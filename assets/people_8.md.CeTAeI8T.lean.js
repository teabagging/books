I'd have preferred to have borrowed rather than purchased it; it isn't something that will have a lasting place on my bookshelf. &quot;Life's a probability&quot; sums up part of it. But, it has value in challenging a modern reader to ask themselves why they see the world and life the way they do; do we really believe what we say. The product, I'd guess, of a deep cynic. About an hour to read - and by the way, if you thought &quot;Who Moved My Cheese&quot; was a great book you want to recommend to friends, you'll hate this."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"Scott Adams is a very talented writer who has a way with words, if you've read the introductions to his Dilbert books you know this. God's Debris is an excellant book, that really makes you think in new and different ways. It is especially good if you can get a few people to read it and then discuss it together. Although he does have a few scientific mistakes about magnetism, everyone(even my eccentric Physics teacher) should enjoy this book"},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"Though I didn't fully agree with the conclusions of the book as original as they were, I think Scott Adams does an incredible job of communicating truely profound abstractions which is nothing less than remarkable considering the subject material presented. Most authors couldn't begin to touch this stuff and have it make any sense. Way to go, Scott."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"Everywhere I go, my friends are talking politics, religion and world events. I can't remember a time when everyone I knew was so informed about world events. And after September 11th, how could we not be?GOD'S DEBRIS is a fascinating read in light of what we're experiencing. Obviously Scott Adams does not have the answers, but he offers a platform for a more philosophical discussion (i.e. what do you BELIEVE, rather than what did you hear on CNN) with friends or a book club.This book will make you THINK, yet it's an easy read. Anyone expecting Dilbert humor should check out WHEN DID IGNORANCE BECOME A POINT OF VIEW. But you will definitely recognize the cleverness of Adams' work in this book."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"It was a good price. Came to me quickly. I've read this before and thoroughly enjoy it. Recommended to everyone."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"This is an intriguing and thought provoking book which mixes philosophy and science fiction that you will enjoy. Once you read it you will be asking more questions about life and god that you may have never entertained before."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"A good thought provolking book, but the concepts are not new. Many of the questions presented are the same philosophical arguments that have gone on in western philosophy for hundreds of years. Very little new information is presented. Some dis-information is presented and that is something one would not expect in a thought provoking work.The final argument, that the universe is no more than God's Debris reassembling themselves and this accounts for gravity et al doesn't strike me as being a sound basis for anything. The explanations as to how this accounts for many of the physical attributes of our world is strained to say the least. The delievery man asking the questions does not ask the type of questions one would expect from a reasonably well informed person. Rather, the questions are the type one would expect from someone without a solid foundation in science and the answers to such questions can easily be misleading because the person doing the questioning is ignorant of basic scientific facts. In fact, the answers are misleading and ignore a lot of scientific findings in physics, chemistry, astronomy et al.So, while some of the throught processes are fun to follow, the book does not achieve the purpose of adding to a geniune philosophical debate over the nature of the universe or the nature of man or God et al. It is a book filled with questions that are more a matter of unstated assumptions and the distorted use of words than the advance of knowledge."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"In the Introduction, Adams admits that lots of what his Avatar says is wrong, and he challenges you to figure out which parts are wrong.I call this a cop-out. It is true that Avatar advances, with great authority and confidence, a number of ideas that are just flat wrong. However, there is no internal evidence that Adams himself recognizes these as errors. Does Adams think that gravity propogates instantly, or that a magnetic field cannot be shielded? There is no hint of irony to indicate that. The book's nameless protagonist is completely clueless. In the dialogs of Socrates (to which other reviewers have compared this book), the people arguing with Socrates make good points, have cogent arguments. In this book, the Avatar has the debate all his own erroneous way.The result is that people who are not well grounded in science find a lot of claims that strike them as &quot;challenging&quot; and &quot;thought-provoking&quot; when in fact the claims are simply wrong, and well-known to be wrong.For the record here are some of Avatar's errors of fact: (p19) magnetic fields can't be blocked; (p19) gravity propogates instantly; (p22) we don't understand how electricity travels; (p61) there is no friction between the Earth and the Moon (the statements about gravity and the Moon are wrong in multiple ways); (p66) the theory of evolution is a &quot;concept with no practical application&quot;.The Avatar advances a dangerous, nihilistic kind of epistemology. In plain language, he seems to dismiss all possible sources of knowledge as equally pointless. He dismisses mathematics as useless (p. 20-21, p56). He dismisses all of science (&quot;all we can do is observe and record patterns,&quot; p.22) as being unable to provide &quot;why&quot; answers. Finally he says that all ideas are equally valid (p38ff) because they are all identically &quot;memory traces&quot; in our brains. This may be what others have called &quot;New-Agey&quot; but in fact it is nihilism and defeatism.As to the philosophy, it is basically self-contradictory. If you take the time to read the book, read it carefully and then actually think about the Avatar's basic claims: (a) God blew itself up in order to learn the one thing omniscience could not know, namely, what happens if God isn't there; but (b) God imbued his debris with a &quot;probability&quot; so strong that even if the universe were rewound and played back, exactly the same events would happen over again (p.51-2). These ideas are fundamentally contradictory, hence the whole exercise is pointless.The Avatar does pose a number of philosophical riddles that have been standard fodder for student bull-sessions for generations. Example: if God is omniscient (Adams incorrectly writes &quot;omnipotent&quot;), the future must be determined, hence how can we, or God, have free will? But the questions are only posed, never explored in any satisfying way. Go looking for better books in elementary philosophy."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"Non-fiction thinly veiled as a fictional account.The author goes out of his way, maybe even trying too hard, to say that the story isnt what he believes.This could be true, it might be just to keep folks off his back - doesnt matter to me.This was interesting, if pretty far fetched and based on some pretty bad reasoning and sometimes outright lunacy.Makes for a quick read too."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"This book is the best book I have read in a while. Its not for everyone. I think you have to be curious about life and open to differant veiws of creation. To explain this book, is imposible, its the friend you don't understand, you see whats in front of you, he see's whats inside. The book is a way to test your mind to see whats inside not what you see. Read this book not to understand sceince, or GOD, but to find you, the awnser is within you"},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"Just a few words. It is a very good book, and finding some of the logical flaws will be my quest in reading it a second time.Perhaps the originality of this book is simply the manner in which Adams presents it. Sometimes old stuff newly framed is all it takes to lead to an epiphany.This book is epiphanious."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"I wanted to like this, I really did. I enjoy Dilbert, and I enjoy &quot;thought experiments&quot; that force me to think differently. However, as one of those said experiments, this book is a dismal failure. Its basic tenets are so ridiculous that it ceases to cultivate critical thought as it unravels them, and instead becomes an exercise in semantics and outright silliness.Probability, which is nothing more than a mathematical tool of sorts, necessitated by our own limits of perception, is in fact supposedly one of two main components of the universe. We're all the other component, and we're basically all pieces of a God who blew himself up because he was bored. Gravity supposedly also doesn't exist as a force and things don't &quot;move&quot;, merely appear and disappear from one spot to another...so it is merely that the &quot;probability&quot; of you appearing successively closer to the Earth after jumping off a mountain is higher than &quot;appearing&quot; on Jupiter or something. And things don't &quot;collide&quot;, they merely change their probability, so billiard players are not really careening balls off one another, merely altering their &quot;probability&quot; to appear closer (and eventually into) the table pockets. When you're running, you simply increase the probability that you'll appear further in that direction, instead of somewhere in Zimbabwe, and when you're sitting down reading this book, you merely are increasing the probability that you will keep appearing in your seat getting increasingly disappointed and bored instead of suddenly finding yourself appearing as some octopus in the Atlantic.Now if this kind of goofy, incredibly contrived &quot;wisdom&quot; is your idea of deep thinking, then knock yourself out...this book'll be a smorgasbord. Otherwise, decrease the probability that you'll buy/read it, and your probability of satisfaction (not to mention saved money and time) will increase drastically."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"This is a very creative and thought-provoking read, quite obviously a self-view from Mr. Adams in a narcissistic dissertation of his self-perceived brilliant ideas and how he hopes to be thought of in his later days. This is probably an anthology of all of his cocktail party \\"look I'm smart\\" conversation material. It's pretty obvious in part because of how unabashedly shaped the delivery guy's questions were and how they wouldn't be a part of any reasonable person's cohesive line of thinking. I found the first part, obviously what Mr. Adams found to be his most profound idea, to be very intriguing. However, it strongly resembles Enlightenment Age-like component theory; as in we are all just smaller component parts of a larger organism. In reference to some of the other reviews that said that in order to properly evaluate the book's credibility you should assemble a team of experts from the fields of physics, chemistry, philosophy, religion, etc., that is completely wrong. Any reasonable, college-educated person can see right through this book's thinly-veiled assumptions.Bottom line: Will only seem profound and convincing to someone who is not a reasonable thinker and only has a middle school education."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"I obtained my copy of this book via a free download offered by the author. Perhaps if I had paid for it my rating would be lower. Much of what the \\"old man\\" has to say is either silly or overwhelming common sense, yet there are a few nuggets here and there. I shared the section containing his thoughts on male/female differences and basic social interactions with my teenager. I shall be interested to read the sequel (The Religion War) whenever he gets around to giving it away as well."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"Deep and Captivating. I was very impressed by this book. 5 stars to Scott Adams. This &quot;experiment&quot; was a true success. I have passed this book on to many friends. Great conversation material. Once again: Outstanding book!"},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"...that so many people think this book is \\"excellent\\" and \\"thought-provoking\\". Anyone with a shred of common sense can see that this is nothing more than an exercise in vanity. Why do so many celebrities think that just because they're famous, they suddenly have something worth saying or have gained an insight that the rest of us mortals have failed to see? Perhaps if people were better informed or better read they'd see this book for what it is: crap."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"Most people have a fixed sense of the reality around them. The common interpretation given by the scientific community, combined, more often than not, with a clear set of spiritual views, is often enough to satisfy our longing to understand the &quot;Why?&quot; of our universe.But are there alternatives?In &quot;God's Debris&quot;, Scott Adams has delivered a rich dialogue, which contemplates, debates, and even defies many of these traditional perceptions. Alternate realities are provided in multifaceted chapters, converging, as you read, to provide one great concept. It is much like reading about the &quot;Big Bang&quot; in reverse.I recommend this book to anyone who wishes to be left enlightened, perhaps not as a Buddhist monk, but more as an intellectual who has recently shod the burden of a close-minded view of everyday life. This is not a book of humor, but much like the irrepressible comic Scott Adams is known for, it should leave you feeling good."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"In God's Debris, Scott Adams has created an intriguing journey for the mind. This book should be read the first time with an open mind and no distractions. You don't have to agree with everything to appreciate the story. This absorbing and thought-provoking book will undoubtedly become a classic. I thoroughly enjoyed this stimulating book and highly recommend it to all fans of metaphysical literature."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"Many of the reviewers of this book, including me, consider it to be one of the best books they've ever read. Others hate it, claiming either it's \\"nothing new\\" or that the logic makes no sense. Since the point of the book, clearly stated in the introduction, is to get people debating the arguments in the book, obviously it worked, because I'm going to do some debating right now.I'd love to sit in a room with any of the people who thought there was nothing new in the book and find out if they're hallucinating or if they have bad reading comprehension. Many of the building-block ideas in the book are familiar, granted, but where they lead is an idea so unique and powerful that it will blow you away. Or, as some of the critics here have demonstrated, you simply won't get it.As for the book being illogical or unscientific, it appears that some of the critics here didn't understand it or didn't read it carefully. For example, Greg Mancini snidely says, \\"I guess Scott has never heard of a cluster galaxy.\\" But in fact, the book uses cluster galaxies as its main analogy. What book was Mancini reading? Several of the other negative reviews are similar in demonstrating that the reviewer wasn't very familiar with the book. Given the controversial nature of the book - it redefines the notion of God -- I can only speculate about the motives of the critics.And the science? Some of it might be \\"baloney\\" as Adams states in the introduction, but the remarkable thing is that it's essentially the same theory put forward by physicist and genius Stephen Wolfram in his book called A New Kind of Science, recently #1 on Amazon.com. And Adams published God's Debris a year earlier. So if you think the science is ridiculous, you might want to go argue with the guy who is being compared to Einstein and Newton (Wolfram that is) because he has the same ideas."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"First of all, it is very important to understand that this is not a scientific text for the way of things. I believe Adams goal in writing it was to merely make a person think. While I agree that nothing really new or original was involved it does have its moments that elicit a mild amount of wonderment. Some of the reviews have seemed to be very angry and centered around the fact that it isn't accurate. That's the point. It wasn't meant to be, it's meant for you to untangle why it isn't. I actually don't think that it is possible to do so. This doesn't, however, mean that it is an accurate portrayal of reality, it is a very speculative one. It takes the areas where we have questions and attempts to fill in the blanks, but as with all areas that attempt to fill in the blanks, it can't do so in a way that is disprovable. This may not sit well with those who only like concepts that can be experimented with, but ultimately any book that attempts to go outside the realm of what we know will lead to this frustration. Therefore, you may think the whole genre is bad, but this book is as good as any others. It could have been more detailed though, I felt it didn't hit on a lot of depth but just threw out a few concepts that can be mulled over. It didn't quite get me thinking as much as I had hoped, but it does give us pause to ask the ultimate question (in my mind) as to how much of reality we can ultimately know. It seems that if we can't answer that question all others become moot. Not a brilliant book, but not a bad one either."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"This is definitely the book I would recommend to anyone who is interested in independent thinking. I realize the book was not designed to enlighten, nor force you to look differently at the world. It may not even be an entertaining story about a delivery man who discovers a wise old man. On the contrary, the wise old man probably discovered him, and that's how he got the package in the first place. Or, maybe it's like the old man says and the package delivered the man. That's what I love about this book -- everything can be questioned, including the questions themselves.Short, smart, and does nothing but make you think while entertaining you with a good story.I like it."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"This books should be read by everyone with more than a peanut for a brain.

The story is not in the one two punch style of Dilbert humor, but Scott Adams' ironic humor is there mixed with the philosophy. A great read that definitely leaves you thinking!"},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"A great book for anyone who enjoyed A Brief History of Time, Dancing Wu Li Masters, and Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, in spite of not understanding much of any of them. An even better book for those who talk about those books without having read them.A book that makes people think is rare, and a book that gets them to try to think together is a gem. The magical way everyone identifies with Adams's cartoons works in this book to make everyone want to participate in the experiment. This book is like a great meal - one hundred times better if shared with your friends."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"I'd say I'm right in the middle for this one. Theories are always fun to make up and to toy with mentally. I honestly believe that this book could have been much better. The first word that comes to mind is \\"hollow\\". It seemed as soon as the writer touched a point that woke up my brain on a topic, the chapter was already over. I swear every great statement that interested me was the last few sentences of every chapter and the fact that it didn't go into depth kind of ruined those interesting moments.Don't get me wrong, I think the writer has a lot of potential. I could grab soem nice quotes from the book. I could also look at the positive side and expolore what he didn't in my own mind and have fun with the base theory he came up with. I've read much worse, I've read much better.I think a better book to rack your brain on is the Conversations with God series. It made me think much more and was longer than a two hour read."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"God's Debris is by far the most thought-provoking and interesting book I have ever read. I would recommend it to anyone with an open mind. As advertised, it does make your brain spin around inside your head, at least metaphorically. All the major points have been covered multiple times by other reviews, so I won't restate them here. However, the person who complained about the science being completely wrong OBVIOUSLY failed to read the introduction. Adams explains that a good part of the science is made up. Besides, as with all great books, you either love it or you hate it. There's really no middle ground. Please, do yourself a favor. Buy this book. It's great."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"This book was absolutely wonderful- perhaps one of the best I've ever read. I read it in 1.5 hours and was up another hour just thinking about the ideas presented by the older, wiser character. I have already loaned the book to my roommate and have someone else in line for it. If you have an hour or so, and you are not afraid to think outside your current belief system for a little bit, this is an awesome book!"},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"After buying and reading this book with high expectations based on the reviews here and those that I read, I am shocked that Scott Adams would even think to say that the 'philosophy' in this book would make anyone's head spin around. It's just a silly book. It wasn't challenging, there were no really new ideas expressed in it. It was a thorough, resounding disappointment. Scott Adams really should stick to what he's good at - Dilbert. Additionally - I was absolutely nonplussed at the audacity of the reviews that were put on the jacket cover. They weren't attributed to anyone, and after having read the book, I'm convinced he wrote them himself or his mom and dad and wife wrote them."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"Aargh! Why does this book have me so wound up?!Because so many people think it has worthwhile content. Adams has duped you. Bravo to him.It seems Adams has dredged up a few pub conversations, got drunk, and made loads of money out of the result.It's this simple: Read some real science. Then read some real philosophy. Then reread God's Debris. Is it astounding you now, or are you just annoyed that you wasted so much time thinking about it before? Not new, not insightful, not interesting, and just plain wrong."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"As a theologian and philosopher, Scott Adams is a great cartoonist! Why isn't that enough?"},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"As a proud DNRC member I must say that it was more than worth the pittance I paid. Now I truly know why I appreciate Dilbert so much. I'm no Doctor of Philosophy but I've always enjoyed epistemology. This masterpiece definitely delivers in that area. Thank you Mr. Adams for giving me permission to remain an agnostic.As far as theories go all theories have presuppositions so nothing is certain. Those who claim to know are pretty arrogant. But how does one evaluate a theory then if by definition it can't be proven? The answer is simple, a theory is good if it provides a useful perspective. This theory definitely provides a useful perspective. Useful by whose definition? Mine of course.What's my point? Well it's that this book is a good read. It prompts one to think, it's a nice way to spend a couple hours, and it also provides some good laughs even though the subject matter is pretty heavy.

He's a physicist who has a theory that the wholeuniverse - including everything from evolution to physics to freewill - can be understood as a simple program with maybe two orthree simple rules. He shows lots of examples of how simpleprograms can, given enough time, create all of the sorts ofpatterns and complexity found in nature. For his work, Wolfram isroutinely compared to Einstein and Newton.Or you can read the same theory, published a year earlier, in myfiction book, \\"God's Debris.\\" (See page 55 in the hardcover.Really.) For my work, I am routinely compared to Bozo the Clown,Charles Manson, and steaming piles of offal.I assume Wolfram gets more respect than I do because he's apolymath genius whereas my only other theory is, \\"You are what you eat, so don't eat a falafel because then you'll feel-awful.\\" That's the sort of theory that can come back and haunt you.God's Debris:http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0740721909/dilbertcom-20A New Kind of Science:http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1579550088/dilbertcom-20**************************************************************So as some people suggested in these reviews! please read the notes at the start and then the book again.Already now thanks to the decsriptions given in the reviews hereI realize more and more that those who reviewed (and failed to realize it) that the young boy/man. is US. and that old man is.Well. knowledge/science as most of us know it currently.And also as we speculate it can be.See.

All of these are true, but also misleading; if you think any one thing about the book, I think you're mistaken. I'm a fundamentalist Christian who read it (or an early version) years ago. I recognize the blasphemous nature of the title suggestion, but I recall noting that it was on the order of \\"A Modest Proposal.\\" If Adams really does have a certain answer he is proposing in disguise, then I've overthought the book and I'm disappointed in it. The impression I got was that the point wasn't to lead people to a new perception of reality, so much as to challenge everyone and leave us all a bit unsettled. For me, it seems that the world is unavoidably, deeply paradoxical. Some have pointed out that there tend to be two extreme reactions to the book, one from secular sceptics and the other from rigid religious folk. I think on both ends there are people who want to have the universe to be a nice, safe, ordinary box, with certain allowable gaps in our knowledge or miracles in the past. Could God create a boulder so heavy he couldn't lift it? Yes, and then He lifted it anyway. For me, God did experience death, through Christ at Golgotha. How could the Eternal, Immortal God die, even when manifest in the flesh? How could He die and still be alive? How can God be Father, Son, and Holy Spirit and yet One God? We can't understand these things, but we can't even fully understand the world around us, which seemed so simple, ordinary, and explainable in the late 1800s. Then we began to learn how strange the subatomic world was, the depths of the wave-particle duality of light, the mysteries of the quantum physics realm... atheist or true believer, if you think humans have, or can eventually come up with, all the answers, you need to think again, and this book might help you do that. I give it a middling rating, because I think it is designed not to be a great book, but a book to inspire great thoughts through its own flaws."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"Don't read this book like it will show you the true meaning of life. The fact is, if you follow the church in someway, this is bound to heat your head a little bit.

People are excellent at rationalizing their understanding of the world through various channels. This book helps bring into question the reliability of those channels.This book does not construct sound logic and even includes false information. This is done so deliberately and demonstrates how such a faulty foundation of concepts can be alarmingly convincing.

Probably it is because one expects Scott's books to be funny that God's Debris sort of falls sideways away from expectations and it ends up being just what it promises to be - an experiment. Mind you, it is not a failed experiment because the book manages to hold the reader with a plot that is extremely simple and exceedingly magnetic. It is a book that one should spend time pondering over, but one gets tempted to hurry through and finish it in one reading.All in all, a good coffee table book but not a serious read."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"***from national review***The intro functions almost as a warning label: The ideas expressed herein are \\"inappropriate for young minds\\"; Old people should likewise bow out; Those likely to be offended are invited to take a pass.In God's Debris, Adams animates the well-worn genre of the Socratic dialogue with his musings on weighty issues: God, religion, community, free will, morality, the mind. The upshot is, among other things, a modern Gnostic fantasy and a skeptical argument for belief. The two players are an anonymous UPS driver stand-in for Adams and a mysterious ancient \\"man\\" named Avatar who \\"knows literally everything\\" and who, by explanation, upends most of the deliveryman's assumptions."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"I enjoyed this book and the fact that it made me think hard about established beliefs. My concern when I first read it was that it would offend many religious individuals. I think that no one should take this as an absolute, but simply to open their minds to the possibilities, realizing that nothing is ever completely how it seems nor might many long-held beliefs 100% accurate.This is thought provoking, insightful, and just plain fun to read. The debates that go on in this text are priceless."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"Even if you think you have examined meta-physical/mystical/neo-spritiual concepts in depth in your life, you owe it to yourself to check this one out. Scott Adams is a brilliant writer and this one will keep you glued; I couldn't put it down 'till I was done (then started over again!). Expect to be amazed, expect to be intrigued, then expect not to expect anything anymore. Perfect for those (20-27 yr olds, OUR generation) kinda strugling with their beliefs, this won't necessarily change them but it'll help you in ways you might not be able to understand yet. Enough reading reviews by strangers, GET THE BOOK!"},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"I love this book. It's so full of thoughts and ideas that sound logical, yet many of them are entirely new and different. It's a quick read, just finished it in about two hours or so, and this is my second time reading it. What I really love about it is how it makes your brain feel alive.A young delivery man attempts to deliver a package to an old man. However, the old man seems to ignore the attempts at delivery, and instead he asks the young man a variety of questions, beginning with a question regarding a simple coin toss. He continues to probe and prod at the young man's answers to physical phenomenon, God, free will, probability, and numerous other concepts. While this book may not radically change your life, it will encourage you to think a little bit more about what you really do know, and what you don't.I particularly find this book interesting due to the physics contained within its pages. It discusses string theory and Einstein and a bit of quantum mechanics (ironically the subject of another book I'm currently reading, The Elegant Universe by Brian Greene), and it treats them in a different manner. While I'm not quite sure if the discussions of them are entirely accurate, it's interesting to see where this book compares with what I think I know. :)While I encourage people to read this book, it is not for anyone who isn't willing to read views that may be radically different from his or her own. From the introduction:\\"The story contains no violence, no sexual content, and no offensive language. But the ideas expressed by the characters are inappropriate for young minds. People under the age of fourteen should not read it.\\"The target audience for God's Debris is people who enjoy having their brains spun around inside their skulls. After a certain age most people are uncomfortable with new ideas. That certain age varies by person, but if you're over fifty-five (mentally) you probably won't enjoy this thought experiment. If you're eighty going on thirty-five, you might like it. If you're twenty-three, your odds of liking it are very good.\\"The story's central character has a view about God that you've probably never heard before. If you think you would be offended by a fictional character's untraditional view of God, please don't read this.\\""},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"It is hard to believe that this book is from the same author as all of the Dilbert books, but it is. Adams lays out in 132 pages a completely new philosophy of life, love, religion and values to live by. I found the book to be interesting and thought provoking. I read it in one sitting. I suggest that you read it, also."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"Before reading I had personally stepped onto some the points in this book by my own thinking. The excellent explanation of the Universe, why we exist, and the point of our lives are all wonderfully tied together into an understandable thought process. No sooner was I finished it when I told a friend about it and she immediately wanted to borrow it. I recommend this to anyone who enjoy's exploring problems and presenting theories."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"This little book contains a lot of thought-provoking material. Scott Adams approaches some profound thoughts from a practical perspective. Read this book chapter by chapter so you can spend some time thinking about the questions that are presented.This book is a permanent part of my library, designed to be read again and again."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"First off, this is NOT a Dilbert book. It is not a humor book, it has almost no humor whatsoever. It is a &quot;thought experiment wrapped in a novel,&quot; according to the man himself. It provides the reader with the platform for a discussion with an intelligent friend over a really good drink. It is a short, extremely interesting book, and I recommend it to anyone who is looking to have their brain &quot;spun around in their skulls.&quot;"},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"This is a fantastic book to read if you are still unsettled with the tragic events of September 11.After reading this book, by surprising philosophical Scott Adams..(who you may also know as the creator of Dilbert (?)..I walked away almost a new person. This is a great gift!!!"},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"This is one of the first books in a long time which held me so captivated that I literally could not put it down. It was mentally stimulating yet so comforatble and familiar as to place the reader inside the dialogue. Scott Adams advises that you should &quot;share your copy with a smart friend and then discuss it over a tasty beverage&quot;, and I have to agree as this book poses the type of questions that can keep you up all night and delivers answers in kind. While I do enjoy Dilbert alot, I really hope Scott Adams takes the time and what must be a considerable effort to write another &quot;thought experiment&quot;."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"I bought this an an e-book thinking what the heck.I was suprised at the level of thought put into each chapter. The writing is clear, concise and simple enough for even a sales person to understand which is not something that you would expect from an engineerDoes it explain away all religous thought and dogma, no. Like the preface says I dont think it was supposed to. But it did leave me thinking about my place in all of this debris, to coin a phrase.Now that it is in print I hope that more people will read it and and enjoy it like I did.There are only a few books that I reread and this is one that I will reread and talk to others about."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"This is, by far, the most genius book I've ever read. It may never go down as a literary classic, but anything...book, movie, tv, radio, art...anything that can get you to think so much within such a short amount of time is a marvel in itself. I've read it several times and each time I find something different that strikes me. It's also refreshing that the author, Scott Adams (who will discuss the book with you if you email him, as I did) is not trying to push a set of beliefs on you, but rather to get you to challenge your own. He gets at the (scary) root of WHY we believe with what amounts to about 100 pages of a 2 person dialogue.Although the subject of God is addressed, it is not a religious book, nor a critique of religion. It is an eye opening critique of how we think.I always keep extra copies around and give it as my standard gift. I've not met a person yet who hasn't loved this wonderful little book."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"Someone once said that philosophy is the art of thinking about thinking. Being philosophers means, first and foremost, holding our own thoughts, beliefs, and values -- in fact, our entire thinking process -- up to careful scrutiny. What do we really believe? Why do we believe those things? Are our beliefs justified? Are we thinking rationally or irrationally? Are the values that guide our actions sound or unsound? These are the sort of questions that philosophers ask.Scott Adams will probably not go down in history as one of the world's greatest philosophers; but his book \\"God's Debris\\" clearly does what all great philosophy must do: It forces its readers to THINK about their beliefs, values, and way of thinking. Writing in dialogue form (much like Plato did), Adams presents us with an interesting thought experiment. One of the interlocutors argues for a new way of looking at reality that turns our conventional notions about religion, science, perception, behavior, and human relationships on their head. You certainly won't agree with every idea expressed in this book -- nor were you meant to. Some of the arguments are based on misinformation. Some are based on faulty logic. Adams has said that the purpose of this book was not to assert his own views about reality; but to encourage his readers to think seriously about their own views, and why they believe what they believe. If that was his purpose, then I would call this book a resounding success. It's an easy, quick, fun read; and it really stimulates your thinking. The book is not for everyone -- if you don't like to think about philosophical issues, or to have your most cherished beliefs challenged, then this book is not for you. But, if you like to THINK, get this book."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"This was the most amazing book I have ever read, a fascinating exploration of a sort of neo-existential phenomenological view of God. The economics and probability of god-dust and its evolution back into one collective consciousness is the most fascinating story I have ever read. After reading this book, you will never look at the internet or religion the same way again. I started off reading the introduction in which Adams challenges the reader to decipher the ideas that he made up against those that are actually true, and after reading the book you may find that quite a challenge."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"So many of the reviews on this book focus on Mr. Adams philisophical arguments prestned in the book. If you read the introduction carefully, you will see that he does not intend to present his personal views in this book. His intent is to open the reader's mind to points of view that are outside of the established norm and to realize that both science and philosiphy are based on assumptions that humans make about the world that may or may not be right. In effect, he is trying to create a starting point for discussion that keeps these assumptions in mind.In my view, he has done this very well. He even says at the beginning of the book that some of what the old man says is bull. What is important is not the views presented, but the reader's willingness to entertain and analyze those views. Notice that the book is subtitled \\"A Thought Experiment\\", not \\"A Doctorine of Philosophy\\".This is a great book to read, share with a few friends, and then sit down for a few hours and discuss the meaning of, to borrow a phrase from a slightly more famous book; life, the universe, and everything."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"Don't waste your money. Don't waste your time.I couldn't get pass the page where Mr. Avatar says &quot;probability&quot; is a major force driving the universe. As any mathematician can tell you there is no such thing as probability. Probability Theory is merely a tool to help our limited understanding of complex phenomena.If there is something of value within these pages it is probably the urge to ask Big Questions; something you can get almost everywhere else. Reading Asimov's fiction or any philosophy book would be better."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"I just read the book as a choice in a book discussion group. we have not discussed the book yet.Its the first book of this type Ive read in a long time. I'm still trying to figure out what Scott Adams is trying to do by asking readers to find the flaws in the books's all knowing character Avatar's ideas. It seems to be a bit of a setup, watchout!."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"I like the concept that the author is trying to get the reader to think outside of our norms, but the scientific information that he attempts to incorporate into the novel are grossly off-base. Since the author regularly skews scientific concepts to make his it makes the book seem ignorant at times. I am in my third year of medical school and graduated undergrad with honors with a hard science degree, so I have a pretty firm science background, and I know many points in the book are inaccurate. The author does state in the introduction that part of the book may be \\"bull,\\" however, so the reader should keep this in mind and enjoy the book for what it is."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"This book really surprised me. I like Scott Adams, and always assumed he was intelligent, but for him to release this childish nonsense as something which will make your brain spin... I'm going to have to revise my opinion of him.Everything in this book is obvious, dumb philosophy. It's the kind of stuff you'll find amazing if you've never read a book in your life, or dare I say it, if you have a double digit IQ.I'm quite saddened so many people rated this book highly. I guess it just shows how poor the US education system is.Total waste of time, and totally devoid of any intelligent thought."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"This is perhaps the dumbest book ever written. I love Dilbert. Please Adam, stick to cartoons. Your attempts at philosophy are embarassing. In fundamentalist US attacks on evolution are all the rage - given that all attacks on evoltuion have to date stemmed from extreme ignorance, yours is still the worst I have ever read."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"I would better choose some Dr.M.Laitman kabbalah book. This one holds a few things of his books... well, let say taken of kabbalah, well again ... the ideas that are described in there, not of M.Laitman himself. But anyway - two stars for starting to think :) What about you?"},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"The only thing I can really say is that this book is absolute garbage. It's borderline plagarism (here, let me steal the writing style from Plato and move on), except that none of the ideas presented in this book make any sense when compared to the Republic. In fact, the ideas in this book could not hold up to the intense scrutiny of an Eighth Grade Science class. If you think this book gives you any insight on philosophy, you're sadly mistaken. And I thought it couldn't get worse than the Dilbert cartoons, but this is worse. Much worse."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"I'm a huge fan of Dilbert and Scott Adams, but this book is a piece of crap. Scott Adams is trying to be slightly philosophical but he is also being lazy, and after reading this really short book you dont really feel like it made you think. If you want real thinking books, I would recommend Sartre, Nietzsche or almost any other philosopher. You could even just stick with the Dilbert books, since those are brilliant and are what Scott Adams does best."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"Scott Adams' \\"philosophy\\" (if you can even call it that), as presented in this book is only believable if you read it really fast and ignore all the glaring errors. If you mix bad logic and even worse science you get God's Debris. Better philosophy is presented in the last few chapters of The Dilbert Future (latter editions). Most of God's Debris is lifted right from The Dilbert Future and watered down with copious amounts of arrogance and stupidity. In the introduction Mr. Adams says the beliefs presented in this book are not his own though one look at his blog reveals just the opposite. He's been selling this load of bull feathers so long he's starting to believe it himself. In fact, I've challenged him three separate times on his blog and once in a personal email to refute the argument I gave for the validity of UFOs and he simply ignored me every time. I'll just assume he's busy, what with having to draw all of three panels a day. Anyone who takes an introductory philosophy class (or even reads an introductory philosophy book) can tear apart the \\"arguments\\" of the so called world's smartest man character. The best refutation of the \\"science\\" presented in this book was already given by reviewer David Cortesi (19 July 2003). I am greatly in your debt, sir.As someone who has been pondering the mysteries of this and other worlds for the past seven years I can say that none of the Avatar's arguments hold up to any degree of scrutiny and his challenger, the delivery boy, accepts his faulty arguments on the grounds that he's too stupid to think up any counter arguments, no matter how asinine. I've debated people many times before and have heard some very stupid counter arguments, and have made some very stupid ones as well, but the delivery boy doesn't even bother. Not someone I would be looking to become my successor, but I guess some people like it when others accept what they say on blind faith.The really sad part is Mr. Adams' followers accept God's Debris as their new Bible. The 400,000 plus members of Dogbert's New Ruling Class, as evident from the posts on the Dilbert blog, don't even bother to scrutinize the validity of any point of view opposing the Nihilistic Materialistic Monism (NIMM) presented in God's Debris. This is the reason I left DNRC.Update: The fact that people overwhelmingly negatively rate this review show the extent to which Pope Adams has control over the gullible. I have never received personal correspondence, or seen any later reviews of this book, actually refute any of the points I brought up. I wonder why. Actually, I don't wonder why. The truth is the points are true and Pope Adams' supporters know this, so they wage guerrilla warfare by bashing this review instead of providing reasons why the logic used is incorrect. You would think people who view this as a philosophy book would use philosophy to argue against the points I raised."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"Adams uses typical arguments meant to disarm traditional theists. Too bad the arguments are weak and tired. By the way, the only person who can say that all the roads lead up to the top of the mtn is the person who sees and knows all roads. I don't know anyone truly that arrogant who believes he knows all religious systems, especially since there have been thousands of them! Beyond the thought experiment there is little to commend here. It might be best if Mr. Adams were to stick to his comics."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"I read God's Debris last week, and it's a winner. I was looking over a few of the other reviews, and a number of people have pointed to Adams' incorrectly stated facts as reasons why they did not like the book. Well, congratulations ladies and gentlemen, you've just illustrated the point. Adams said, &quot;The central character states a number of scientific 'facts.' Some of his weirdest statements are consistent with what scientists generally believe. Some of what he says is creative baloney designed to sound true. See if you can tell the difference.&quot; This wasn't an obscure, hidden objective - the quote is taken out of the introduction. That stated, I highly recommend this book. It's a great catalyst for conversation, and it brings some ideas to light which, whether they are factual or fictional, give you a new point of view from which to view the world."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"This is a book that will really make you think. The whole point of the book is to try to find where the argument that is presented in the book is wrong. Not an easy thing to do - as long as you work within the framework presented (some of the facts that are offered to support the argument are obviously wrong, but must be accepted as basic postulates - you don't have to agree with them, but whether they are right or wrong doesn't really impinge upon the thought expieriment presented). It's a form of writing that hasn't been done much recently (Think something closer to \\"Plato's Republic\\").One thing that should be mentioned - This is NOT a Dilbert book. It contains no humor and no cartoons. If that is what you are looking for, then pass this book.In short, if you are looking for something that will make you think try this."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"This book will definitely set your brain in motion. Even though it's relatively short (I finished it in about three hours, and I'm a slow reader), there's plenty in it to think about. Adams raises some good points, and then some not-so-good points, but just about everything he says makes sense on some level and forces you to look at the way you think. The story through which the whole God's Debris theory is told makes it a bit more enjoyable. Adams' writing style is likewise engaging. One recommendation, though: get the electronic form if at all possible. It's not worth the extra money for the hardcover version considering the length (or lack thereof) of the book."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"Mr. Adams warns you before reading the book God's Debris of its uncharacteristic nature in respect to his other offerings. Boy oh Boy is that ever true! I opened the book, thought I'd take a peek and then read the rest over the weekend. Instead I spent the next several hours into the wee hours of the morning hungrily reading every word!Are you stuck in a rut? Tired of the same old novels? Thirsting for something to stimulate your mind? Do you like to challenge conventional thinking or perhaps defend it? Enjoy brainteasers and the teasing of others brains? Do you really believe the things you believe? Then this book is certainly for you.Other reviews give you a peek at how the book is structured and it's content so I won't bore you with the same. I can tell you that if you allow it, if you welcome it, this book will turn all of your previous thoughts about life and it's meaning on it's head! No, it's not a \\"cult\\" message or urging you to convert to any \\"new\\" realm of thought. Although at certain points I did amusingly ponder the emergence of a new \\"S. Adams cult\\" ! I loved reading the chapters then sitting back with a cool drink to ponder and absorb its message. I also enjoyed challenging friends and family with several ideas from the book.Bravo Mr. Adams, bravo!"},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"Yes, there are factual errors, lots of them, they're supposedly deliberate, and that's supposed to be the \\"fun\\" of this book. Sadly, it's not fun, it's just tedious.The prose is stilted, the \\"mind-spinning\\" ideas are just poorly-constructed rehashes and mishmashes of convenient bits of postmodernism, gnosticism and a few theological philosophies, and the narrative framework is pure high-school creative writing. And really, anyone who's going to start writing about \\"new\\" ideas about philosophy and religion would be well-served to read and understand what's already been said, what's already been refuted, and how various religions deal with their own internal paradoxes, so the \\"theories\\" in this book can be at least a bit better-constructed even when they're supposed to be wrong.The argument that \\"it's a thought experiment, and parts of it are wrong\\" is, as another reviewer has said, just an intellectual cop-out. The book starts out with a bunch of errors and throws more around like confetti, and if that's the point of the book, then it's pretty lame. Figuring out what's wrong with the arguments is just grading someone's homework, not a thought experiment. It's worse still, considering nearly every argument in the book is either a misunderstood paraphrase of preexisting philosophy, or is argued from incorrect first principles. Where's the fun in reading along and ticking off \\"yep, that's wrong, that's wrong, and that's wrong, that'd be right if he'd applied it to something other than quantum physics, that's wrong...\\" ? It's a big snooze, not a deep philosophical insight.Scott Adams isn't a dumb guy and is usually a better writer, this much we know. As far as I can make out, though, he must've been totally baked when he wrote this. The only other explanation would be that he's profoundly arrogant about his own intelligence.Seriously, if you want a better-informed discussion of reality and philosophy, rent The Matrix. Not that the discussion is really deeper or more insightful, but the special effects are a lot better and it's a more entertaining way to kill a few hours."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"Scott Adams rambles all over the philosophical world in God's Debris, his first non-Dilbert book, which attempts to slaughter most of the world's sacred cows. This book of philosophy surprised his fans when published in 2001; after all, most times a celebrity in one field takes on another, we end up with something like Eddie Murphy's music video.His sections on religion and science are best, perhaps because those are more objective subjects. The sections on relationships and the practical applications of the stated philosophy are weaker, and come off as a cheesy self-help book.The first-person prose is not great, coming off as a mix between a film noir detective thriller and the narration of The Wonder Years. It performs its function, however, of distancing the ideas from statements of truth. Adams writes in the forward: \\"I call it a 132-page thought experiment wrapped in a fictional story...You won't discover my opinions by reading my fiction.\\"Another drawback of the prose, however, is the way it forces him to explain each step of the reasoning. He has to build his arguments like houses of cards, where any one flaw seems to take down the entire structure. The way he does so shows a lot of ego from the Avatar's perspective. The overall concepts once he finishes explaining them are strong, but the hubris makes me skeptical of the execution.The real value of reading God's Debris is in the discussions that inevitably come out of it. The book is an excellent provocateur, and I agree with him that it's best to \\"share God's Debris with a smart friend and then discuss it while enjoying a tasty beverage.\\" It's best to not take these ideas for absolute truth, but reading it with friends will certainly help you find out what you really believe yourself."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"&quot;God's Debris&quot; is set up much the same way as the Diologues of Plato. Except it has a modern setting and even more modern ideas. In both, we have the &quot;teacher&quot; leading the &quot;student&quot; in a question/ answer forum. The &quot;student&quot; is lead to a new point of view through the logic of the &quot;teacher&quot;'s explainations, and through questioning his own beliefs and assumptions. That is how the book, in my opinion, should be viewed. Just as today, we dont agree with everything the Greeks belived in, but we admire thier skill in logic. As long as the reader has that mind set about this book, they will enjoy the untraditional view of God and the fresh perspective on probability that Scott Adams presents. And dont let my referrence to Plato freak you out, the book is easy to follow. I'm only 18 and I got it. at least I think I got it. And thats the beauty of it. It's a piece that's meant to be shared with others to see what they've gotten out of it. I hope this review does the book justice. I didnt want to give away too much of the content, because it's one of those things that you have to see for yourself."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"\\"The target audience for God's Debris is,\\" according to Scott Adams' own introduction, \\"people who enjoy having their brains spun around inside their skulls.\\" I think it was exactly what I liked about the book.On the one hand the book presents some very unusual theories about God, life and the universe. And indeed, some of these leave you with the question: why not? On the other hand, as one should expect when reading a book by Adams, regardless of his opening statement that the book \\"contains no humor\\", this book is of course one big tongue-in-cheek.Those who complain that the theories and philosophies in this book do not make sense just did not get it. They probably missed Adams' disclaimer that is as smart and funny as only he can write it. He asks the reader to try to figure out which statements in the book are consistent with our current scientific insights and which are just \\"creative baloney designed to sound true\\".Of course Adams is not a top philosopher, but he is a master in writing things down in such a way that you know he is fooling you and you just do not know how to debunk his claims. In the introduction of the sequel to this book (The Religion War), Adams confesses about God's Debris that he \\"used a variety of hypnosis techniques in an attempt to produce a feeling of euphoric enlightenment in the reader\\".So if you do not mind about that, go ahead and read the book. And for those who think they will not appreciate Adams' humor, he outsmarted you already: \\"keep in mind that I hate you too, and I said it first.\\"[If this review was helpful to you, you might also want to read my review for The Religion War.]"},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"I have read over half this book now and must say it's very good. I am upset about some of the negative reviews. It seems to me they open the book to a random page read that page and wrote their review. One person complained about how probability was perceived. If this person would have read on, the book was saying the same thing he was. A lot of people are saying this book in nonsense that should not be followed. Scott Adams says in the preface that this is only to give your mind something to think about and not to be taken seriously. Too many people are thinking Adams was trying to be the founder of a new religion with this book. That's not what this book is about. He wasn't trying to answer any questions about life. I would recommend this book to any one who likes to think about those unanswerable questions, and paradoxes.Also I you did not already know this is not a humor book. It has nothing to do with Dilbert."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"But it does make an attempt.I agree with those who've said the writing is sub-par and the knowledge is pretty general, but overall it's an interesting way to kill a few hours.In regards to the negative reviews, I believe you are looking to deep into this book. It set out to do invoke thought, not drop some grand revelation onto society.In fact in some ways this book accomplished its goals as evident in the good and bad reviews it recieved.If you're reading this book hoping to discover the secrets of life, the universe and everything forget it. However, the ideas proposed in God's Debris are no more unlikely than the ideologies that have spawned humanity to kill one another over a sandy piece of land that may have once held some minor significance a long, long time ago.On a side note for those who enjoyed this read, I might also suggest a book written by Galacticomm CEO Tim Stryker called Common Sense."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"I enjoyed this book, having first \\"subscribed\\" to the online version. I also appreciate the way the \\"lessons\\" were presented, and it does provide some new ways of looking at age-old problems.But I can't imagine why anyone would give it five stars. It is far from an epiphany, or a guiding light to help me live my life. It does what it purports to do...give people something to think about...but there is no Pultizer forthcoming for this piece of work, and there is much more debris than God presented here.I give it three stars because I often engage in and enjoy this kind of philosophical doggerel.

I have to believe that had this book not been written by Scott Adams or someone with similar celebrity (cult) status it would be recognized as the shallow tripe that it is.Based on other reviews I kept waiting for something revelatory or thought-provoking to come out of this book. But instead, I got page after page of the meanderings of someone who just read their first metaphysics or self-help book and thinks they are now enlightened.No ... I haven't missed the point of this being a thought experiment. Even as a thought experiment it is amateurish in its content and in its presentation. High-school Creative Writing class kind of stuff.Mr. Adams is a wonderful cartoonist. \\"Dilbert\\" is one of my all-time favorite strips.

Adams, in the introduction, explains that the book is a \\"... 132-page thought experiment wrapped in a fictional story.\\"Okay. What book ISN'T a \\"thought experiment\\"? What book DOESN't expect to challenge the mind, to take the reader to places she or he hasn't been, and to leave the reader ruminating on new universal or neural connections and pathways?Besides Harlequin Romance #1409, \\"Nurse Harriet Goes to Holland,\\" I mean.It was disingenuous for Adams to develop his thoughts on life, God, evolution, ESP, skeptics, et cetera, and then state, \\"Hey... I didn't get it wrong... it is a THOUGHT EXPERIMENT!!! If you don't get what I'm saying, or you disagree with my argument, NO PROBLEM. I never intended to get it right!\\" [my words, not his.]Now, I have to admit that I first read The Religion War (was glancing at it in the bookstore because I'm a Dilbert fan, read a few pages, bought a coffee and finished reading it, bought the book and gave it to my daughter) and got God's Debris later. I thought The Religion War was the better book of the two.The most interesting feature or insight from God's Debris was, literally, the notion of \\"God's debris.\\" For a richer understanding of the nature of God, I suggest Richard Dawkin's book, The God Delusion. Now THERE is a \\"thought experiment!\\"With all that said, I DID enjoy reading God's Debris. It DID function as a \\"thought experiment.\\" My brain DID \\"spin around in my skull\\" (and I enjoyed it). And I HAVE recommended the book to others.So I give this book five stars for being interesting (and attractive), worthy of recommendation to others, and encouraging people to think, but I lower it to four stars for being too shallow to accomplish what Adams could do with the book (and perhaps this is why he followed it up with The Religion War... these books should have been combined into a single volume).This book is also available as a free download: search for \\"God's Debris free download.\\""},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"(This is not a review of this book.

Even those that seem to acknowledge that they know what the author's \\"point\\" is.To the pedagogues who have (or think they have) a knowledge of or familiarity with philosophical writings: the book is NOT the author's attempt at philosphical dialogue. While the fictional search for truth within these pages is philosophical in nature, the author is not propounding new philosophical theories or paying homage to old ones. It's a story, and it's a game, for you. There's no point in your criticizing the author for attempting to recreate your college philosophy class, other than showing off, or deterring those who may enjoy this logic game.To those complaining about factual errors in the book: you have completely missed the point. If you don't enjoy identifying the errors, don't read the read the book. Keep in mind, those of you who challenge the arguments themselves, factual errors notwithstanding, there is a difference between true and valid arguements.I've seen too many reviews that spend pages critizing the author and what they perceive he is trying to do, when this is clearly laid out in the introduction. It's not a philosophy text, it's not nail biting fiction. I ask that those who are impatient/unimpressed by the thought experiment idea stop attacking the book for what it's not because you may be deterring those who would enjoy this.

Scott Adams does very well for someone who isn't a metaphysician, though--as others have commented, and as I have noticed--a lot of what he advances is simply metaphysics by any other name.

It is also not a book for everyone. Some people love it, some people don't like it at all. There is not much grey area in between.God's debris states in the introduction that it will probably not be enjoyed by someone over the age of 55(mentally). Reason being, it discusses controversial and alternate ways of thinking. Somebody who is quite stuck in their ways and not open to even thinking about alternate(if unreasonable) ideas will not enjoy the experience.It's fiction. It's meant to be fiction. But it was one of the most entertaining books I've read in a long time. I read somewhere that it was compared to &quot;battlefield earth.&quot; An artist's arrogant attempt to branch out believing that anything they do will turn to gold.. Well, all I know is that I could barely sit thru battlefield earth, and I couldn't put down God's Debris. I read it in one 5 hour session. Then again the next day.

(This has been a popular form since the days of Socrates himself, and in fact a structurally similar, and absolutely dreadful, book about a dialogue between a man and a gorilla was a best seller in recent years.) Adams' wise old man presents the narroator with a number of arguments that baffle the narrator but (unfortunately for Adams) are mostly old arguments with simple refutations.Every imaginative college student who has completed a course in intro philosophy has found his or her thoughts turned to the sort of fantasy Adams has written, but not everyone has enough pull with a publisher to actually get it published. Adams has written an imaginative little story that would have been much better if he's read a few more philosphy books and realized that his novel ideas weren't terribly novel at all.Still, those who have never read any philosophy might find this book interesting and perhaps it might even stimulate them to read a bit deeper than the author has. If you found this book interesting- or \\"life changing\\", as some have intimated, I suggest you move on to a few more challanging books by authors whose education in philosophy goes beyond a few intro classes. As good a place as any to start might be Alain de Boton's \\"The Consolations of Philosophy\\"."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"I recieved this book for Christmas and was skepticle at first.

This book is perfect for people with open minds and the urge to aquire knowledge. The only negative thing i could say about this book is the actual story.

The idea of the &quot;all-knowing&quot; character is a good start, but what comes after that is flat and uninspiring. Take the first point: Probability triggers off no &quot;why&quot;.

Unfortunately, the book loses all credibility as serious thought experiment when one reads the section on evolution. There is a lot that could be said about the specifics in this section, but the core of the problem lies in the know-it-all sage's (Avatar) misconception that evolution bumps along on a basis of improbable mutations and sudden appearances of fully formed, new species. In the introduction the author Adams declares, \\"The central character (Avatar) states a number of scientific \\"facts.\\" Some of his weirdest statements are consistent with what scientists generally believe. Some of what he says is creative baloney designed to sound true.\\" I wondered briefly if Avatar's statements about evolution fit either of these categories but I don't think so. I believe that they are Adams' own naive view of evolution. This view, that evolution is driven by sudden, gross mutations, is common among those who have only a superficial acquaintance with evolution but most who fit this category would not attempt to explain it in a public forum."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"I don't know where people get the idea from that this will improve your critical thinking skills.

It turns out that this delivery on his daily route is more than it seems.That is a basic description of God's Debris, by Scott Adams. For the mind-bending questions that are asked in the book, it is relatively simplistic in its presentation. Most of the questions are ones you've probably heard before and a lot of them are paradoxes. For example, \\"How do we have free will if things are known by God already?\\" So, most of the questions are not new but putting them all together in a story, linking them up, is something I don't usually see. And then taking these questions and answers to develop a \\"theory\\" is very interesting.Don't expect hard hitting theories and scientific journal type writing. That isn't what this book is about. It really is \\"A Thought Experiment\\" to get the gears in your mind oiled up and moving in different ways.I had the chance to hear about the book and talk a bit to Scott Adams when it came out. He had some interesting comments that helped me enjoy the book more.1. The book is placed in the Philosophy section in most bookstores but Adams has said he'd rather have it with his Dilbert books. I think because it would be easier to find and also because of reason the next item:2. He isn't trying to establish a new religion or even a new philosophy. He is just asking questions to make you think, to mull over life's mysteries. He is not trying to debunk any current religious beliefs. He wants you to talk about this book with friends. Throw ideas out there and see if any stick.3. The introduction is important. There is a flaw in the argument in the book and he *wants* you to figure it out. In his words, he challenges you to show how \\"Scott Adams is full of crap.\\"I like this book because it makes you think about complex ways without having to decipher what is being written. It is a fun book and I do believe that contemplating reality can help lead you to a better understanding of what is truth and what is fiction. Let ideas challenge and shape you. This is an easy way to do that. Then, if you like it, move to the bigger, more complex stuff that is written like a journal.3.5 to 4.0 stars."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"Most of the reviews here seem to miss the point that this book is about figuring out &quot;what's wrong with the old man's explanation of reality.&quot;While the one star reviewers seem to have expected an inspiring and consistent vision of reality (of course it is not!), the five star reviewers seem to ignore the &quot;intentional&quot; inconsistencies within itself and with Physics and Philosophy. Sure, for someone unfamiliar with Philosophy or Physics, this book fills nicely and comfortably some white spots on her map of the world. And this is exactly what this book should NOT be used for. It is - if anything - the question, not the answer. But like to old man says: &quot;Our perceptions are wondrously flexible, transforming our worldview automatically and continuously until we find safe harbor in a comfortable delusion.&quot;So who should read this book? Definitely not newcomers in this domain, because they will receive plenty of seemingly correct, but inconsistent &quot;new information&quot;. For them I would rather recommend Fritjof Capra's &quot;The Tao of Physics&quot;.It might be interesting for a student in this domain to sort out all the errors, maybe as a student assignment.

This is the kind of book that really makes your head spin with ideas. I could not stop reading once I started. And I certainly recommend this highly to people who have read widely on religion and science. There is something metaphysical about this and I applaud Scott Adams. This is the work of a genius and that's always been clear to me when looking deeper into the Dilbert cartoons. And now looking deeper into the soul, the origin, the meaning of life. Scott Adams ranks up there with Douglas Adams in original thinking and wit."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"My goodness, where to begin. This book was one of the most immediately intriguing, engaging works of... well what the heck is it? Fiction to be sure, but not quite a story in the traditional sense, although it reads like a novella. The &quot;Thought Experiment&quot; description fits as well as anything, I guess.Anyway, the first time through &quot;God's Debris&quot; I found myself thinking &quot;I'll just finish this page, then get back to work.&quot; Before I knew it I was done with it and the hadn't gotten anything done. Good thing I'm the PHB here. While not written specifically as a humorous work, it does have some good &quot;chuckle&quot; moments to help make points throughout.This is every bit as thought provoking as Hawking's &quot;Brief History of Time&quot; (seriously, no hyperbole there), but you don't need an advanced degree in quantum mechanics to get it. A great read for anyone interested in tweaking their own perception of the Universe."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"What is the &quot;thought experiment&quot; here? As far as I can tell, Adams &quot;thought&quot; he was presenting something really earth-shattering and mind boggling. I &quot;thought&quot; that the book was pretty disappointing, especially given the absurd hype it has receieved by Adams, the press, and others here.As fiction, the book is pretty weak. First, there's the intro, where Adams claims that what you're about to read will &quot;spin your brain&quot;, as if something earth shattering or important will follow. How many works of &quot;fiction&quot; need a prelude where they hype how interesting they're going to be? In the &quot;meat&quot; of the story we get rehashed philisophical debate. Some of the debates seem presented in a somewhat fresh, or at least more plain-spoken, wording, but there is little &quot;new&quot; or &quot;brain spinning&quot; here - at least to anyone whose had at least a bachelor degree level exposure to philosophy and/or logic.As a philisophical book, it has some gaping flaws. Many of the arguments put forth by the old man have significant errors, most notably the chapter on evolution theory. Instead of highlighting flaws with evolution theory, the argument put forth by the Avatar demonstrate that the he has a flawed interpretation of evolution theory. Odd coming from a character who is supposed to know &quot;everything&quot;.And I really don't understand the shift near the end to talking about men, women and their relationships. It doesn't fit with the rest of the information presented. It sticks out and is presented like something that was thrown in at the last second. Honestly, it appears as though Adams was trying to bump up the word count.The &quot;value&quot; of this book, if there is any, is that as a whole it reminds people to always attempt to see things from many angles, to not accept what they have learned as &quot;gospel&quot;, whether its the gospel of religion or science. But Adams covered all that in a single chapter in &quot;The Dilbert Principle&quot; (or was it the &quot;The Dilbert Future&quot;?). This is essentially a long-winded re-telling of the ideas presented there - though he does present a somewhat different view on affirmations.Not utterly worthless, but NO WAY near as original or entertaining as Adams' self-hype and some of the reviews presented here and elsewhere suggest. What keeps it from being a total waste is that the entire book can be read in ~2 hours, so one doesn't have to waste a whole lot of time.Mr. Adams: Please stick to comics."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"God's Debris takes you on a journey of contradiction. It is written to make you sit back and think, question what you readily except. This book, as appropriately sub-titled, is a work of thought. This book does not necessarily challenge what you think, but more of how. If you do not like being challenged, tasked, or made to take pause of how you think of things, then God's Debris is not for you. But I have recommended this book to many people and I have not had anyone disappointed. Again, this book goes against conventional thought.The author never says, &quot;THIS IS THE WAY IT IS&quot;, just &quot;What about this?&quot; It is time to wipe the cobwebs from your brain and think for a couple of hours. I came away thinking to myself that this book should be required reading for Philosophy Classes.I hope that Scott Adams does more like this. I would read them all."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"God's Debris is an attempt to force you to hit F5 (refresh) on your beliefs. Ideas once accepted have a way of going unchallenged for years, even decades. By design, Adams makes the scope of the book broad and the subject matter universal. For each section he hopes the Old Man's explanations are compelling enough for you to wonder why you DONT believe the same and to reconsider how you came to believe what you do. You might be appalled at how wobbly the foundations of your own core beliefs are.Outside their ability to perturb, the Old Man's ideas are irrelevant. It would be a mistake to accept them wholly or to reject them based on their inaccuracies, which are intentional. An inaccurate assertion has the greatest power to stimulate a response (good messageboard &quot;trolls&quot; know this). If, for example, I told you that my clearly polka-dotted shirt was plaid, you'd carefully examine my shirt before telling me I was wrong. Adams wants to prompt the &quot;carefully examine&quot; response and perhaps make it a habit of mind for you.The absurdities in much of Adams's works relate to a failure to carefully examine ideas, to accept them based on momentum or the resonance of their elegant simplicity. In a sense, this is Adams's antidote for a world where pointy haired bosses reign.Having said the above, if you don't find the ideas novel enough to jog you into a critical thinking mode, you won't get much out of the book. This is likely the case for philosophy majors. Still, you shouldn't dismiss it out of hand. Consider it a potential gateway drug into more substantial works.I'm sure that possibility would delight Adams."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"In God's Debris, Dilbert-creator Scott Adams lays out what he calls a \\"thought experiment.\\" Adams frames the meat of his book--a long conversation--in a meager plotline: A delivery man comes to a house one day, gets no response to his knock, steps inside, and is greeted by an old man. The two have a long conversation that covers physics, metaphysics, God's will, free will, religion, evolution, extra-sensory perception, and motivational psychology (not to mention the kitchen sink). The old man is presented as an oracle (of sorts), and the delivery man is there mainly to keep him talking.Adams disavows the beliefs presented in God's Debris, stating that the \\"thought experiment\\" is to discover where the old man goes wrong--where his beliefs make leaps that defy logic. I have a couple problems with this approach. First, Adams' unwillingness to stand behind any of the views he presents feels like a cop-out--one wonders if he wrote the book, saw the obvious flaws in his (the old man's) arguments, and then decided to publish it anyway with the disclaimer. I'm wary of an author who won't put himself on the line.Second, I don't find Adams' thought experiment particularly interesting. One should read any work skeptically, and a work making metaphysical claims deserves an especially close look. Would Adams' thought experiment have been any different had he presented the old man's views as his own? No--we would still read his work skeptically. Adams claims that the old man's philosophy stems from the \\"skeptic's creed\\"--that the simplest explanation is probably the correct one--but he gives no justification for this claim. It's not at all clear that the explanations presented are simpler than the alternatives. Thus, the fact that the old man's arguments are flawed says little about the validity of the skeptic's creed.The philosophy of God's Debris does have its merits. The old man's explanation of the universe's origin, for instance, was novel to me. In short, the old man thinks that an all-powerful god--one he assumes exists--would find nothing challenging other than the prospect of destroying itself. The old man posits that this god did destroy itself in an explosion that created the universe. The universe is composed of tiny particles--\\"god's dust\\"--whose motion is governed by \\"probability.\\" Though this probability is not explained very well, the old man thinks that it captures god's will--events that god wants to happen are more likely to occur. According to the old man, god is using probability to rebuild itself.If you've read much philosophy, you're probably familiar with much of the ground God's Debris covers. The old man presents oft-repeated arguments against \\"free will,\\" for example. He also pokes holes in science, which, he points out, makes its own metaphysical assumptions. To Adams' credit, his presentation is straightforward. Too many philosophers get bogged down in jargon and incomprehensible sentence structures, and I commend Adams for keeping things simple.Is God's Debris worth reading? If you are new to the topics it presents, I think so. It will get you thinking about some interesting questions. The philosopher in me can't help but wish that Adams had taken his task more seriously and presented arguments that he could stand behind. Nevertheless, the book does present difficult ideas straightforwardly, and some of its content was new to me."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"God's Debris is interesting. And I think that this was the author's intent really. The book asks a lot of questions, makes the reader ask more and answers none of them. In fact, by the end I am not any more convinced or sure of anything before I read the book except that all those questions I had about whether God existed -- and if so in what form and for what purpose -- are the same ones we all ask. We all have to ask. Whether we believe or not, no matter what our definition of God, the questioning is an important part of faith. It is what you believe after the question that matters.That said I would recommend the book. But don't think that because it is tiny that you can wiz through it.

From the presocratics to pre-modern day Nietzche, I've dabbled in whatever I can get my hands on. I picked up this book with the notion that Scott Adams has written something along the lines of a &quot;thought provoking&quot; book. Upon reading it, I have to agree that it does do just that.The book provides a good mixture of psychology, metaphysical mind journies, and a hint of preaching. It was never intended to reveal the secrets of the universe; nobody can do that. Instead, it allows the reader to step up from dogmatic thinking patterns and really question the world in which we live in.My only complaint was that the book's ultimate thesis was argued only via appealling to faith. As there is no clear method to explain reality via science, Adams uses the word &quot;model&quot; to justify his position in the book. However if one were to look beyond simple semantics, the underlying explainations of our current belief systems are indeed quite impressive.I enjoyed the book very much.

Each chapter focuses on some aspect of life and attempts to expose some part of the mind which tries to create and maintain its own illusions. This book is not written for the arrogant or fundamentalist scientist or religious person. It is, however, written for the life, physical, and theological scientist."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"If someone had handed me this without the title page and asked me to guess who had written it, I would have said it was a college freshman making a C in his Introduction to Philosophy class, a D in Biology, who was dropping acid when his roommate was discussing his Physics classes and thinks The Matrix rocks, especially the part where the old dude was explaining everything with all those big words that he did not understand.The reader is challenged to \\"Try to figure out what's wrong with the old man's explanation of reality.\\" There is no challenge. Every page is filled with factual errors, leaps of illogic and philosophical fallacies. It is like trying to find holes in a sieve. The only intellectual challenge is trying to find poetical ways to describe how silly it is, and how pretentious its marketing - \\"...it might be the most compelling vision of reality you will ever read.\\" There are plenty of websites with just as absurd views of reality that are no less compelling, which is not saying much.The apparent success does show one thing; the poor quality of American education. That so many people find this book \\"compelling\\" just goes to show how ignorant the average person is. This why the Intelligent Design movement is having so much success, even after a Federal trial has revealed that it is completely lacking in substance, even in the minds of its best supporters.It would take a much larger book, or a decent education, to explain in detail everything that is wrong with God's Debris, but what would be the point? There is nothing new in this book."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"This book is wrapped in a story, but that is inconsequential. Essentially it is a series of short philosophical ideas put forward by an old man who knows everything, discussed with a young man who is learning to question his perceptions.Adams asks us to suspend our disbelief and base our subsequent thoughts on the premise that everything the old man says is true. But how is this possible when many of the things he says are so fundamentally wrong? Take these pearls of wisdom for instance:&quot;No matter what object you insert between two magnets, their attraction to each other remains the same.&quot; This is simply not true.&quot;Religious people are happier, they live longer, have fewer accidents, and stay out of trouble compared to non-religious people.&quot; Just exactly where is Adams getting these farcical figures?Perhaps sloppiest of all is Adams' dreadful interpretation of the theory of evolution, expounding the fallacy that evolution requires entire organs, and even new species that cannot interbreed, to appear in a single generation. Or could it be when the old man states that he &quot;recognizes science as a belief system&quot; - clearly his understanding of what science is is in need of some improvement.I was just very relieved when it turned out the old man's understanding of relativity was broadly correct, or I may have stopped caring at all about the next platitude he uttered. Adams claims that his own views cannot be gleaned from the book -- but why else would the old man be saying these things, if he is supposed to know everything?It is generally assumed by people reading a book that the author will have made the effort to research factual material. People who don't know these things are wrong will likely assume them correct. How can a thought experiment succeed if it starts with false premises? In addition, there are plenty of examples of flawed logic in the book, although Adams may claim it is part of the experiment to locate them.Despite this, there are several interesting ideas in the book, as long as you know where the pitfalls are. The old man comes to some profound conclusions about the nature of God through the method of redefinition, in other words he redefines &quot;God&quot; at the start to fit the conclusions.It's difficult to know how to rate this book: on how much I enjoyed it, or whether I think people should read it? The book does make you think, and the average person does not think about or question their beliefs and presumptions anywhere near enough, so in that sense I recommend it. Another bonus is that Adams is a popular author, so many people who would not normally contemplate philosophical issues will be introduced to its advantages. But will the conclusions the reader comes to be based on invalid statements of &quot;fact&quot;? That I cannot guarantee against."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"I havn't been able to sit through and entirely enjoy a book in two years. A friend of mine, knowing I'm into philosophy, recommended I read this book. I hated being bored so I left it out for future use. One night I picked it up and read the first two chapters, in three hours it was over and I wanted more. I loved every minute of it. Though I did not agree with everything it said, it still opended up the flood gates to thoughts I didn't know anyone dared to think. This is a brave, thought provoking peice of literature and I highly recommend it to anyone who is ready to open a world of questions and find the answers all at once."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"i think the reviewers who give this book low ratings are either taking the book or themselves way too seriously! the author practically provides a disclaimer that he is not a scientist and that his scientific theories should not be taken seriously. but still some reviewers insist on showing how big their brains are by picking apart the very same theories that Adams admits are not sound from the very start.i think that a great explanation as to why the \\"scientific\\" theories were even included was offered by another reviewer down the list. i.e perhaps the incorrect science was included purposely to challenge the reader to research these scientific ideas for themselves. thereby Adams would be, in a weird way, tricking people into becoming more knowledgeable. seems like the sort of thing Andy Kauffman would have found hilarious.but the real jem of this book was the meaning of the term \\"god's debris\\". this was the real reason why the book was written. the importance of all the rest of the content is secondary. i don't want to ruin it for anyone who hasn't read it, but the explanation is brilliant and truly unique! i've never read any explanation for the existance of god and the universe that was so profound and yet so obvious! i'd recommend this book to anyone and everyone who just enjoys reading new ideas and philisophical concepts! excluding those who take themselves too seriously. they can stick to math textbooks."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"Its an interesting thought experiment and I found that I couldn't put it down. I think some of his science may have been slightly off but it was still an interesting read. If you like thinking about the Universe and what possible meaning the Universe could have then you might enjoy this book. I think its a good way to stretch you imagination."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"I'll give this book one star because it did generate some thoughts. However, if you're looking for a book that will give your mind something invigorating to ponder, forget this one. Its psuedo-facts, its psuedo-logic, and its incorrect use of the notion of probability make this story easy to dismiss. It doesn't even read well. It also doesn't present any real meaningful truths. The author wields a grandiose idea that &quot;probability&quot; is in control of the universe. This is merely semantics. It's like saying &quot;time&quot; is in control of the universe. Both are only ways to help define events--not the cause of events. The author says in his introduction that there is some hidden agenda or message to be extracted from this unbelievable and child-like conversation. I really think that statement is a ploy to sell books. This story is too contrived."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"Well I guess I'll have to be contrary because I didn't get anything out of this book. It appeared to be disjointed ramblings with no central theme. I love Dilbert though."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"Mr. Adams warns you before reading the book God's Debris of its uncharacteristic nature in respect to his other offerings. Boy oh Boy is that ever true! I opened the book, thought I'd take a peek and then read the rest over the weekend. Instead I spent the next several hours into the wee hours of the morning hungrily reading every word!Are you stuck in a rut? Tired of the same old novels? Thirsting for something to stimulate your mind? Do you like to challenge conventional thinking or perhaps defend it? Enjoy brainteasers and the teasing of others brains? Do you really believe the things you believe? Then this book is certainly for you.Other reviews give you a peek at how the book is structured and it's content so I won't bore you with the same. I can tell you that if you allow it, if you welcome it, this book will turn all of your previous thoughts about life and it's meaning on it's head! No, it's not a \\"cult\\" message or urging you to convert to any \\"new\\" realm of thought. Although at certain points I did amusingly ponder the emergence of a new \\"S. Adams cult\\" ! I loved reading the chapters then sitting back with a cool drink to ponder and absorb its message. I also enjoyed challenging friends and family with several ideas from the book.Bravo Mr. Adams, bravo!"},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"This is an interesting piece of work, comparable to a similar Bernard Shaw work titled &quot;little black girl&quot; (1920's I think). You know a book is going to be fascinating when it incorporates eastern and western theology to explain the obscene amount of money spent senselessly, oh so long ago, on internet technologies. Scott sounds very Nietzschean in the way he takes on current models of theology. I highly recommend people who enjoy this book to also take a swing at an essay by Nietzsche called &quot;On truth and lie in an extra-moral sense&quot;. It's probably available on the net."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"When i first started reading &quot;God's Debris&quot;, I was instantly hooked. Scott Adams totally immerses the reader into his world. While he could have easily forced the reader to see his own point of view, he more or less guides you into it. In an almost hypnotic way he leads you along lines of thought that the reader may have never gone down. After finishing &quot;God's Debris&quot; I did indeed look at my own beliefs in a new way. While it's not asking you to denounce your own set of beliefs, it does warrant asking a few questions."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"&quot;God's Debris&quot; is set up much the same way as the Diologues of Plato. Except it has a modern setting and even more modern ideas. In both, we have the &quot;teacher&quot; leading the &quot;student&quot; in a question/ answer forum. The &quot;student&quot; is lead to a new point of view through the logic of the &quot;teacher&quot;'s explainations, and through questioning his own beliefs and assumptions. That is how the book, in my opinion, should be viewed. Just as today, we dont agree with everything the Greeks belived in, but we admire thier skill in logic. As long as the reader has that mind set about this book, they will enjoy the untraditional view of God and the fresh perspective on probability that Scott Adams presents. And dont let my referrence to Plato freak you out, the book is easy to follow. I'm only 18 and I got it. at least I think I got it. And thats the beauty of it. It's a piece that's meant to be shared with others to see what they've gotten out of it. I hope this review does the book justice. I didnt want to give away too much of the content, because it's one of those things that you have to see for yourself."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"When I heard of this book, I was hoping that Adams, world-class humorist that he is, had with \\"God's Debris\\" written a profound and amusing treatment of Omega Point theory - the idea that everything that has ever happened will be replicated and perfected in some distant, heavenly future. Having years ago read Frank Tippler's \\"The Physics of Immortality\\", I felt that a popularization of the subject of this dry, voluminous, yet thought-provoking book was long overdue. As a longtime Dilbert fan, I would have liked nothing better than for Adams to write one.For about the first third of \\"God's Debris\\", I though he might have. His forward warned not to hold the story up to excessive factual scrutiny, and \\"Physics of God-Dust\\" promised showed promise to get into some cool speculation about quatitized time and quantum gravity. Alas, this promise was never fulfilled. By the time Mr. Avatar began discoursing on the physical non-existence of light and the instantaneous effect of changes in gravity - ideas at odds with the last century of experimental Physics - all hope had fled. And, this book having only the thinnest narrative framework, the events and characters created only to present its ideas, when those ideas become unignorably wrong, the reader is left with nothing. In fairness, the information on social skills in \\"Relationships\\" is sound and worthwhile, but occurring as it does nearly at the end of the book, it was a struggle to regain interest.This book is one of the rare ones that I had to put down several times, not to reflect upon, but because its failings were so painful.The pity is that this needn't have been. A competent physicist could have marked this book up with a sprinkling of additions and corrections that could have kept it on track, and made it into a book that would stir the imagination of more experienced and technically literate readers, while not leading less experienced ones into a grab-bag of archaic intellectual pitfalls. When Carl Sagan, no slouch scientifically, wrote \\"Contact\\", he invited folk like Kip Thorne to proofread it, the result being a bestselling novel with practically no scientific holes.The idea of a \\"5th level human being\\", a step above the 4th level (\\"skepticism ... good working grasp on truth, thanks to science, your logic , and your senses) is deeply intriguing. To be convincing, however, such a character must evidence that he has acquired the \\"good working grasp\\" skills of the previous level of consciousness. Otherwise, the ancient wise man comes across as an enthusiastic but naive youth. A \\"man who knows everything\\" would always include the Michelson-Morley experiment in an explanation of Special Relativity, and be numerate enough to avoid statements like \\"if you flip a coin often enough, eventually it will come up heads a thousand times in a row\\" (The odds of 1,000 consecutive heads is 1/2^1000 =~ 1/10^301. If every person presently alive on earth flipped a trillion coins a second until all conventional matter has vanished from the universe (10^124 sec), the chance of one person getting 1,000 heads in a row is still worse than 1:10^270 !)"},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"If you're capable of reading something that you don't agree with, you will thoroughly enjoy this book and the effect it has on your mind. Very thought provoking! It should be required reading for anyone who considers themselves a \\"freethinker\\".The very religious might wish to avoid this book because they would find the ideas in this book highly disruptive to their tidy little world views. They will most certainly NOT want to let their children read it.The very scientific should take discussions on quantum teleportation, gravity, light and evolution with a grain of salt: the book isn't trying to introduce new scientific theory, its trying to make you see how much your own perceptions and beliefs shape what you _think_ you know.Finally, if you've got a Masters or PhD in Philosophy, you have no doubt heard (and thought about) all of the ideas presented. Its still an interesting read though."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"A delivery man of limited brains and no ability to argue comes up against an old-man blowhard named, without much subtlety, Mr. Avatar. Mr. Avatar spouts some teenage philosophy at the guy, and the guy lacks the brains to argue or reason effectively. So Mr. Avatar goes unchallenged in his statements. Even though many of them are simplistic or muddle headed.The book is a carefully considered thought experiment. But it seems to have failed, and probably shouldn't have been let loose on the world. Adams sets up many straw men and knocks them down, but never puts his thoughts up against real competition. He makes extreme examples and fails to look critically at the leading questions he asks. He also makes some infuriating errors in terminology: God doesn't know everything because he is ominpotent, as Adams claims many times: The word he's looking forward to is omniscient, which is a different proposition. It may seem small, but it's just an example of the sloppy writing found in this screed.Finally, it's a short thought experiment, sure. But why no footnotes to back up claims like \\"Einstein proved this...\\" or \\"Science proves that...\\". I can say that Einstein proved that tinfoil hats protect me from the CIA. But I'd at least want to footnote such a claim. This book, in other words, is not for critical thinkers."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"Let me first of all say that I like Mr. Adams. I find the Dilbert Cartoons enjoyable, even with the occasional snippets of Adams \\"philosophy\\" that spring out here and there. I have also enjoyed it when he sometimes goes off and gets all serious on us at the end of some of his funny books, and is willing to write about what he thinks about black holes, string theories, parallel universes and the like. If nothing else, these may help people who otherwise would not have been interested, in wanting to know more about fascinating fields of knowledge and reasoning (like physics).I have thus enjoyed the arguments put forth my Mr. Adams in his book \\"God's Debris\\", even if many of them seem downright childlish in the author's belief that they would be \\"groundbreaking\\"; or if many of the old man's explanations seem oddly out of place, simplistic or just plain wrong, from a logical standpoint. It is, after all and as Mr. Adams says at the beginning, an \\"experiment\\". I see it more of an experiment on whether he can write non-humour or more profound books, so we might be willing to give him some slack on how we perceive his efforts.Now, having said that, there are two elements that (for me, at least), really undermine Mr. Adams efforts, make his \\"experiment\\" a failure and compel me to give him only two stars (and that is generous). The first is the feeble attempt at what he calls \\"fiction writing\\". Some other reader described it as in league with a \\"college freshman's creative writing assignment\\". That's exactly what it is. Mr. Adams tries to describes his character's emotions, actions and surroundings in a way that may make you, the reader, care more about what is going on and what is being said, because of the emotional connection the author creates by the swift and masterful use of the written word. But he just doesn't have the lyrical bug in him. It is like a young performer at a variety contest trying to sound like a huge music star, but actually making her shortcomings all the more apparent (think \\"American Idol\\" and all those contestants trying to belt out tunes that are way too big for their voices).But the real stinker in Mr. Adams' efforts, and frankly the thing that annoyed the hell out of me and compelled me to write this review, was his smugness and overbearing arrogance, particularly at the preface of this book. After all, all he did was take some interesting physical theories and discussions from intellectuals who have made an effort to explain physical phenomena in more common terms for the benefit of us all (\\"a brief history of time\\", \\"Schroedinger's cat\\"), and made them even more basic and accesible to, say, a teenager. This is a fine intention, and a good reason to write a book. However, Mr. Adams goes all condescending on the rest of the world, and actually writes a warning to his book that he just may have been too clever and written such devastating counter-arguments to some of the beliefs that we hold \\"true\\", that \\"kids under the age of 14 shouldn't read this book\\". He also asks readers NOT to write to him to debate him, \\"because you won't find out what I believe in from my fiction\\". As if the rest of the universe might only care about what he \\"believes in\\" --Mr. Adams does not entertain the possibility that one find fault in the writing or descriptions of philosophy or physics themselves ,and just thinks that the rest of us are delusionally religious and shaken to our foundations by his Avatar's musings.A pot-head roommate of mine in college was fascinated with the idea that the atoms that we and things are made up of, might seem to be tiny universes and solar systems, and made up themselves of really, really small planets and people and things. What was funny to the rest of us, was that he actually thought he had come up with this image --that he was the first to liken the description of an atom to that of a planetary system or galaxy. Mr. Adams book just reminds me of my roommate --he is entertaining, but for all the wrong reasons."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"I loved this book, it really did make me look at things in a different light, however if you are set in your beliefs and ideas don't read it. Especially if you don't like having your notions about everything questioned. Although Scott Adams says in his preface that this is unscientific it does make some sense."},{"Title":"God's Debris: A Thought Experiment","review":"God's Debris is one of those books that seems far too short. I read it in one sitting and wished for more. Whether or not you agree with Adams' conclusions, it will get your mind working in unexpected areas. Like the Tao Te Ching, Voltaire's Candide, Nietzsche's Thus Spake Zarathustra, Pirsig's Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, and Richard Bach's Illusions, my mind will be returning to questions and ideas raised in God's Debris for the rest of my life. Following is an excerpt from an e-mail I sent Scott Adams immediately upon finishing the book:I just read God's Debris, and I was quite impressed. Clarity. Simple and profound. Many of the ideas correspond to my own thoughts, but you put a slightly different light on them or combined them in new ways, to my utter delight. It is very satisfying to compliment myself with the notion that a third party has confirmed that my ideas were grander than I had thought. I will bask in the illusion. However, while reading I couldn't help feeling that something even beyond these notions was creeping up behind me -- some way of seeing even further outside the human box, or perhaps further inside it. Perhaps even the idea that our notions are &quot;delusions&quot; is a purely human one -- resting on the shaky notion that there exists some absolute truth or fiction about things, when truth and falsehood are only a &quot;useful delusion&quot; that helps us to avoid being fooled in our daily lives. The idea (delusion) in the previous sentence helps me feel better about making practical use of my delusions, though I'm not sure why."},{"Title":"Superman: The Animated Series Guide","review":"Being a fan of the Superman animated series, I was thrilled to see some a new book come out on this well-written show.Regrettably, after a measly 52 episodes, WB decided not to produce any more episodes, and just last year DC also decided not to produce any more comics written in the Superman--Animated Series style.This text is much more kid friendly than Mr. McCloud's other DC Books on the regular DC DK books (Batman, having a few strong illustrations that might be a bit much for the younger crowd).I was rather surprised at the smaller size of the text, but loved the well-chosen illustrations and text, culled from both the series and short-lived comic book.An excellent guide to the series, which hopefully can get some more kids and viewers into the show which will be replayed on the Cartoon Network.I hope Mr. McCloud can continue to do books on Batman Beyond and in a few years, the Justice League (when that particular series has accumulated more episodes).Still, I wish a few more pages could have included an episode guide to the series, and to the comic book done in that styleHeartily recommend.Sincerely,JThreecarolyn@dia.net"},{"Title":"Superman: The Animated Series Guide","review":"My 5 year old son loves Superman and loves this book.

What directions do you have to know which is the right way? I'm gonna help you with those directions. Tokyopop has pulled a Nintendo and release TWO different versions of \\"CLAMP no eshigoto\\": North Side and South Side (the \\"no eshigoto\\" is the japanese lettering on the title, meaning \\"artworks\\"). These Sides contain history of CLAMP's synonymous visual works, from the early years of 1989 to these art books' Japanese release in 2002; forget about looking for \\"Tsubasa\\" and \\"xxxHOLIC\\" designs on either side, they're from '03. Also, if you're hoping for illustrations of \\"Cardcaptor Sakura\\", \\"Chobits\\", \\"Angelic Layer\\", and \\"X(/1999)\\", you're out of luck on either side as well. The Sides are for the real CLAMP manga enthusiams, but those books are by no means a disappointment.If you read mostly CLAMP manga from Kodansha, then you're a northern bookworm. \\"Clover\\", \\"Magic Knight Rayearth\\", and others were part of the same company line-up, because \\"North Side\\" was released in Japan by Kodansha. Even though I mentioned there's no \\"Cardcaptor\\" or \\"Chobits\\" artworks here, it does have collaboration works with characters from those series mixed together. Surprisingly, even if Kodansha has more popular and exquisite CLAMP works, this Side is short with only 160 pages.If you read some CLAMP manga from Kadokawa Shoten, then you're a southern player. Like Kodansha to the North, \\"South Side\\" was released in Japan by K-Shoten, along with the manga in this side: \\"CLAMP School Detectives\\", \\"Suki\\", \\"Legal Drug\\", and the anthologies that grabbed my heart. Personally, \\"Clamp School\\" along with its spin-offs are, to put it lightly, not great, and at worst, vomitatious (which CLAMP girl thought \\"Man of Many Faces\\" was a great idea?). Even so, there are others that love it, and these are in it for a treat with this side, with 40 more pages of illustrations than on \\"North Side.\\"If you're buying a CLAMP art book for the abundance of extras, go for the North path. \\"North Side\\" has an exclusive CLAMP comic with one of the CLAMP artists as a princess trying to survive a whole day being a normal girl, and eventually got her ass towed up by her mishaps; funny stuff. Not only that, but it include a lengthy, though hard-to-read, interview with THE femme four. Storywriter Ohkawa, and artists Nekoi, Mokona, and Igarashi gave some standard facts of how they met, complications of their careers, and mostly discuss about their work, \\"Chobits.\\" You might want to get some reading glasses because the text are small...REALLY small.If you're looking for a CLAMP artbook with some artistic diversity, head to the South path. While \\"South Side\\" has only one extra, the \\"How-to Art\\" section is plentiful. Three different CLAMP illustrations, three different methods of creating them with detailed instructions and materials needed to create them; reading glasses not included for those squinty text. It's very helpful for those who are following a career in art.For both sides, they include CLAMP's unreleased illustrations, including those that are titilating (who knew these girls can actually draw nipples in one of their designs), and columns to show where CLAMP's works of art have been (magazines, postcards, etc).Choosing between \\"North Side\\" and \\"South Side\\" is like choosing between the red and blue version of \\"Pokemon\\": they're different, but they follows the same core. Both sides contain a considerable amount of flaws, while having some advantages by the corner. It would be nice if both would include arts of such popular CLAMP series, but what both sides have is good enough. For CLAMP fans, I gave you enough facts to help you with your decision, but if you have the dough, you should get both, but if you can afford only one, that decision really depends on your taste.FINAL W()RDS: Whichever wins, nobody loses.[Reviewer's View] I decided to buy \\"South Side\\" over \\"North Side\\", because...well, I'm from the south. Plus, it contains arts from CLAMP's manga anthologies, which I enjoy reading so much, even though their amount of arts were sparse."},{"Title":"CLAMP South Side","review":"My only complaint is the binding. it doesn't really let you open the book easily to really look at the artwork.

This book, 10 years later, is also very rich. Sam has a wonderful way of opening himself up and sharing both his loves and his losses with the reader. This man has clearly done his work and he admits he is still learning.I normally won't read any book that gives me a numbered list of things I'm supposed to remember or incorporate into my life. Sam has a list of 16 qualities of love (if I recall correctly) and I stayed with him through them all. The simplicity of his approach and power of his writing make it work, e.g. the first quality of love Sam describes is Attention. And guess what? I realize on reflection how little attention I give to others in my life, and how little I get back. That is a good starting place for improving my capacity as a loving person and it is easy to remember. So typical of Sam's clarity and authenticity.I agree with the earlier review that this book should be read in bits. It took me several months (and it is a small book). The richness and the depth of this book required that I frequently stop and reflect. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"To Love and Be Loved","review":"I have been a fan of Sam Keen since I read his book &quot;Fire in the Belly&quot; a few years back. I have not read any of Keen's other books until this book captured my interest in the bookstore.Keen makes the argument that love is often misunderstood by those who claim to be in the know. Keen argues that love is not the same in all situations. Their are different types of love in different types of situations. Keen uses stories from his own life and the lives of others to demonstrate his thesis. The is the love one feels for their mate, their children, their friend, and their supreme being.Keen's explanation of marriage is what stocks out most about this book. Keen dispells the myth of soul mates. A couple does not perefectly melt into each other but is able conform to each other and understand each other's needs. We all probably don't have perfect mates, but a number of mates could complement us well.Many readers will be disappointed to find that this book is not really related to sex. Although sex is part of love, love is what makes life worth living. Sex without love lacks substance."},{"Title":"To Love and Be Loved","review":"If you're looking for a kind book to refresh your spirits, then this is it. The tone of the book is warmth, patience, and gentle guidance. The first part of the book covers the art of being a great lover. Part II, which I found most useful, identifies the elements of love. These are best explored one chapter at a time, with plenty of time to reflect on his writings."},{"Title":"To Love and Be Loved","review":"Men and boys in our culture are not taught the art of love, love making or being a loving partner. Most of the self help and relationship books out there are about \\"communication\\", but it is very superficial and basic. There is a path, a journey to being a lover and a Man that is a lover. It does not end with getting laid, being a stud in bed or getting married. Viagra, Cialis, and the like would be unnecessary in modern culture if men felt like men in their everyday lives. That potency carries into the bedroom. This book will start that path."},{"Title":"To Love and Be Loved","review":"You can't go wrong with Sam Keen. Poetically written, Keen displays his skills as a deeply moving philosophical writer once again. More than just stirring up analytical thought within the reader, he moves emotions and contemplative self exploration like no other. Far from idealistic and fantasy based notions, keen hits the nail on the head and creates a very repeatable read that will serve you to improve in all aspects of love."},{"Title":"To Love and Be Loved","review":"Acheivable steps to healthy giving and receiving of love...

As her surveyed the audience he spotted a former girlfriend, Daphne Thorne, and the current was instant the moment their eyes locked. For Nathan, old feelings returned as if they were yesterday. He couldn't explain why he felt the way he did but he knew that he wanted the chance to try to see if the magic between them could re-ignite.Daphne Thorne couldn't believe her feelings for Nathan still existed. It had been years since she had seen her high school boyfriend or &quot;crush&quot; would be more like it. But when Daphne finds him in her apartment waiting for her shortly after his disastrous &quot;non-wedding&quot;, she knows she is in deep trouble. Unable to say no, Daphne agrees to let Nathan rent her vacant apartment; and her emotions and life begin to spiral out of seemingly control.

Deirdre Savoy does a wonderful job of creating characters that warm your heart. Her vivid descriptions of Nathan and his interactions with his baby daughter are captivating. She presents a picture of a dedicated and loving father, which is refreshing. Ms. Savoy is able to describe the scenes in her book with such clarity and the emotion of her characters with such depth that the reader feels the intensity of the emotions that the characters exhibits.

So he seeks her help by asking to rent out her downstairs apartment. It is not long before their attraction is rekindled. Nathan and Daphne have to let go of the past to move on to a passionate and loving future. This is another excellant story by the author. It is written at a pace where the reader will not lose interest but quickly turn pages to see what will happen next.I recommend this and all of Dee's books to all romance readers. Although this is only her third book, I consider her a veteran in the romance writing field. And it looks like she will be around for a long time. Keep up the good work Deirdre. I can't wait to read Nathan's sister story."},{"Title":"Once And Again (Arabesque)","review":"After completing Once and Again, I said to myself, Dee Savoy just keeps on elevating to another level. This is Dee Savoy's third book, having now read all three, each has its own characteristics and being unique in its own special way.I strongly recommend to everyone who enjoys the romance novels to read this book. Great character development, the romance is the heart of this story, it has a lot of passion and you feel the real-lifeness of how the author pulls you into the story.This is one of those books, you just find great difficulty in putting it down, as though you may miss something. It's what we call An All-Nighter type book, one that you can't help but fall in love with both the hero and the heroine.For some of you who read Dee Savoy's last book, Always, will recognize some of the key players in this book. You get the chance to see Nathan Ward, Daphne Thorne (Michael Thorne's sister) and Jenny. You meet some new characters like Bradley and Sherry. You feel the love of baby Emily and you'll understand the sacrifice of motherly love that Monica leaves.In summarizing this book, I say it was one awesome story that I actually hated to see it end on page 300. Yeah, folks 300 pages worth of great reading, the kind of story that makes you say, THAT WAS ONE GOOD BOOK!!!!I met Dee Savoy last year and was very impressed with her loving spirit, saw her again this year and that same spirit still shining with the smile she gives us on the back of her bookcovers.

However, like the finest of wines, the &quot;aged&quot; love that exists between R&amp;B, crooner, Nathan Ward and entrepreneur Daphene Thorne will truly satisfy one's palette for romance. Realistically though, during any lengthy separation, adults may divert their physical needs elsewhere, as in the form of Nathan's infant daughter, Emily. Savoy craftfully permits Emily's presence to draw Nathan and Daphene closer, instead of driving a wedge between them. Daphene finds Nathan's charm and sexiness impossible to ignore, and he does not deny his feelings for or toward her in any way. Pick this novel up at your favorite bookstore, go home, and listen to your favorite R&amp;B crooner and read this book. Like me, you will be thanking Deirdre Savoy for years to come."},{"Title":"Once And Again (Arabesque)","review":"Daphne Thorne and Nathan Ward were first seen in the book Always which is Ms. Savoy second novel. Nathan and Daphne have a past, one that Daphne Thorne would like to forget.As Once and Again opens, Nathan is getting married to his precious baby girl's (Emily) mother Monica. Daphne takes a seat in the back hoping not to be spotted by Nathan. Nathan receives a note from Monica stating she just can't marry him. Nathan is really relieved by this situation and at that moment vows to get his life together and stop living so carefree. He now has his daughter Emily to think about.Nathan then decides to ask Daphne to allow him to rent her basement apartment to him and his infant daughter. Daphne wonders what his motives are because Nathan is a famous singer with lots of money. This man could live anywhere, why here? She asks herself. Well, Daphne requests an enormous sum of month for renting the apartment. She felt that way she could get rid of him quick, but he agrees with no problem. Daphne would then try to stay away from the smooth talking Nathan Ward and try to guard her heart. She didn't want him to break it a second time. Nathan on the other hand had other ideas for Ms. Thorne. Nathan has always loved Daphne even in her teen years. He now wants to show her that he is not the man he used to be and that she is the only woman for him.To get a better understanding of the conclusions drawn of Mr. Ward's character read Always first before Once and Again.

The point of view is from their nurse, Lally, who took care of them when they were growing up. Stella, married to a German but living in America, is now a mother; Joan, also a mother, is a political activist; and Natalie is a wealthy widow. The girls have grown up and moved away, but one by one each returns. It's a novel in which women are the focal point of the story; each of the male main characters is weak, both physically and/or emotionally.This is a weird one, both in tone and story. As far as plot goes, there's not much of one; it's mostly just a flurry of activity as one sister leaves and another one comes. The narrator, Lally, isn't believable; she's far more educated than I imagine someone in her position might be, and she has less of a presence in the novel than some of the male characters. She claims that she loves the three girls, but you don't really get a feel for that in this book. Of the three sisters, Joan and Stella are the more interesting, since their role in the story is much larger than Natalie's. As far as the tone goes, though, it's atmospheric and brooding, which I enjoyed; I've never been to the West Indies, but I can imagine it very clearly through this book. You get this feeling of being suspended midair while reading this novel, much as the humidity of a summer afternoon hangs in the air. There's almost a repressive feeling to the tone of this novel sometimes, which works for it in a way.Nonetheless, this book is important in terms of its place in West Indian literature; apparently, Jean Rhys was influenced by this book in the writing of Wide Sargasso Sea. Unfortunately, I just didn't care much for The Orchid House."},{"Title":"The Orchid House (Transaction Large Print Books)","review":"This book is like a favorite painting at a museum one returns to see again and again.

Also lots of info on the Delta and SEAL operators midset, training, and day to day activities. It nicely fills out the &quot;Bush at War&quot; account of CIA-operators with boxes full of cash bribing warlords to shortterm alliances - and also details how the different warlords used different special forces teams to wage war on each other.The Prisoners-in-containers-masacre at Mazar-i-Sharif and the US involvment in that is only mentioned in a footnote.If you want to know how things started out on the ground in Afganistan, how few soldiers where on the ground, and lots of other details then this is for you. Also several other special forces areas of operation (Nigeria, Bosnia, Latin America etc are mentioned)The rest of the book is a nice insight in the sometimes strange combination of roles you get in distant parts of the world when US-soldiers act as representatives for the US - often filling the roles of police and diplomats, and the belief in washington that forces can solve most problems by training local armies.I personally feel the definitive book on the 319 men on the ground in Afganistan and their activities the first few months after september 11 is not yet written - Mark Bowden author of Black Hawk Down should with his connections make this his next project!"},{"Title":"The Mission: Waging War and Keeping Peace with America's Military","review":"It is obvious that Dana Priest learned a lot in the late 1990s and early 21st century traveling the world. If not for 9/11, she may have published a must read on American foreign and military policy. Unfortunately (for a lot of reasons), 9/11 did occur and it looks like Priest had to hurry back to make a lot of changes to account for it. She was unsuccessful. The book, by mistake, goes from capturing the post-Cold War/Gulf War/1990s/dominantmilitarilyanddiplomatically America to the post-9/11/waronterrorism/goeverywhereanddoeverything America but fails to really analyze that transition. Priest seems to treat the military's mission in the 1990s, which was largely diplomatic and peacekeeping with it's post-9/11 mission, which is largely military. For example, in the 1990s the Combatant Commanders had a great deal of latitude internationally. Given the new war on terrorism, is this still the case, or are more of their missions being dictated from Washington? Also, aren't they a bit busy fighting, or preparing to fight, wars for some of the activities Priest described as taking place in the 1990s? Priest also does a disjointed job managing time. With each chapter, it is not clear if we are before or after 9/11. Was the chapter in Nicaragua before 9/11, when the mission would be largely humanitarian, or after 9/11, when the mission would be a front in the war on terrorism? Priest also drops names with no context, for example Afghan President Karzai is suddenly on the scene, but where did he come from?All in all, Priest's book feels disjointed and this is probably by necessity. She worked long and hard on an interesting book about America's new place in the world in the late 1990s. When 9/11 took place, instead of turning it into a history book she tried to keep it up to date and ended up with a disjointed, somewhat confused book."},{"Title":"The Mission: Waging War and Keeping Peace with America's Military","review":"Not a bad read; informative through some of the vignettes. Priest writes well, but leaves lots of loose ends...and omits key info. She asserts the Military acted beyond its intended role due largely to the absence of action by other US Govt agencies. Why didn't the others act? Why the vacume? Was it funding? Failed political moves? Her depiction of the powers held by the CinCs is entertaining, but not news. She makes no suggestions or recommendations for alternative strategy.If you want a light, anecdotal read, this works. Beyond that, it falls short."},{"Title":"The Mission: Waging War and Keeping Peace with America's Military","review":"Unfortunately, this book helps explain why we will be having very limited peace-making success in Iraq and Afghanistan. Priest is very sympathetic to the military and, like many of its officers, she sees that the US has allowed virtually all other aspects of foreign policy to atrophy. This is in stark contrast to the 1950s, when the Marshall Plan rebuilt Europe. It is as if our leaders (in both parties) think that the free market will rebuild these nations by magic. Sad to say, that is not how it works."},{"Title":"The Mission: Waging War and Keeping Peace with America's Military","review":"The Mission provides for the reader not what some would call 'an intellectual challenge', nor does it challenge popular thought very much. The Mission is simply a researched backing of what we all knew already: our military is not comprised of compassionate humanitarians, nor should they be wholly responsible for making policy decisions.The book is not quite as fabulous as the hype, but its interesting.

I would say that the author also has a pretty liberal slant to her writting and up to one point acts as if the Serbian issue was the fault of our military. She discusses many problems with sending \\"solders\\" to be \\"cops\\" many times in the book. She offers no new insight it the ongoing troubles our solders have when asked to \\"police\\" a hostile citezenry.

She says that Genereal George Marshall achieved the rebuilding of Europe after WWII, and General Douglas MacArthur did the same for post war Japan.She feels that the military are used in place of civilian corps of aid workers -- a real peace corps -- to take charge of reconstruction in Afghanistan. She goes on to tell how, after the German surrender, General Dwight Eisenhower charged U. S. peacekeepers with a set of duties similar to those issued by Lt. Col. Michael Ellerbe's troops in Kosovo.Having access to all levels of the military, she goes to the countries involved, interviews locals plus our military men out in the field, and takes photos she uses liberally in this book. She traveled to twenty countries on her mission to write this book.Previously, she'd been the 'Washington Post's Pentagon expert; then she reported on the CIA. She has received awards for her 'distinguished defense reporting.' This book is in much detail on subjects of interest to her in particular but the American public have no inkling of and possibly would not agree that our money should be used in this manner when there are so many at home who are needy.

I'm persuaded that Dana Priest can show any of us wishing to understand the wide-ranging demands being made upon our armed services around the globe, upon the leaders of our military services, and upon our sons and daughters, grandsons and granddaughters in a lot of unbelievably demanding non-combat missions. Talk about 'mission creep!'Any effete, ignorant, intellectual snob who believes the officers and men and women of our military services are too dumb to walk and chew gum simultaneously needs to allow Dana Priest to disabuse such a deluded one from that error. From the interview I got a sense of character, commitment, and competency from this journalist and author. Within a few days C-SPAN will have the interview (video)and the transcript available free at www.....org. Also, after a few days, the audio will be available for a fee at www.....com.One might conclude that Americans and America's political leaders have now decided that our warriors should handle both the pointy end of the spear and the dirty end of the stick. Is this what being the world's lone superpower is all about?

Beyond this she concludes that this expanded role is sending the military to go where diplomacy would work. Lets analyze this point by point.1) The war on drugs. We have committed a few men and lots of equipment to fighting the war on drugs in S. America. We helped kill Pablo Escobar and we have ehlped spray the drug crops. Whats wrong with that? The drug lords have large armies and sophisticated weaponry, countries like COlumbia need our technology and know how to fight this very real war that once threatened to topple the COlumbian government.2) The Balkans. We committed men and the air force to help the albanians. Although I think this was a totally useless war that resulted in the murdering of tens of thousands of peaceful christians its apparent that Milosevik would not have budged without force. Sometimes we need force to accomplish goals, read Clauswitz's 'On War' and you will understand.3)Nigeria: The author is totally off base here. We dont have troops in Nigeria except to train the weak innefective corrupt Nigerian military. Thats the role of a Hegemon like us to help other countries defend themselves and keep order in their region.4) Afghanistan. THe author syas that we shouldnt have used our military in the war on terror. Well then whats the military for? If we cant fight those that murder our civilians then I guess we should just give up.5) Indonesia: We are helping crush the indonesian islamic militants who are murdering civilians and christians daily. THis is part of the war on terror. What good would a diplomat do in training foreign troops???A totally flawed book that basically says we should sit back and everytime our civilians are murdered we should say \\"how can we understand you better Mr. terrorist???\\""},{"Title":"The Mission: Waging War and Keeping Peace with America's Military","review":"Dana Priest writes very well. No matter the subject in this book -- whether its CINCs, Special Forces, or peacekeeping -- she captures your attention. She knows how to tell a story, and write colorful vignettes of the people in it. (Whether they're accurate or not, I have no idea, but they are fun to read.)Unfortunately, Priest wants her collection of well-written reports to mean something, and it is here -- whenever she moves from narrative to analysis -- that her book runs aground. Her main notion seems sound enough: that the U.S. military is too often in the front lines of diplomacy and peacekeeping, both because it is so strong and the U.S. diplomatic corps is so weak. This condition, she claims, attenuates both the U.S. military and U.S. diplomacy.But Priest's details do not support her thesis. In one chapter she writes about the confrontation between the new U.S. ambassador to Indonesia, Robert Gelbard, and the U.S. military commander of the forces in the Pacific, Dennis Blair, on what policy the U.S. should take with Indonesia's military over human rights abuses in East Timor. Gelbard wants to cut off military-to-military contacts while Blair wants to maintain them. Despite his lack of nominal authority over U.S. policy in Indonesia, Blair's view wins out.Priest thinks this is an example of how the U.S. military is able to overpower U.S. diplomacy because of the military's greater funding. But is it? In her summary of events, Priest makes clear Blair did not so much overpower Gelbard as outmaneuver him. Blair had to push the matter up to the National Security Council in Washington before it was finally decided in his favor. That kind of bureaucratic infighting is both common and acceptable to the policy-making process. One hardly needs to be well-funded to excel at it.Priest also recounts the sad tale of the rape and murder of a Kosovar girl by a U.S. military \\"peacekeeper\\". It is one of the centerpieces of her account in the last third of the book showing the ineffectiveness of the U.S. military at handling peacekeeping duties in Kosovo. At times she seems to suggest that U.S. troops should just be out killing things rather than trying to keep the peace. In this section, she even gives an anecdote of some U.S. troops in Kosovo who, while driving their tank through traffic, lose their patience, and demand to be given immediate passage through a red light.Priest seems too easily offended to imagine what the situation might have been like without U.S. troops on the ground in Kosovo. Unable to successfully carry out their mission of protecting the minority Serbs in Kosovo from reprisal attacks, the troops' presence at least gave some orderliness to what would have certainly been much worse if they had not been there. And it's very difficult to come up with a plausible scenario where U.S. diplomats would have been more successful at completing the near impossible mission the troops were given.An isolated rape case and some impatient troopers at a traffic stop shouldn't be emblematic of U.S. military peacekeeping efforts. It's unfortunate that Priest doesn't show a better appreciation of how difficult these missions are, and the unlikelihood that U.S. diplomats - even when armed with cash and executive support - would be any better at solving them."},{"Title":"The Mission: Waging War and Keeping Peace with America's Military","review":"The Washington Post's Dana Priest, one of the great reporters of our generation, in this book follows the famous storytelling guideline: show, don't tell. So to hammer home her point about the militarization of American foreign policy, she gives us a ground-level view of the officers and grunts thrust into roles as peacekeepers and nation-builders in places like Bosnia, Nigeria, Kosovo and Afghanistan. It is heartbreaking to see decent, smart, well-intentioned men such as Lt. Col. Michael Ellerbe and his subordinates stumble in tasks for which they are ill-prepared and for which they get little guidance from butt-covering or flat-out obstructionist policymakers in Washington. Priest is a great storyteller - fair and humane, with an eye for detail. Her account of Ellberbe's struggles in Vitina is probably the highlight of the book. Even the most ardent military supporter must be left wondering why we put 19-year-olds in such culturally sensitive assignments or how a monster like Staff Sgt. Frank Ronghi managed to work his way up the ranks without anyone noticing that he was a psychopath. Or why the military brass, taking on diplomatic clout that once belonged to ambassadors and regional specialists, is so susceptible to the charms of military strongmen like Indonesia's Wiranto and Pakistan's Musharraf. What's missing from The Mission - and what I wanted to understand - is how we got into this fix. Why did we starve our diplomatic corps and pile more and more responsibility on an overburdened military?"},{"Title":"The Mission: Waging War and Keeping Peace with America's Military","review":"This book is an attempt to look at the U.S. Armed Forces, primarily the army, and their mission in the modern world: how it's changed, what it can and can't do, and what effect the changing mission has had on the force itself, and its ability to fulfill its missions. Author Priest is primarily a reporter, though this doesn't really show in the book: it's clear that while some of this materiel probably appeared in shorter form at some point, she's rewritten everything into a style that befits a book.The author spends a good deal of time walking you around the American military establishment in the late 1990s, describing at great lengths Hugh Shelton and Anthony Zinni, and talks a lot about the C-in-Cs (pronounced \\"sinks\\", Commanders-in-Chief) and their roles in the modern world, trying to get nations to act in a more ethical fashion while working up plans for a reaction if those nations prove a threat to us our our interests. Priest describes them as modern proconsuls, with more retinue and equipment (and a better reception overseas) than most of the Cabinet, but strangely with their power very constrained at home.Next she discusses the various wars the U.S. engaged in between 1996 or so and 2002. This includes a short section on Afghanistan and a much longer one on peacekeeping in Southeast Europe, mostly Kosovo. My guess is the book was pretty much written when 9/11 happened, and she or her publishers felt it would be irrelevant if it didn't include something on the new war. Her view of peacekeeping in Kosovo is that the whole thing is fundamentally flawed because the army has become too cautious, and because the government can't decide on how to handle the new mission of peacekeeping itself. At one point she characterizes George W. Bush as a \\"dangerous idealist\\".There's a lot of interesting material here, but the author comes to some conclusions which don't seem warranted by the facts, even as she presents them herself. She seems to believe that the U.S. Army isn't going to be able to transform itself into a force that can handle peacekeeping missions, and that the government should keep it out of such a role. Instead she argues for a larger State Department involvement in these issues. While this makes sense, part of her logic--that peacekeeping is beyond the U.S. Army) is patently false, whether they've successfully done it in the past or not. Capability isn't the issue, it's knowledge and skill. Armies don't always start out good at performing new missions, and this one requires a rethinking of pretty much every aspect of warfare, so it's going to take a while.Second, there's the issue of accuracy. One other reviewr took her to task for improperly using army acronyms, and for other percieved inaccuracies. I, on the other hand, objected to her referring to Herat as an \\"eastern province\\" of Afghanisatn, when it's about as far *west* as you can go in the country without dodging Iranian Revolutionary Guards on their border. When I catch a simple error like that, I alwas wonder what else crept in, which I *didn't* notice.I enjoyed parts of this book, but other parts were of considerable concern to me. I would recommend it only for the specialist."},{"Title":"The Mission: Waging War and Keeping Peace with America's Military","review":"I read David Halberstam's \`War in a Time of Peace' and this seemed like a good continuation. Halbersam covers the Bush 1, Clinton period, in retrospect an idyllic period. This book transitions through 9/11, but really covers the development of the Combatant Commander for the US Military in the various areas of the world - Pacific Command, Central Command etc. It does cover the successful invasion of Afghanistan, it covers conflicts in Kosova, Columbia and relationships in the Middle East and Asia. It doesn't cover the Iraq invasion or subsequent failures.I was particularly struck by the contrast between the resources available for the military commanders in various countries, and the US ambassadors to the same countries. The commanders can have transport and material resources which are an order of magnitude away from the civilians, and therefore the local politicians/dictators get the message that the US relationship is mainly a military one. Priest gives a good overview, especially in the Kosovo, of the power and limitations of the military-only relationship. She also concludes that even the military must take some part in peace-making and low level nation-building, but the bigger story in that the US, by virtue of its size and power, must take a nation-development role if it hopes to avoid having a low-level war with the developing world for generations to come. In fact the situation has probably got clearly since, and the current debate about leaving Afghanistan and non-intervention in Syria, makes this book appear prophetic.Lastly there are remarkable portraits of Generals Zinni and Blair who were combatant commanders in the Central and Pacific commands during this time period. The contrast between their power and status when in the military and their post-military career is significant (though not mentioned in the book), Zinni was messed about when proposed but eventually not selected as ambassador to Saudia Arabia, Blair was later director of National Intelligence in the Obama White House, but was could not get along in that particular fishbowl and was fired in mid 2010."},{"Title":"The Mission: Waging War and Keeping Peace with America's Military","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and I learned a lot from it. It discusses multiple topics in multiple ways. It is a good read for a military historian minded person."},{"Title":"The Mission: Waging War and Keeping Peace with America's Military","review":"I can't speak to the factual inaccuracies some other reviewers have mentioned, but I can say that Dana Priest, by-and-large, is a terrible writer. She's a great reporter. I think her stories in the Washington Post are terrific, and obviously she's won a Pulitzer, so I would never take away from her reporting skills. But she should stick to writing articles, not books. And actually she should be banned from using adjectives altogether.Another reviewer mentioned her description of Anthony Zinni's hands as \\"cantaloupes\\", which struck me too. And did she really mean to write \\"gracious, snow-capped mountains?\\" When was the last time you saw a gracious mountain? In a scene where a Kosovar Albanian family is being evicted from their Serb-owned squatter digs, the mother is described as a large, brawny woman but, incongruously, wearing \\"pretty, peach lipstick.\\"And someone please tell Priest that \\"quipped\\" means \\"joked\\", not said, explained, uttered, muttered, complained, etc. Priest writes, \\"How can you have an army of 1.5 million, and 50,000 deployed, and it's nearly broke?\\" Shalikashvili quipped in an interview. \\"There's something that's crazy.\\" Then she has Wesley Clark joking, \\"Our level of resources doesn't match our level of national interest,\\" quipped Clark [watching from the sidelines as the situation in Afghanistan unfolded]. Surely everyone in the room was slapping their thighs with the hilarity of that quip.The book is also filled with typos. Writers! Editors! Please do your jobs."},{"Title":"The Mission: Waging War and Keeping Peace with America's Military","review":"_The Mission_ by Dana Priest is an interesting and through-provoking look at American foreign policy and the military's role in devising and implementing it.Since the end of the Cold War, \\"the Mission\\" for the American military has been to take the lead in managing world affairs, to fill in the tremendous gap left by civilian agencies. With little public debate or even awareness, the military \\"simply filled a vacuum left by an indecisive White House, an atrophied State Department, and a distracted Congress.\\" Whether turned to by policymakers or on its own initiative, the military has taken the lead abroad to fix problems, even those that are at their root ultimately political and economic in nature.In the first third of the book, Priest detailed how this state of affairs came to be. Part of the reason is the lack of resources of the civilian agencies that are supposed to be prominent in foreign affairs. Congress slashed the State Department budget 20% in the 1970s and 1980s, closing over 30 embassies and consulates and laying off 22% of the department's employees. Other organizations, such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Peace Corps suffer from similarly reduced budgets.In contrast, the Department of Defense has more resources and personnel than any other foreign-focused government agency. Most prominent in this area are the leaders of the U.S. military's regionally-focused unified commands, the regional commanders-in-chief or CinCs (pronounced \\"sinks\\"). The Defense Department divided the globe into five regional commands, each with its own regional CinC (Southern Command, which is basically Latin America, European Command, which is Europe, Turkey, and most of Africa and the former Soviet Union, Central Command, which is the Horn of Africa, Egypt, the Middle East, and the states of former Soviet Central Asia, Pacific Command, which is the rest of Asia and the nations of the Pacific, and Northern Command, which is North America). Each regional CinC has a budget twice that or more than that of the Cold War era, averaging $380 million dollars a year, lavish compared to that of civilian agencies. Additionally, each CinC has a dedicated long-distance aircraft, a number of helicopters, and access to in-flight refueling (only the Secretary of State has a dedicated aircraft, all other diplomats either fly commercially or hitch a ride on military aircraft). Each CinC has a much greater staff than other diplomats and civilian officials; compare the overworked staff of Foreign Service officers in an embassy, each likely with more than one task to perform, to the dedicated entourage that accompanies each CinC in the field along with the scores of admirals, generals, majors, captains, and colonels that he or she can deploy on diplomatic missions.Additionally, CinCs are not as prone to the turf battles civilian agencies engage in on foreign policy matters as they are stationed abroad and generally don't become embroiled in Washington insider politics. Also, changes in the Defense Department in years past have increased their relative power and importance at the expense of the once dominant uniform service chiefs, the CinCs replacing them as war planners and reducing these individuals instead to basically administrators at home.Priest wrote that General Anthony Zinni of Central Command joked that he had become a \\"modern-day proconsul,\\" a descendent of those who used to rule the outlying territories of the Roman Empire, bringing order and justice to the frontier.About a third of the book detailed one of the key tools of the military in foreign policy, the U.S. Special Operations Forces. The \\"tool of default,\\" sometimes more Peace Corps volunteer than soldier, even before September 11 they were deployed to 125 countries. Their presence is often the only agreed upon action among American policymakers, politicians hoping that Special Forces could forge strong, useful ties with foreign militaries, have a \\"rub-off effect,\\" encouraging foreign militaries to become more professional, less corrupt, and more respectful of human rights, and also take the lead in such tasks as settling local political disputes, coordinating foreign aid, and even repairing water systems. Priest detailed Special Forces at work in Afghanistan, Nigeria, Colombia, and Indonesia (and also spent another third of the book showing the actions of one CinC, General Wesley Clark, and his regular troops in Kosovo).Priest said that the prominent role of the military in foreign policy had both its good and bad points. She was complimentary of the military taking the lead in engaging with the states of the former Soviet Central Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, pushing for political reform in Kosovo, and fighting the drug war in Colombia. She was glad that such an effective agency was involved in foreign policy, given the lack of leadership and resources on the part of civilian agencies abroad, which severely disappointed her. However, she did have concerns. She implied that some CinCs tend to end up too closely identifying with the needs of some of the countries in their \\"CinCdom,\\" whether it was Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, or even China. She wondered to what extent military engagement can positively influence foreign military conduct and that if in fact it only allowed a corrupt and abusive military to simply become that much more efficient in prosecuting human rights abuses (as was the case with the Indonesian military's role in East Timor). Also, military engagement can send mixed signals or reward countries that are in violation of their citizen's human rights or otherwise acting contrary to American interests. The soldier on the ground, while the finest fighting man or woman in the world, is often not trained to solve political disputes, develop the economies of foreign countries, rebuild infrastructure, or engage in political reform, and she wondered if not some \\"more appropriate or nuanced engagement program\\" could be devised rather than having either special forces units deployed in small teams or groups of regular soldiers acting on their own initiative or with precious little guidance (as in Kosovo) trying to solve economic and political problems."},{"Title":"The Mission: Waging War and Keeping Peace with America's Military","review":"A very uneven book, with a fundamentally sound point the author makes: The military has more tools (and less will and training) than either the US State Department or the UN with respect to its impact on foreign governments. I say \\"uneven\\" because it starts as a documentary of what the Defense department structure is, worldwide, fails to complete its \\"explaining\\" for each sector, and then launches into \\"Kosovo in detail.\\" The grist for the last 1/3 of the book is probably the FOI act court transcript of the guilty sergeant, as well as reporting from the area.... but it completely fails to mesh with the front 2/3 of the book. The writing of the Kosovo 1/3 is beautiful. But the author fails to summarize the case, call for specific change, and ends with a whimper. I wish she had written a novel about Kosovo instead."},{"Title":"The Mission: Waging War and Keeping Peace with America's Military","review":"Overall, this book is a basic overview of the structure and operation of the US armed forces theater commands in the final days of their power and prestige, before the Bush administration centralized control, power, prestige, decision- and policy-making to Washington, DC. It is a view of the last great days of the regional Commanders-in-Chief, the CINCs, and their geographically-oriented theater commands of immense space, scope, power and influence.My criticism of this book is straightforward and simple, yet speaks directly to the overall character and accuracy of this work: Dana Priest is grossly incorrect in her statements, and therefore in the conclusions she makes, specifically in Chapter Ten, \\"The Indonesian Handshake.\\" I was intimately and directly involved in the entire episode, and it did not unfold as she describes.I quote from page 230: \\"Meanwhile, since January 1998, seven intelligence analysts at the 'Joint Intelligence Center Pacific' (JIC), the world largest military-intelligence center, in a windowless concrete building near (US Pacific Command CINC, Admiral Dennis) Blair's headquarters in Hawaii, had tracked the movements of Indonesian military and militia forces in East Timor and Indonesia. The Indonesia desk in the JIC had grown from one to nine persons and maintained a round-the-clock 'crisis action' mode. Over the preceding year, the analysts had received a tenfold increase in imagery and a fivefold increase in electronic collection. It was actually too much to process.\\"First of all, Priest blows the name of the institution she's describing. It's the Joint Intelligence Center Pacific, or JICPAC (now Joint Intelligence Operations Center, Pacific, or JIOC-PAC). Second, the \\"Indonesia desk\\" implies a single person monitoring this country. That was never the case, as a team of at least five analysts had always been assigned to maritime Southeast Asia. Suharto's 1998 fall had ramped up both Pacific Command's and JICPAC's attention to Indonesia, and the scheduled elections of mid-1999 and following East Timor referendum were anticipated months in advance, with commensurate analytical adjustments and assignments. Newly assigned to the Pacific Command intelligence directorate, I was detailed to JICPAC personally by the Pacific Command Director for Intelligence, Rear Admiral Rick Porterfield to assist in this effort.I was one of two US Army Foreign Area Officers (FAOs) assigned to this issue. I had just completed five years of training in Southeast Asia, with an International Studies masters degree, both Indonesian and Malaysian language training, and attendance at the 1998 class of the Malaysian Armed Forces Staff College. My partner was an Indonesian staff college graduate. We two Southeast Asia FAOs, both senior US Army majors, were the officers in charge. I was the Chief of the East Timor Crisis Cell for the entire period of the East Timor crisis, and I take immense pride in the work that I and especially my analysts performed during this period. This was the best analytical team I've ever worked with, experienced, highly intellectual, eager, motivated, and thoroughly familiar with the issue at hand, as well as all of the related regional and functional issues. They performed brilliantly in an extended crisis mode.At no time was the information we were requesting and receiving \\"too much to process.\\" Early on, Admiral Blair and Rear Admiral Porterfield recognized the potential for unrest and crisis, and supported all command activities to prepare for all possible outcomes, which we explored and analyzed continuously. I and my people updated both leaders daily with briefings, papers, and direct consultation, which increased in frequency, intensity and scope as events unfolded. We aggressively worked with all relevant and engaged national-level agencies and elements for our intelligence collection requirements, and based upon national-level reconciliation we were given what was available and appropriate to the situation. Yes, we were receiving increased collection and reporting, through all intelligence disciplines and channels, not merely the ones Priest cites. At no time was anything we were doing or being asked to do too much for us to process. At no time was the information that we were requesting from national-level intelligence collection too much for us to process. The support we received from the commanding officer of JICPAC, now Marine Major General Mike Ennis, was outstanding in every possible way. He supported our needs and actions personally and fully, a consummate professional and directly engaged commanding officer. Whatever resources and assets we requested, he personally attended to those needs, immediately.I challenge Ms. Priest to name the source(s) who provided such grossly incorrect information. I was present in Hawaii as she did her research there, and at no time were either my FAO partner or I contacted to discuss our roles in the crisis.I offer a highly telling anecdote which illustrates Ms. Priest's qualifications to write on this specific issue: Upon entering JICPAC for the very first time, Ms. Priest asked informally and good-naturedly of her escorts, \\"Why is the Australian flag flying outside?\\" Well, yes, both Pacific Command and JICPAC work very closely with our Australian partners, always have, and enjoy doing so immensely. But JICPAC does not fly a foreign flag from its quarterdeck. Of course, Ms. Priest had mistaken the Hawaiian flag with its Union Jack in the upper left corner as the Australian flag, telling the JICPAC intelligence specialists, researchers, and analysts more than enough about her familiarity with Pacific Command, showing a small yet true measure of the depth of expertise and background knowledge she brought to her work in the US Pacific Command theater.Bottom Line: Take this book as a historical account of the now-gone days of the power and prestige of the theater commands, a late 90s snapshot. That being said, the book is fundamentally flawed and factually incorrect, at least as far as Chapter Ten reads. I cannot speak for the remainder of the work, but my direct and intimate experience with the events she grossly incorrectly describes here is more than enough for me to dismiss this book in its entirety."},{"Title":"The Mission: Waging War and Keeping Peace with America's Military","review":"While the subject matter of this book is one of real interest to me, i almost gave up on this book a few times, purely on account of the writing style. Priest starts of with a dry academic introduction to the increasing role of the US military in International Relations, then soon into the book starts to write descriptions that are more like a fanzine, gabbling on about the individuals in the special forces. Every major character throughout the book is defined by physical characteristics (definately in no way adding to the narrative and which really has no relevance), and most non-Americans are described in stereotypical, depreciating terms.That said, Priest does do a good job of critiquing how the US has come to use its military for operations that it really is not designed or suited for. She manages to cover both the macro and the micro, giving examples of both strategic and tactical failure. While i believe that in some places she went a little easy on individuals that should be held more accountable for their actions (and often failure to act), this is an engrossing account of the subject matter. And by the end, i had overcome the writing style and came to admire the book."},{"Title":"The Mission: Waging War and Keeping Peace with America's Military","review":"After reading the book and reviewing it for a small town paper, I can say openly that I would rather not live in a country in which Dana Priest is a citizen. I am of course speaking of her (unfortunately representative) art, not of her views on war. This is without a doubt the worst-written book in the long history of text. To compare her with Ernie Pyle, as the dust jacket does, denigrates every war correspondent dating back to Thucydides.One excerpt from page 68, on General Zinni, will suffice (hopefully to discourage anyone from buying the book): \\"Zinni, however, walked straight through from his plane into the military airport's gold trimmed VIP lounge for an obligatory tea, plopping onto a down-filled settee covered with grubby pink satin. He wasn't yelling commands or convening with grubby subordinates in battle fatigues. Instead, he folded, his cantaloupe-sized hands in his lap and waited for cardamom tea to be served by dark brown attendants, former slaves larger and hairier than he.\\"I will be canceling my subscription to the Washington Post promptly - simply because she works for the paper. Dana Priest is everything wrong with the United States."},{"Title":"The Mission: Waging War and Keeping Peace with America's Military","review":"Ms. Priest's book is the latest of the political/journalistic genre to hit the racks on America's military. By my count, we've had David Halberstam's War in a Time of Peace, Eliot Cohen's Supreme Command, Max Boot's Savage Wars of Peace, Wes Clark's Waging Modern War, and several others in the past 1-2 years. As one of the Washington Post's star reporters, Ms. Priest certainly holds her own as a writer against these and other authors who have tried to explain the Pentagon and American foreign policy.The Mission tells a story from several levels which are often neglected. The author deployed to many of the places where American soldiers are involved in making foreign policy. She talked with these soldiers, their commanders, and the civilians they interact with in those places. From that vantage-point, Ms. Priest offers some salient arguments about the wisdom of using American soldiers as the vanguard of American diplomacy.I'm not sure I agree with Ms. Priest's penultimate argument -- that America's military is best kept for warfighting and not peacemaking. Since the Bosnia mission, I have echoed Gen. George Patton's sentiment that an ounce of sweat in peacetime was worth a gallon of blood in wartime. Better to experience some problems in these missions than to have to fight an all-out war in the Balkans or elsewhere. Nonetheless, Ms. Priest tells a compelling story. Her book stands as a piece of outstanding reporting, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Mission: Waging War and Keeping Peace with America's Military","review":"I finished Dana Priest's new book The Mission late last night, fueled by a pot of Peet's coffee. Great read -- I highly recommend the book. However, I'm not sure I agree with the author's major arguments. Ms. Priest argues, among other things:1. The U.S. military has gradually squeezed out diplomatic efforts abroad. This has occurred because military funding has remained constant while funding for diplomatic agencies (State Dept, USAID, Commerce, etc) has declined. I agree with the author's argument here, and think this is a dangerous trend. We ought to be engaging foreign governments, economies, and societies -- not just their militaries.2. In this vacuum, military commanders (the \\"CinCs\\") have initiated a number of \\"military diplomacy\\" programs. These include the use of Special Forces to train foreign soldiers, sharing of intelligence, promotion of foreign military sales, etc. In the absence of diplomatic workers from traditional agencies like State and USAID, these soldiers have become the biggest group of American government personnel operating abroad. I agree with the author here too; the soldiers have filled a diplomatic vacuum created by tremendous funding disparities. Ironically, this occurred even in the Clinton Administration, where human rights and international engagement had a kindred spirit in the White House.3. Soldiers are ill-trained and ill-equipped to do this job on behalf of America. Using soldiers abroad has led to a number of breakdowns in American foreign policy, such as the failure to establish a lasting and self-sustaining peace in the Balkans. Moreover, soldiers have contributed to conflict and human-rights problems in various ways, especially through the training of foreign troops. Here, I strongly disagree with Ms. Priest. U.S. soldiers have left a powerful and lasting legacy in places like Bosnia. They may remain there for some time. But the mission is a success story. 10 years ago, snipers dueled over the streets of Sarajevo, killing civilians with impunity. Today, civilians can walk through Sarajevo without fear. A similar, if not-yet-perfect, situation exists in Kosovo, where U.S. soldiers secure the future of Serbs and Albanians alike.Bottom Line: Soldiers don't make the best diplomats in the world. They should not replace political, social and economic diplomacy, as they have done because of funding disparities between the Pentagon and other federal agencies. But soldiers do a pretty good job at policing the peace. And while the American infantry isn't automatically ready to assume such missions, it can be trained to do so. With good training and leadership, American soldiers can make and keep peace in some of the world's worst places -- just as they have done in Bosnia and Kosovo. On occasion, mistakes will be made. However, American soldiers have proven their ability to stop the killing -- a goal that thousands of diplomats could never attain in the Balkans."},{"Title":"The Mission: Waging War and Keeping Peace with America's Military","review":"This book disappoints. After several people told me how great it was, I forked over the cash for the hardcover. The book was a quick read, but I was left with little of substance. Ms. Priest makes her whole argument in the first chapter, and the rest is just disconnected anecdotes, with little analysis of the various stories. For example, the book starts off talking about the proconsular role of the US Combatant Commanders (formerly known as CINCs until Rummie outlawed the term for everyone except George W.) but then inexplicably switches to various lengthy accounts of soldiers on the ground all around the world, culminating in an extensive -- but superficial -- depiction of the peacekeeping mission in the Balkans (and a long discussion of Frank Ronghi's rape of a young Albanian girl). Ms. Priest seems to alternately praise and blame the military for the current emphasis on the use of military force over diplomacy in US foreign policy, but neglects the issue of how this situation came about (why doesn't the State Department get the funding that DOD gets? why do civilians trust the military to solve all of their problems, and not their fellow civilian leaders & foreign service personnel?). Ms. Priest also spends an inordinate amount of time commenting on what various highranking military officers are wearing and the trappings of their office (Wesley Clark wears Burberry blazers, but Anthony Zinni likes Hawaiian shirts) as if this provides some deep insight into their psyches, and then glosses over substantive issues such as the apparent willingness of military officials to circumvent the law as they try to accomplish their missions. The book ends abruptly without a real conclusion. Ms. Priest also needed a better editor -- the book is full of typographical errors. I suspect this book was rushed into print. If you must read it, borrow it from the library."},{"Title":"The Mission: Waging War and Keeping Peace with America's Military","review":"I did not buy this book at first, having read and thoroughly enjoyed the many long articles the author contributed through The Washington Post, all of which comprise the middle two thirds of the book. However, at the recommendation of a retired Army Special Forces Colonel, I finally did buy it, and I am glad I did.Unlike the articles, which focused on the questionable use of Special Forces to train forces within repressive regimes around the world, from Colombia to Indonesia to Central Asia, the book more properly focuses on the complete lack of a US inter-agency planning process, the complete lack of a US means of coordinating actions and spending by all US agencies, and consequently, the complete lack of a US national security and global engagement strategy that is so vital to protecting America from attack and protecting American interests in a coherent and sensible fashion.While many critics read the book as if it were a glorification of the theater Commanders-in-Chief (CINC), and complain about the militarization of US foreign policy, a proper reading of this book clearly documents that the militarization occurs by default, as a consequence of the abject failure of the White House and the Department of State, neither of which, under either Clinton or Bush, are serious about global engagement.The military *works* (when it's not being frittered away by elective wars and occupations). What I see in this superb book is a solid foundation for thinking about three essential reforms to American national security: 1) the creation of a Presidential level inter-agency strategic planning and operational coordination process--no, the National Security Council is *not* capable of doing that; 2) the redirection of theater commands and staffs to become truly inter-agency, with men of the caliber of Bob Oakley and Mark Palmer serving as Peace CINCs with military four-star deputies; and 3) the doubling of the Special Operations Forces through the creation of a &quot;white hat&quot; &quot;armed peace corps&quot; that can deliver sewing machines, water purification, and the myriad of other things, including law enforcement under combat conditions.The book also does for Marine Corps General Tony Zinni what Ron Suskind's book &quot;The Price of Loyalty&quot; does for Secretary of the Treasury Paul O'Neil--it gives us some deep insights into Tony Zinni as one of the most extraordinary men to ever serve the American people, and a man who is clearly well-qualified to be one of the top five to ten people in any future Administration. Although I am a former Marine and know Zinni's reputation among Marines as both a warrior's warrior and a thinking general (there are very few of those, even in the Marine Corps), I had not realized the depth and breadth of his brilliance until I read this book. In particular I was moved by his intuitive demand for tribal-level intelligence, his focus on nuances and context at all times, and his insistence that a major aspect of US national security policy must be on the delivery of water, electricity, and the kinds of basics that can rescue failed states, legitimize governments, and create future democracies.I recommend that this book be read together with Kissinger's book on &quot;Does America Need a Foreign Policy&quot;, Boren's edited book on &quot;Preparing American Foreign Policy for the 21st Century&quot;, and Halperin's 1980's but still relevant book on &quot;Bureaucratic Politics &amp; Foreign Policy.&quot; Bob Oakley's edited work on &quot;Policing the New World Disorder&quot; and Mark Palmer's recent book on &quot;Breaking the Real Axis of Evil&quot; (44 dictators), and Joe Nye's two most recent books, will round out any intelligent person's feel for what needs to be done. This is a very high quality book, fully meriting five stars, because it explains both the harsh world we must engage, and the failure of our national policy process--regardless of who is President--in this regard."},{"Title":"The Mission: Waging War and Keeping Peace with America's Military","review":"Dana Priest is news reporter, and I know from first hand experience the impact her articles had on the U.S. military's ability to conduct training with some of our less than stellar allies. This book appears to be compilation of her various articles, and though it provides the reader with a number of entertaining and insightful war stories, her underlining theme that the U.S. military is not trained, thus not suited, to conduct peace keeping operations is not well supported. The truth is that the U.S. military does have a body of knowledge to support peacekeeping operations, and is very proficient at establishing a secure environment, which is what we would prefer to limit our tasks to. Our weakness is in the conduct of nation building (e.g. Iraq and Afghanistan), but again no one else is stepping up to the plate. The bottom line is that there is no other organization beyond the U.S. military (especially the U.S. army) that can effectively conduct peacekeeping . It almost seemed that Dana reached that conclusion herself as she writes about how inept the UN is, and how the French refused to get their hands dirty when people were being killed in the sector they were responsible for protecting. In both cases (and in others) she explains how the U.S. Army came to the rescue. I was hoping she would have interviewed a number of senior level policy members to get their perspectives and recommended solutions to the policy issues she identifies, but that didn't happen. So a book that could have been influential in shaping policy fell short. Nonetheless this book spins a few good tales, and will expose the reader to the challenges our military faces on a daily basis around the world."},{"Title":"The Mission: Waging War and Keeping Peace with America's Military","review":"--The reviewer is a peace operations analyst in Washington DC-As others have noted, this book contends that the U.S. military has become far too large a player in the creation and execution of U.S. foreign policy. This has happened for many reasons, and the book will tell you about them. This is the first important message, and it is true.The next important message is that U.S. soldiers do not in fact make good peacekeepers. That is not a criticism of the U.S. military, which is the best in the world at many things, and has proven it. In terms of fighting a war, which is what U.S. soldiers are trained to do, and want to do, they are the best. I think that Priest actually gives a good sense of that, in a very personal way that may not be too common in such books. Particularly so for the Special Operations soldiers that conduct so much of this execution of foreign policy.But U.S. soldiers are bad peacekeepers. Facts are facts, and historical fact is on my side here. The inability of the U.S. military to excel at peacekeeping has been proved in nearly every single military intervention conducted by the U.S. military during the past twenty years. We do post-conflict badly because U.S. soldiers are not trained for it, but since we have no other capacity for it, they must do it. We don't have a national police force, or paramilitary police, like France, Spain, Italy and others. We don't train our soldiers in the full spectrum of activity, from war-fighting to peacekeeping and policing, the way the Brits and others do, so we don't have special elements of the military to call upon either.Not only that, but the aftermath of conflict is much more messy than conflict itself. Nation building, stability operations, peace operations - whatever you want to call it, it is messy. Priest also gives, I think, a good picture of this. Unfortunately, the picture is a bit messy itself. It comes out jumpily throughout the book, rather than as a smooth flow. I think this will confuse rather than educate most people.This is a shame, because the message is important, critically so. The U.S. must start to build a better capacity to conduct operations in post-conflict scenarios. The U.S. military, if forced to continue to plug the gap, will do so only imperfectly. And that includes the sort of atrocious behavior that Priest took some time to discuss in later chapters. The point here, missed I think by some reviewers, is that this is a common problem. And it is created, in part, by forcing people to do something they didn't sign up for and don't really want to do.This is a great book. We must do better at post-conflict. This book tells you why."},{"Title":"The Mission: Waging War and Keeping Peace with America's Military","review":"The Mission, a book penned by Dana Priest, focuses on a few different, yet somehow intertwined, ideas involving the military and foreign policy. Priest is trying to enlighten the readers on how the military has gained power in the execution of foreign policy, how these powers exceed the scope of the military training, and how the CinC's (Commanders in Chief) have seemingly grown as powerful as most any political figure remaining in the United States.The first of these components is the idea that the military has been brought into situations that exceed the scope of their training. The issue at hand has been addressed several times throughout the book. One example of such a situation was the peacekeeping mission in Kosovo. Soldiers were sent into the Balkans with specific rules of engagement that prevented them from doing the very task they were trained to do, fight. In the end, the mission backfired and the people they were trying to aid, turned into the people they should be trying to stop. The cause of the failed mission was a lack of training and experience in unconventional military duties. Different examples of this misuse of the military are more extreme. There are situations when special forces have been used for nation building in Afghanistan and Iraq, and to help distribute humanitarian aid in countries such as Nigeria and Somalia. Forces were even expanded as far out to include the war on drugs in Colombia.The second portion of the review covers the idea that the Commanders in Chief, along with the military as a whole, have become more powerful than imagined in the execution of foreign policy. The power instilled in these CinC's came through trust, dependencies and their overwhelming budgets. This idea, not unlike the other, is displayed in several situations throughout the book. The majestic powers of the CinC's began with Priest's discussion of General Anthony Zinni of U.S. Central Command, who was in control of all military affairs in much of the Middle East and through parts of Africa. There, Zinni was not only in charge of the military operations, his duties entailed most diplomatic missions as well. This book follows the career of Zinni through the flexing of his controlling muscle in the Persian Gulf and up into central Asia with Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, and others. Other CinC's that Priest addresses include: Admiral Dennis Blair, CinC of Pacific Command, General Wesley Clark, CinC of European Command, and General Charles Wilhelm, CinC of Latin America. After September 11, 2001, the CinC's gained much power with the approval of their sworn enemy, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. He even added an extra CinC to the mix; the U.S. Northern Command, which was to reign over Canada, Mexico, and the United States.Priest composed this book with great talent and thirst for knowledge. The interviews she gained access to during the creation of this book are of highest quality. The data gives such thorough insight into the roles that the military played during various missions to a point that a reader would be pressed to find a flaw in her research. The main quarrel that any reader would have with Priest is that one has to weed through all of the brush to find the ideas that she is trying to highlight. The information is all very important, however, it seems to fulfill more of the entertainment factor of the book instead of keeping her eye on the ball. The various anecdotes that are scattered throughout the book make it hard to focus on what the military was actually doing. For instance, Priest tries to bring the reader into the text by not only introducing new characters, but telling a large sum of their history. However entertaining it is, the reader does not need to know that General Wilhelm was born in North Carolina or that his father was a lawyer. On the same note, it is not vital to the book that the reader knows every adventure that General Zinni embarked on during his time in Vietnam. So, while the information is very thorough, there is far too much filler added for entertainment."},{"Title":"The Mission: Waging War and Keeping Peace with America's Military","review":"I was intrigued by the subtitle: \\"Waging War and Keeping Peace with America's Military\\" after trying to think of how many countries (dozens) the United States has committed its military forces to over the past couple decades, and why. Dana Priest had top-level access to various military personnel, visited a number of the countries she discusses, and from this creates an informative document around a major issue confronting our military/civilian leadership; namely, what is \\"The Mission\\"? She is mostly uncritical (contrary to the impression of previous reviewers who sound offended by the subject matter, as though the military were too holy a subject for any civilian to tackle) and highly complimentary, and informative about our soldiers, and CINc's (Commanders in Chief/theatre command generals). I think the book would've benefited from a more personal, opinionated account after having done all this research, however, like Mark Bowden (\\"Black Hawk Down\\", \\"Killing Pablo\\") she's a reporter at heart and keeps it pretty straight-forward.\\"The Mission\\" raises fundamental questions about our government's ever-changing world-concept, and the role of our military in advancing goals better suited for diplomats and the UN. More specifically, she brings up the trend of using our forces for \\"peace-keeping\\" & \\"nation-building\\" missions which they're obviously not well suited for (at this time). Yes, our military is the best at what it does in most cases, but it has serious limitations when we attempt to use it for unclear post-war objectives in countries with broken infrastructure. She provides detailed accounts of Kosovo, where one Lt. Col. wanders the streets and is reminded of his experience in the 1991 debacle of Somalia. There is a brief and disturbing account of an Army soldier who raped and murdered a young Albanian girl, and details of other negative encounters between young, un-worldly American soldiers and their Serb & Albanian \\"protectees\\". One interesting chapter deals with the complex world of a female Albanian-American translator trying to fit in with her fellow American soldiers. Priest also touches on the nature of covert, Special Ops. military training and relations with various troubled countries such as Colombia, Nigeria, and Indonesia.Fundamental questions arise throughout the book: What exactly is nation-building, and should we be engaged in it? Have we already abandoned Kosovo and Afghanistan? Do we have the funds, military resources, will-power, justification, or desire to play international policeman? Will we keep our promises to the peoples we set out to protect? The answers aren't here, but \\"The Mission\\" sets the table from which this crucial discussion will definitely continue."},{"Title":"The Mission: Waging War and Keeping Peace with America's Military","review":"Dana Priest is a well-respected journalist with the Washington Post and a frequent guest on NBC's &quot;Meet the Press.&quot; She specializes on military and intelligence topics, so it was with great interest that I read her book &quot;The Mission&quot;. Her thesis, that the US military is playing an ever increasing role in US foreign policy matters and that the nation is becoming dependent on the military's presence in foreign affairs, could not be more timely.She presents her argument via a series of vignettes which cover senior military leaders as well as a broad spectrum of recent military operations. She primarily writes from the military's perspective and its impact on foreign policy. The profiles of the four, 4-star commanders provide the reader with a sense of the situation each commander faced in 1999 and how their ideals influenced not only their area of responsibility but also our foreign affairs. Priest chronicles our military activities with examples that range from major operations in Afghanistan and the Balkans, our covert drug war in South America, and the relatively unnoticed actions in Nigeria and Indonesia. Her stories capture the military's struggle to achieve success across the entire spectrum of operations.She does a good job of stating her argument and offers varied examples of where the military is setting the foreign policy agenda. Unfortunately, the book does little more to move into an analysis of US foreign policy decision making beyond the military's impact nor does it make recommendations for changes to better the current situation. The book seemed to be more of a compilation of &quot;reports from the field&quot; than an analysis of foreign policy decision making and the military's role in it. I suppose the author's goals and my expectations were decidedly different but I expected more from this book.I feel her point would have benefited from a comparison of the State Dept's and the DoD's role in US foreign policy making. She also needed to consider the contributions of non-governmental organizations to the foreign policy equation. Additionally, if the author thinks we are becoming reliant on the military to conduct foreign policy, she should include recommendations to counter that reliance. I enjoyed reading the well-written vignettes, thought this is a great introduction on the topic of political-military relations as it impacts foreign affairs, but would like to see more analysis and less story-telling.A worthwhile read."},{"Title":"The Mission: Waging War and Keeping Peace with America's Military","review":"I first read this book in March of this year while the invasion of Iraq was taking place.Many of the points which Dana Priest made in this book have been borne out by subsequent events.The big problem that the US faces in Iraq is that not only does it want to get rid of Sadaam Hussein's regime (which it has),but it also wants to decide what government the Iraqis will have in the postwar period.As Ms Priest points out in the book American troops are not suited either by training or temperment for peace-keeping.Nor are they suited for nation-building.In the meantime while they are supposed to be doing this they also have to be on alert against possible attacks carried out against them by a hostile population.Is it any wonder then that at the moment things aren't going that well in Iraq? This is what I took to be the main point of the book:that too often politicians use the military as a bandaid solution to fix difficult problems.Got a problem with ethnic violence in Bosnia and Kosovo, send the military in to deal with the problem.Civil war in Liberia, let's send the Marines in to do the job.Can't find other countries that are willing to contribute troops to re-build Iraq, well then we'll just use the troops we already have there to do the job.And so on and so on.It's unfortunate that not enough people have read this book because it adresses some serious issues concerning America's military that the American people need to look at."},{"Title":"The Gospel of Mark (The Daily Study Bible)","review":"First read this book in my early thirties.

It let me know a lot more about what was going on during the life of Jesus Christ. so that I could understand the Gospel in much greater depth than I ever had before.I would greatly recommend this book for use as a suppliment to the Bible for study groups or individual study of the Scriptures. I also think that this book is good for both a historical and/or a theological study of the life of Jesus Christ. It really helps to make sense of what Mark had to say by reviewing what the people knew and thought during the time that Jesus was among them so that we could view the Gospel from that perspective as well as what it means to us today.I think that every Christian will find that they will learn a great deal from this book. As a Christian I feel that this book should be on everyone's must read list."},{"Title":"The Gospel of Mark (The Daily Study Bible)","review":"Barclay is one of the most insightful commentators of the New Testament. Written about 50 years ago, much of the background information and schalorship in his commentaries are outdated. Sometimes he stretched historical/cultural background too much to explain the text. Conservative readers should be aware that Barclay was a universalist (one who believes that all people will be saved ultimately). He does not believe in miracles and tries to explain them away in his commentaries on the Gospels. However, his comments on the relevance of the Bible can still be very valuable for discerning readers.Advanced students would not need be told where to find more updated scholarship on NT Bible. Beginning students should get Tom Wright's \\"Mark For Everyone\\" instead of Barclay's. The volume on Mark in NIV Application Commentary series by David Garland is an excellent choice for slightly more advanced students.

I highly recommend it if you want to understand the Bible more deeply and fully. Start with Mark, then decide from there. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because some people might find it a bit tedious.

Some of the research is a little dated and some of the references are no longer familiar. But they still bring the reader what they have always brought. They bring a brilliant, coherent, inspiring vision of what the New Testament writers meant and how their works fit together. Putting aside the nitpicking about details that fuels professional scholarship, Barclay's commentaries bring the ordinary person into contact with the New Testament authors in a very special way. This is abundantly true of the commentary on Mark. Barclay highlights for us of the urgency which drove the author and the graphic nature of his portrayal of events.This re-editing of the original removes or alters a fair amount of material which made the volume seem more dated than it really is. The views of an earlier generation about gender roles and other cultural prejudices have been minimized. When I heard about the project, I feared for the literary integrity of Barclay's work, but, actually, the commentary on Mark has benefited from tighter editing and reads even more smoothly than it did before. Comparing it to the original, which I also have on my shelf, I find that I definitely prefer the new edition.So, five stars and three cheers for a new edition which even earns the label, \\"improved.\\""},{"Title":"The Gospel of Mark (The Daily Study Bible)","review":"Great explanation and background of all the passages - good daily devotional.

The seller was both prompt and honest.Ruth Root"},{"Title":"PYRAMIDS (DISCWORLD)","review":"First off, it's well known that Sir Terry is quite incapable of writing a bad book. This one, however, falls right in the middle of the pack: Perfectly readable, very funny in places, and with some pointed points to make regarding the anti-progressive nature of religion (a recurrent theme of Pratchett's), . . . but still, on the whole, and not to put too fine a point on it, not nearly as engaging as his stories about the Witches or the City Watch.The setting this time is the long, narrow river-following desert country of Djelibeybi whose principal function is to act as a buffer between two other nations, once minor but now major indeed. Moreover, it's littered with 7,000 years worth of pyramids, all of them flaring off their stored-up energy every night. Teppic is the son and heir of the current pharaoh and, since his father thinks he ought to see something of the world before being locked into the stultifying job of king for the rest of his life, he's spent the past seven years at the Assassin's School in Ankh-Morpork. (Well, it does provide the best education available.) And he does surprisingly well there, but then, just as he has passed his final exam -- and you can imagine what that's like -- his father dies and Teppic is yanked back home. Being an earnest young man and inexperienced, Teppic decides he ought to be a man of the people -- only to discover that that's not what the people want at all. And he discovers that Dios, the High Priest of Djelibeybi, actually runs things to suit himself and will not be denied. There's his late father's pyramid, for instance. Even though he doesn't really approve, and doesn't think his father would have, either (too right he didn't -- and doesn't), Teppic finds himself ordering a pyramid to be built twice as large as the standard model. Ptaclusp, the contractor whose family has been constructing tombs for royals for many centuries and not being paid for it, has his own problems, with one twin son who is an accountant and another who is an innovative architectural engineer. \\"Innovative\\" is not an attitude that's well thought of in Djelibeybi. But that huge pyramid is going to be a problem for the entire river valley, because the reason the country has gone on and on for thousands of years without ever changing is that \\"pyramids are dams in the stream of time.\\" That way, a dying king tucked inside will live forever -- more or less. And what the pyramid releases at night is the time it has accumulated during the day -- provided it isn't too big.The author's characters, as usual are droll and a lot of fun, especially Ptraci, the luscious handmaiden. \\"Ptraci didn't just derail the train of thought, she ripped up the rails, burned the stations, and melted the bridges for scrap.\\" And then there's You Bastard, one of the greatest mathematicians on Discworld and deadly with a wad of half-digested cud. Pratchett is also, as always, adroit with the language, dropping original metaphors and similes on almost every page. One old lady is \\"as tough as a hippo's instep,\\" while another is \\"as self-centered as a gyroscope.\\" And Teppic's encounter with the Sphinx is almost Monty Python-ish. Still, the narrative seems forced at times -- not something one usually encounters in a Discworld novel. And the first part of the story, about Teppic's experiences with training as a black-clothed assassin, while quite good in itself, has nothing really to do with the rest of the book."},{"Title":"PYRAMIDS (DISCWORLD)","review":"If indeed any one of Terry Pratchett's Discworld books can be termed any more 'unusual' than the others...Pyramids is more or less of a one-off among Discworld books, not fitting into any of the 'arcs' which include most of the others (ie: Wizards, Witches, or the Watch). The writing style is pure Pratchett, and his inimitable humor is just as evident in this novel as it is in any of the others. I would say that if you liked any of the books dealing with the History Monks of Wen, you will probably enjoy Pyramids."},{"Title":"PYRAMIDS (DISCWORLD)","review":"Pyramids represents something of a detour in Pratchett's Discworld series. The principal action takes place in the heretofore unfamiliar land of Djelibeybi, located in northern Klatch across the Circle Sea from Anhk-Morpork. This is a unique realm of the Discworld, two miles wide and 150 miles long. It is often referred to as the Old Kingdom for a very good reason-it is quite old, over 7000 years old in fact. It is a desert land whose pharaohs are obsessed with pyramid-building; besides bankrupting the country, this obsession has also had the unforeseen consequence of keeping the country firmly entrenched in the past. Pyramids, you see, slow down time, and there are so many pyramids in Djelibeybi now that new time is continually sucked in by them and released nightly in flares. In a land where the same time is reused daily, it comes as something of a surprise when the pharaoh Teppicymon XXVII decides to send his son Teppic outside of the kingdom to get his education. Just after becoming a certified, guild-approved assassin, young Teppic is called upon to return home after his father suffers the unfortunate consequences attendant upon thinking he can fly. Three months into his reign, he basically loses his kingdom-literally. The Great Pyramid being built for his father's mummy is much too big, and eventually it causes the temporal dislocation of Djelibeybi from the face of the Discworld. Accompanied by the handmaiden Ptraci, whom he rescued from certain death, and a camel whose name would be edited were I to state it here, Teppic must find a way to restore his kingdom back to its proper place and time above the ground. The ordeal is only complicated further by the fact that all of the land's dead and thousands of gods suddenly have appeared in person, acting as if they own the place.While its unusual setting and the fact that it features characters seen here and nowhere else makes this novel seem a little different from its fellow Discworld chronicles, I must admit it is quite an enjoyable read. Pratchett ingeniously incorporates ideas and practices from ancient Egypt and ancient Greece: pyramids, mummification, Greek philosophers, the Trojan War and its Horse in particular, etc. Teppic is an enjoyable enough character, but we never seem to delve deeply enough to understand him properly. I loved the brash handmaiden Ptraci and her fearless contempt for tradition. All of the dead pharaohs are quite funny, particularly in terms of their opinions on an afterlife spent shut inside a tomb inside an escape-proof pyramid. The subplot featuring the history of warfare between two neighboring kingdoms really helps make this novel a true winner. Perhaps the most interesting thing to be found in these pages, though, is the actual identity and thought processes of Discworld's greatest mathematician. There is also much to amuse and delight fans of temporal dislocation theories-the pyramid builders make many incredible discoveries in the process of building the Great Pyramid, not the least of which is a means of utilizing the structure's innate time loop to call forth several different selves to help make sure the job is finished in the allotted time.Even though this book is funny and satisfying enough to stand on its own, I would not start my Discworld reading with it. Aside from Teppic's time spent in Anhk-Morpork learning to be an assassin, the action takes place outside the much more familiar lands we encounter time and again in the other novels. Of course, Pratchett devotees will want to read it for the very reason that it acquaints us with a strange, otherwise unfamiliar section of the Discworld."},{"Title":"PYRAMIDS (DISCWORLD)","review":"This is a fairly early Terry Pratchett (number seven I believe) and demonstrate his unique ability to lampoon nearly everything at once. We find ourselves with Teppic the heir to throne of Djelibeybi, who has been sent off to Ankh-Morpark to learn a decent trade. Or rather, a lucrative indecent trade of inhumation (otherwise called assassination). Djelibeybi has been building bigger and bigger pyramids for some 7,000 years and is way behind on its payments. Somebody has to bring home a paycheck.Teppic has mastered all the requisite skills (tucking equipment everywhere, wearing black clothes, swinging from buildings, etc) and now, in a flash of accidental good luck, he has passed his final exam. At this crucial moment, Teppic's father develops a sudden urge to fly and our young assassin must return to the world's most tradition bound kingdom (no toilets, no mattresses, and no aqueducts). Having spent years in the most corrupt city on Discworld Teppic must wear a very heavy mask, sleep on stone beds, and be a very bored god. And bankrupt the kingdom building his father's pyramid.Pyramids are the problem. Since each one has to be bigger than the last, they have long since achieved enough mass to bend light and absorb time. This keeps their occupants alive, but the accumulation of present and future time has to be vented off nightly. The reason Teppic's country is so stodgy is that all the present and future is being shot off into space and they only have the past left to live in.Now Teppic decides that his father's tomb will be an order of magnitude larger than its predecessors, and all quantum breaks out. Even before it is finished is becomes a major time hazard and suddenly, in one great big pffft, it folds Djellibaybi into a Hilbert space and leaves Teppic with a camel sized headache. Needless to say this irritates the heck out of Teppic's father (dead or not), all the mummified kings, and a large number of loose gods.Pratchett uses this opportunity to mach fun of organized religion, solipsistic scientists, relativity, archaism, relatives, politics, war, and mathematicians with one or two humps and four stomachs. He spares no one, and it is great fun for the reader. His ability to pull a horrible pun out of thin air is unequalled. Pratchett's message has always been that life is too important to take seriously, By all means hunt this up, you'll be mummified laughing."},{"Title":"PYRAMIDS (DISCWORLD)","review":"and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.On earth this passage from Genesis describes the Tower of Babel. But on Discworld it just may describe the proud towers (pyramids actually) built by the people (slaves actually) of Djelibeybi in Terry Pratchett's seventh Discworld book, Pyramids. Pyramids is an excellent addition to the Discworld series and, like just about every other volume in the series is both hilariously funny and thought provoking.Teppic is the heir to the throne of Djelibeybi. For each generation going back as far as anyone can remember the new king, upon the death of his father, builds a pyramid that will serve both as his tomb and an eternal monument. This would be fine but for the fact that each succeeding generation is expected to build a monument that is greater than the last. This keep Djelibeybi locked in a perpetual financial crisis and has caused each succeeding ruler (Pharaoh) to lead a life that is overly regimented to the point of insanity, or at the very least officious inanity.Teppic's father, Teppicymon XXVII, seems to want a bit more from his son then a life of idleness sitting on the throne and when the story opens we find Teppic going off to \`college' in this instance the famed school run by the Guild of Assasins on Ankh-Morpork. No sooneer does Teppic pass his Assasin's exit examination (a typical Pratchett tour de \`farce') then his father dies and Teppic is called back to assume the throne.Teppic chafes at the constraints put upon him and his life by Dios, the nation's chief holy man and enforcement officer. Dios is the type of horrifically evil bureaucrat who, smitten with a bit of power, tends to be the person you must deal with at the Department of Motor Vehicles or at the bank or at the office who's biggest skill is the ability to say \`NO!!!' in an infinite number of ways. The rest of the story follows Teppic's adventures as the power of the new pyramid built to honor his father causes havoc with the time-space continuum and which in turn threatens to engulf the region in a disastrous war.Pyramids is the 7th in the Discworld series. It is far enough along in the series for the reader to see Pratchett really hitting his stride. You can see the beginning of themes that he develops with great success in later volumes, particularly in his masterful Small Gods. Pratchett's treatment of the Ephebian philosophers is hilarious. As portrated by Pratchett these neo-Athenian philosophers would fit in perfectly with those Australian philosophers named Bruce made famous by Monty Python. The presence of mathematically inclined, nasty-tempered camels was also drawn to great effect. I'll never see another camel again without wondering whether it is performing advanced calculus.Devoted fans of Terry Pratchett are likely to have read Pyramids already. However, for newcomers to Pratchett this is probably not the best place to start. I think in order to appreciate Pyramids to the fullest it is probably advisable to read at least one or two earlier Discworld stories (Color of Magic or Light Fantastic would probably be best) before getting to Pyramids. Needless to say, as someone who was made his way through about two thirds of the Discworld books, it is well worth the time and effort to get invested in the entire series."},{"Title":"PYRAMIDS (DISCWORLD)","review":"Recently I became a fan of Terry Pratchett, after having read The Color of Magic. I continued to read the series in order, and I just finished reading Pyramids. Immediately I liked this book, because I found the Assassins Guild fascinating, and I thought Teppic was an interesting and cool main character.The plot goes something like this: Teppic was born in Djelibeybi (a sort of ancient Egypt-like country) and was sent to Ankh-Morpork when he was 12 to become an assassin. Just after Teppic passes the final test, his father dies and he has to return to Djelibeybi to be king. When he arrives, he realizes a pyramid has to be built for his father, and he orders that it be the biggest pyramid in the valley, with labyrinths and statues and so forth. But the pyramid is -so- big and powerful that it somehow alters the fabric of time and space, and puts Djelibeybi into its own little dimension, separate from the outside world. It's now Teppic's job as king (and a god) to make things right, even if the High Priest likes to twist everything he says.Thrown into the mix is the mysteriously old High Priest named Dios; the best mathemetician in the world (a camel); a handmaiden named Ptraci; the gods coming to life and freaking everyone out; and thousands of dead 'ancestors' lurching around and complaining about their pyramids. The story is humorous, as are all of Pratchett's books, and the characters are very likeable. And for those of you who like romance, there is definitely some of that (which I was glad of).Some reviewers complain that the plot is thin and the characters are under-developed, but I must disagree. So far this is my favorite Discworld book, and I'm pretty sure it will stay that way. This is well worth buying, even if you're not a huge Discworld fan!"},{"Title":"PYRAMIDS (DISCWORLD)","review":"I've read many books from Terry Pratchett's Discworld series, and Pyramids remains one of my favorites because of the unique setting. Most of his Discworld books takes place in the city/state of Ankh-Morpork. Pyramids, set in a Discworld-type Ancient Egypt, Djelibeibey, or &quot;Child of the Djel&quot;, Teppic struggles with the problems of being a teen-aged god. And Dios, the power hungry high priest isn't making matters any easier. It's a battle between old men, set in their ways, and the new boy king who's going to bring Djel kicking and screaming into the Centry of the Fruitbat! I also liked how the author used a teenager for a hero. A great book, and I'd highly recommend it to any Pratchett fan."},{"Title":"PYRAMIDS (DISCWORLD)","review":"So my friend tells me about this author, Terry Pratchett, who in my fifth decade I have never heard of. And my friend is pushing the likes of Going Postal, Thief of Time, Guards Guards, and others of Prachett's books. One wonders if my friend knew that there was a \\"proper\\" starting place into Pratchett's Discworld. :PI also decided to go against the, er, grain and enter Discworld not from \\"the beginning\\" (The Colour of Magic) but with Pyramids. So that my kids - avid fans of ancient egpyt (pharaohs and priests, tyrants and the titular ptopic: pyramids) - might take an interest in a writing style they've not encountered before: satire. Throw in an Assassins' Guild (NINJAS!) and I think I've, or Pratchett, has clinched the deal.(Yes, I realize that Prachett has written two or more trilogies for \\"younger readers,\\" including The Bromeliad Trilogy and The Tiffany Aching trilogy -- both of which I also bought for the kids and look forward to reading myself.)And although several reviewers have stated that Pyramids is not the best place to start the Discworld series, I say Phtooey. The book has a cast of memorable characters, both major and minor: Teppic, Dios (the high priest), Pteppicymon XXVII, Ptraci, Chidder, even Cheeseworth, Hoot Koomi (the double faced priest) Pthagarom, Mericet (the master assassin), Endos (the attentive listener), the tyrants of Ephebe and Tsort (read: ancient Greece and Troy), DEATH HIMSELF. And, of course, the greatest mathematician in the world.I find the book a page turner of the first Tsort. From the characterizations of Dios and Pteppicymion, the early exploits of Teppic at Assassins' School to his summons to his father's kingdom and his innocent consorting with Ptraci......I was surprised most of the fantasy elements of the story could better be classified as science fiction (i.e., Pyramid Power run amuck), but I also realize I wasn't reading The Colour of Magic, The Light Fantastic or other of the Rinceworld novels.The satire of Pyramids is brilliant. The writing style begs to be read aloud, and I found myself doing so at great lengths even though no one was around (probably a good thing) until my throat got sore (probably a bad thing). Read aloud it becomes sort of a Monty Python in print, except you're no longer dealing with print. Additionally, the book has great \\"re-play value,\\" in that it can be read more than once for amusement. I am going to have to read it a second time to pick up some of the subtleties I missed.The plot is light but fantastic. (The underlying satire probably more enjoyable). Nevertheless the story races to the climax, where all the major players: the gods, the priests, the undead ancestors of -what - Djelibeybi (\\"Jelly Baby,\\" a popular British confectionary), the King's Embalmers (one whose name is Dil, who pickles the dead kings), the Pyramids' architects (Ptaclusp and his twin sons Ptaclusp IIa and IIb), and Teppic himself collide in a rousing attempt to rouse the Kingdom of Djelibeybi from the slumber of its having fallen through a fractal in the space-time warp. Ah: pyramid power: don't ever underestimate it!And don't underestimate Pyramids. In fact, I am loath to leave the world of Pteppicymion and Djelibeybi for the wider world of Ankh-Morpork and \\"Discworld proper.\\" (I kind of rince to think about it.) Where Ive heard there are such things as dragons and wizards. I guess it's great my kids are as entranced by those topics as well, having read Tolkien. Now let's see if they can understand and enjoy Pratchett as much."},{"Title":"PYRAMIDS (DISCWORLD)","review":"It is obvious from reading other reviews that readers of Terry Pratchett each have their own particular favourites, and these can vary wildly. \`Pyramids' was the first of his books that I read and even though I have now read most of them it remains, in my opinion, one of the best. What did I like about it? Well, the concept of a king who was actually trained to be an assassin (rather than one who took on the role to get there) was a good start. A kingdom called Djelibeybi (you have to say it aloud) that remarkably resembles Egypt, but skewed in the way that only Pratchett's Discworld series can, was also clever. Add to that swipes at pyramidology, the way some of religions followers abuse the power they get from it, and a teenage hero concerned about all the normal things that teenagers are concerned about, and you get a funny book. Perhaps my favourite bit is that camels are the smartest creatures on the disc (maybe you have to have met some camels to really understand that). If you are a fan of Terry Pratchett, there is a fair chance you will like this book. If you've never read him before, buy \`Pyramids' and prepare to laugh."},{"Title":"PYRAMIDS (DISCWORLD)","review":"Pyramids is yet another Discworld novel from Terry Pratchett, though it doesn't take place in the same setting as the other novels in the series. Instead, it takes place in \\"The Old Kingdom,\\" and is take-off on ancient Egypt. How does it fare?Let's call it a triple. It's wonderfully funny, and definitely a 5-star book. It only suffers in comparison to the other Discworld books that I've read, in that it takes awhile before it's laugh out loud funny. The whole book is definitely worth reading though, and your patience will be rewarded in spades once things actually start happening.The book is about Teppic, the son of the king, who has gone to Ankh-Morpork to learn to be an assassin. The first section of the book consists of scenes of his final examination intercut with scenes of his joining the assassins' school. This section has its amusing moments, but it didn't make me guffaw like the City Watch trilogy of books did. The section gives information on Teppic's character, which does inform the rest of the book, and is thus valuable. It was just missing something.There are also scenes back in the Kingdom, where Teppic's father is going a bit insane. He ends up falling off of a balcony while identifying with the local seagulls. Thus, Teppic is drawn back home to take his place. When Teppic gets back, he finds most of the rituals and values that dominate the kingdom grate with the values that he learned while he was in Ankh-Morpork. Meanwhile, Teppic's dad is dead, and he's not liking it.Things steamroll from there, and I won't give away any of the rest of the stuff. Once Teppic gets back home, things get a lot better in this book. The laughs come very frequently, and nothing is spared from Pratchett's wit. The take-off on the Trojan Horse story has to be seen to be believed, as well as the Philospher's Cafe. And next time you see a camel, you'll be wondering what's going through his head.The main problem with the book is that it seems a bit detached from the situation. In the City Watch books, most of the humour comes directly out of what is happening, making the events that Pratchett is describing feel important, at least to the characters. Pyramids, though, seems different than that. The jokes are funny, but the events that they are coming out of seem very inconsequential when you think about it. And when the event in question is as big as it is in this book (can't say more without spoilers), inconsequential is the last thing it should feel like.Still, that doesn't detract from the enjoyment of the book. Some people don't like the zany, madcap type of humour that Pratchett delivers, and they should stay away from it. But it's certainly worth a pick up for anybody with a funny bone."},{"Title":"PYRAMIDS (DISCWORLD)","review":"Time to turn a sacred cow into hamburger--Terry Pratchett, having established wizards, witches, and cranky policemen in his famed, kooky &quot;Discworld,&quot; turns his attention to ancient Egyptianesque surroudings, here the city of Djelibeybi (say it out loud) and its unfortunate pharaoh.Teppic is an unusually educated young pharaoh-to-be, the crown prince of Djelibeybi (&quot;Child of the Djel&quot;) whose father has a few seagulls in the attic, and overall is a harmless little guy. Teppic heads off to Ankh-Morpork to train to be an Assassin, but comes back home when his dad unexpectedly dies (it's unexpected because the poor guy thought he was a seagull and leaped off). Teppic is a relatively enlightening young man, who doesn't like feeding people to crocodiles, doesn't want to build a pyramid for his dad, isn't comfortable with being a living god, and doesn't relish the idea of marrying a close female relative.Unfortunately, the high priest (who is clearly insane) is holding the reins and doesn't intend to give them up to an upstart pharaoh. Teppic isn't entirely sure what to do about Dios, but he's sure that Dios's age-old ways are not the best ways. It's the century of the fruitbat, and Djelibeybi should live it that way!Among Dios's proclaimations is that the old pharaoh (who is hanging around with Death, and who wanted to be sent out to sea rather than sealed in a pyramid) be built a pyramid to end all pyramids. Enter some slightly deranged architects, who do their darndest to make it so. The problem is, the bigger the pyramid, the more likely it is to distort space-time &#65533; and this one proceeds to mess up the fabric of all Djelibeybi. Soon Dios is siccing the guards on Teppic and rebellious handmaiden Ptraci, the gods have come to life and refuse to behave &#65533; and over a thousand mummies are lurching out into Djelibeybi from their pyramids.Terry Pratchett is at his best when he takes accepted history/events/fantasy and twists them into hilarity. He takes the most absurd aspects of Egyptian culture and makes them into the bizarre land of Djelibeybi. Not even the Egyptian gods are free from Pratchett's spoofery, running around creating havoc--not to mention the enormous dung beetle carrying the sun.The teenage hero Teppic is an innocent bystander who just happens to be the sole legitimate heir of the old king, and his bewilderment at the various customs and traditions (which all date back centuries) is perfectly done. Ptraci is a typical Pratchett gal -- strong, independent, intelligent, and takes no guff from anyone, revealing handmaiden costume or none. The old king is also an enjoyable character, harmlessly nuts when he was alive, and when he died he ended up on a guided tour watching his own embalming (the poor guy has to watch his own organs being extracted, when all he wanted was to be sent out to sea), thus proving that Death is very willing to be nice. Accompanying them are Dios, the insane high priest who spends centuries controlling pharaohs, a bunch of freaked-out architects, a super-intelligent camel called &quot;You B*******&quot;, and a lot of deceased pharaohs (whose dialogue is priceless).This book, like many of Pratchett's, is acceptable for kids as there is minimal profanity, no sex, and not really any violence. Teens may identify with Teppic and Ptraci, but they are excellent characters to be read about for any age group.One of Pratchett's best novels. Also recommended are &quot;Jingo,&quot; &quot;The Truth,&quot; and so forth..."},{"Title":"PYRAMIDS (DISCWORLD)","review":"Teppic, only legitimate son of the king of an impoverished kingdom, is sent to an assassins' school for his training.

Pyramids is one of those outliers. This book has the weakest of connections to Discworld as a whole. Taking place in Discworld's version of Egypt, this one is populated by characters you're unlikely to meet again in the series and if the hero, Teppic, hadn't been educated at the Assassin's Guild, this could have been a separate fantasy novel for all it had to do with Discworld. The nature of the Egyptian belief in the pharaoh as god, is examined here; I'm really not sure for what purpose. It seems with this one, the idea and the execution both came up short. Although there are silly bits about the nature of the afterlife, with mummies staggering around, and the power of pyramids makes for an equally funny commentary on some new age beliefs, the overall effect of this one is fleeting, making it one of the weaker Discworld books."},{"Title":"PYRAMIDS (DISCWORLD)","review":"A young prince from the kingdom of Djelibeybi is sent off to Ankh-Morpork for training at the guild of Assassins. His final exam is vividly imagined and well-told. But just after graduation his father the eccentric pharaoh of the realm, considered a god, dies, and young Teppic must return to ascend to the throne. His father's ghost gets to hang around and watch himself get mummified, and Djelibeybi begins building its biggest pyramid yet. In this book Pratchett throws in an awful lot of funny detail in: we get a send-up of Zeno and his paradox, a mockery of the whole notion of \\"pyramid power\\" (subject of many silly pseudo-science books that I remember from my childhood), and a nasty but mathematically inclined camel... in other words, a whole lot of bits and pieces with \\"Laugh! This is funny!\\" stamped on them... but they aren't, and I didn't. Teppic is never developed further as a character; although as the new pharaoh himself, he finds his orders constantly reinterpreted by his high priest. This makes for good satire of Egyptian government but results in a situation where nothing Teppic says or does really seems to matter. Teppic's love interest, Ptraci, is even less interesting; she is described as a voluptuous handmaiden schooled in the exotic arts of love, and scented with intoxicating perfumes. But rather than give her anything interesting to say or do, Pratchett simply takes her off-stage for most of the book, and focuses instead on nerdy quantum instabilities, reanimated mummies, a parody of the Trojan Wars, the Sphinx, the internal squabbles of the high priests, a bevy of bizarre gods, and a mishmash of other distracting details. Erotica is not Pratchett's style, and I wasn't expecting a real X-rated Kama Sutra send-up, but we don't get even a budding romance or a love-hate relationship; instead, we get a disappointing plot twist that effectively neuters the characters. Although I admire some of Pratchett's big ideas in this book about Egyptian culture's obsession with death and time, and found the story of Teppic's assassin's guild examination to be fun reading, the book ultimately becomes quite dull and hard to finish. This is a shame, because there is a the seed of a very good Discworld novel about Teppic the Reluctant Assassin buried in here, and that would have been much more fun to read. For a far better Discworld standalone read _The Truth_ instead."},{"Title":"PYRAMIDS (DISCWORLD)","review":"Pyramids is almost a complete standalone discworld book, with just small references here and there to the occasional other person.This is his take on the whole Egypt and pyramid worship and the whole thing about the shape and construction of pyramids doing weird things with preservation and time."},{"Title":"PYRAMIDS (DISCWORLD)","review":"I could write a 1000 word essay on why to buy this book but wouldn't do justice to the cause by half. So I'll just summarize:Terry Pratchett.DiscWorld Novel.'Nuff said."},{"Title":"PYRAMIDS (DISCWORLD)","review":"Probably the best of the Discworld series. Enjoyable, funny in places, and enough story to make the book an easy one to finish.I've wondered on occasion why Pratchett (at his best) is never nearly as funny as Douglas Adams (at his best); now I think I know. \\"The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" is genuine science fiction. The story drives itself. The Infinite Improbability Drive, is exactly the sort of thing a science fiction writer would invent, and the explanation for its existence exactly that which a science fiction writer would give. Someone with no sense of humour at all might not like Adams's book, but would at least understand it.None of this is true of Pratchett. His books, as a rule, aren't fantasy: he usually gives the impression of wanting to write about something else. (This is most apparent in, say, \\"Moving Pictures\\", a book about Hollywood that would lose most of its humour if it was actually set *in* Hollywood.) Usually there's nothing to Pratchett except one liners and turns of phrase. He presents us with a plot he doesn't appear to care about, and then goes through the tedious motions of writing a novel to it, all the time keeping a sharp look-out for amusing comments to make. The amusing comments are what makes the otherwise tedious excercise worthwhile. They don't always succeed.(This explains why Pratchett is seldom REALLY funny. Someone who has no particular axe to grind and is just looking for jokes, any jokes, is in the unenviable position of a a clown at the circus, or a court jester, whom everyone expects to be funny but no-one expects to be anything else. Such people produce dutiful chuckles. Humour needs passion.)This is a generalisation. There are exceptions, and this book is one of them. Ankh-Morpork is about the only thing left in Discworld which is interesting in itself (and not just interesting as a result of the funny things that might be said about it); so, hurrah, we begin the novel in Ankh-Morpork. We get a story which has some merit as a fantasy story all by itself. The magic is for once genuine magic, and not a kind of ersatz technology. This book approaches the kind of thing Discworld as a whole ought to have been.Another book worth reading for similar reasons is \\"Mort\\". Read it after or before \\"Pyramids\\". It won't hurt to read the other Discworld books, but there is really no need."},{"Title":"PYRAMIDS (DISCWORLD)","review":"The first part of this book revolves around the idea of an &quot;assassin's guild&quot;. This is undoubtedly the wittiest and most original part, unfortunately it is also the briefest. Pratchett is unable, or unwilling, to continue in this vein and instead tacks a great wad of stodge on to this promising introduction. Whilst this manages to pad it out to a reasonable length to be published, it also makes it profoundly wearisome. Obviously however it is this tripe, more concerned with its own twisted logic than with being amusing, which Pratchett considers to be the most important part. This is evident from the reworking he gives most of these ideas in &quot;Small Gods&quot;, and by inflating the size of this book he manages to make the same old themes more turgid than ever before. If you value your sanity then stop at p68, progress beyond this point at your own peril."},{"Title":"PYRAMIDS (DISCWORLD)","review":"\\"Pyramids\\" is an odd entry in the Discworld franchise. It is neither a knock-you-down laugh riot, nor an existential meandering. It has great dollops of both, though, and sometimes the two sides clash confusingly in the middle. Other times, they fit together perfectly, like the large blocks that when stacked together make up a pyramid.There are some classic Pratchett moments here. Funny stuff. Like when a doctor (medicine being a new artform on the Discworld) declares a man's temperature so hot you could fry an egg on his forehead. Then, predicting the complicated medical jargon we all know and love, he pompously declares that the man is suffering from \`Pyrocerebrum ouerf culinaire'. A great and ridiculous moment. Even better is the scene near the middle of the book, where our hero, Teppic, encounters the legendary Sphinx, and ends up debunking the logic behind its famous riddle. It is a great scene, hardly integral to the plot, but wonderful to chomp on while it's playing.As for that plot, well, Terry tries some complicated set pieces, and usually manages to pull them off with minimal explanation. He lets the reader figure out the merits of the Assassin's Guild, what it means to inhume a client, the concept of &quot;flaring&quot; off a pyramid, camel mathematics, and &quot;quantum&quot; architecture. Needless to say, none of these concepts are very useful in our world, but all make perfect sense on the Discworld.I was somewhat disappointed that he returned to some tried and true devices. The ghost of the dead king, used so well in &quot;Wyrd Sisters&quot;, here comes off as a tired rehash (although the king's afterlife companions turn out to be an interesting bunch). Also, the smart-mouth female sidekick has been done to death by this point. And our hero seems to be just an amalgamation of every Discworld hero so far, from Rincewind to Twoflower to Mort to Rincewind (again). Although Death returns, for a very brief but memorable appearance.All told not the greatest entry in the series. Terry aims the bar quite high, which I commend him for, but he manages to knock it down more times than not."},{"Title":"PYRAMIDS (DISCWORLD)","review":"I really enjoy Terry Pratchett's writing and he did not disappoint with this one.

Teppic, heir to the throne of Djelibeybi (which bears more than a passing resemblance to ancient Egypt), has just passed his final exam to become a member of the assassin's guild in Ankh-Morpork when his father dies in a bit of madness. He returns home to take on his responsibility, for which he is totally unprepared. Even though he is king and considered a god, he finds he has no say in anything at all; because of the high priest, his is merely a ceremonial position. The story is no mere court intrigue, though; the Djelibeybian custom of building a bigger, more impressive pyramid for each kingly generation's resting spot creates havoc when the new pyramid proves to be so large that it creates a warp in space and time. Teppic, with the aid of a handmaid and Discworld's greatest mathematician (a camel named You Bastard) must put things to rights before Djelibeybi is destroyed by gods who have suddenly manifested on the physical realm and before war breaks out between the countries on either side of where Djelibeybi used to be.While certainly amusing (the assassin's final exam is particularly good), this isn't one of Pratchett's stronger stories. It's disjointed and a lot of things happen that don't advance the story- the gods becoming physical and apparently witless being one of the worst. The characters aren't as vivid as in most Pratchett stories. Teppic and Ptraci are likable but not compelling. The best characters are the dead king and Dios, the power mad high priest who turns out to be motivated by good. But still, a not so great story by Terry Pratchett is better than a lot of some authors best stories, so it's certainly worth the read."},{"Title":"PYRAMIDS (DISCWORLD)","review":"Very funny, like all the other discworld books.

The book tells the story of the Discworld's Egyptian like civilization, that continue to exist in \\"modern\\" times. The interesting comparison between the rest of the world and how they live is shown very clearly through the eyes of our protagonist Teppic. He trains in the major city of Ankh-Morpork to become an assassin by trade only to return back to his home town of Djelibeybi, where he must take over as ruler after his father dies.It is quickly shown that the pyramids in the area have mystical powers utilized for their creation, but when these get out of hand, some strange events begin to occur.

Teppic is successful in his studies there, but, seven years later, the death of his father sees him recalled to take up the mantle of pharoah.Unfortunately for all concerned, Teppic comes home with some strange notions about plumbing and the benefits of feather mattresses, which is not good news to the head priest, Dios, who prides himself on how things are run in the kingdom precisely as they were seven thousand years ago. New ideas are not welcome in the Old Kingdom...Pyramids (subtitled 'The Book of Going Forth'), the seventh Discworld book, is one of several 'sleeper' hits in the series. Much more attention is lavished on the book preceding it, Wyrd Sisters, for introducing the popular characters of the Witches, whilst the succeeding volume, Guards! Guards!, gets a lot of props for introducing the City Watch and also for being one of the best books in the series. Pyramids by contrast tends to slip beneath the radar, which is a shame as it is a very good book indeed.It's a stand-alone with not too many continuing story elements, but it works well for that. Rather than simply doing a story about someone with new, radical ideas turning up that the priesthood gets annoyed by, Pratchett throws in some excellent mickey-taking of philosophers and also some nice commentary about SF. Around the time Pyramids came out a lot of 'approachable' SF had been discarded in favour of brain-expanding stories about time travel and non-linear space or something, and Pratchett's constant use of \\"It's probably quantum!\\" to explain every single possible plot hole in the novel is a nice bit of satire.Teppic makes for an engaging protagonist, although he's one of Pratchett's more familiar archetypes (a general do-gooder whose attempts to do good go wrong but he sorts it all out in the end). Dios is one of the series' more interesting protagonists, and the various pyramid-builders and embalmers make for an amusing secondary cast as well. On the minus side, the book's humour is a little bit too obvious in places (there's a few obvious Cleopatra jokes and the employment of mummies for comedic purposes), but there's still a few good belly-laughs in there as well. The theme of the book also seems a bit vague, except that ossification should be avoided by embracing new ideas, which is a bit of a no-brainer.Pyramids (****) is a solid entry to the Discworld series, funny and entertaining throughout.

I recently read two more books in Terry Pratchett's Discworld series, WYRD SISTERS and PYRAMIDS. (I had previously read about a third of the Discworld books, but I'm currently reading all of them in order of publication.) I had imagined that I was going to love WYRD SISTERS, knowing that it was filled with Shakespearean references, and imagined that I was going to dislike PYRAMIDS, since I am pretty uninterested in Egyptian mythology and religion. And given that the novel was set in an area of the Discworld in which we were not likely to encounter any of I was wrong. I enjoyed WYRD SISTERS well enough, but I didn't love it like I expected. But I absolutely adored PYRAMIDS. The novel is nothing short of absolutely hysterical, with Pratchett's inventiveness hitting on all cylinders, with one deliciously absurd character after another. The scenes where Dios exerts complete control over the actions of Teppic are among the finest Pratchett has produced, while the delightful beast known as You Bastard are among my favorite creatures in the entire Disc. The scenes in which Teppeic and Dios exchange words are unfailingly delightful. But I may prefer ever more the moments in which we learn that camels are the most brilliant creatures on the Disc and that they are oblivious to others because they are perpetually engaged in working out problems in higher mathematics. The book also has a brilliant encounter between Teppic and the Sphinx, with some typical Pratchettian twists on the tale.I didn't actually dislike WYRD SISTERS. The problem was more that I have never really been drawn to the witches to begin with. Just a matter of taste. I did enjoy the references to Shakespeare. Have the joy of Pratchett is getting his various cultural allusions. For instance, any Gene Wolfe fan will love the title of Part Three of PYRAMIDS, \\"The Book of the New Son.\\" But it isn't enough merely to have references to Shakespeare; the allusions must stand up on their own, and my own feeling was that the Shakespearean elements in the book were the weakest part of the book.So here is the paradox: I thought I was going to love WYRD SISTERS and dislike PYRAMIDS, whereas PYRAMIDS is my favorite of the first seven books in the series while WYRD SISTERS is my least favorite. Just shows to go that you need to read books before knowing whether or not you will like them."},{"Title":"PYRAMIDS (DISCWORLD)","review":"Terry Pratchett's first novel, \\"The Carpet People\\", appeared in 1971. \\"Pyramids\\" is the seventh novel in his hugely popular Discworld series and was first published in 1989. It's the first - and, to date, only - book to feature Teppic, and is largely set in his home country of Djelibeybi.As the book opens, Teppic (or Pteppic) is approaching the end of his education at Ankh-Morpork's Guild of Assassins. (The final exam, if failed, tends to be very...&lt;ahem>...final). However, there is more to Teppic than dressing very stylishly and inhuming only for vast amounts of money. With the very recent death of his father, he has also become King Pteppicymon XXVIII of Djelibeybi. Teppic's home country is very obviously based on Egypt : it's two miles wide, one hundred and fifty miles long and runs along the river Djel. It has driven itself bankrupt, having spent seven thousand years building pyramids for its monarchs - invariably on the country's most fertile soil. Having become the first Pharoh to be educated outside Djelibeybi, Teppic finds it difficult to re-adapt to the traditions of his home country. He is technically a God and although he is officially Head of State, it's Dios - the very aged High Priest - who actually runs the country. Teppic isn't entirely impressed about this - he wants to introduce proper plumbing and pillows, for example. However, in spite of the country's debt, he does agree to building a massive pyramid for his late father. (This isn't something his late father - still pottering around as a ghost - isn't too impressed with). The final straw comes when Dios decides to feed Ptraci - the late King's favourite handmaiden - to the crocodiles. Teppic decides to become a little more politically active - and, luckily, he has a helpful education to fall back on.Like everything else I've read by Pratchett, this is an excellent book. It's easily read, features plenty of likeable characters and there are plenty of laughs. As it's one of Pratchett's stand-alone books, it's a good starting point if you've never read any of the Discworld books before. (In a way, I find that a pity : I'd love to have known what became of Teppic and Ptraci).

The suave, stylish, chic and, well, murderous life as an apprentice assassin is, against all logic, made sort of appealing and cool, like an academy for future James Bonds.Then our protagonist, Teppic, is cruelly jerked back to his reality -- he's the son of the pharoah in the Kingdom of the Sun, and his father has just died. The cosmopolitan Teppic has to face what are, to him, backwards and outdated customs the rest of the world has left behind centuries ago. He's right, of course, and the mystery as to what's really happening in his kingdom spins out at Teppic tries to adapt himself to life as pharoah, and try to drag the kingdom into modern times.Along the way, there is the ghost of his father, who mournfully watches his own body being prepared for the afterworld, a sassy handmaiden, and a mysterious and forbidding high priest. Toss in the greatest mathematician on Discworld -- not a biped, though -- a parody of Ancient Greece, and a graduate assassin turned pirate, and you've got a rollicking cast plunging towards a very local sort of doomsday.The ending is a touch ambiguous for my tastes -- Pratchett was trying to use a light touch and went a touch TOO light for my tastes -- but overall, this is an engaging, amusing and even somewhat thoughtful Discworld novel, and one that stands alone even better than most.By the order of the pharoah, this is strongly recommended."},{"Title":"PYRAMIDS (DISCWORLD)","review":"First of all, I loved this novel.

The very name of Teppic's country, Djelibeybi, made me giggle, and the final exam in the Assassins' School had me at the edge of my chair until Teppic -- whew! -- makes the right decision. It's fun to look for the sources of Pratchett's plots (and satires). Did anyone else notice the similarities between this one and the first two of the Gormenghast trilogy? Not just Daddy's becoming a bird, but the dark ambience, Teppic's strange rivals and relatives, and the liberating finale. This book isn't my absolute favorite of Pratchett's (those accolades are reserved for the Watch novels and REAPER MAN), but it's a far cut above the Rincewind tales -- and better than the Gormenghast novels, since it examines all problems, including the hilarious ones, that trouble the inheritor of vast inbred territories."},{"Title":"PYRAMIDS (DISCWORLD)","review":"One of his better parodies.

Death is in here, for all the fans, and a new cast of characters comes into the scene. The only bad part about this book is the fact that, so far, Prattchet hasn't re-used any of these characters in other books. For newbies to the land of Discworld, it isn't the best starter book; it has a lot of jokes that you wouldn't understand and references to other books. Still, it is my favorite book in the Discworld series."},{"Title":"PYRAMIDS (DISCWORLD)","review":"Have you ever wondered why camels are so ungainly? The answer is in 'Pyramids' along with some of the most hilarious material ever to appear between the covers of a book. Terry Pratchett is the greatest &quot;Funny Fantasy&quot; writer in the world (disc or otherwise). I laughed so hard I nearly did myself an injury!! If you've never read fantasy, start with Terry Pratchett"},{"Title":"PYRAMIDS (DISCWORLD)","review":"\\"Heavy hangs the head\\" goes the old saying. Teppic doesn't wear a crown, but there's plenty else. Besides all the gear he took up while training to be an Assassin in Ankh-Morpork, there's The Reaping Hook of Justice, The Sheaf of Plenty and The Three-pronged Spear of the Waters of the Earth. Oh, yes, there's also a gold mask for identity. All this has been imposed on Teppic since ascending the throne of Djelibeybi at the death of his father. Along with the paraphernalia, Teppic has also inherited a staggering, if unspecified, debt load. In Djelibeybi, each monarch is to \\"rest\\" in a pyramid, each one larger than that of his/her predecessor. With seven millennia of monarchs, the shores of the River Djel are occupied with these man-made stone mountains. And nobody can remember how long it's been since any of them was paid for.Teppic, having breathed the foetid air of Anhk-Morpork, misses feather mattresses and plumbing. He is also suspicious of the type of \\"justice\\" prevailing in Djelibeybi. Long centuries of \\"tradition\\" have conditioned the populace to endure bizarre forms of justice. So conditioned that they will self-inflict punishment, no matter how illogical. Teppic has difficulty understanding this, but Dios, his high priest is there to counsel him on how the system works. There's also another voice, just at the level of perception, adding to Teppic's uncertainty. Urged by Dios to build the greatest pyramid ever to honour Teppic's departed father, the new king has reservations. Something is telling him it's a bad idea.The bad idea proves worse than he can imagine. The ranks of pyramids contain the fourth dimension, Time, which can distort the other three if enough accumulates. Events transpire, not the least of which is the disappearance of Djelibeybi, river, pyramids and all. This situation allows Pratchett to make his first drastic departure from the image of \\"humourous fantasist\\" pinned on him by uncomprehending critics. He does so with gusto. Employing the assistance of the Discworld's greatest mathematician [not a dolphin!], Pratchett guides us through the world of quantum physics. Far from fantasy, this is serious science brought to life by the one writer who can accomplish it with such finesse. Who but Pratchett could utilise the metaphor of Djelibeybi stretching like \\"a lead ball on a rubber sheet\\" in such a context?What happens when Time distorts the other dimensions? If you're outside, how do you return? If you're inside, what effect will the transformation of those dimensions mean to reality? What will be reality? Pratchett answers those questions in ways that will astound fans of fantasy and confound physics professors who seek ways of awakening their legions of drowsy students. He formulates a new reality in which those things we believe in but never see are given substance. Will we still believe in them when they confront us? How will we cope with the forces they possess? Pratchett poses these questions to prod us into considering them for ourselves. Can you accept his challenge?Read this as a guidebook to the world beyond \\"reality\\" and enjoy the immense wit Pratchett uses to describe it. You won't be disappointed.

Discworld currently has 34 titles and every one of them will probably knock your socks off. His mind bubbles and flashes like a boiling pot of electric eels, and I simply can't get enough of his writing.A reviewer has compared him to Geoffrey Chaucer. He reminds me more of Douglas Adams, or perhaps S Morgenstern. Great company, isn't it? He's an extremely skillful and imaginative writer, damn funny, clever and observant to boot. He's also very easy to read. A master of characterization, and if there's anything else you like about reading that I didn't mention here, assume I simply forgot. He's awesome.Another reviewer mentioned Jonathan Swift and PG Wodehouse. Why such hallowed company? Because Pratchett belongs there! Truly, I'm enjoying my quest to read every book in the series. You should do the same, and begin your quest at the library because he's got to be there. He's awesome!Yet another reviewer said Jerome K Jerome meets Lord of the Rings. Yeah, that works too.Why do we, as reviewers, compare authors to other authors? Because it's easier than thinking. In the case of Terry Pratchett, it's probably because we'd otherwise wind up quoting the guy. He's so unique that we just don't know how else to cope with his greatness. Even this paragraph sounds like foamy drool raving, doesn't it? That's how all readers react to Pratchett. Reviewers simply don't have the good sense to keep it to themselves.I could call his writing fantasy, but I could likewise call what Douglas Adams wrote science fiction. In both cases, I wouldn't be wrong, but I'd be neglecting so much and just totally missing the point. A rare few authors transcend a genre to such a degree that you know they're shouting out, loud and proud, a big fat \\"Bite me!\\"I love Terry Pratchett's writing, and I completely understand why some folks refer to him as their favorite author. Or favourite, I should say, since we're being British. He's one of those authors that makes you want to grab whoever's in hearing range and start reading passages aloud. I'm simply thrilled that there's such an extremely talented and prolific author who's been working for years without me being aware of him. Now I have much catching up to do, and I will love it."},{"Title":"PYRAMIDS (DISCWORLD)","review":"A delightful piece in the discworld series, this must have story depicts the life of P'Teppic(an assassin) the son of a Phaoroh in his attempt to govern his people. Being half man half god is a tough life, especially because of a certain advisor. He must now build the hugest pyramid ever."},{"Title":"PYRAMIDS (DISCWORLD)","review":"As a relatively new fan of Terry Pratchett and his Discworld series, I was so impressed by what he wrote so far I started to believe that everything from the series will be brilliant and excellent. Therefore, despite the fact other books sounded better, I picked \\"Pyramids\\" at random. And also because... All I can say is, even the best writers can make mistakes now and then - and that I will be more careful next time.About the book: Pyramids is set in Djelibeibey, which is the Discworld equivalent of Ancient Egypt. The main character is Teppic, the son of the Pharaoh who gets sent to Assassin's school in Ankh-Morpork for a few years, only to come back exactly when his father dies and he becomes the new Pharoah of the kingdom. The plot gets complicated by the building of a pyramid which is bigger than any pyramid which has ever been built in the kingdom. This pyramid somehow twists the rules of space, time and belief to create a big mess.Does this sound a big vague? To me it does - and the story feels confused and vague to the end. Many plot lines aren't fully explored, many characters aren't fully developed.. the plot is very thin, it feels as if it leads nowhere. Even the jokes in the book weren't as witty as the other Discworld novels I have read. It's a pity since the premise has a lot of potential, and Teppic is cool as the main character.What can I say, I guess Pratchett is human after all, even great authors can do less than perfect every now and then. Was I disappointed? Yes. Will I continue to read more Pratchett novels? You bet! I guess I would recommend this book only to people who are absolutely die hard fans of Discworld.. for anybody else I would say, Skip this one."},{"Title":"PYRAMIDS (DISCWORLD)","review":"Pyramids revolves within Prachett's representation of a very British, albeit magical, Egypt. Pratchett has some fun playing with classes, and the expectations and confinements imposed on all classes (especially royals, in this case). He also takes many amusing pokes at polytheism. A camel, going by the name of You Bastard, provides the rest of the hilarity expected (and delivered) with Pratchett's Discworld books.Unfortunately, the final sections of Pyramids are disappointing, failing to make much sense or be very funny. Of the nine Discworld books I've read (the first 8--Pyramids being the 7th--plus Going Postal), Pyramids is on par with Sourcery as being the least of the lot. Not that this is hugely negative, as Pratchett's least is still very good. But with 30-some Discworld books available, this one's recommended only for the most serious of Pratchett fans."},{"Title":"PYRAMIDS (DISCWORLD)","review":"I don't claim that this one is the rollicking, laughter filled ride of most of the previous books (particularly WYRD SISTERS) but, for sheer inventiveness and looney logic, this has claimed its current spot in my head and heart as King of the Hill as far as Discworld novels are concerned. However, I am reading or re-reading the series in order published, so it will likely change. Camels. Who would've thought? Highest recommendations."},{"Title":"PYRAMIDS (DISCWORLD)","review":"A rollicking trip through Djelibeybi (Jelly baby, a British candy, get it?), Ephebe (with it's suspicious resemblance to classical Athens), and Anhk-Morpork (which needs no tag line). We're introduced to life as a student in the Assassin's Guild, where school dinners are the most stressful event of the day but not for the bullying. We observe the true pyramid power, the ability to muck about with the flow of time, and gain insight into the lives of those who build the pyramids, those who build things to go in them, and those who go in them.Most important, we meet Dios, the high priest of Djelibeybi. The man has LOTS of experience at managing royalty, but is overcome by Pteppic, the young price sent to Anhk-Morpork to be educated at the Assassins' Guild. (You'll appreciate how easy even your hardest final exam was.) No, Dios is not assassinated, just out-witted by the independence and cunning the boy acquired in his years in that city of cities, that festering dung heap on a warm day, Anhk-Morpork.Ephebe, a city of philosophers in search of bath-towels plays a critical role in this story, and the value of a good listener is demonstrated, to the cent.One of Pratchett's best. The characters are well developed. Shots are taken at New Age silliness, boarding schools, and philosophy. It ends with a twist. What else can we ask for?"},{"Title":"PYRAMIDS (DISCWORLD)","review":"Teppic is the son of King Teppicymon XXVII, the pharaoh of the ancient Klatch kingdom of Djelibeybi. Young Teppic is sent away to Ankh-Morpork to go to Assassin's School. He is called back to the kingdom immediately after graduation because of the death of his father. He must now ascend the throne, wear the ceremonial gold mask, and commission master architect Ptaclusp to build the massive mother of all pyramids for his father's earthly remains. Being the pharaoh of the dusty old tradition-steeped Kingdom of the Sun is no fun, however. Teppic misses the modern excitement, not to mention the modern plumbing, of Ankh-Morpork. When the pyramid under construction begins to generate enough energy to warp the fabric of time and space, the entire kingdom is displaced from Discworld into an alternate dimension. Teppic, accompanied by his headstrong handmaiden Ptraci and a mathematically inclined camel, is catapulted out of the kingdom. The threesome must find their way back to the kingdom to return it to its place within the dimensions of Discworld, rescuing it from beliefs turned to hellish reality.This Discworld novel has a different feel from ones that precede it. Once Teppic leaves Ankh-Morpork, almost all traces of Discworld slip away. The reader is immersed in an amalgam of ancient Egypt and Greece, complete with mythology, high priests, deserts, hieroglyphics, and lots of pyramids and mummies. There are no wizards or witches here, and the magic is of an entirely different nature. There are almost no familiar characters, although Death does make a minor appearance. Pratchett uses this unusual setting to explore ideas about religious beliefs and traditions, and the nature of time, space, and reality. This is some pretty heady stuff, but it is given the magic Pratchett touch that entertains the reader while providing a lot of serious food for thought.Pratchett is in top form as he satirizes Greek philosophy, Zeno's paradox, quantum physics, mythology, pyramid power, and the Trojan wars. His parody of the Riddle of the Sphinx is hilarious, as is an introduction to the questionably honorable ideals of the Assassin's Guild. Although Pratchett avoids chapter breaks, at least this book is divided into four sections to provide you with a few logical stopping points. This will give you several places to catch your breath in a funny and thought-provoking story that is a royal jewel in the scepter of Discworld.Eileen Rieback"},{"Title":"PYRAMIDS (DISCWORLD)","review":"This book was fantastic! I found that Djelibeybi, the Kingdom of the Sun that Teppic finds himself ruling, had many similarities to our own world and ancient civilizations. We also got a great look at what the Assasin's Guild is all about.So far this is my favorite Discworld book. The books aren't in any particular order, and you really don't have to start with the first one. But I don't recommend you start with this one. It may be confusing.

There's your 1000-year old high priest, a camel that's also the greatest mathematician on Earth, a sea trader whose business is about 30% legal, a handmaiden (what does that mean, anyway?), a whole lot of architects, and of course the new pharaoh, Teppic.

It was packed full of information and is certainly worth its sales price. I would have enjoyed it more if it had been a little less pro black woman and complained less about racism and sexism. But the author apparently thought it was necessary to include such verbage in order to connect with her target audience.The author is a registered investment advisor who has two businesses that she runs: (1) a financial and small business consulting firm, and (2) a personal financial advisory firm. In a nutshell, she is a consultant by trade. I see some similarities to what she does and what Suze Orman does. They are both basically CFPs who market themselves through writing books, making presentations, and getting media exposure.As I read this book I wasn't sure if the author in writing it was being a Life Coach, a Financial Advisor, or a Business Coach. The title of this book says that the book is a \\"Guide to Starting Your Own Business.\\" As a result, I expected to hear exclusively from a business coach. But chapters 1 through 4 about personal faith, purpose, and goals didn't seem to me to relate to starting a business.For me, a \\"guide\\" is something that offers basic information or instruction and shows the way by leading, directing, or advising. As a result, this book was supposed to advise me as to how to start my own business. Unfortunately it did not do this for me very well. While it covered business plans (Chapter 12), choice of entity (Chapter 7), financing your startup (Chapter 8), cash flow and recordkeeping (Chaper 9), and marketing (chapters 14 & 15), it did not do them in a step 1, step 2, step 3 kind of way. That's what I expected when I started reading this book which the title says is a guide.The book is also dated. Coverage of choice of entity is not current. Limited liability companies (LLCs) are available throughout the US now. And their popularity has basically made partnerships, limited partnerships, and S Corps a thing of the past.The four types of businesses discussed in Chapter 10 seemed odd to me. The auther suggests the four basic types of businesses are: product, service, mail order, and retail/restaurant. I had hoped that the author in this book would have dissected the following generic business models in detail:>>Retail businesses>>Service oriented businesses (part service and part product)>>Product oriented business (part product and part service)>>Personal service business (all personal services)>>Distribution companies>>Internet companiesMail order today is pretty much an online business. And that category probably falls under Internet Companies. And what's the difference between a product business and a retail business? Don't retail businesses sell products?And there is no talk in this book of Web sites as a marketing tool. Just another reason this book is dated. Also, I found the inclusion of Chapter 11 on franchises to be unnecessary. The target audience of this book is supposedly black women who want to BECOME financially independent. For the most part, franchises are only an option for women who are already financially independent or wealthy. I think the book would have been better if the chapter on franchising had been left out. All in all, not a bad book. 4 stars!"},{"Title":"Sister CEO","review":"I am a Black Australian woman and I found this book applicable to my situation.

Anton \\"Explorer\\" writes in his Amazon review: \\"If you are expecting to learn anything that can actually help you in your life, forget it.

Anton's review does a good job summarizing my gut reaction to the book:1. I bought the paperback and found the rambling style difficult to plod through. Fortunately, I acquired the audiobook through the library and found listening to that while driving and bicycling somewhat easier. Rarely have I started a book I was so happy to finish simply in order to begin something less plodding and with more substance!2. The whole book is based on the (in my opinion) still developing and insufficiently supported science of mirror neurons, and of \\"low road\\" versus \\"high road.\\" Yet as Goleman himself confesses, \\"the neural specifics of both systems have yet to be worked out and are still under debate.\\" (p. 321)3. Much of the supposed scientific conclusions do nothing more than affirm common sense. You don't need a doctorate to know most of what is concluded within these pages.4. Content useful for personal application is skimpy at best, and that statement might be considered generous. I will, however, try to find time to investigate further topics mentioned by Goleman such as the Baron-Cohen test, empathy quotient, the eye test, PONS, and Ekman's' test for reading micro-expressions (pp 87 and 139).5. One of the many times Goleman summarizes his thesis can be found on page 314: \\"the exquisite social responsiveness of the brain demands that we realize that not just our own emotions but our very biology is being driven and molded for better or for worse, by others--and in turn, that we take responsibility for how we affect the people in our lives.\\" Being as the book is highly repetitive, my advice to you is to read the first chapter and maybe skim one or two more, skipping ahead quickly to the epilogue.

In general, the writing of both these authors are well-researched and powerfully presented.In this book, Daniel Goleman goes beyond the concepts in EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE to explore social bonding and the underlying mechanisms and connections that are being discovered in neuroscience. There are many fine reviews of this book and I don't feel I need to provide anything but a further endorsement of it's credibility and some additional suggestions for more.According to Buddhism and congruent with modern physics, everything is interrelated and somehow connected. In fact, our nervous systems are open-ended and we even regulate each others nervous systems. Phenomenon are also much more complex than they appear having various dimensions... e.g. an internal subjective component, an objective observable aspect and a systems dimension when interpreted from without or a cultural one when interpreted from within the group. Daniel Goleman does a great job of exploring this territory in a very understandable way.If you like this book, you may also want to pick upA General Theory of LoveandA Brief History of Everything.

One of many interesting discussions involves the distinction between the \\"low road\\" of emotion -- our immediate, visceral reactions, say, to an attractive face or a nasty remark -- and the \\"high road\\" in which we run emotions through the neural system, which allows us to ponder and plan our reactions to others. He takes these ideas far deeper than the typical sociology text.I recommend this book to anyone interested in the science and the art of human relationships. Like a good movie, it may even merit a second visit."},{"Title":"Social Intelligence: The New Science of Human Relationships (Random House Large Print)","review":"At a time when people are more and more likely to communicate through text messaging and emails, instead of the deeper more nourishing and empowering exchange of a face-to-face, this book truly comes at the right time!If you are in sales, or journalism, or you want to have a meaningful relationship, have a deep understanding of how to effectively lead a team by understanding what's happening past the overt representations of communication such as facial expression and vocabulary......or just want to understand from a scientific observation what those little instincts and 'inner-senses' really mean and can do for you......this book will take your understanding of the inner workings of social 'energy' to a new level.Goleman takes the reader to deeper understanding of neuroscience and how humans are hardwired to respond in a number of varied (previously so mysterious), yet effective ways...if we just listen to what we're 'hearing/feeling'.Humans are emotional and subconconscious sponges of life experience; and Goleman's 'Social Intelligence' great follow-up to his prior hit 'Emotional Intelligence' is the perfect material to beneficially get that deeper understanding and appreciation of your deep, neurological responses during person-to-person interactions!"},{"Title":"Social Intelligence: The New Science of Human Relationships (Random House Large Print)","review":"In a nutshell this book is about the neuroscience underpinning human emotions. Yet this so-called science leaves much to be desired as the neurological basis of emotions is little understood, as even advanced researchers in this field admit. Yet Goleman's exposition makes it sound as if the relationship is down pat and solid. neither are alternative neurological views underpinning emotions presented. Hence the book give the incorrect impression that there is an agreed upon concensus among neurological scientists regarding the basis of emotions. The reality is far from this. Thus the book is of very misleading."},{"Title":"Social Intelligence: The New Science of Human Relationships (Random House Large Print)","review":"If you like a rambling style of discourse that goes on and on about social experiments you might like this cd or book.

The ability to create deep empathic connections with other humans makes us happier, healthier and wealthier. Lack of these connections leads to decline.The new news here is the rapid rate at which psychologists and neuroscientists are using functional MRI and positron emission tomography to map the physiological responses of the brain as it experiences anger, joy, love, and the rest of the emotional gamut. Goleman employs a useful if somewhat simplistic distinction between low road social functioning (instinctive responses regulated primarily by the amygdala) and high road social functioning (cognitive appraisals located primarily in the anterior cingulate cortex and parts of the prefrontal cortex.) An easy interplay between the two is necessary for a high functioning social intelligence - we need the capability to make flash judgments and the ability to prevent ourselves from always acting on them.Social Intelligence often resembles the Platte River: a mile wide and an inch deep. Goleman describes mirror neurons and spindle cells and surveys the social neurology of love, academic performance, toxic bosses, prison reform and world peace, but it's all done in one to two page snippets that read like syndicated newspaper columns. He might have gone into more depth about the implications of all this brain imaging. For instance, mixing social science with neural functioning could be toxic to inidividual freedom. Without safeguards on how this new knowledge can be used, politicians, the health care industry and multinational corporations could manipulate us at the neural level in ways that will make Orwell's 1984 seem benign by comparison.Or he might have written more about how we can use this high quality biofeedback to manage our emotional responses and improve the quality of our interactions with other people. Will we be able to increase the surges of oxytocin that lead to feelings of well-being and reduce the cortisol spikes induced by stress without becoming even more reliant on the pharmaceutical industry? If we have more insight into the manufacture of our own feelings, will the movies, theater and novels that we use to induce these feelings become less necessary to us?We'll see. This book, while something of a hodge-podge, provides a decent overview of the experiments being done to unlock the neuropysiological basis of behavior. While the field is in its infancy, its implications are enormous, and should be subject to the rigors of public scrutiny. Read this book in order to begin arming yourself for the battles ahead."},{"Title":"Social Intelligence: The New Science of Human Relationships (Random House Large Print)","review":"I read, and enjoyed Emotional Intelligence, so I assumed this book would \\"mirror\\" not only his former success, but also give me an in depth review of the latest research in this area. Instead I got a repeat of the first few opening sentences, rephrased dozens of ways, but all saying the same thing and adding nothing new. I finally gave up in disgust after the second chapter, which gives this book the honor of accompanying only two other books that I did not finish - in my entire life. It was just too much of a waste of time. If you are still interested in the latest research in this area, see the article in the November 2006 \\"Scientific American\\" (and I'm sure there are others more recent).PS, I gave it one star because the system would not allow fewer."},{"Title":"Social Intelligence: The New Science of Human Relationships (Random House Large Print)","review":"You may not have the time to read the book.

Nevertheless, we can be thankful that Daniel Goleman chose to pay his tax bills this way. Firstly, it serves to bring back the lessons of the earlier book to best-seller awareness, which is goodness. Secondly, it re-casts them more clearly in an inter-personal format. Note that this already existed in Emotional Intelligence, but was not so clearly called out.The most positive aspect is the confirmation provided by fMRI studies to previous empirical or intuitive knowledge on the importance of inter-personal relationships to psychic ecology. A question-mark would be against the reliance on Seligman's and Csikszentmihalyi's questionnaire based results. Questionnaire psychology is frustratingly limited in the gap between the suggestive nature of the results and the impossibilty of distinguishing between correlation and cause-effect."},{"Title":"Social Intelligence: The New Science of Human Relationships (Random House Large Print)","review":"This book has an interesting take on how the mind interprets the slightest events between two people such as body language, facial expression and more.

Unfortuately, the author sacrifices intellectual integrity when he makes an unsupportable leap in the middle of the book that appears to be an attempt to buttress a personal belief that humans are innately kind. He invokes the concepts of empathy and social mirroring at the subconscious level (the low road) combined with the automatic response of the brain (as viewed on fMRIs) to argue that humans are programmed to be kind. He uses the example of a baby crying and highlights the fact that the area of the brain that fires when we feel empathy towards that baby is universal. However, his own concept of social mirroring contradictst this conclusion. Mirroring (as he presents it) can work both ways. Social mirroring suggests that the human brain is a neutral palate that wil react in line with the nature of the social stimuli (fear, anger, pain, empathy etc). Disappointing to see him let his personal agenda trump intellectual honesty, particularly given his previous book, Emotional Intelligence, was a four or five star effort."},{"Title":"Social Intelligence: The New Science of Human Relationships (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have listened to the taped version of this book and I must admit it was hard to turn it off each morning and evening when I had reached my destinations. There was such intense revelations within the prose of this book again again... I found myself being validated again and again. I am in the medical field and I deal with patients every day. Being a Nurse Practitioner and not a physician I am constantly being told how I am not dealing with the patients in this difficult correctional setting like I should be, detatched and scientific. I have been recognized by the jail administrators to be who I am because we have recently passed an NCCHC certification inspection with a fantastic testimonial that expressed how the inspecting team has not seen our equal but once before in 10 years of inspections as a team. We were sited for cooperation and consideration in all areas that this team evaluates and were not found difficient in even one of the 40 criteria that encompasses the core of the certification process. This I attribute to my own approach to people using the concepts that Daniel Goldman has finally scetched out as being so productive in may aspects of human relationships and interactions. The easy manner of the prose made listening to this so much more enjoyable then if it had been presented in a more scientific manner. I do not think that Daniel Goldman was trying to prove anything with this treatise, he was only presenting gleefully to the world. Any critisim of his methodology might be truly justified if you are a one of the experts that might be used by a journal to justify its publication in your scientific publication. However, if you are a person wishing to validate how you communicate with the world around you, while others consistantly critize your approach you may be pleasantly suprised to find that your actually on track when the science is applied to really quantify your \\"feelings\\" about how things should be done.

I strongly recommend this book for anyone contemplating or entering a new relationship or understanding why an old one failed. The knowledge gained from reading this book helps us to be less judmental of ourselves and others and promotes forgiveness simply because there are so many factors that cause humans to behave the way they do and how we became the person we are today. All of this can lead to deeper understanding and healing thus moving us to make better choices and realize there are tools to help us move forward with a healthier mental, emotional physical and spiritual awareness and outlook.

Backed by new and hard science, innumerable studies and experiments, Dr. Goleman weaves a picture of everyday life that is profoundly affected by our natural empathy for other human beings. Dr. Goleman provides a road map for developing social awareness and facility.Dr. Goleman describes the interdependence of nature and nurture. He discusses our brains' capacity to read and map what is going on within another person. Our social brain is triggered by mirroring neurons that instantaneously and unconsciously align themselves with those we are with. Our genes are designed to express themselves when triggered by a matching external social stimulus. If our parents worry about the future we worry about the future whether or not they said worrisome things out loud, the worry was transmitted unconsciously. Most of what we know about interacting with others is learned. So according to Dr. Goleman what you may not have learned when younger can be learned. This book makes it possible to see the world of human relationships as a field of new possibilities and gives us a lot to ponder about the state of our culture and what we might do about it and ourselves.\\"How to Create Magical Relationships\\", written by Ariel and Shya Kane, is a great companion book to \\"Social Intelligence\\". This book is very down to earth with stories and examples of how people's lives and relationships have transformed. They offer a living example of social intelligence and ignite the possibility of everyone having magical relationships. The Kanes value living in the present with non-judgmental awareness. Their style and delivery are very practical. Using real world examples and illustrations from their own experience, they make a life filled with excellence, well being, and passion a vivid possibility for everyone."},{"Title":"Social Intelligence: The New Science of Human Relationships (Random House Large Print)","review":"I heard an interview with Daniel Goleman on NPR and thought this book sounded fascinating. Goleman explained that research into neuroscience was exploding, and that researchers had recently discovered biological, chemical and structural aspects of the brain that correspond to fluency in social interactions. When people strongly connect in social situations, the chemical activity in each person's brain actually synchs up with the other participants'. This causes a ripple effect throughout the body, causing greater and greater physiological connections. A person with high \\"social intelligence\\" has this effect to a much greater degree than others; an charimatic person can affect the physiology of a crowd of hundreds or even thousands. Goleman claims that such research will have a profound effect on the theory of social interactions and interpersonal relationships.Unfortunately, the ten-minute interview was much more interesting and informative than the book. After making that basic point in the first five pages in the introduction, Goleman wanders incoherently from topic to topic, with no attempt at all to structure a cohesive argument or to draw any overarching conclusions from the material he discusses. Instead, each chapter consists of a series of only loosely related anecdotes that supposedly correspond to one research study or another. Goleman makes no attempt to explain the connections between these subsections or to thread them together into a coherent whole. Indeed, the entire book consists almost entirely of a series of examples, but Goleman never explains what the examples are supposed to be illustrating.I found it impossible to read this book straight through. It's as if Goleman knew that most of the readers would just flip the book open at random and read a tiny snippet here and there. If the book is approached in that manner, a reader might think that the book looks pretty interesting and conclude that there must be something there. Goleman must have been banking on the fact that most people would not go beyond such superficial browsing. As someone who made a sincere attempt to read the book straight through, I actually feel deceived."},{"Title":"Social Intelligence: The New Science of Human Relationships (Random House Large Print)","review":"I am a huge fan of Daniel Goleman. He's the bestselling author who coined the term \\"Emotional Intelligence\\" with his 1995 book of the same name. Now he's got a new book, \\"Social Intelligence: The New Science of Human Relationships.\\" Social intelligence is the ability to read other people's cues and then act on them. Life is all about relationships, and there is a science to how we relate to each other. It's fascinating to see how Goleman breaks down each aspect of communication. We can learn how to more effectively express ourselves so that we feel understood. And we can learn how to better \\"read\\" other people so that we can better understand. This helps to improve our interactions and ultimately strengthen our relationships. He talks about \\"synchrony\\" or interacting smoothly at the nonverbal level, which is an important, yet often overlooked, part of relating. Goleman also scientifically explains \\"the capacity for joy\\" and how that affects our social intelligence. He shows how our resilience plays an important role in our happiness, which comes into play as we express ourselves to others."},{"Title":"Social Intelligence: The New Science of Human Relationships (Random House Large Print)","review":"I had loved Emotional Intelligence so much that I was really excited to read Social Intelligence as I expected an indepth look on Interpersonal Intelligence. However, this material is better covered by Louis Cozolino in his newest book \\"The Neuroscience of Social Relationships.\\""},{"Title":"Social Intelligence: The New Science of Human Relationships (Random House Large Print)","review":"I read a book a day, and have for 30 years. I sometimes read a book looking for that one scintillating page, sometimes it's just a paragraph, in some books only a sentence. I begin by reading the inside cover of the book. I then scan the preface, and turn to any random page usually deep in the book. I start to read. Whether something strikes my fancy or not, I turn to another page somewhere else in the book. I probably look at five pages this way. Within those five pages, I can tell if I am going to like this book.With Goleman's Social Intelligence, every page was fascinating. I literally had difficulty putting it down. This whole book is jam-packed with fabulous and interesting information on topics, which I feel are important to all of us as human beings. Some of this material has been covered in other places in other ways. When Goleman covers it, it seems so fresh.His work seems to indicate that as human beings, we are DESIGNED FOR SOCIALIBILITY. Our emotions are CONTAGIOUS. Now there's a thought I have never thought about. You can catch a cold; we all know that. What I didn't know is that I could literally catch somebody's emotional state.Yes, I know that classically trained psychoanalysts go through \\"transference issues\\" with their patients. That's not the point. What about being in a room with a group of very down people, and your soul picks up on it and accommodates them by making you depressed. This is what Goleman is writing about, and he gives example after example. The difference is that the author uses the phrase, \\"TOXIC PEOPLE\\".I have been fortunate in many of the friendships I have formed through the years. One of my friends is among the brightest people on earth. He is categorized as Mensa, Mensa, the top 1% of 1% of geniuses on earth. Several years ago when I was describing a relationship I had with another person, he said something so profound that it transformed me immediately. He said, \\"You know, you think you can reach down into the murk, and pull that person out. You can't, you never will, THEY PULL YOU IN.\\" He was so right, so penetrating, so spot on dead accurate. You can't change TOXIC PEOPLE, and Goleman writes about this. They change you. You simply have to AVOID THEM.I loved Goleman's story of \\"Yacht Envy\\". He talked about being on a magnificent yacht in the Mediterranean Sea. Each person on board had a room fit for a king. The yacht was a converted commercial vessel of some kind, but beautifully decked out. On the coffee table in each room was a copy of a very special book on the world's most beautiful yachts. There was a piece of paper pointing to a certain page in the book, and on that page was a multiage color layout of the very yacht you were on.Goleman talks about how everybody felt so fortunate to be on this beautiful craft. Suddenly one morning, as the guests climbed the stairs to the deck, they saw this other yacht four times longer than the yacht they were on, close by. It absolutely dwarfed the ship they had all thought so highly of, and then there was the tender. The tender is an auxiliary ship used to service the yacht they were looking at. It brings provisions and other goods to the yacht. The tender was bigger than the yacht they were on. The author ends the story by saying, \\"Is there such a thing as YACHT ENVY.\\"What you will learn from this book will blow you away. Some of the topics that I find fascinating and covered in detail in Social Intelligence include:Nourishing relationshipsReshaping our brains with enriching personal relationshipsForthrightness is the brain's DEFAULT responsePeople lying begin verbalizing 2/10ths of a second later than truth tellersA new explanation for Jung's concept of synchronicityI will leave you with this thought. You are probably familiar with MRI. The doctors use them medically to find tumors and so forth. There is a more complex machine called an fMRI which brain investigators are doing mind-boggling research with. As an example if you are wired up, and all of a sudden are expressing anger over something, a researcher can look at an MRI and see precisely what parts of the brain are lighting up during the emotional outburst. You can just guess at the possibilities of this work. It is covered thoroughly in this book as is over 100 other fabulous concepts. Read it, delight yourself, and don't put it down.

Welcome to the brave new world of \\"Social Neuroscience\\"! This book may change the way you see life, relationships, and how you approach both! In \\"Social Intelligence\\", the companion volume to the highly successful and informative \\"Emotional Intelligence\\", award-winning author Dr. Daniel Goleman examines the emerging science of Social Neuroscience and reveals it's most basic concept: \\"we are wired to connect\\" with each other. Our brains are \\"sociable\\" and interact, from the basic one-to-one relationship to those relationships much more complex and layered. He then tells us specifically how this happens in our everyday lives. From the bedroom to the boardroom to recreational activities and beyond, it's always there affecting us. Even more importantly, the book shows how the direct one-on-one neural bridge between two people emotionally affects the brain of the other person. That emphasis is how this book differs from \\"Emotional Intelligence\\" which dealt with what happens within the individual. Each individual social interaction becomes a mental thermostat, affecting both specific parts of the brain and individual emotional functions with each changing situation. Each new situation will \\"reset key aspects of our brain function as they orchestrate our emotions\\" each time. While each discussion gets technical, Dr. Goleman gives specific simple examples of everyday occurrences that we all can recognize and which reinforces his points.We can take this information and use it: at work, at home, in our relationships with friends, lovers, or strangers. Eye-opening findings abound, as well as things we have long suspected which are proven in the book. All of which occurs in normal environments or in environments where individuals are increasingly isolated by their cars, their TV, or their headphones whether in a crowd or alone. \\"Social Intelligence\\" is loaded with interesting findings, challenging concepts, and individual bits of data that most readiers will find fascinating. And best of all the \\"hidden patterns\\" that emerge. That alone will make this book rewarding for readers of almost any particular leaning, because it enlightens us about our \\"social brains\\" in this complex world. The identification by Dr. Goleman of the situational functioning of specific parts of the brain in this regard is quite stunning. This book does a wonderful job of giving us the latest findings and concepts from this field of Social Neuroscience. Highly recommended!

The subject of social intelligence intrigued me, but books like this can be so chock-full of scientific jargon that your eyes cross before you've finished the first half dozen pages. But what Goleman offers is a highly readable text, revealing much about the brain's role in our social interactions - from the most simple to the more complex. He cites numerous experimental studies that help the reader draw clear conclusions amid the complicated neurological reactions set off in our brains as we interact socially. The book increased my awareness of how I operate in similar situations.If you're interested in increasing your awareness and looking at how you operate, you may also be interested in Working on Yourself Doesn't Work: The 3 Simple Ideas That Can Instantaneously Transform Your Life, by Ariel and Shya Kane. The Kanes' no-nonsense approach to self-discovery debunks the myth that setting copious goals, making resolutions and being hard on yourself is the way to a better life.

Goleman provides lots of scientific tidbits, but little advice on how to actually describe, assess, or teach social intelligence as a set of practical competencies. As with his first book, \\"Emotional Intelligence: Why It May Be More Important than IQ,\\" educators and business users will find it necessary to develop their own methods for application.It's worth noting that this book was published a year after the publication of Dr. Karl Albrecht's book, \\"Social Intelligence: the New Science of Success.\\" Albrecht's book offers a more practical, \\"street level\\" treatment of the subject, with a five-point descriptive model of social intelligence, (\\"S.P.A.C.E.,\\" which stands for Situational Awareness, Presence, Authenticity, Clarity, and Empathy) and a primary focus on how those dimensions can be measured and developed.Recommendation: read both books."},{"Title":"Social Intelligence: The New Science of Human Relationships (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is more a book on how the body chemistry effects our behavior.

In a chapter about prisons, he scientifically expresses what I've witnessed over the last ten years, namely that prisons cultivate criminal instincts instead of \\"correcting\\" them. Our prisons, as they are today, should be called \\"corruptions\\" rather than \\"corrections.\\" The cure is worse than the disease, or rather in this case, the cure exacerbates the disease.Biologically speaking, survival in prison demands that the part of the brain called the amygdala be set for \\"paranoid hyper-vigilance.\\" The amygdala triggers the fight, flight or freeze response. Fear forces the amygdala to override the areas of the brain which are responsible for rational thought. A key to inhibiting these primitive responses is a group of neurons in the OFC (orbitofrontal cortex) that can curb impulses from the amygdala. The circuitry running from the amygdala to the OFC can be strengthened or weakened through conditioning. During imprisonment, we have a choice to mold this crucial brain circuitry for self-control. It's like molding a statue. In the early stages, you have a chance to get the pose just right, but once the arm or some other body part is in position, it quickly becomes too late to correct it.Most prisoners never get a chance to correct the habits and circumstances that keep them out of prison's revolving doors. As Goleman says, \\"Prisons are colleges for crime, strengthening an inmate's predilection and skill sets for criminality. Younger prisoners...typically become mentored by more seasoned inmates, so that on their release they are...endowed with greater skills as criminals.\\" I've witnessed this happen time and time again over the last ten years. Prisons are supposed to be a tool to protect society, but the opposite is happening. We put law breakers in prison to punish them and make them suffer, but then release them as more sophisticated and violent criminals to do ever greater damage to society.We can view criminals as being socially sick, an illness marked by lack of empathy for others and lack of emotional intelligence and impulse control. For various reasons they've violated the rights of others and the rules of society for their own selfish motives. This sickness is what needs to be \\"corrected.\\" Punishment and suffering do nothing to achieve this objective. It only makes it worse.Goleman makes a few recommendations. He says prisons need to be reinvented to offer a remedial neural education using programs which strengthen the circuits of the social brain for empathy and for regulating emotional impulses. These programs have been used in schools to reduce fighting by 69 percent, bullying by 75 percent and harassment by 67 percent.Another component of a better justice system would be the use of \\"restorative justice.\\" Criminals should have to face the emotional aftermath of their crimes and make amends to the victims. Victim impact sessions are already practiced in some states but not in the federal system. I had several victims in my string of robberies and I never had to face even one of them. I have no idea what I did to them. I don't know if they suffer from post traumatic stress disorder, if they had to quit their jobs, or of any way that my crimes may have negatively impacted their lives. I can only assume that I hurt them more than I'll ever know. But facing them and listening to them would have went a long way in helping me atone for my crimes and heal my social sickness, so that I can become a better functioning human being. But instead, I was thrown into a violent prison, a hell where everyone fights for respect and violence wins prestige, where the physically powerful prevail and fear rules all.Everything I've done to improve myself in prison, I've had to do on my own with little or no help from a soulless, robotic, prison bureaucracy. Even this book, Social Intelligence, had to be borrowed from another inmate, even though the information inside is invaluable to someone wanting to recover from a life of addiction and crime. If I didn't make a daily, conscious effort to repair my broken life, I would fall fast into a pit of bitterness, apathy and self-defeat as the vast majority of my fellow inmates have, only to be released back to the streets worse than before.David Allan ReevesAuthor of \\"Running Away From Me\\""},{"Title":"Social Intelligence: The New Science of Human Relationships (Random House Large Print)","review":"Daniel Goleman has created another educational masterpiece to follow up his book Emotional Intelligence (which taught us we could have a high IQ but act emotionally unintelligent). This book teaches us we can have excellent analytical skills but be very unintelligent in how we interact with people. He classifies social intelligence as our ability to listen, talk appropriately in conversations, tell \\"white lies\\" when necsasary to value peoples feelings over blunt truth, and understand how to react with people as to create rapport and trust. He believes that SQ in many ways is more important than IQ because the success in the world is more determined by how you get along and relate to people as opposed to how many A's you received on your report card. He writes about the importance of doctor's treating their patinces as people, it has proven that this dramatically reduces the amount of malpractice suits. He discusses what people care most about in bosses great listener, encourager, communicator, courageous, sense of humor, empathy, decisive, humble, takes responsibilty, and shares authority. He discusses how through inmate interactions prisons are breeding grounds for life long criminals and how to change that. If you are interested in the above read this book. It is a detailed road map of how our brains loop with other people to create interactions. You will learn a lot, I did."},{"Title":"Social Intelligence: The New Science of Human Relationships (Random House Large Print)","review":"Daniel Goleman has hit another home run with his new book on the contributions of neuroscience to understanding social behavior.

The rest essentially serves the purpose of supporting his findings.Being a career specialist, I particularly enjoyed the chapter on \\"Bosses: The Good, The Bad & The Ugly\\" and \\"The Socially Intelligent Leader.\\" Yes, strong emotional bonds among co-workers does make them more productive.Much of what Danial Goleman writes about in his book, are topics that you've had fleeting thoughts about, but didn't delve into deeply because you were...well...busy with life.

I have read and use all his books!"},{"Title":"Social Intelligence: The New Science of Human Relationships (Random House Large Print)","review":"In this companion volume to his bestseller, Emotional Intelligence, Goleman persuasively argues for a new social model of intelligence. He expresses concern at our creeping disconnection from one another as we connect instead to iPod, computer, and television. Another example of that disconnection is how medicine is being taken over by the \\"accountant's mentality,\\" which is a disservice to patient and doctor alike. \\"We are wired to connect,\\" Goleman says. \\"Neuroscience has discovered that our brain's very design makes it sociable, inexorably drawn into an intimate brain-to-brain linkup whenever we engage with another person. That neural bridge lets us affect the brain-and so the body-of everyone we interact with, just as they do us.\\"Drawing on numerous studies, Goleman examines how our brains are wired for altruism, compassion, concern and rapport. The skills of social intelligence include the social awareness of empathy, listening, and social cognition. He demonstrates how the power of social interaction influences mood and brain chemistry and discusses the \\"toxicity\\" of insult and unpleasant social experience and the positive effects of neurochemicals that are released in loving relationships and caregiving.He shows how social sensitivity and wisdom can profoundly reshape conflicts. In one encounter in Iraq, a quick-witted U.S. commander turned a Muslim mob's threats into laughter when he ordered his soldiers to kneel, lower rifles and smile - averting a potentially fatal clash. Given our socially reactive brains, we must \\"be wise,\\" he says, and be aware of the ways that our moods influence the biology of each life we touch."},{"Title":"Social Intelligence: The New Science of Human Relationships (Random House Large Print)","review":"I happen to like anecdotal books, and this one is full of anecdotes. I also like science when it's popularized for the general reader, and Goleman provides information on assorted research in easily understandable language. Neuroscience is simply fascinating to me and I was eager to get more deeply into the subject, but \\"Social Intelligence\\" didn't strike me as a particularly deep book. The basic premise, that we are social creatures whose brains and bodies can alter upon exposure to other people, and who can in turn alter others, is riveting...but it is essentially repeated all through the book without moving on from there. However, I did enjoy all those anecdotes and descriptions of various theories and experiments. I wish it had gone a bit deeper, but considering that it was written in 2006, it could be that there wasn't enough depth to be plumbed at that time. If that's the case, I'd really like to read something more current and detailed, perhaps with fewer anecdotes...thanks to this book, been there, done that."},{"Title":"Social Intelligence: The New Science of Human Relationships (Random House Large Print)","review":"It's such an interesting topic but I wish someone else had written this.He cites many examples to back up what he's trying to say but it's so disconnected.

Meh.It's ironic that this book is often about how we pick up on unconscious social cues and yet the writer seems out of touch - like he's from another time. He uses words like \\"busybody\\" and \\"hitherto\\" and I can overlook that but every other line is a metaphor and every other one of those metaphors uses the word \\"dance\\".

According to Goleman, social intelligence should be defined as what we sense about others:* Primal empathy - sensing emotional signals and feeling with others* Attunement - listening with full receptivity* Empathic accuracy - understanding other's thoughts, feelings, and intentions* Social cognition - knowing how the social world worksAnd, what we then do with that awareness by way of:* Synchrony - interacting smoothly at the nonverbal level* Self-presentation - effectively presenting ourselves* Influence - shaping the outcome of social interactions* Concern - caring about others' needs and acting accordingly.These factors operate at both a neurological reaction level to signals from others - the \`low road' in our emotional economy, and through choice at the more thoughtful \`high-road' which gives us some control over our inner life. A warm smile in response to a hateful glare is possible, if we think about what is happening as the contagion of the glare threatens our mood.Now, if you think that Goleman is going to provide help with this \`high-road' of relationship management, think again. This book is about an emerging science, (studies with regard to the brain's responses to social interactions) and not about the how-to of relational management. I found the book to be a heavy read, although Goleman often uses stories from everyday life to introduce topics and the supporting research results. This book is recommended for people who not only have an interest in social science but also have the time to study it. Dennis DeWilde, author of \\"The Performance Connection\\""},{"Title":"Social Intelligence: The New Science of Human Relationships (Random House Large Print)","review":"One of the best books I read last year! Daniel Goleman, the author of Emotional Intelligence, has written a new book that focuses on how humans beings connect to each other and how those connections are learned or formed. He does a good job of balancing very interesting anecdotes with descriptions of how all of this works at the biological level.He spends a lot of time explaining how these social connections are learned as a child and how what we do or don't learn when we are young affects us later. As a mom with a new baby, some of the experiments were actually scary! He talked about how some moms can naturally tell when their babies need a break and leave them alone for a while and how others continue to \\"get in their face\\" and how this changes how the baby interacts with people as an adult!If you've ever wondered how you knew someone was annoyed when they didn't say anything (or how someone else did and you didn't) or why you seem to connect so well with some people and not others, or how you could tell if someone is lying, or how much of our behavior is nurture versus nature, ... well then you should definitely read this book. It's much more of a \\"why\\" book than a \\"how-to\\" book and it makes for some fascinating reading.I just found out last week that Daniel Goleman used to teach at the massage school I'm studying at, Boulder College of Massage Therapy.

It was an eye-opener for someone in a leadership role operating under unusual and extremely stressful conditions. None of my military leadership training, nor any of my mentors in the military, had prepared me for leading people on an emotional level.Naturally, Goleman's most recent book strikes a similar chord. Whether it's a social, business or casual interaction, this book explains many of the fundamental dynamics of the human brain when interacting with another person. While much of it seems intuitive, and many of the referenced sytudies have been cited in other works, this book packages it all together rather nicely. Fans of the Cameron Diaz/Ben Stiller movie \\"There's Something About Mary\\" will even recognize a scientific correlation to the famed \\"don't go out with a loaded gun\\" discussion.

In my opinion it is heavy reading. I generally can read a book a week. This one took about 50% longer. There are a number of reasons for this. There is very little white space on any page. The subject matter is new and different and unless you have made a deep study of the brain, its various parts and functions, you will often need to refresh your memory about what the various parts do.Having said that, I would highly recommend the book to anyone who wishes to learn more about why we do what we do. There are some very valuable lessons that have application in everyday life. For example, Goleman talks about how fear in social situations engages the the flight or fight part of the brain, overriding the cognitive part. He gives everyday examples of how this shows up in our daily lives. The teacher randomly calling on students in the classroom can evoke social fear, shutting down the cognitive/learning part of the brain.Goleman deals with numerous other social situations in life - love, anger, empathy, prejudices, crime and punishment. His insights are sharp and easy to understand. Some are real eye-openers.The book is long, some 334 pages with 65 pages of notes. This means that the concepts set forth in the book have been well researched and he provides the sources for those who wish to do additional research on a particular point of view.If you have any interest in why people do what they do, then this is an important book.

Humans can better themselves and there is no age that is too old to do so.

Baron-Cohen defines Asperger's underlying neural pattern as \\"low on empathy, high on systematizing\\". This is an important behavioral pattern in social life that must be conciously addressed because many of us are working in high-tech industries, usually in software development in one form or another. Although our natural inclination maybe to have genuine interest in other human beings and how they think or feel, in other words have empathy, at least from my own experience constantly being involved in \\"systematizing complex information\\" maybe resulting in lessened empathy so crucial to social intelligence. Goleman assures us that \\"making sense\\" of humans is no easy task. But we must try and this book is at least a friendly guide. Success in this endeavor has clear positive ramifications in marriage, parenting, and work.While I was reading this the name \\"Baron-Cohen\\" sounded familiar. Where did I hear this name before? BORAT! The actor who plays this character Sacha Baron Cohen. Any relation? I only checked Wikipedia and didn't immediately see a link, although one teaches at Cambridge and the other studied there.

He developed the theory of multiple intelligences - and a lot of good research backs him on this - since it's around twenty years old and still developing. Basic point is humans have more than one kind of intelligence and each has more of some types than others. The practical use of this - and Gardners' writings - is, in education, the recognition - and acting on - of multiple modes of learning - teaching so the hands on kids, the readers, the talkers/socializers, etc. get the information in the way(s) they can best integrate it. Doesn't stand still either - a new intelligence has definitely been added (lot's of work/research to verify it is a true intelligence all its' own) and two more are in the research phase.

I had once had a great job that was gradually being turned into a mind prison affecting my health.After I read this book that explained how anyone you spend a lot of time with can really affect you for good or for bad, I realized there was no hope in my job anymore. My supervisor and her abnormal growing demands were making me phsycially ill. I had the worse allergic reaction I've ever had in my life and suffered for 2 months of agony.As I tried to withdraw from so much support I was being relied on for as the only support person at night for 80+ attorneys and 150 staff total, this supervisor was suddenly demanding a \\"strong\\" relationship with me. She treated me like her prisoner in so many ways. I might as well have been chained to her. I came in early for the communications seminar and there she was, sitting at a desk with a chair waiting for me. That's right, chained to her.I realized that it wasn't going to work, she wasn't going to back off making me her prisoner and it was making me sick. I felt like I was dying. I had no energy to do anything after work. This lady would supervise me from her home late at night. She was just one of the most difficult people I've ever worked for, like something out of the military. I was nearly a perfect employee. I had no complaints for my work in the entire 2 years I had been there. I had no problems at all, except one - and that was a sick supervisor wanting to make me sick too.After reading parts of Social Intelligence, I decided this lady had done enough damage to my health. I stood up to Ms. Seargent by making my case about her to H.R. and left. I figured out I no longer needed to be making so much money to have a high quality life. In fact, I could easily make half of what I was making and still live a comfortable life.I have recently shifted my life to living in the moment and not for the future.

Then, towards the final chapters, he tells us how we can apply that knowledge to our lives and society. Its not nuture vs. nature, but rather the nuture OF nature that shapes who we are and how we intereact with the world. Social Intelligence will let you know why you are who you are, why those you love interact with you the way they do, and how you can effect change in yourself or others. Personally, I put the book down with a much deeper understanding of myself and everyone in my life.

Required reading. 5+ stars."},{"Title":"Social Intelligence: The New Science of Human Relationships (Random House Large Print)","review":"The good news is that the book presents fascinating tidbits such as how certain facial expressions universally represent the same emotions throughout all cultures, why most people use their left arm to cradle infants, and a layman's guide to neuroscience. He has great ideas on why emotions are contagious, a striking definition of \\"rapport\\" (mutual attention + sharing positive feeling + a well-coordinated nonverbal duet), and the neuroanatomy of a kiss (hint: the eyes sit at the critical juncture where the uppermost part of the emotional center and the lowermost part of the thinking center meet).The bad news is that the ingredients sit on the kitchen counter. There are no overriding concepts that tie the data together in a compelling fashion. As interesting as they might be, the facts and theories as presented in the book don't significantly contribute to one's understanding of social intelligence. Goleman's earlier book \\"Emotional Intelligence\\" promised that you could improve your EQ. \\"Social Intelligence\\" does not quite deliver on that promise."},{"Title":"Social Intelligence: The New Science of Human Relationships (Random House Large Print)","review":"During the first third of this book, I was completely carried along by the scientific outlook and optimism. There are two mutually supporting aspects of social intelligence discussed in detail. One is human relations by the instinctual fast mode, called \\"the low road\\" and the other is the more intellectual and slow mode called \\"the high road\\". The distinctions are fascinating. Without the modern neurological biochemistry, his book could have been written 100 years ago, and probably was, many times over. What is now different is that both fast and slow thought processes can be traced to particular parts of the brain and to more or less of certain biochemicals being present. This does not yet lead to any better understanding of social intelligence, which is practiced so well by successful politicians, clergy, opinion leaders, and rabble rousers who would be dictators. Social intelligence is said to be at least as important as scientific or technical intelligence, and to be under appreciated. Maybe so, but was Benito Mussolini really smarter than Enrico Fermi? Was Hideki Tojo really smarter than Akio Morita of Sony?The interplay with detailed physiology of human interactions and physical damage is given in great detail, and most of it is probably accurate. Unfortunately, Goleman agrees with the standard dogma on cholesterol and blood pressure. See book: Malignant Medical Myths, 2006 (MMM). Goleman gave much attention to chemical differences in criminals. What a shock that the true effects of cholesterol in criminals is completely ignored. A large number of clinical studies showed that cholesterol levels &lt;180 were associated with depression, accidents, suicide, homicide, antisocial personality disorder in criminals and army veterans, cocaine and heroin addiction, and high relapse rates after detoxification (Buydens-Branchey & Branchey, 2003). A review on 32 studies found a strong association of low cholesterol (especially &lt;200 mg/dL) with violent behaviors and violent death (Golomb, 1998).Regarding criminals and recidivism, after many other examples of treatments and results, Goleman wrote (on p296) of the 4-month multi systemic treatment (MST). This was carried out by counselors who followed the young ex-cons and tries to make them spend as much time with favorable people already known to the ex-con, whoever they are. That is, cultivate a web of healthy connections. He actually wrote: \\"...For young offenders who have gone through the program, recidivism rates tracked over three years after release drop by anywhere from 25 to 70 percent.\\"This is meaningless, since the drop must apply to a group. There had to have been a single mean or median quoted, and there was not. Furthermore, these are not clearly absolute or relative rates (see MMM). On top of this, the drop in % recidivism has no obvious comparative -- was the 25-70% compared with those who did not go through the program at all? Of those offered the program, how many refused or did not complete it? If refusals or dropouts are high, then the program might show an overall drop in recidivism of only 5-10%.The key citation was: Borduin CM et al., Multi systemic Treatment of Serious Juvenile Offenders: Long-Term Prevention of Criminality and Violence. J Consulting Clinical Psych 1995;63(4):569-578. This paper had an uninformative abstract with no numerical outcomes. No major medical journal would have accepted it with such a poor abstract. The numbers of refusers and dropouts was internally inconsistent and hard to decipher.In the body of the paper, it was clear that the 4-year recidivism rate with MST, determined by how many were arrested, was compared with ordinary 1-on-1 talk therapy (IT) and with complete refusal of the programs. Of treatment refusers, the recidivism rate was 87.5%. Of IT dropouts it was 71%, of IT completers it was 71%, showing the total uselessness of talk therapy as conventionally done. Of MST dropouts it was 47%, and of MST completers, 22%, a good improvement one would think.There was complete refusal by 12% of the original group. IT dropouts were 33%. MST dropouts were 24%. So summing 24% dropouts and 12 % refusals, 36% assigned to MST did not start or did not finish it. This seems to mean that of all those offered MST and completing it, the recidivism rate was 50%, a good result.My suspicions were confirmed that some of the trial data was presented by Goleman in a glib and misleading manner. This was not the only case. Mutant statistics do not foster understanding. See Calculated Risk by Gerd Gigerenzer, 2002.Toward the end the topics became somewhat more political; for example, on p317 Goleman noted \\"...policies that burden the poorest countries with such huge debts that they have too little left to pay for food or medical care for their children.\\" No alternative is given. Was it supposed to be better to have foreign aid without limit and no strings? How well has this worked?At first the referencing seemed to be of the highest academic standard, with numbers in the text. But of the 26 citations to Chapter 20, for example, only 6 were to peer-reviewed journals. There is an extensive index, but recidivism was not found.An enticing book with many interesting topics on human interactions and their physical and chemical bases, but beware trial results with relative risk and no dropout rates, and those with oversimplified results (see MMM).*****Buydens-Branchey, L., Branchey, M.

Some of what is written in this book may seem obvious, but in the context of the electronic media we increasingly use to connect with each other there are new social issues to explore.I recommend this book as a starting point to those managing and interacting with people in an electronic age and as an adjunct to Dr Goleman's earlier works.

We impact our environment & our environment impacts us. SocialIntelligence focuses on how this happens in the realm of human interaction.Utilizing cutting- edge, clinical research and neural science technology,Daniel Goleman describes what happens in the human brain when we are engagedin social situations . Our communications, including, facial expressions, bodylanguage, thoughts and words, send instant neurological messages betweenparticipants - it's a dance which stimulates specific areas of the brain,releasing any number of proteins & hormones. This chain reaction affects thestate of our physical condition, contributing to well being or discomfort anddis-ease. This neurological activity is automatic & mechanical, based on thememory of similar, past experiences stored in our brain.. Not an accurateaccount of what is really happening currently. Coleman identifies thisreactive behavior as the \\"Low Road mode\\" of brain operation, rooted insurvival. I love what he calls the \\"High Road\\" mode, where we are capable ofbypassing past based behaviors. Coleman observes, if we simply see what isactually in front of us & not get hooked by the brains mechanical referencing,we make appropriate, more satisfying choices, see a \\"bigger picture\\"& are morein synch with what/who is showing up in our lives.Another book that rocked my awareness of \\"being\\" was How to Create a MagicalRelationship by Ariel & Shya Kane.

It is a revolutionary book about how we are more connected to each other in ways that we would never have thought possible.Another book which shows how we are connected is How To Create a Magical Relationship by Ariel and Shya Kane. It takes you on a journey of discovering how individuals can make a difference in other people's lives and how we are impacted by other people through the elegant use of narratives of real people's lives.

This one recent area of study was turned a paperweight of a book.I must admit I was not impressed with his earlier book Emotional Intelligence either. I like the key ideas presented in both books, even if they are rehashing of other ideas, but like many pop/business type books both of these \\"Intelligence\\" books are really just pamphlets with a whole lot of stuffing. I await another tomb on Childhood Intelligence; surely we could get 500 pages out of that.Mr. Goleman wrote at least one great book that I have had the pleasure to read. (I certainly have not read everything he wrote. He also contributes articles to various Buddhist journals which have always been enjoyable to read.) If you have not read his account of one of the Mind and Life Institute gatherings with the Dalai Lama I suggest you pick up a copy of \\"Destructive Emotions.\\" If there is filler in this book it is for good reason. Mr. Goleman's feel for the subject creates a sense of excitement which overcomes the potentially dry subject matter.Perhaps the demands of pop business publishing imposed on the Intelligencer books, are so powerful a wonderful thinker and a good writer must lower his standards."},{"Title":"Social Intelligence: The New Science of Human Relationships (Random House Large Print)","review":"This book describes the latest advances in neurology research and uses them to explain the social behavior of people.

It regulates \\"low road\\" activities in some cases but act as an interpreter after the fact in some other cases.the has a very wide scope and a good framework in organizing the accumulated knowledge in the area.

In this sense, this book is a good window into neurology-based behavioral research. On the other hand, it offers few practical advices. Most of the facts about human behavior described in the book are common sense. Therefore, this book has little value as guidance in social intelligent.I found Part , the epilogue and appendices most worth reading.

Using this construct as a common thread he is able to articulate how we have been programmed to sense things \\"socially\\" in milliseconds and dialog and writen words in seconds and minutes. The most powerful example used is how people on a common platform, when something is not ordinary,can be quickly calmed down by the simple, social connection of seeing how others are perceiving the event. From that construct we can now all see why it is much easier for us to communicate in person as opposed to reading something or talking on a phone. Furthermore our \\"High Brain\\" as we develop can deteriorate the use of our \\"Low Brain\\" leaving us less able to effectively communicate socially. Finally he opines that we can retrieve our \\"Low Brain\\" awareness and compliment it with our \\"High Brain\\" communication by using leaning tools to \\"Re-Teach\\" ourselves how to read \\"Low Brain\\" signals. And if we don't it is to our own detriment.

Many people think that San Francisco, with the Beat Generation, was the \\"center\\" of bohemian living, but the City of Angels had quite a thriving culture of its own.It all grew out of the coffeehouse scene, where a constantly changing group of poets, literary gypsies, writers in exile (real or self-imposed) and others, would get together and weave pieces of the literary tapestry of Los Angeles. Rolfe profiles the famous, and not so famous, including Theodore Dreiser, Charles Bukowski, Henry Miller, John Steinbeck, Aldous Huxley and the Mann brothers (Thomas and Heinrich). There is also a piece on Upton Sinclair's 1934 campaign for Governor of California. Running on the Socialist Party ticket, he received 45 percent of the vote despite a major smear campaign against him.As part of a musical family (the virtuoso violinist Yehudi Menuhin was an uncle), Rolfe grew up in a household that offered a place to go for musicians and other artists-in-exile. This book was not written as some piece of dry literary history, it was written by someone who was there and lived through that era, and has spent much of his life writing about it.As a lifelong voracious reader, I very much appreciated Rolfe's putting a person and life to the names I have seen on book covers my whole life. Anyone with an interest in 20th century American literature will enjoy this book. I think I'll visit my local library and see how many of these authors are in the stacks. Meantime, this book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Literary L.A.: Expanded From the Original Classic and Featuring the Coffeehouse Scene Then and Now","review":"I really love this book. I have the original smaller version from 1981, published by Chronicle Books. This first edition is featured in a separate section on Amazon with two reviews--and I'm shocked at the hostility of both reviewers, who seem to think there was and is no literary accomplishment in Los Angeles. The expanded third edition, as shown here, is much more appreciated, given the good reviews it has received. It's fascinating to read about talented people like Huxley, Thomas Mann, Jack London, Jack Kerouac, Somerset Maugham, etc....and how living and working in Los Angeles influenced their careers and personal lives. These bohemians-in-exile were free-thinkers, ahead of their time while living creative lives in and around Hollywood. Read this book if you're interested in the literary tradition of Los Angeles. You'll especially like it if you're an Aldous Huxley fan."},{"Title":"Literary L.A.: Expanded From the Original Classic and Featuring the Coffeehouse Scene Then and Now","review":"Lionel Rolfe's book is a delightful meandering journey through the past and present of LA literature. At first glimpse, it's not constructed along the lines of an argument. That's because it is not, by Rolfe's own admission, an academic treatise. But after a good read, one finds that a consistent message does come through. And argument or not, it's a great book to curl up with because it gives readers a chance to revel in the past.As one of its most important themes, the book outlines several strains of the Bohemian movement as expressed in Los Angeles. Stressing that Bohemians came from a variety of political backgrounds, Rolfe nonetheless shows the radical strains informing their activities. He also laments that these days, there's not much going on that could be considered truly radical in LA literature, a loss he traces in part to the decline of the coffee house.Literary LA also gives a geographical tour of many of the sites around the city which feature connections to past literary greats. Who knew that Monrovia and Pasadena housed some of America's greatest writers, let alone a small house off an alley in Hollywood where Jack London MAY have slept?Maybe the best chapter is the one on Bukowski. Here Rolfe talks about spending time with the great poet, and here the book gets most gritty. And delicious.If you have an interest in LA literature (and if Rolfe is right, more American literature than you think is Los Angeles-connected) you need to buy this book."},{"Title":"Literary L.A.: Expanded From the Original Classic and Featuring the Coffeehouse Scene Then and Now","review":"Lionel Rolfe's In Search of LITERARY L.A. is meticulous, catholic, personable and intimate.

And, of which he speaks isspoken with integrity, insight, and a touching charming boyish wonder. And compassion.Rolfe reports, extrapolates, describes the indescribable fabric of a city without one - then or now - and this fabric's effects on an art much tied to, and determined by, time and place: Literature.Literary L.A.'s third edition, like its previous ones, is written in a fierce journalistic style, with ample and eccentric quotes woven in, dates, names, places - whos whens wheres - about writers as different from each other as their respective reactions to Los Angeles. Love and Hate; Sickness and Death; Nightmare and Eden. (Macolm Lowry hated it but it wasthe place he met and was delivered to B.C. by his beloved Marguerie, a native; Nathaniel West suffering on his back with prostate saw the hills burning from his stifling Aptos-Sed room and wrote one of the most powerful scenes of L.A. in Twentieth-century literature; Bukowski talked of Europe and Art as he stumbled the trashy wine-hazed alleyways of central L.A,)The gang's all here - West, Lowry, Faulkner, Huxley, Bukowski and so many many others.

As a writer Gordon emigrated to America and mixed with the rich and famous and the upper echeleons of society. He became very wealthy in his own right and from a legacy left to him. He was able to buy an historic house in Charleston and have the surgery required to become a woman. Dawn then met and married a poor black man,and faced a future of racism and abuse from the community, eventually having to leave Charleston and after many shifts becoming very poor herself and joining the black community of her husband. She gives birth to a daughter and is now a grandmother. But her husband can be described as a scoundrel,having had affairs,almost killing Dawn with his abuse and then being diagnosed with schitzophrenia. The ! fact that Dawn could be so forgiving is a testament to her strength and character. I first read about Dawn in a magazine in 1997 and spent a very long time tracking down this book,eventually getting it from Amazon.com. Reading of Dawn's British roots in Heathfield and Tunbridge Wells was so neat as all of my relatives come from that part of the world too,so the places she mentioned I was able to picture in my mind. This book is a very good story of an incredible life of unbelievable contrasts. How many people could cope with what Dawn has been through and come out such a lovely person."},{"Title":"DONNING INTERNATIONAL ENCYCLOPEDIC PSYCHIC DICTIONARY, THE","review":"This author did a great service to anyone in metaphysics who needs a quality reference tool.Should be called Metaphysics Encyclopedia though."},{"Title":"DONNING INTERNATIONAL ENCYCLOPEDIC PSYCHIC DICTIONARY, THE","review":"June Bletzer's &quot;Encyclopedic Psychic Dictionary&quot; covers a vast array of topics, from nineteenth-century spiritualism to twentieth-century occultism, all the way up to today's many varieties of new age mysticism.

Compiled and edited by Cyril Birch. Associate editor Donald Keene. 492 pp. New York : Grove Press, 1965.Birch's anthology has always been one of my favorite books. In contrast to the more recent mammoth compilations of Victor Mair (1335 pages) and John Minford (1176 pages), the Birch, at a mere 492 pages, is a far more modest and manageable proposition.Unlike the Mair and Minford, it can be held easily in the hand while reading, and it is printed in a large clear font on spacious pages in which the lines have room to breathe. Modest in size it is also modest in presentation. Selections are preceded by only the briefest of introductions, and footnotes have been kept to a minimum.The Birch is also unlike the former two anthologies in that it has restricted itself to contributions from just twenty-one translators, most of them well-known names such as A. C. Graham, Donald Keene, Ezra Pound, Arthur Waley, Gary Snyder, and Burton Watson. In other words, its complement of translators is not swelled by a substantial contingent of second-tier, relatively unknown, and sincere though not particularly inspired academic translators.One happy consequence of this is that the Birch, although in terms of quantity it holds perhaps only a third as much material or less than the Mair or Minford, has a higher relative proportion of quality translations. In other words, most of its selections actually read, not so much as 'translations' but as good literature - the tone, feelings, imagery, rhythms, and control of sound are what we expect to find in original works. Anything less than such excellence is, of course, hardly worth bothering with, and there is a lot of such excellence in the Birch.As for Birch's selections, he seems to have struck a nice balance between prose and poetry of different kinds. We are given, for example, thirty-three poems from the 'Book of Songs,' some rendered by Waley and others by Pound. We also find such things as 'The Songs of Ch'u;' the Taoist Chuang Tzu; Burton Watson's 'Grand Historian' SSu-ma Ch'ien; Rhyme Prose; Letters; Satires; the Poetry of the Recluse; the great T'ang poets Wang Wei, Li Po, and Tu Fu; Prose Essays; T'ang Short Stories; other great poets such as Li Ho and Li Shang-yin, as well as many other fine but lesser known writers.The book also includes a substantial selection from the Sung Dynasty, and is rounded out with two Yuan Dynasty plays, an extract from the Yuan novel, 'The Men of the Marshes,' and a modest but useful Bibliography which offers a number of suggestions for further reading.There is an enormous amount of pleasure to be had from this book, and instruction too. For in reading it we learn a great deal about the sensibility of a people who have been described by Pierre Ryckmans, not without some justice, as &quot;the most intelligent people in the world&quot; ('Chinese Shadows,' Viking, 1977). One of my great favorites in the Birch anthology has always been the brilliant 'Essay on Literature' ('Wen fu') by Lu Chi (+ 754-805). Here is a line from Shih-hsiang Chen's admirable translation (p.208) :&quot;The argument (shuo) with glowing words and cunning parables persuades.&quot;What Lu Chi seems to be saying is that &quot;theses are convincing, but deceptive.&quot; As such the line becomes a caution against trusting too much in theses and 'rational' argument, a caution against lending ourselves too readily to what Lin Yutang has called an excessive, as opposed to a more reasonable, use of reason. Lu Chi's are words that a Cartesian and ever more Frenchified West, with its slick and deodorized armies of specialists, analysts, and technicians, would do well to take to heart if the relentless Juggernaut of Reason now underway isn't to end up crushing everything beneath its wheels.For anyone who would like to get a good idea of what Chinese Literature is all about, and to actually enjoy the experience of finding out, there could be no better book than Cyril Birch's anthology. The Mair and Minford are all very well in their way and serve as useful references, but they are hardly books that one can sit down and read with pleasure from beginning to end.The Birch, however, is just such a book, and I have no hesitation in recommending it to anyone who would like to begin exploring one of the richest and most interesting literatures in the world.Here, for those who may want to know, are details of the Mair and Minford anthologies :THE COLUMBIA ANTHOLOGY OF TRADITIONAL CHINESE LITERATURE.

I didn't like it."},{"Title":"Darkside: Of Magic Scorned","review":"Beyond our mortal existence lies another world called Darkside where beings of the occult rule. Once Darkside possessed fertile fields and bustling cities, but it now lies in decay and ruin. During the Dark Ages worshipers of the Dragon crossed into the mortal world to bring back humans for sacrificial and breeding purposes. If the portal to the mortal realms can be breached again, they will begin kidnapping anew in order to bring power back to Darkside.On the mortal side, Anlese, a powerful white witch, seeks to protect mortal humans and their short life spans with the power she wields. She believes human beings show more promise in protecting the resources of their world than the immortal inhabitants of the Darkside. But she's over a hundred years old and must leave her legacy to another. Between the worlds of Darkside and mortals lies a portal she has long protected. When her great grandson Tyler's reckless lifestyle negates him as an heir, Anlese demands that he bring his wife to her.With her husband's death in a car accident and after ten months recovering from her injuries and drug addiction, Julienne had no choice but to fall in with Tyler's family's plans for her. Her beauty and career as a supermodel destroyed, she has no where else to turn. Even as her growing psychic gifts foreshadow danger, Julienne finds herself at the family estate with great-grandmother Anlese and cousin Morgan Saint-Evanston.Immediately upon her arrival at the airport, Julienne begins her humorous conflict with Morgan. Their sparring and brittle humor brings a welcome counterpoint to this dark tale. Morgan is a wizard and an assassin who's renounced his powers but is immortal. Renouncing one's powers isn't enough, however; a wizard may walk away from magic, but magic, especially dark magic, doesn't allow itself to be scorned forever.Although Morgan doesn't age, the centuries still bring about a horrifying, long disintegration. Julienne brings danger to him, arousing emotions he thought dead. As All Hallow's Eve rapidly approaches and he must leave the ancestral home, Julienne learns the true nature of the man she's falling in love with, and the dangers posed by both Darkside and the Dragon itself.DARKSIDE: OF MAGIC SCORNED is sharp, crisp story telling at it's best. Despite the bleak overtones, the novel is riveting and impossible to put down. As the tension builds, the reader transitions right along with Julienne from the mortal to the fantastic, completely lost in the tale. Indeed, the complexity created between the human world and the immortal, the tangled relationships, distrust and betrayals combine in a breathtaking depth. Masterful. If you read only one fantasy novel this year, make it this one! I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF IMAGINARY BEINGS","review":"Borges has compiled a zoology of the imagination under the title The Book of Imaginary Beings. He arranges these fantastical creatures from world literature alphabetically, but urges the reader to skip around, looking for subjects of interest. Some are familiar creatures: centaurs, nymphs, harpies, sirens, banshee, phoenix, hippogriffs, minotaur, mandrakes, and unicorns. Others I failed to recognize: A Bao A Qu, lamed wufniks, kujata, nagas, odradek, catoblepas, and others.Ctesias, physician to the Persian emperor Artaxerxes Mnemon, compiled a deficient description of distant India in the fourth century B.C., in which he mentions the crocotta, a blend of a dog and a wolf. The Roman writer Pliny expands on this work by describing a cross between the hyena and antelope.Kafka tells about an unnamed creature, that is half cat and half lamb, not only in appearance, but also in behavior. C. S. Lewis describes chilling monsters in his fantasy fiction Perelandra. Dante paints a vivid, horrifying picture of Cerberus, a creature with clawed hands that rip the skin of the souls of the damned as they file past him. In The Time Machine H. G. Wells predicts the future split of mankind into the weak, aristocratic Eloi living on the surface, and the carnivorous Morlocks, a race of underground proletarians that feast on the Eloi.While I enjoyed perusing The Book of Imaginary Beings, this little collection is not among his best works. Perhaps, his structured approach, that of assembling accurate depictions of creatures from literature, unduely prevented Borges from freely exercising his own uniquely creative imagination. Nonetheless, the reader familiar with Borges will find this little book an interesting addition to a larger collection of his works. The Book of Imaginary Beings was co-authored with Margarita Guerrero.The first edition with 82 topics was published in Mexico in 1957 and titled Handbook of Fantastic Zoology. In 1967 a second edition with 34 additional entries was published in Buenos Aires. My 1969 yellowed paperback edition (Penguin Books, UK) is slightly larger with 120 subjects.

The only thing missing, of course, is more creatures. Borges himself begins the work with a disclaimer that any such undertaking can never be complete, yet there was plenty of room for more here.

But the book becomes deeper and more intriguing as it goes on, tapping into philosophy and common imaginings around the world.There are several religion-based creatures -- the Biblical Levithian, Swedenborg's angels and demons, Mohammed's heavenly steed Buraq, Judaical golems (which aren't quite the same as other creatures, since people have to make them), and supernatural versions of real animals, like the white elephant that appeared before the birth of Buddha or Chinese foxes.But even more numerous are the mythic creatures, from the usual (centaurs, unicorns, hellhounds, gryphons) to the obscure (the A Bao A Qu, an insubstantial little thing that follows people up the stairs). These are a more colourful bunch, especially since many of them -- dragons, the hare in the moon, the basilisk -- recur in different countries, and Borges told readers of most of those.And to round it off, Borges included creatures invented in literature -- Homer and Dante's mythic creatures, Poe's Antarctic creatures, Kafka, Lewis Carroll's version of a Cheshire cat, and C.S. Lewis's alien creatures from the \\"Space Trilogy.\\" These authors all created creatures that were almost too weird, but which also seemed relatively likely (as invented animals go).\\"The Book of Imaginary Beings\\" is actually very well-rounded, with lots of bizarre or relatively unknown creatures. You'd expect a bunch of typical mythic creatures just tossed together, but fortunately Borges goes way behind the call of duty, from the A Bao A Qu to the Zaratan (a carnivorous living island).Borges obviously had great respect for these various legends, since he treats them as seriously as if they were scientifically proven. And he did his research, including duplicates and variations from across the world (not all of them, though), such as the Guardians of the four directions: for the Chinese, it was four tiger spirits, while it was four angelic beasts for the kabbalists.Borges writes this in a solemn, scholarly manner, but it's still very easy to read (\\"It is a monster of form, inspired by the devil of symmetry in the imagination of sculptors, potters and ceramicists\\"). He also includes translations of the beings' names, and quite a few snippets of text and poetry that describe them. Even ancient nonfiction, such as Lucretius insisting that a creature like the centaur couldn't exist. Okay, whatever.\\"The Book of Imaginary Beings\\" seems like a rather minor work for a legendary author. But taken on its own, this little mythic bestiary is a solid little read."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF IMAGINARY BEINGS","review":"This book is amazing.

Great for when you don't have much time to read, but you want something interesting to think about or something to make you smile."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF IMAGINARY BEINGS","review":"In addition to being a brilliant and talented author, Jorge Luis Borges also had a strong interest in mythology, fantasy and philosophy. It shines through in this book, a field guide, of sorts, to the imagination. While it may not be amongst his best works, it IS a fun read, and one gets the feeling it was really a labor of love for Borges. Spanning the realms of folklore, mythology, theology and literature, this volume winds up being perhaps one of the closest modern equivalents to a medieval bestiary. While not quite like Carol Rose's 'Spirits, Fairies, Leprechauns and Goblins,' or Mack & Mack's 'Field Guide to Demons, Fairies, Fallen Angels and Other Subversive Spirits,' I thoroughly enjoyed reading through this little book. And, as Borges himself says in the introduction, this really is meant to be a book one flips through occaisonally as any good volume of miscellenea.Lurking in the pages of this book, one finds such familiar beasts as dragons (of east and west), lamiae, harpies, the minotaur, satyrs, Valkyrie, manticores, golems, kami and the Lernaean hydra. Yet we also find more obscure and exotic things, like the Chinese ink monkey, Lamed Wufniks, creatures from American folklore (like the Hide-Behind and goofus bird) and a strange hairy beast seen in France. While werewolves and other shapeshifters were intentionally excluded, Borges also includes a great number of beasts from literature, ranging from the Behemoth of the Bible, Homer's scylla and the roc from the 1,001 Nights, to stranger things imagined by Poe, Kafka, H.G. Wells and C.S. Lewis. All in all we get well over a hundead beasts mentioned, each with a short story and description, and some with cute little cartoon illustrations.The end result is quite a fun read. Like I said before, its not quite on par with Borges other works. But still, its well worth the purchase, especially if you share his interest in the strange, mythical creatures that haunt our thoughts and minds. Like the title says, its a zoology of our imagination, and a very unique adventure."},{"Title":"THE BOOK OF IMAGINARY BEINGS","review":"This book may not have all of the imaginary beings ever known, but it tries.

Mos to f the writing is thick and heavy handed; to say this isn't Borges at his best would be an understatement."},{"Title":"The Complete Compleat Enchanter","review":"One rarely thinks about this, but there actually was terrific heroic fantasy being written before Tolkien published the Lord of the Rings, and L. Sprague de Camp and Fletcher Pratt were at the forefront of such efforts. These magical misadventures of Harold Shea, psychologist turned multiverse knight/magician/hero are thoroughly entertaining and amazingly detailed. The Complete Enchanter consists of the two novellas The Roaring Trumpet and The Mathematics of Magic (published together as The Incomplete Enchanter) and a follow-up novel The Castle of Iron. Sorting out the different versions of these books can be somewhat confusing, but basically this set consists of the original trilogy of \\"books\\" recounting the adventures of Harold Shea. Shea is a smallish man who continually takes on affectations such as unusual modes of dress in an effort to lift his spirits out of the mundane environment of his life. When his boss comes up with a logical theory for traveling among different universes, Shea takes the initiative and put the theory to the test. Aiming for mediaeval Ireland, Shea actually finds himself in a bitterly cold environment where he meets up with Thor and the three other principal gods of Norse myth. Deciding to pass himself off as a magician, he soon finds himself involved in preparations for a final world-ending battle between the Norse gods and a group of malicious giants. In many ways this is my favorite Shea story because it is here that he finds, to his own amazement, that he can handle a sword with some degree of skill (as long as it has a sharp point at the end) and can actually perform some feats of magic.After managing to return to good old present-day earth, Shea soon sets out on another journey, this time with his boss Dr. Chalmers along for the thrill-seeking ride. Their aim is true, placing them inside the world of Spencer's Faerie Queen. Here Shea finds himself in the company of both noble knights and rogue \\"black\\" magicians bent on defeating the good and noble paladins and destroying the enchanted world. In this mediaeval setting, he hones his fighting skills, struggles with his magical spells (as does his colleague Chalmers), and meets up with the red-haired beauty of the woods Belphebe. Chalmers, for his part, becomes enchanted with the lady Florimel, who unfortunately is a not quite human reproduction (formed of ice and snow) of the original Florimel.The Castle of Iron finds Shea back in his own time and space again, trying to explain to cops the manner in which his wife has disappeared. Suddenly, he, two cops, and two of Shea's colleagues find themselves transported to another world Shea soon realizes is Xanadu, but soon Shea and his annoyingly rash colleague Vaclav are whisked magically away to a castle of iron in an ancient Moor kingdom (the world of \\"Orlando Furioso\\"). The plot of this novel confused me a little, but basically Chalmers has bidden them there to help him achieve a truly human form for his beloved Florimel. The castle Chalmers resides in, however, is under a curse which can be put in motion should the young Mohammedan warrior Roger escape the grounds and fight as a warrior, which is the only thing Rogers wants to do, as luck would have it. Once again, Shea finds himself mixed up with men and creatures of mythological origin, seeking this time to not only glorify himself in further adventure without winding up dead but also to find and restore the memory of his recently-disappeared wife.The logic of Shea's method of time travel is rather abstruse; basically, transference is achieved by choosing your desired location (which ends up being a fictional or mythological universe of literary note), trying to ground yourself in the physical and magical principles that would hold reign in such a world, and then reading aloud complicated logical arguments-then, poof, you find yourself in another place and time, one where all of your old assumptions do not quite hold true, requiring quick thinking, ingenuity, and-inevitably-skillful or very lucky life-preserving skills. There are quests, battles, and loves galore in these three adventures. The method of invoking magic is especially interesting, as Shea and Chalmers basically take their words of power from literary sources such as Spenser's The Faerie Queen and Shakespeare. The only negative thing I can say is that sometimes Shea's time in each world is drawn short before we have a chance to actually experience the long-awaited battle or ultimate conclusion to events there. De Camp and Pratt made an incredibly talented writing team, and the magical misadventures of Harold Shea hold a long-appreciated, eternally rewarding place in the annals of heroic fantasy."},{"Title":"The Complete Compleat Enchanter","review":"Remember that Sprague and Pratt wrote this before LORD OF THE RINGS and only a few years after the hobbit. There weren't as many fantasy books to draw upon either.Great system they set up for how magic works through mathematical formulas. Not too confusing either for people like me who don't care for math either.The book is divided into three books that cover different mythologies: the first being Norse where Harold Shea, our hero, gets to meet some of the Norse Gods as they travel in to giant territory; second being in Spenser's THE FAERIE QUEEN where he gets to meet his future love interest; and THE CASTLE OF IRON which if based on an old epic poem that wasn't finished.This book mixes humor, action and clever tactics. Shea isn't the big bruiser type although he carries an epee and knows fencing which lets him beat a lot of people. He also is smart in that where the big bruisers with him find they can't get out of a jam, he's there to outthink his opponents. Oh, and, of course, he also knows magic but sometimes that messes up or does things differently.For its time and even today, a great book for fantasy fans. Alternative History buffs should also check out LEST DARKNESS FALL (a history professor helps Rome from not collapsing . . . sort of, that is).

Pratt and de Camp are very good at presenting a humourous everyman's view of fantastic worlds and manage to combine just the right amount of wit with a deft sensibility without resorting to slapstick or satire.

This volume collects all of the original Harold Shea novellas into one book. This makes it something of a one-stop buy for anyone who wants to read them, especially since the original volumes are out of print.

For those who are well-read in occult/spiritual literature, they will surely recognize \\"Djwal Kul\\" as the source of the monumental series of treatises transcribed by Alice A. Bailey and published by the Lucis Trust. This book is dishonest for many reasons. Here's a few:1. \\"Djwal Kul\\" is a misspelling of the Tibetian's name. It should be spelled Djwhal Khul. I suspect that the name was spelled incorrectly in order to avoid legal entanglements.2. At the end of the book there is an \\"About the Authors\\" chapter. In the short discussion of DK there is no mention made of his 18 books, totaling 9271 pages, all published by the Lucis Trust. Amazing! DK worked exclusively with Alice A. Bailey from about 1920 to 1946. A gentleman at the Lucis Trust told me that DK stated that he was only going to provide information to AAB and that it would only be published by the Lucis Trust.

I appreciate the author's care in researching the details and making frequent references to Holy Scripture and the Fathers of the Church. It really brings to life the reality of the early Christians. This book is a must-read for any modern-day Christian."},{"Title":"Paul of Tarsus","review":"A favorite genre of Catholic authors through the years has been biographies or fictionalized historical novels on the saints. You can find a plethora of works on St. Francis of Assisi, St. Ignatius Loyola or even St. Maximilian Kolbe. Thus, I find it odd that so few biographies or novels exist on those considered the foundation of the Church - the apostles. It is true that one is hard pressed to find many historical details on apostles such as Bartholomew or Simon the Zealot, but the few scriptural details plus the lively traditional accounts of their lives leads one to believe that this would be a burgeoning field of literature. What is most shocking is that even the two greatest apostles, Peter and Paul, founders of the Church of Rome, have had very few Catholic biographies or novels written on their lives.This book, \\"Paul of Tarsus\\" by Rt. Rev. Joseph Holzner, is a rare exception to this rule. Written in the 1940's, it is a lengthy (over 500 pages) biography on the great convert apostle. In many ways, it is an admirable book - Holzner leaves out nothing that is known about Paul, and fills in many details using an extensive knowledge of the 1st century culture in which Paul lived, both Roman and Jewish. By reading this book, one is able to \\"fill in the gaps\\" that sometimes occur when reading Paul's letters - who was he writing to? What was the situation of that local church? How did Paul get from this city to that city? When was Paul in prison? Who are all these people he references - Timothy, Titus, Luke, etc.? All these questions and more are adequately answered in the pages of \\"Paul of Tarsus.\\"However, there are a number of flaws in this book. First, Holzer seems to be unclear as to whether he is writing a strict biography or a novel. Before reading it, I was under the impression that it was a novelized account of Paul's life. Although it had parts that had a novelized \\"feel,\\" it more often than not read like a strict biography. It would have been more readable if Holzer had stuck to one style throughout.Second, I found Holzer's synopses of Paul's letters to be cumbersome and tedious to read. Holzer takes each letter and makes it a chapter in the book. He then goes through the major points, trying to write it like Paul is thinking these thoughts and ideas. But anyone who knows Paul's letters even a little bit know that they are difficult to summarize easily, as Paul has a tendency to address multiple subjects in one letter and can quickly change directions within a letter. It would be been better if Holzer had just given a quick overview of each letter, instead of trying to rewrite them. Leave it to the reader to read the actual text of the letter itself.Finally, as this book was written in the 1940's, it is a bit dated. The most glaring example of this is in Holzer's comments on the Jewish people. He has a tendency to speak of them as was typical of the time for many Christians: cursed as a people for rejecting Christ. Whereas these comments are rare and I would not call Holzer anti-Semitic, it would perhaps have been wise for the publisher to edit those comments to reflect more recent understandings of Catholic-Jewish relations as seen in the teachings of the Second Vatican Council.Flaws notwithstanding, \\"Paul of Tarsus\\" is the best biography of St. Paul available today. I hope that one day a new Catholic biography of this great saint will be written, but until then, I recommend Holzer's book for anyone looking for a comprehensive treatment of the life of Paul the Apostle."},{"Title":"Paul of Tarsus","review":"I loved this book.

But Mr. Levy had nothing to do with proposing this trip and little to do with the itnerary of it. Rather, The Atlantic Monthy magazine proposed and set it up for Mr. Levy; although the author does say of the stops proposed that \\"it was glanced at before leaving.\\" So where did the Atlantic send him to look for America? Mr. Levy's first destination is New York's Rikers Island jail (just the first of 5 prisons he ultimately visits). Next he goes to Cooperstown. Cooperstown is the home of the baseball hall of fame of course, but also the \\"town of James Fenimore Cooper, and thus of the symbolic responsibility for the slaughter of the Indians,\\" says Mr. Levy. Mr. Levy finds it hard to believe why \\"every year millions of men and women come, like me, to visit a town devoted entirely to the celebration of a myth.\\" The myth he is referring to is the fact that baseball (as we have since learned) has origins older than Abner Doubleday in Cooperstown. So, presumably it's ridiculous to travel there anymore. Obviously, however, folks go there for the Baseball Hall of Fame, not to pay homage to Mr. Doubleday. Apparently Mr. Levy believes that a celebratory museum of America's pasttime has to be located in the actual place baseball was invented, otherwise Americans are saps for visiting it. (The Rock n Roll Hall of Fame is a myth too then and, presumably, not at all worth visiting either, in Mr. Levy's view, presumably.) Likewise, he attacks Gutzon Borglum for proposing to carve Mount Rushmore in Indian territory. Borglum, however, had nothing to do with choosing the sight. And even less justfiable is his criticism that Mount Rushmore is far more grand than the monument for Wounded Knee (also in SW South Dakota), as if everything in America is proposed and commissioned out of Washington D.C. Mount Rushmore was NOT a federal government project. Its size (and the lack of size for the Wounded Knee marker) has nothing to do with decisions made in America's capital. It was a South Dakotan project pure and simple. Conclusion: Mount Rushmore is another huge American myth not worth visiting either. I suppose if Mount Rushmore was carved at Mt Vernon then it be be worthwhile. Such is the reasoning of this Frenchman; who, incidentailly, could have phoned in this book from his homeland as it is full of cliches: Americans \\"are armed like Nazis\\" (yes, Mr. Levy uses the term \\"like Nazis.\\" He also calls America's \\"obsession with the flag\\" to be \\"strange,\\" because, apparenty, it only flies at government buildings in France. Care to know where else Mr. Levy was sent to by the Atlantic Monthy? Buffalo, Cleveland, Detroit, San Francisico, et al. But it is not just places he visits. He also meets with a number of representitives of America culture along the way. Any guesses who the Atlantic Monthy set up for him to meet to take the cultural pulse of America? Answer: Norman Mailer, Woody Allen, Sharon Stone, and Warren Beatty. This book's jacket describes Mr. Levy as a \\"brilliant and sympathetic foreign observer\\" who \\"has arrived to help us begin a new conversation about the meaning of America.\\" That's the biggest myth, actually, of this book. (06Aug) Cheers!"},{"Title":"American Vertigo: Traveling America in the Footsteps of Tocqueville","review":"I have to state first off that I only got a short way into this book.I had seen the author on the Daily Show, was intrigued with his premise and stories, and looked forward to diving into the book. What I found in the part of the book that I was able to slog through was that Mr. Levy's observations were much shallower and hastily made than would give any real insight into the American Way Of Life. Being from Buffalo, and having spent considerable time with friends and relatives throughout the Rust Belt I am able to critique the beginnings of the book. Had he started his journey elsewhere I would have had no basis for comparison and would have passed on commenting on the content altogether. Suffice it to say that Mr. Levy, for whatever reason, missed the forest for the trees and apparently limited himself to very narrow experience in the places he chose to observe.Now, to the heart of the review: I am a fifty-year-old, master's-degreed, avid reader of wide ranges of non-fiction and literature. I rarely put a book down without finishing it, and except for a once-a-year escape -- usually toward the end of summer after months of having all four children and their friends underfoot and running wild in our backyard and pool -- I don't read \\"fluff\\". Still, I STRUGGLED through Mr. Levy's introduction, re-reading each sentence at least twice, and more often three or four times, before finally being able to make sense of what he was saying. When the first chapter came I was heartened to see that his sentences seemed a little shorter and more lucid. That, unfortunately, didn't last long.Mr. Levy writes in sentences that are equivalent to five or six normal sentences, with numerous commas and changes in cadence. In person, talking with Jon Stewart, he was articulate and clear. His writing, however, is so unbearably tedious and labyrinthine that I was forced to give up. Perhaps if his revelations had been less shallow and off the mark it would have been worth the agony. They weren't. And it wasn't.If you decide to read this book, I would strongly recommend getting it from a library rather than purchasing it."},{"Title":"American Vertigo: Traveling America in the Footsteps of Tocqueville","review":"I titled my review as I did because it is apparent from reading several of the reviews in Amazon.com that many people did not read it. For example, one reviewer accuses Levy of following Tocqueville's itinerary whereas Levy says in the first ten pages that he did not copy Tocqueville's itinerary because America was a much bigger and more diverse country than it had been 175 years ago when Tocqueville made his tour. In fact, Levy says that he learned to appreciate Tocqueville when he took on this assignment because, as a student, he had always dismissed Tocqueville as a dry old aristocrat, a faint copy of Montequieu, an uninteresting writer with moderate-to-tepid ideas, a poor memoirist, an unworthy philosopher, and a general waste of time. (Please note the last sentence because I will reaturn to it.) Levy had grown up intellectually with a passion for Marx, Hegel, and others, but in the shipwreck of Marxist materialism he had come to appreciate old-fashioned liberalism, such as Tocqueville's. In preparation for this trip to America, he had devoured everything Tocqueville had written, including his letters, as well as the writings of his companion, Gustave de Beaumont. He referred frequently to Tocqueville during his tour.The sentence that I cited in the previous paragraph is my poor effort to duplicate BHL's writing style. French schools teach this stuff, i.e., long, compound, complex sentences with allusions to ideas and works found elsewhere but not explained. Be prepared for an intellectual wrestling match reading BHL as he tours America, a country that he admires with all its faults.One reason he is writing this book from articles he wrote for the Atlantic Monthly is to take on the virulent anti-Americanism that is so prevalent in Europe today. BHL is not anti-American. In fact, he is one of our champions. Thus, this book is a sympathetic Frenchman's description of America, regardless of what many reviewers have said including, sadyly, Garrison Keillor in the NYT. Be prepared for outrageous descriptions of the crazy thing that is the United States because we are a crazy, wild, over-the-top country and visitors have to learn to appreciate that aspect of the United States where all things are possible and many previously unthinkable things are real."},{"Title":"American Vertigo: Traveling America in the Footsteps of Tocqueville","review":"Sometime around 1980 I was sitting in a Parisian movie theater with my friend Maurice waiting for the start of a movie whose name I have long forgotten, when in breezes Bernard-Henri Levy with his entourage and a woman on his arm who was obviously trying to look beautiful.\\"Is that one of the 'New Philosophers'?\\" I asked.Maurice shrugged his shoulders, \\"He is neither new, nor a philosopher, he's just a journalist with a flair for publicity.\\"Shortly after the publication of his book \\"Barbarism With a Human Face (1979),\\" BHL became one of the leaders of a group known in France as the New Philosophers. Along with Andre Glucksmann, Alain Finkielkraut, and Pascal Bruckner, he became one of the leading voices of anti-Marxism, anti-totalitarianism, and anti-antiAmericanism. The rise of the New Philosophers coincided with the rise of the neocons in the US - with whom they are sometimes compared. BHL stood out because he was the most flamboyant, the most telegenic, and he was fabulously wealthy. ( He inherited money from his parents who did well in the lumber business.)In the last 25 years BHL has been busy: he has written over 20 books and occaisionally serves as emissary for the French government. He has his detractors in France as well as America. (Garrison Keillor's hatchet job in the New York Times was a good exmple of the loathing BHL inspires.)This book does have the elements of a \\"Freaks, Fatties, Fanatics, and Faux Culture Excursion,\\" as Keillor describes it, but he's missing the point. BHL has a great deal of admiration for America, and he often defends America in France; he is, after all, the anti-antiAmerican. He's angry, however, at the neocons for spoiling the idea of intervention. As an activist and an internationalist, he is often on the front lines for stopping genocide or for overthrowing this or that brutal dictator. After the invasion of Iraq, however, foreign intervention has taken a back seat to the realist predilection of not interferring with the internal affairs of other countries.BHL's prose can be very hyperbolic and colorful, his observations are many times on target, and many times they are not - inevitable in what is essentially a philosophical travelogue. Another thing about his prose is that he employs the shotgun approach, he says everything and its opposite. Keillor was wrong, he was not short on facts and long on conclusions, rather he is long on impressions and short on conclusions.Notwithstanding the vertigo that the reader as well as the writer experiences in trying to make sense of America, this book can be entertaining and enlightening."},{"Title":"American Vertigo: Traveling America in the Footsteps of Tocqueville","review":"It is often refreshing to read the observations of a foreigner on your own country. After traveling for nine months, Bernard-Henri Levy, or B.H.L. has written a provocative, entertaining, insightful book about America in the 21st century. His comments about the number of American flags on buildings and stores are funny and pertinent. The American obssession with their flag surprises many foreigners. Whether BHL writes about the power of religion, the American relationship with nature and the violence of hurricanes, banks looking like churches and churches looking like banks, the false representation of the birthplace of baseball, his observations are infused with cultural insight and his prose sparkles with intelligence and verve. He is most concerned, however, with the conditions of American prisons and the poverty he saw in the suburbs of LA and NY. This book written by a Frenchman who does not have any anti-American feeling and appreciates the diversity and the richness of American culture might contribute to see this country in a new light. Linda"},{"Title":"American Vertigo: Traveling America in the Footsteps of Tocqueville","review":"This was a treadmill book for me but it probably shouldn't have been, it got pretty heavy at the end. The author is a French philosopher who travelled throughout the United States for several months, loosely following in the steps of fellow Frenchman Alexis de Tocqueville. He starts in the East and really covers a lot of ground, going all the way to California, then heading south and ending back up on the east coast.The first part of the book reads like a politically-savvy travelogue and it's the part I liked best. I liked reading about the country from such a different perspective. Levy is struck by all the kitschy museums he finds on his travels, and he seeks out interesting political figures (Tom Daschle, Russell Means) and places (Savannah, Georgia, New Orleans) to visit and write about.The end of the book is Levy's philosophical and political analysis of the state of the U.S. as he sees it, and whether he feels anything can be done to change the negative things that are going on here and the negative way the country is being viewed at this time. This was the part I shouldn't have read on the treadmill, a lot of it was pretty deep and over my head. Overall, I enjoyed the book and would definitely recommend the first section of it."},{"Title":"American Vertigo: Traveling America in the Footsteps of Tocqueville","review":"If you are expecting a fresh view on the US, in the same way that Tocqueville gave us hundreds of years ago, you will be disappointed. The impression Levy gives us is that he travelled the US on a hot air ballon, landing sometimes to talk to some famous people. It seems he never grasped the reality of the common folk, the average American that make the country.In order to understand Levy's background, we have to remember that France (albeit a wonderful country) is the only place where the Minister of Culture gives a medal to Schwarzenegger or to Paulo Coelho, men who would be considered junk in their countries. French love, like in the 1800's when they travelles the world, or when Gauguin went to Tahiti, exotism. Then they are surprised when they meet flesh and bones people, and don't know how to explain them.It is amazing that Levy doesn't talk about the number one trait of Americans, one that almost explains all the others: the competitive spirit. An American is born into competition since the day he is born, since the elections for \\"most likely to suceed\\" at school, until the chase for money at all costs, leaving family, traditions, etc., behind. Kids get drunk not for the fun, like in other places, but to be found \\"popular\\". The basic reason for the American neurosis is that they try unsuccessfully to balance this competition drive with the uncompatible Christian tradition that still exists. Levy misses all that.Because he is a famous character, he has access to several important people, like presidential candidate Kerry, philosophers and artists. but an average American would not recognize himself in any of those people he talks to."},{"Title":"American Vertigo: Traveling America in the Footsteps of Tocqueville","review":"Sometimes the movie is better than the book. In this case the one star reviews are far more articulate,nuanced,and insightful than this pompous screed of a trite rite of passage from this pretentious icon of the French.I started reading this book hoping for a \\"Blue Highways\\" but found myself slogging through page after page of utterly self absorbed and myopic self musings.Mon Dieu!! Could this be? Perhaps it was I who missed the profundity of the great \\"BHL\\" ( the name itself pretentious and revealing).So I then checked the reviews. How typically American,BHL would probably sneer,\\"ready ,fire,aim.\\" The reviews gave me final dispensation and validation to trash this piece of tripe. This book is so bad it tempts one to go on and on with endless BHLesque adjectives so I will not.BHL, I have read Toqueville,and you ain't him ,bud.Hats off to all you guys and gals of the intelligent one star reviews."},{"Title":"American Vertigo: Traveling America in the Footsteps of Tocqueville","review":"Discussing the content (if any) of this book is irrelevant because first there would be a big hurdle to negotiate: Mr Levy's writing style. In 308 pages there is barely a positive statement like \\"this cat is black\\" or any causal construct.Instead, it has long sentences trying to touch several disparate subjects at the same time but not analyzing any, lots of rhetohric questions the author makes to himself, no honest effort in deepening on anything. It is desperating, one reads on wanting the author to say something, to enuntiate a thought, but that never happens.This writing style was fashionable among some \\"social scientists\\" circles of the seventies, and I thought it had been ostracized for good, but apparently not."},{"Title":"American Vertigo: Traveling America in the Footsteps of Tocqueville","review":"It seems no matter how anything is presented or appears before him, he makes up his mind that it's a certain way. He'll take an attribute of an area, or a town or a region, and without investigating as to why it is, he'll decide the reason himself.One passage concerns his visit to the Baseball Hall of Fame, where Abner Doubleday has a prominent mention. Everybody I know is aware that Abner Doubleday did not invent baseball. I think the whole country knows this. However, Levy thinks that anyone visiting Cooperstown is an absolute idiot because the ENTIRE hall of fame is based on a lie. He doesn't even entertain the idea that people go there because they like baseball.Another passage references a visit to a prison and meeting with an inmate. He assigns to this prison the quality that society has abandoned the inmates because the prison was taken over from the local government by a private company. He comes to this conclusion after the inmate he spoke with claims that she's happier because she receives more attention and better food.I had to read this to write a term paper. Unless you're forced to read it, I wouldn't recommend it. While it was somewhat interesting to read about a coast to coast, nationwide travel, I could have done without his smug imaginings."},{"Title":"American Vertigo: Traveling America in the Footsteps of Tocqueville","review":"I bought this book because I had heard of the author due to my knowledge of France and the French language. (Also, I knew that his wife, Arielle Dombasle, was one of the most beautiful women in France. Although she is French, she was born in the USA to an American mother and she carries an American passport.) I found the prose in the book somewhat rambling, disjointed, and seldom interesting, let alone entertaining. The contents of the book just did not seem to have any real purpose or goal; it was mostly a random collection of thoughts and observations, many of which were seemingly pointless. Perhaps it is unfair for me to say this, but this book just re-inforced my belief that one of the problems with France is that the country has too many so-called philosphers, of which BHL is one."},{"Title":"American Vertigo: Traveling America in the Footsteps of Tocqueville","review":"....with the sole intention of wiping my keister with it!FIVE STARS!Cheap TP!Read Garrison Keillor's review in the New York Times.Or rent this from the library, if you must.

Etc.Nothing new, whatsoever.But, I'll have fun disposing of this 'masterpiece'."},{"Title":"American Vertigo: Traveling America in the Footsteps of Tocqueville","review":"In American Vertigo, Bernard-Henri Levy has written a book that was ostensibly a retracing of Alexis de Tocqueville's famous tour of America in the 1830's, a trip that resulted in the renowned book Democracy in America. This time around, however, our French visitor and observer has flubbed his reading of America in every possible way. Allowing for an occasional interesting comment (even the proverbial stopped clock is correct twice a day), most of this book is filled with gross and, far too often, incorrect statements and generalizations about America. Levy's approach is dismissive of American culture, ignorant of its people, and overly bound up in celebrity chasing (Sharon Stone, Warren Beatty, Norman Mailer, etc.). While the concept of having an outsider critique American culture and life is intriguing, the execution in this instance is utterly execrable. While I managed to get through the entire book, including its absurdly misplaced meanderings on terrorism in the Reflections chapter, most readers will find themselves hard pressed (as I did) to finish the first chapter without wanting to chuck it full speed at the nearest garbage can. I can confidently predict that this will be the most unread and/or unfinished popular book since Oprah recommended Faulkner's \\"The Sound and the Fury\\" to her reading groupies.It is worth noting that reviews for this book are already polarized between one's and five's. Consider well that the one's have most likely actually read (or tried to read) the book and the five's are of two types (I've checked). Four or five of them are readers with only one book reviewed (one reviewer had two reviews). The others are among the highest-rated reviewers on this system who never rate a book lower than four for fear of getting negative votes. Check for yourself -- you'll see reviewers who have never opened a book they didn't rave about. In their way, these individuals are no more discriminating (and no more helpful) than Mr. Levy has been in \\"American Vertigo.\\""},{"Title":"American Vertigo: Traveling America in the Footsteps of Tocqueville","review":"Having enjoyed levy's \\"Who killed Daniel Pearl\\" i was anticipating a thought-provoking intelligent read.

Keillor's review in the nyt was off the mark-- too kind. and he hated it!I finally chucked the book right into the trash halfway through after he declared a small mexican restaurant in colorado, \\"the ultimate junk food\\".

But the book this guy wrote about Daniel Pearl is one of the smartest, coolest books I ever read. He went undercover in Pakistan to report about all kinds of things way before American media (such as Pakistan selling a-bomb secrets). And the stuff about Pearl's murder was chilling and just beautifully written. This book is like a knock-off joke in comparison. It's like bad television. Get the other one!"},{"Title":"American Vertigo: Traveling America in the Footsteps of Tocqueville","review":"As I just wrote-reading this book will involve you in, perhaps, more than you at first anticipated. I was not familiar with the author's previous works and, although realising that French writers are several cuts above Anglo writers, not so much in the complexity of their thoughts but definitely in the complexity of their writing, I nonetheless, open-eyed, began a book I thought would be a purview of contemporary America. I was correct-intially, but then I got to his last section, Reflections, and therein I confronted the beast. As long as Levy confined himself in those first seven chapters to a clourful, intriguing and ultimately insightful overview of American contemporary society, I embraced everything he wrote about: the Fundamentalist Christians with their mega-churches, prisons of various age and condition throughout the country, irrasible Native Americans, the Castro district of San Francisco and many and various other oddities of a too rich country-a country that can afford the silliness of an over ripe \\"culture\\" like spoiled children affording an over packed toy box.There can be no denying the beauty and richness of Levy's writing; Oh, that writing of this brilliance could become more commonplace in Anglo societies that then would not need to resort to reading a few translated French crumbs dropped to the English reader. I found myself re-reading and marking particularly beautiful passages such as this from page 55, \\"Who are the Amish, then? Who are these men and women who live in an economic autarky, their gaze fixed on eternity?\\" And this is but a small piece of a thousand piece puzzle; a puzzle that deserves to be returned to a thousand times to wallow and submerse oneself in the beauty of this wonderous prose.My prose praise is not to hide the facts of Levi's encompassing conservatism. I was lulled into overlooking as word-smith play the insignificant references to political conserservatism throughout the first section of his book. But the Reflections section near the end of American Vertigo became suffocatingly moribund-as all conservative writing ultimately is. Unfortunately I lived too long [about 26 years] in the States and I know its ubderbelly too well to absorb unflinchingly Levy's unquestioning view of the American outlook onto the world, its own suffering people and the havoc it has ridden on the world's, yes world's, environment. Although Levy is a consumate student of Plato, Hegel and many other early modern and modern thinkers, he seems not to have paid enough attention to contemporary writers such as, Heinberg, Ruppert, Marrs, Tarpley, Horowitz and many others who understand the dimension's of America's and therefore the world's problems. I don't think the truth lies in the encompassing paradigms of thinkers not alive while the twentieth and twentity first centurie's consume what is left of this sorry planet.Levy's book is a fabulous read and I would recommend it to anyone who has the time to appreciate 200 plus word sentences randomly placed throughout this brilliant book but forgetting, if you can, his deep conservatism encountered at the end."},{"Title":"American Vertigo: Traveling America in the Footsteps of Tocqueville","review":"I was reading the first chapter of 'American Vertigo' in a book store, when all of a sudden a horrible sensation of nausea over-whelmed me. Everything got all fun house mirrors and the world flipped upside down. Oh wait, that was just Levy's prose that was doing that to me.I carefully put the book back on the shelf and stumbled from the book store, only to find that when I got home the media blitz had put Levy on the Charlie Rose show. First, when I saw how Levy was treating Charlie I thought Charlie owed Levy money, and then I figured out he was just being French. Then he went off on a long, you know the French, diatribe about the 'Mall of America'. The next thing I knew I woke up on a plane, dazed and bleeding, flying to New Jersey -- Oh wait, that was a \`million little pieces', an entirely different nightmare.Whatever it was, it sure was the worst hangover of my life. After a little Camus, and believe it or not Sartre, I started to trust the French again. But then the non sequitur(is that a French Word?), of Levy's prose tracked me down, I found the Book and the author following me, I'd wake up and there the book would be, tempting me with gushings about Seattle and Transvestites, Swingers, and Gun shows. I persevered, I wouldn't let it beat me and then I found that I was addicted to it, the nausea and the 'Vertigo' over came me, and I kept on reading because it felt so good when I Stopped."},{"Title":"American Vertigo: Traveling America in the Footsteps of Tocqueville","review":"Yes, Garrison Keillor's review was ridiculously Francophobic, and shame on the Sam Tanenhaus for his bigotry. But it is possible to understand why this book could enrage someone as seemingly gentle as Keillor to rant about it.

BHL scorns the people of the US, their religion, their values... he visited the US like Louis XIV visited his kingdom in the XVIIth century.L&eacute;vy make the French ashamed. We are sorry, my dear American friends, to give you a so bad overview of the French intellectual movement."},{"Title":"American Vertigo: Traveling America in the Footsteps of Tocqueville","review":"The title of Bertrand-Henri L&eacute;vy's \\"American Vertigo: Traveling America in the Footsteps of de Tocqueville\\" is both accurate and deceiving. L&eacute;vy's prison tours are a thin pretext for his travels through the United States in 2004, an afterthought in the dizzy-inducing whirlwind of a trip.Whereas Jean Beaudrillard spun, in \\"America,\\" his account in terms of space (the desert), L&eacute;vy narrates the country as movement (the road). The result reflects the approach: L&eacute;vy breezes through the land in fragments and enumerations. Similar to any lengthy road trip, as soon as I settled into the book I found myself paying attention only intermittently, skipping passages, skimming through the snapshots of what could also easily have been bullet points. L&eacute;vy occasionally does venture into analysis, as when he discusses the Americans' inclination to create history out of everything (\\"a country where everything ends up as a memorial\\"). But soon, he's off to the next stop, and the thought is gone.Similarly, Beaudrillard's musings may have been over-philosophized, but that's perhaps because he's a superior, more original philosopher. When a list of observations becomes too long for L&eacute;vy to handle (cue the vertigo), he sweeps into a conclusion that sounds pre-conceived, as if he were superimposing on reality his idea of America as he knows it from movies and television. For L&eacute;vy the simulacrum comes first and when reality's complexity intervenes, he resorts to the simplified version.Worse, as he criss-crosses the country, on what Garrison Keillor named the \\"Freaks, Fatties, Fanatics & Faux Culture Excursion,\\" L&eacute;vy carries with him an air of condescension. He tries to mask it with attempts at eloquence and what he passes for analysis, but he simply cannot shake it. Perhaps it's because he visited the States in a presidential election year, when the country does become a circus of sorts. Or it's because W was still President, and the French had only disdain for him and the Iraq war. Regardless of his motive, the quelle-horreur view of America's collapse persists throughout.As another afterthought, indignation seeping from the first 240 pages takes, in the concluding chapter \\"Reflections,\\" a sharp U-turn. It turns out America's paradoxes and contradictions make it a stronger, more resilient place than it appears to a casual traveler. Yes, the evidence presented spurs a curiously opposite conclusion.Being a naturalized American, my irritation with the book never reached the heights of Keillor's; my scorn reflects my European sensitivity. If learning how to do things entails also learning how not to do them, L&eacute;vy's \\"American Vertigo\\" provides an excellent tool for every travel writer."},{"Title":"American Vertigo: Traveling America in the Footsteps of Tocqueville","review":"First, let me introduce myself: I am French, and I have been living in the USA for five years. I traveled in the USA to discover the beauty of some places (e.g. Grand Canyon) and to learn some history (e.g. battlefields). I am not a journalist and I definitely never interviewed any politician.That said, I guess I could have done a better job than what BH L&eacute;vy did.First, his style of writing is very pompous. Even though, in French, it might be fashionable in some circles to write this way, in English it is unbearable. You have to re-read two or three times some phrases just to understand what he's trying to say (his introduction is the best -or worst- example).Secondly, he has some thoughts and he tries to relate them to a former philsopher's thought. Granted, he's a philosopher and he likes philosophy, but he doesn't explain it so for those unfamiliar with philosophy concepts, it's not understandable. That's not what I expected from this book, I didn't want to read about vague (to me) philosophical concepts but more about the true nature of the USA.Which leads me to this: he keeps comparing his book to Tocqueville's, but he's no Tocqueville. Out of 300 pages, only 70 are titled 'reflections'. The first 230 are a description of HIS journey. And, for example, one page about him taking a piss and being almost arrested for it... well, what about the nature of the USA? It's more about HIS nature and his disrepect to US laws..... This book is very superficial, and even though he meets a lot of people, it doesn't look like they said anything interesting.When I say I could have done a better job, it's not only me, but (almost) all the French people living here. All of us have traveled, all of us have met different people from different backgrounds. And we have a certain sense of what an American is (compared to an European). We might not agree with each other but at least we have an opinion and we can defend it. It seems that BH L&eacute;vy has no real opinion, he met a lot of people but missed a lot of points. This book's truly disappointing."},{"Title":"American Vertigo: Traveling America in the Footsteps of Tocqueville","review":"A French philosopher with liberal leanings tours America to parallel Tocqueville's journey. Basically there are two sections: the tour and his philosophical conclusions. The tour is interesting. Yes, he discloses his political leanings and mentions Clinton and our obsession with a puritanical sexual view (in a European opinion). There is much discussion of Kerry as the tour starts a week after his loss. But the journey touches many varied subjects with excellent thought and particular emphasis on subjects Tocqueville covered in his early 1800's tour, none bigger that our barbaric prison system including Gitmo. Opinions are varied as he moves through the country and varied subjects with in my opinion, no particular leanings but just observations.Then the CONCLUSION and unfortunately, I was traveling and in a hurry to finish this section. Don't be. This is heavy reading with particular emphasis on sharing his extensive philosophical reading and what theories best fit the American current day philosophy. It's intellectually stimulating but you must be prepared to read thoroughly and many times reread passages to really understand his well-reasoned points.I'm very happy to have read this book to explore how America and Americans are viewed by other cultures.

The first two-thirds of the book are Levy's observations on his journey around America, where it seems he manages to stop in at least 100 cities and talks to a wide range of people - from the famous like John Kerry and Norman Mailer to the unknown, like a stripper in Las Vegas and an Indian activist in South Dakota.He describes each place and meeting in 2 to 4 page vignettes and as such, it makes for a fairly quick read. At times, I wished he would have elaborated a bit more on certain people or cities but he prefers short, to-the-point observations.Levy makes very insightful points on the American experience in the 21st century and on several occassions, I thought \\"wow, that is an interesting perspective.\\" His observations on American myth and history are particularly interesting.The last one-third of the book are his observations on his trip and America, in general. This gets a bit long and tedious. He goes into Full French Philosoper mode in this part and truth be told, his editor needed to do a better job here. Add on the fact that this is a translation, and the sentences run on too long, and the last one-third of the book gets pretty difficult to get through.That said, the actual journey itself is a very good read."},{"Title":"American Vertigo: Traveling America in the Footsteps of Tocqueville","review":"This is a discombobulated, disjointed piece of junk that has two redeeming features.

The \\"observations\\" are the sorts of things that would be made by a self-important college freshman, such as explaining to the benighted reader what is meant by the symbolic obesity of large malls.

In America, according to Levy obesity is not just a physical problem, but also a social, cultural, financial and political one. In other words, the American worship of bigness. If Levy is fond of the US, he is also very aware and critical of America's failures: The response to the victims of Katarina, the poverty of many black Americans, the torture of prisoners, racism and violence.

There might be better books or analyzes to prod us to analyze ourselves but this is a hell of a good start (and please, don't even bug the guy for being French, or jewish: he is an intelligent observer of America with things for us to see in ourselves, period).

His outsider's point of view can be penetrating and hold a mirror to us Americans that can be both difficult to look away from or to look directly at.At times, as you might expect, he misses the mark. His commentary in these instances is based more in his already-formed conceptions, his wish-it-were-different/how-it-should-be longings than a detached analysis.Levy, for all of this book's weaknesses however, shows himself to be an admirer of the United States. The underlying theme that runs throughout this text is that America and Europe are tied, for better or worse, to one another. Indeed, it is his contention that the United States and Europe serve as essential pieces in each other's cultural, existential DNA; neither great society, from his vantage point, can really be who they are meant to be without a close familial relationship with the other.

Keillor's review, for those of you who have read it and are consequently skeptical about shelling out the money for this book, was one long shamelessly insulting piece of invective, totally unfair, totally off the mark and illustrating a complete lack of understanding and forebearance. Because Levy was at times (admittedly, quite often) long-winded, philosophically minded, and revelled, it's true, in frequent references (sometimes obscure) to novelists, philosophers, movie directors, to support his theses, Keillor trampled all over this book without digging any deeper. He accused Levy of being superficial, harping on his writing style, and hypocritically wrote an embarassingly superficial review of this admirable book.What can you expect from this book? Don't go in hoping for all of the answers. No one person, American or not, understands all of the nuances of this broad and diverse country (Whitman of the US: \\"Do I contradict myself? Very well, then I contradict myself, I am large, I contain multitudes\\"). But I consider this perspective from an outsider commenting on our culture, a la Tocqueville, to be an invaluable insightful piece of journalistic writing. He sets out on a cross-country ramble, with the opinions and misconceptions of his countrymen surely ringing in his ears, and reports with admirable honesty having been shocked by how many of his preconceived notions were utterly shattered. True he is still set, and couldn't possibly budge (what would be the use to us?) from his French-ness. And so his itinerary is surely not one an American would choose in pursuit of cultural enlightenment. He visits seven prisons (hence, in the footsteps of Tocqueville) including Guantanamo Bay, the Mall of America, Cooperstown, the Space Needle, a brothel outside of Las Vegas, a strip-club within it, a gun show, and many other diverse instances of Americana. He interviews a wide swath of people of myriad colors and stripes. The result is a pastiche of observations and reflections, sometimes frustrating, often insightful, poignant, even poetic. For someone who grew up in the Southwest, it was marvelous to read his deconstruction of the sprawling, decentralized cities there, and once again his fresh, outsider's perspective was naive, engaging, insightful, incomplete, but absolutely worthwhile.It's a shame that so many reviewers on this site gave the book such a crummy rating. Did they read a couple of passages and fling the book into the waste bin after feeling embarassed that this French author was far more cognizant of contemporary and 20th century American literature and politics? Maybe they were encouraged by Keillor's self-indulgent tirade. In any case, I recommend this book to anyone who is willing to sit down, concentrate, and resolve to stick it out to the end."},{"Title":"American Vertigo: Traveling America in the Footsteps of Tocqueville","review":"That probably the best book on America was written by a remarkable Frenchman has been known since about 1830, but that fact doesn't seem to bother Americans one whit. On the contrary, we're glad to have it. Especially these days, when the question of American character and integrity seem to be on the chopping block, both here and abroad. But it does seem to irritate the French a good deal, because even though they can lay claim to having authored the best book on America (although one certainly can't forget Mark Twain in this context), they still don't seem to understand it. Alexis de Tocqueville's \`Democracy in America' set the bar very high for French intellectuals, and it's become something of a great-great-grandfather complex for them. Tocqueville threw down the gauntlet, and Bernard-Henri L&eacute;vy has picked it up in his \`American Vertigo.'Whatever else they disagree on, French intellectuals - of which Bernard-Henri L&eacute;vy is certainly one (his initials BHL are often compared in France to a fashion brand, and he prefers shirts that can't be buttoned to turtleneck sweaters) - seem nevertheless destined to share one thing in common: at some or other point in their careers they are compelled to try and 'understand' America. This is the pretext for L&eacute;vy's new book, a fast-paced jog through the US that aims to sample the patchwork that makes up the fauna (the political animals, Amish people, strippers, etc.) and the flora (usually restricted to natural wonders like the Space Needle, megachurches and certain well-known prisons) of our American culture, or American Vertigo. L&eacute;vy travels to America precisely because he doesn't understand it. America inspires vertigo, and so the title of L&eacute;vy's book is already given before he voyages to the New Continent, like a modern day Alexis de Tocqueville who L&eacute;vy says explicitly underwrites his entire book, and so invites comparison on a few points. L&eacute;vy is decidedly not Tocqueville, of course, who had astute political and cultural things to say regarding the character of early America. Instead, BHL's insights are journalistically profound, or what amounts here to the same thing, profoundly journalistic.The cultural myopia that L&eacute;vy starts out with does not improve during his travels, as is evident on any page of the book, and instead of rejecting it L&eacute;vy embraces this myopia as the guiding principle of his voyage, as it allows him the liberty of seeing America differently. This inevitably produces some interesting juxtapositions, but what it does not do - and moreover, it's not meant to - is provide any clarity. Throughout the book, L&eacute;vy flits from one venue to the next, with nothing more than something 'interesting' to say - in the way that we say, 'hmm, that's interesting,' and then promptly drop the idea because it really doesn't lead anywhere. Now, this is not a critique of the book per se: L&eacute;vy is not aiming for anything more from his thoughts than the production of an interesting read. He doesn't intend to understand America, and that is precisely what his book is about. As the title suggests, it still gives him vertigo. In this sense L&eacute;vy sets out in the opposite direction from Tocqueville's \`Democracy in America.'American Vertigo instead intends to be provocative, even if that means simply placing any two things that are American side by side (say, Arlington Cemetery and baseball) and observing: 'isn't that interesting! I wonder if this isn't somehow a key to grasping America?' Unfortunately for us, but more so for the French public who won't know any better in their edition of the book, the fact that L&eacute;vy has selected himself as the major guide and muse for his trip to America ultimately leaves the reader none the wiser for having read it. L&eacute;vy's no Virgil. But then perhaps that's because Virgil wasn't flashy. He has questions, but he intentionally sets out to raise them, not to answer them. Never mind that L&eacute;vy doesn't quite understand what causes the acute American vertigo that he suffers from: he's interested at the moment in the attraction (or distraction) that America affords him with.Nonetheless, when it comes to America, L&eacute;vy likes what he sees, and his anti America-bashing stance has won him friends here in America. This book doesn't bash America, and that does set it apart from most other books written by French intellectuals on the topic of \`America' since Tocqueville's praise and his sharp eye for truly defining characteristics of Americans, even if these also included well-perceived faultlines. It's clear that at least one of the reasons why the French are obsessed with 'understanding' America is because Tocqueville kept comparing the French to Americans in his 'Democracy in America.' And as Tocqueville's insights into the characters of both Americans and French are still relevant today, it seems that if one if wanted to read a book that explains America to the French, or America to Americans, Tocqueville's is by far the first and best guide. One thing that Tocqueville decidedly did not suffer from is vertigo. For all of L&eacute;vy's gushing about how wonderful a place America is, one gets the sense by the end of the book that for L&eacute;vy, it's a nice place to visit but that he wouldn't want to live here."},{"Title":"American Vertigo: Traveling America in the Footsteps of Tocqueville","review":"Take a one way ticket with Bernard Henri Levy and his text, \\"American Vertigo\\" and make the most astonishing journey you ever thought you would do.

By Bernard-Henri L&eacute;vy.Thing is I became even more perplexed. Between wondering why Charlie Rose was even mentioned, much less so much, in the book to wondering if Garrison Keillor had read the same book I was reading.Yes, I like the book. Not because its about anything in America I know, but because of the elements of America I either didn't know about or didn't care that much about. Putting myself in the authors shoes I tried to visualize how he chose the places and people he was writing about. In fact I wish he would have shared more about how he did choose to visit certain places and talk to certain people. Like why Sharon Stone?The fact that he is a self proclaimed atheist Frenchman who is of Jewish background helped me sort things out. Simply because I tend to travel alot and seek out people and places different from myself and my comfort zones.So I at back as if in the car traveling with the author from one state to another. Trying hard to see the faces and sites he was seeing and taking in the smells, heat. cold, terrain he was observing. It helped alot too. The book really makes 'melting pot' real. Unlike France and many other countries that aren't as diverse as the United States of America, the book actually shows a much more 'live and let live' attitude which I found refreshing.The Reflections chapter toward the end really is good. I especially loved how he writes of the obesity situation here in the states and how he hit the nail on the head when he writes about obesity beyond Americas weight situation and how we have an obesity epidemic in most areas of our lives beyond super size meals, to the homes we own, cars we drive, high tech toys we own, clothes we buy, entertainment we partake of. Great food for thought. This chapter alone made the book well worth the price!!"},{"Title":"American Vertigo: Traveling America in the Footsteps of Tocqueville","review":"In his review of this book in \`NYT Book Review' Garrison Keillor does an old- fashioned hatchet job. He adopts an attitude towards it, and writes one long put- down. Reading the review, and having read many reviews of books in my time, I knew it was unfair without reading one page of the book. Now I have read the book, and I believe the review is unfair, but does hit on a certain truth. In some way Bernard Henri- Levy just does not \`get America'. He wasn't born and raised in America, he doesn't really have the feeling or spirit of it. It's not in his writing, not in the tone of what he says. One major example of this for me was in the way he wrote about \` the myth \` of Cooperstown, the way he goes through some strange intellectual exercise to indicate that Abner Doubleday did not invent the game. And he makes this seem as if it is of tremendous importance to most fans. The man does not know what baseball is. His description of Cooperstown, and even of the \`Farmer's Museum' there is off. He doesn't have the feel, or the spirit of it, doesn't understand the innocence and dreams connected with it, its special lore, has no sense of the real feel of what a ballfield is, or probably even what a game of \`pitch' and \`catch' is.But that said Bernard Henri- Levy does provide in his very heavily researched and studied travel through America a certain kind of European -intellectual's insight and perspective. He does this, commissioned by Atlantic Magazine to go in the footsteps DeTocqueville who provided the great ur- commentary on American society, who set the standard for all sociologists debate in regards to it today. The assignment of course is unfair, and BHL is simply not in the same league , and could not expected to be . Nor does he in some sense really try to be, and admits in the outset that he is not making a literal and direct parallel commentary to his great predecessor countryman's excursion.Instead he makes a journalistic journey of his own one rich in observations but also perhaps over-rich in philosophical reflection. In the course of this, he truly does his work, travels it seems coast to coast, visits a number of prisons, speaks with some of America's most foremost intellectuals, William Kristol, Francis Fukuyama, Samuel Huntington, has a five- minute interview with Presidential Candidate Kerry, speaks with politically involved left- wing movie-stars, Sharon Stone and Warren Beatty, visits a whole host of American cities, finding two he loves, Seattle and Savannah , meets with people in bordellos and shopping - malls, in Indian Reservations and model- cities (Sun- City) .And he writes essentially a long series of vignettes of his encounters and experiences, many of which for me were tremendously informative and convincing.Inhabitants of Sun- City will not love him, but I found his picture of a sterile segregated artificial Paradise a stark warning of where not to turn in Old Age. I too was taken by his rave description of Seattle which serves as one kind of climax for the book. He writes, \\"If I had to choose an American city to live in -if I had to pick a place, and only one , where I had the feeling in America of rediscovering my lost bearings -it would be Seattle. But all in all .. If I had to choose one moment in this discovery.....it would be the moment when arriving from Spokane on Highway 90.. I saw floating like a torch between two motionless clouds, in a dark pink sky entirely new to me, the tip of the skyscraper, already lit up, which in my imagination suddenly condensed everything that America has always made me dream of: poetry and modernity, precariousness and technical challenge, lightness of form meshed with a Babel syndrome, city lights, the haunting quality of darkness, tall trees of steel Ever since I was little I've so loved saying \\"gratte-ciels\\" - \\"skyscrapers.\\"But this passage, however strong, also reveals the weakness of the work. For he speaks of America from the point- of-view and with the baggage of the over- verbal French intellectual. He analyzes and analyzes from the point- of- view questions Americans do not ask about themselves. I found this true even in his writing about two American writers, Hemingway and Fitzgerald who have meant something to him. He asks questions about the kind of medical treatment Hemingway received, and about Fitzgerald's situation when visiting Zelda. He does not touch their literary visions, nor does he for them matter touch upon the great Tradition of American Literature.He does however provide a meditation on America and its meaning today. In this he presents a long and complex debate with major figures of intellectual history. In one small passage of this debate I found when he is discussing the jihad terrorist war against the West a real sense of understanding America. \\"I'm thinking of those jihadists about whom you can't say enough times that they aim to destroy what is best about the United States: freedom of speech and thought, equality, women's rights,democracy) -this basic yet decisive detail remains then: in the sheer fact of being American, or at least expressing yourself like one and wanting to be one, there is gentleness, a lightness, an element of freedom and, in a word, of civilization , thatmakes this country one of the few countries in the world where, despite everything you can still breathe freely today.\\"This book has far far more in it than I have indicated in this review, and I believe each and every reader can learn much about America from reading it."},{"Title":"American Vertigo: Traveling America in the Footsteps of Tocqueville","review":"I ordered this book after seeing Levy on the Jon Stewart show. He was anentertaining guest. The book is also entertaining (very), but make nomistake: this is a serious, thoughtful, surprising, and deeply engagingmeditation on America today. Levy is both critical of our country (he hasevery right to be in my view) but also refreshingly optimistic. Americaremains, for Levy, a great nation and his reflections on this are asbeautiful as anything I've read on the subject. Levy's book also takes justabout every cliche about America you can name, and which are especiallyprevalent in Europe today (that we are pragmatic, not idealistic, that we areobese, which for Levy is a myth, that we are a nation of rabid religiousfundamentalists, that we are an empire hell-bent on dominating the earth, andso forth, and shows why they are invariably simplistic when not completelywrong. Levy sees danger ahead - what he calls the \\"democratic messianism\\" ofBush, the neocons, and the right wing establishment; the nationalembarrassment that was Katrina; a kind of poverty that was as shocking toLevy as it should be to every American. And he sees a failure of nerve - andof ideas - on the left.But on the other hand he also sees America as fundamentally sane - and acountry that is always in the process of renewing itself; still based on andguided by an American creed unique in the world. This is a book that bothreminds you of what is broken in America, and also reminds you of itsgreatness. For me, what Levy says about America's old and continuing\\"grandeur\\" was relevatory and very moving.This book is very beautifully written but it is not for simpletons. Butfor anyone interested, really interested, in where America is as a countrytoday, you will not find a more interesting or thought-provoking \\"take\\" thanAMERICAN VERTIGO.Finally a word about the garrison Keiller review someone mentioned. I'msorry to say it, but that was the most ill-informed, dumbed down, andpractically racist review I've seen in a long time in a major paper (what ifhe had said, \\"The next time a Pole decides to write a book about America,watch out.\\" But it's OK to say about a French guy-- who, it turns out --happens to be Jewish).

Levy is a Frenchman who writes very pro-American (definitely in the minority), who got an assignment from the Atlantic Monthly for a series of stories retracing a European's journey through America...much the same as that of Alexis de Tocqueville in the 19th century.I finished the book just as I became aware that a grumpy Garrison Keillor had chosen to review the book in the January 29 issue of the New York Times. Just the fact that he did so, is telling. Levy has apparently also appeared with Charlie Rose and Jon Stewart. Apparently Keillor was less than impressed with the nature of Levy's journey and the quality of his prose and his conclusions. I'd have to side with Keillor, although, having not yet read his review (I'll do so AFTER I post this) I think it is fair to say I probably liked the book better than he did.I found the concept of the \\"article cum nonfiction book\\" refreshing, and why not see the country through the eyes of a Frenchman? Levy tells his tale in short sound bites, which is somewhat difficult to follow, but really does have the effect of the continuous stream of differenct images of America, experienced back to back, with little time in between to catch your breath. The problem is not the approach or the concept, the problem is what images Levy chose to be representative of America, and how truly mad we must seem if, in fact, you select the venues he chose. From the highest highs, to the lowest lows, from every mad, over-indulgent \\"scenic\\" vista, Levy fails to capture the middle class of the nation.Let's see, there is his stop at the home of wealthy actress Sharon Stone, his visit to the Mall of America, his visit to Cooperstown, thinking he would find America through the history of her \\"national pastime\\" (instead of going to an MLB game....curious). . He visits a total of 7 prisons, including Guantanamo, which many Americans fail to understand or have appropriate access to information about. He lives it up in Las Vegas, he stops in Amish country, he visits a whorehouse, Graceland, the Space Needle, Bourbon St., alternative lifestyles in San Francisco, shopping in Beverly Hills, spends time with some of the country's intellectuals and a lot of well-known people who are all left of center, a wealthy retirement community....you get the picture. In his mad rush to see all and experience all, he actually comes across a few \\"real people\\" on his journey, and converses with them.Naturally, he has a view of America that is skewed to her madness. And while he makes some good points (I liked the \\"Reflections\\" chapter) and actually approaches America as an ally instead of something to look down his nose at, Levy ultimately fails.He's eloquent, but given to hyperbole, he grabs every clich&eacute; about America and makes it his own, he's shocked by the extent of our poverty (and should be) and he likes \\"the pretty places\\"...Savannah and Seattle (and so do I). I think de Tocqueville would roll over in his grave at the entire, bloated, wasteful trip and the things that Levy misunderstands and makes up. He wanted to find a nation obsessed with the flag, and so he did (even if the vast majority of Americans don't understand the rules for flag handling); he builds castles where none exists (the idea that Abner Doubleday was \\"the pope of the new religion ...of baseball\\"; most Americans couldn't tell you who Doubleday was), his sentences run for miles and miles and miles, and it becomes less of a goal and more of a relief when you finally reach the end.Bernard-Henri Levy missed the real America and drew his conclusions from the \\"outliers\\". Not worth a read; difficult to say this after I appreciated so much his suspenseful \\"Who Killed Daniel Pearl?\\" fiction/nonfiction effort."},{"Title":"American Vertigo: Traveling America in the Footsteps of Tocqueville","review":"As a French citizen who likes the USA, I am not a supporter of Bags Of Wind. BHL has for a long time decided to stop thinking. \\"American Vertigo\\" is another expression of the wind which blows in the brain of this pedantic writer.I totally agree with the good criticism written by William Grimes \\"A Modern-Day Tocqueville Finds an Uncertain America\\", February 4, 2006 in the New-York Times. I quote an extract of this relevant analysis.\\"Mr. L&eacute;vy is, in some ways, a good traveling companion. He takes a keen interest in American politics, and he loves American literature. His voyage of discovery owes as much to Jack Kerouac or Walt Whitman as it does to Tocqueville, a writer whom, he notes in his preface, he barely knew before setting out. But because he lives almost entirely inside his head, he does a remarkably poor job at communicating the sights, sounds and smells of American life. There are many moments, riding in the car with him, that you want to tell him to shut up for five minutes and take a good look at what's out the window.He is lazy. Tocqueville, faced with the bewildering logic of American politics and American habits, rolled up his sleeves and tried to account for what he saw. Mr. L&eacute;vy dashes off a few lines, shrugs his shoulders and tosses out rhetorical questions. Some are long and involved, others quite brief, like the \\"Who knows ?\\" that caps his musings on the inner life of President Bush. At least half of the provocative questions that make up \\"American Vertigo\\" should have been written down as homework assignments for the author rather than lobbed in the face of the reader.

A long, wordy brief is easy in comparison. This maxim reflects the truth that clear thinking results in crisp, concise writing. Muddy thinking, however, results in turgid verbosity. This book takes \\"turgid verbosity\\" to a new level. Who was the target audience for this book? It appears to be the author himself, and perhaps other \\"French intellectuals,\\" whatever that term might mean. I am sure they are very impressed with the use of obscure and bombastic words strung together with laborious sentences and a general lack of organization. I am not. I'm also glad that we don't have to suffer such intellectuals in this country - a point the author ignores.Like many others, I put this book down after several hundred pages. Not because it was too hard for me to understand, but because I resent an author writing so poorly that I have to exert myself so much to understand what he is trying to say. The resentment is especially strong when I hear that the author is allegedly a famous intellectual.Terrible writing aside, the content is also lacking. The author's attempt to define America reminds one of the fable where several blind men attempt to describe an elephant. No correct picture of the image emerges. No political incorrectness intended, but the author has attempted to define America by describing a large number of tiny minorities. One example will suffice -- gun rights activists who collect Nazi memorabilia. It is patently obvious to everyone in this country (except apparently the author) that this microscopically small subset does not begin to accurately describe America's (very diverse) attitudes towards guns and gun rights. I would venture to say that - as Garrison Keilor aptly observed with many specifics - the author failed in his essential purpose. The author either fails to appreciate or chooses to ignore that his vignettes of American culture are not representative of the culture. Whether the author \\"likes\\" America or not is beside the point. The samples of American culture are badly chosen and the writing is worse.This book really, really makes me want to spend a year in France and write a book for the French about France."},{"Title":"American Vertigo: Traveling America in the Footsteps of Tocqueville","review":"The book is very well written, concise and not not becoming destructed by theoretical excursions.

It opened my eyes on things within our culture I never thought about as being unique or different. Bernard has his own opinions on various topics and they are woven throughout the book, but I was pleasantly surprised that his opinions did not take away from the content. If you like reading about our country with a different set of eyes this book is for you. It is an easy read and one you can put down and take up again after a few days since it is written in a journal style format."},{"Title":"American Vertigo: Traveling America in the Footsteps of Tocqueville","review":"I've read BHL's articles in The Atlantic Monthly on the same subject and thought they were weak and uninsightful. For some reason they've been compiled and expanded into an equally weak and uninsightful book. My review was initially going to be an angry rant, but I came across Garrison Keillor's review of the book in the New York Times, which conveys my thoughts exactly. Here's the first paragraph:\\"Any American with a big urge to write a book explaining France to the French should read this book first, to get a sense of the hazards involved. Bernard-Henri L&eacute;vy is a French writer with a spatter-paint prose style and the grandiosity of a college sophomore; he rambled around this country at the behest of The Atlantic Monthly and now has worked up his notes into a sort of book. It is the classic Freaks, Fatties, Fanatics & Faux Culture Excursion beloved of European journalists for the past 50 years, with stops at Las Vegas to visit a lap-dancing club and a brothel; Beverly Hills; Dealey Plaza in Dallas; Bourbon Street in New Orleans; Graceland; a gun show in Fort Worth; a \\"partner-swapping club\\" in San Francisco with a drag queen with mammoth silicone breasts; the Iowa State Fair (\\"a festival of American kitsch\\"); Sun City (\\"gilded apartheid for the old\\");a stock car race; the Mall of America; Mount Rushmore; a couple of evangelical megachurches; the Mormons of Salt Lake; some Amish; the 2004 national political conventions; Alcatraz - you get the idea. (For some reason he missed the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, the adult video awards, the grave site of Warren G. Harding and the World's Largest Ball of Twine.) You meet Sharon Stone and John Kerry and a woman who once weighed 488 pounds and an obese couple carrying rifles, but there's nobody here whom you recognize. In more than 300 pages, nobody tells a joke. Nobody does much work. Nobody sits and eats and enjoys their food. You've lived all your life in America, never attended a megachurch or a brothel, don't own guns, are non-Amish, and it dawns on you that this is a book about the French. There's no reason for it to exist in English, except as evidence that travel need not be broadening and one should be wary of books with Tocqueville in the title...\\"In short, read this book only if you're seeking a laughably stereotypical French philosopher's bitching about America."},{"Title":"American Vertigo: Traveling America in the Footsteps of Tocqueville","review":"It is an excellent, insightful book.

It should be given out as a gift to all new American citizens."},{"Title":"American Vertigo: Traveling America in the Footsteps of Tocqueville","review":"Like a lot of people I know, I really do wonder what people outside the US think of us. This is an interesting book from not just any tourist's point of view, but an intelligent and thoughtful philosopher following in the footsteps of an earlier tourist named Alexis de Tocqueville. Honestly, don't be intimidated by that, either -- it's a really interesting series of essays, followed by a philosophical discussion. Good stuff!"},{"Title":"American Vertigo: Traveling America in the Footsteps of Tocqueville","review":"Am I the only one who in reading the reflections section began to feel that I had dropped in on the last days of the semester of a political science class and was therefore somewhat lost by many of the references? I actually majored in political science as an undergrad, but that was 20 some years ago. I don't remember what it means when you say Hegelian. And the fact that I remember studying Hegel puts me a slight advantage over let's say, biology majors. A sentence or two defining his terms would have helped a lot. I ended up just putting the book down with only 10-15 pages left. I never do that.So, while parts of the reflection section were over my head, the insipid celebrity chasing of the bulk of the book was so condescending. Did Levy or the editors feel that we need to read about famous people, otherwise we are bored? In fact, it is the opposite. I really don't care that Woody Allen likes to play clarinet. He didn't tell us what we don't already know about these people. Or what we care about."},{"Title":"American Vertigo: Traveling America in the Footsteps of Tocqueville","review":"Levy is obviously one of the brilliant minds of our time and his insights into what makes our country great are valuable. I'm not sure that comparing himself to Tocqueville is the humblest way to begin a roadtrip, however. Levy's conclusions are not revelatory, but he is appreciative of the history and culture of our nation.I'd like to go back and read the original by Alexis de Tocqueville now for comparison."},{"Title":"American Vertigo: Traveling America in the Footsteps of Tocqueville","review":"I found \\"American Vertigo\\" to be a puzzling book. It was, initially, a journey in the footsteps of Alexis de Tocqueville. It then seemed to morph into a traditional travelogue as Bernard-Henri Levy criss crossed America travelling mainly by road and meeting a wonderful assortment of Americans from all walks of life. He then concludes the book with a confusing piece of analysis which was, frankly, confusing. Indeed, it was only in the final pages where he wrote a brief postscript that the narrative gained any semblance of consistency. So, all in all, a less than satisfying read.I had expected much more. Tocqueville was an early observer of the American experiment. For another Frenchman to try to rework an earlier master was probably a clever idea. Levy comes with a great resume and should have been able to handle this task with ease. However, the result is disappointing. It is probably the travelogue where the book is its most readable. Levy has an unexpected knack of seeing the interesting within the mundane. He has a keen eye and a fluid style. It's a pity that the book couldn't have been more a travelogue than a political treatise. In the former, Levy excels while in the latter he becomes confused.My criticisms notwithstanding, Levy does manage to redeem himself at the book's end. Here, he briefly discusses Hurricane Katrina and the tragedy of New Orleans. This one event did so much to show the very best and the very worst of America all at once. The best being the willingness of people to pitch in and help. The worst being the pathetic incompetence of its then President. America deserved better than the negligence that its government showed in the wake of Katrina. Levy does well to articulate this point.Overall, this book is mixed. It will anger some, encourage others and simply confuse many. I had expected more. Levy fails to deliver."},{"Title":"American Vertigo: Traveling America in the Footsteps of Tocqueville","review":"I really enjoy reading studies of America by foreigners, spending so much time abroad has really reinforced my ideas about what it means to be an American. I picked up \\"American Vertigo\\" because I was genuinely interested in what this man had to say about America, its people, its culture and its role in the world.To say the least, I was a little disappointed. Far from an insightful study of American character, it's mostly a travelogue that vaguely follows (Seattle?) Tocqueville's journey. Well parts of this story are exceptionally well-written, much of it is filler. For example, who really cares about what Sharon Stone thinks about President Bush? Does Sharon Stone speak for the American people? Is she even representative? His interviews with prominent neo-cons, John Kerry, and other influential people, while more revealing, are probably not that representative of America either.With that being said, it actually is an enjoyable book to read. I read it all in a handful of long-distance car rides, and he often touches upon significant aspects of the American character of which little has been written. He just doesn't dig deep enough."},{"Title":"American Vertigo: Traveling America in the Footsteps of Tocqueville","review":"I'm a bit disturbed to see how people can apparently be offended by the fact that a foreign philosopher studies the US. This is precisely the purpose of American Vertigo!Levy's book is a quest for understanding nowadays America, which he approaches by putting himself in some of the most peculiar and strange situations and environments.In these, he does not only adopt the outsider's view, but, in some way, the same that Toqueville had 170 years ago. This is why American Vertigo, like it or not, is quite a rare and valuable testimony: it allows us to take a step back from our civilization to then observe it through a time filter and from a European perspective."},{"Title":"American Vertigo: Traveling America in the Footsteps of Tocqueville","review":"In these interesting times, it is wise to consider how others see us in the United States. And for the full picture we must look beyond the censored views and propagandized soundbites of mainstream news reporting to outside sources. With American Vertigo, we have a rare opportunity.BHL: philosopher, wit, filmmaker, activist, celebrity yum-yum. America has no one like him. The European literati lap him up like cream. He shocks, he provokes, and above all forces critical thinking; a form of reflection lost of late on many Americans. This delicious book should have us all sitting al fresco at the local Starbucks, discussing our agreements and disagreements with Levy's assessment. It's a must-read for all intelligent Americans.Of course this is not \\"Tocqueville Meets the 21st Century\\". Such is neither necessary nor was it Levy's intent. This is a hybrid essay and travelogue; a social commentary designed to provoke thought and discussion in the wake and context of Tocqueville's 1835 masterpiece. Consider it as a sort of epilogue: as if France and the US, two siblings separated by the paths of their democratic adulthood, have now met over brandy to discuss the developments in their lives since they last spoke. What does it mean to be an American? How is that notion perceived through the prism of French eyes? Is that relevant? Hell, yes. Let's not forget that while of course we helped liberate France from occupations in the 20th century (will the Francophobes every stop reminding us?), the French were essential in our break from England in the 18th. They hosted the international think tank that formed our founding fathers. They gave us the Statue of Liberty, for godsake. Indeed, we are two siblings who frequently squabble, who often don't understand the other, but who owe a great deal to each other. Yes, a Frenchman's perspective is relevantBHL travels roughly along the same path as Tocqueville, almost entirely by automobile. I sat along for the ride, like some stowaway in the back seat as we traveled through much of the diversity of this nation. From Sharon Stone's house, to the Michigan Arab community to lap dancers in Las Vegas to the fence along the California Mexican border, Levy interviews celebrities and commoners with equal interest and respect. Beatty and Fukayama. Waitress and prison guards. As did Tocqueville, Levy pays special attention to prisons, in particular Angola and Guantanamo, and pulls no punches. Levy is an anti-anti-American, and has oft times spoken in our defense when the popular European rhetoric has been to debase and dismiss us as a falling empire. So when he does not sugar-coat the current American experience, he is especially credible.And still, he is optimistic. His \\"Reflections\\" at the conclusion of his journey is remarkable, and it bears repeat examination after rereading Democracy in America, for it clearly validates much of what Tocqueville predicted regarding the tyranny of the masses.Regardless of whether you agree or disagree with BHL, you must read this book if you wish to hold forth in any discussion of the current state of the nation. Otherwise, you are missing a huge piece of the world view. Merci, BHL, merci."},{"Title":"American Vertigo: Traveling America in the Footsteps of Tocqueville","review":"After all the ' French bashing'\\" on this side of the Atlantic and the \\" Anti- Americanism\\" in some French newspapers, it is good to see a Frenchman writing about the US with generosity and enthusiasm. The author, Mr. Levy has traveled extensively all over the United States following Tocqueville's itinerary for a year. The result is a book filled with critical, insightful and amusing observations about Americans, their political and religious institutions, and their cities such as Chicago, Detroit,Savannah, Seattle and San Francisco. He is critical of the US prison system, the health care, and the poverty among Blacks. He is, however, fascinated by the diversity in America and compares this country to a mosaic. He finds that immigrants in this country adapt themselves better to the 'American way of life' than immigrants in France. His final assessment of the United States is a positive one. What makes this book very special is the author's curiosity, wonderment, and insight. After having read this book, I feel that I have a better grasp of American society, culture and institutions.Levy showed with dexterity that, despite many problems, in the twenty first century, Democracy is still alive and well in America ."},{"Title":"American Vertigo: Traveling America in the Footsteps of Tocqueville","review":"Reviewing AMERICAN VERTIGO in the New York Times, William Grimes described the author as \\"lazy\\" and the book as \\"a messy, self-indulgent logbook\\" and a \\"disjointed collection of random observations, facile generalizations, and MTV-style fast-cut takes on American popular culture.\\" Just six days earlier, Garrison Keillor, hardly anyone's notion of a throat-slashing literary critic, utterly trashed this book in his New York Times review. Both were far too kind. AMERICAN VERTIGO is a disaster in every sense of the word: audaciously shallow, haughtily dismissive, annoyingly condescending, presumptuously self-inflated, grossly and grotesquely generalized, laughably contrived (how many rural police officers have ever heard of Tocqueville, let alone read him or known that his given name was Alexis?), and transparently manufactured (e.g., folding characteristics of six presumably random prison visits into an archetypal seventh at Guantanamo Bay).The extent of Mr. Levy's utter failure to understand America can be found first and foremost in his own itinerary. In the first chapter alone, he sums up Newport, RI in less than a page, New York City in three pages devoted in their entirety to the city jail on Rikers Island, Buffalo and Lackawanna in a page, Cleveland and Detroit in a half-page each, and Chicago in three (devoted to gangs). Consider his choice of venues: the Mall of America, Rikers Island, Mount Rushmore, the Mayo Clinic, the Seattle Space Needle, or his piece de resistance, the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, NY.In what has to be one of the worst examples of reportorial writing and inept generalizing in history, Mr. Levy condescends to spend three pages on America's national pastime. Bad enough that he never bothers to attend an actual game, but Levy compounds his failings with ridiculous claims that visitors believe some of baseball's greatest players are buried there (a la Westminster Abbey) and that \\"some of the finest games in the country are played\\" there. He asserts that the day baseball commissioner Bud Selig laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and invoked the memory of Abner Doubleday, \\"the entire United States joined in a celebration\\" about which the entire United States was justifiably uninterested and unaware. Levy further argues that because variations of the sport may date to ancient Egypt, America's entire claim to originating baseball as its national sport are founded on patently and deliberately incorrect myth. American baseball fans are either \\"ignoramuses\\" who buy the myth or that they know and don't care, eagerly following closely the \\"thousands (??) of baseball scholars who form ...one of the most serious, learned societies in this country.\\" How could any American editor let this nonsense go unmarked?Anyone presuming to grasp the essence of America would hopefully spend time with, and write about, its common people, its farmers and laborers and immigrants, its small businessmen and entrepreneurs. The best chroniclers of America have done so, whether Steinbeck's TRAVELS WITH CHARLIE, Kerouac's ON THE ROAD, or William Least Heat Moon's BLUE HIGHWAYS. Not our grand, illustrious, French philosopher. He's ever hurriedly on his way to meet with (and write about) Hillary Clinton, Barak Obama, Norman Mailer, Charlie Rose, Sharon Stone, Henry Kravis, George Soros, Bill Kristol, Warren Beatty, Richard Perle, Woody Allen, and John Kerry. Name dropping apparently carries far more credibility in Mr. Levy's mind to make his case than actually stopping his car and talking to average Americans. Why talk to actual immigrants about their experiences when you can speak with a Hispanic American whose \\"ironic\\" job it is to patrol the Mexican border for illegal entrants? \\"I keep meeting Americans,\\" Mr. Levy writes, \\"who say to me, \`Paris...ah! Paris. Is there any other city in the world more desirable or more civilized than Paris?'\\" Had Mr. Levy truly understood America, he would have seen in that realization the essential problem of this book.One can hardly help wonder the reaction among Frenchmen had any American reversed this process and spent a proportional amount of time in France (based on relative land masses, the American visitor would only need 22 days) before penning his/her deepest philosophizing on the conundrum of \\"being French\\" in the modern world. The response would undoubtedly have been a veritable tsunami of outraged invective at the audacity of such an uncouth, uncultured, and unsophisticated colonial.In the end, readers can only wonder what the fine people at Random House must have been thinking as they took this book to press. Did anyone there read it? Did anyone edit it beyond checking for spelling and punctuation? Did anyone consider that having a fine curriculum vitae and a reputation for intellectual prowess do not a book make? Did anyone wonder whether stringing together ten or twenty questions at a time was good writing, or just annoying? Did anyone care? Were they all just afflicted by some French Vertigo? Will we ever know? Does anyone care?"},{"Title":"American Vertigo: Traveling America in the Footsteps of Tocqueville","review":"I enjoyed about 60% of this book--the other 40% was a real challenge to get through. I'm a pretty smart guy, but even with my PhD this was pretty heavy reading. I really enjoyed Levy's descriptions of the places he visited and the insightful analyses of the places. I found it somewhat difficult to believe that folks he ran into on his journey all seemed to know who Tocqueville was--from policemen to airline passengers, they all had an opinion. Anyway, I'm glad I made it through the early parts of this book to get to the journeys. The end was quite cumbersome...I'm still not sure what I learned, but I was entertained."},{"Title":"American Vertigo: Traveling America in the Footsteps of Tocqueville","review":"Levy ostensibly follows in the footsteps of Tocqueville in order to understand America and make it more understandable in his analysis. The fact he chose to focus on extremes, the perverse, the famous, instead of mainstream America perhaps explains his lack of true understanding.He looks at Rikers Island Prison, lap dancers, Las Vegas and brothels, the Mormon church, Indian reservations, a gay partner swapping club in San Francisco, jumbo malls and a convention of overdressed Saints at the Pentecostal Church convention is Memphis. He pokes his nose into freaky, grotesque and strange nooks and crannies and simply ignores the rest of us.Levy gets a couple of things right: we don't wave the flag because we love our government, but we love our people and our principles. When Americans refer to a state, they aren't talking about the government, but a place and its people. That we aren't imperialistic in the classic European sense.Anyone who is not an American would be left with a distorted view of America and the impression that we are a confederacy of freaks and extremists. He is so busy finding places to prove his points that he totally misses the essence of America."},{"Title":"American Vertigo: Traveling America in the Footsteps of Tocqueville","review":"This is a book I've been meaning to read for a long time but it took me a while to get my hands on the original French version. I thought that a book written by a French intellectual and philosopher offering ruminations about America deserved to be read in French... A friend finally got me a copy in France last month and I took it with me on my around-the-world trip this month.Bernard-Henry Levy (henceforth, BHL) is somewhat of a celebrity in France (perhaps the only country in the world where a philosopher can become a celebrity). In recent years, he has moved away from writing \\"pure\\" philosophical works towards a more journalistic role. In 2002 he spent almost a year, travelling to Pakistan several times to investigate the murder of Daniel Pearl, the Wall Street Journal reporter that was beheaded by Muslim fanatics. He summarised his findings in a book (Who Killed Daniel Pearl?) in which he minces no words when describing the lawlessness of the Pakistani regime. I vividly recall one sentence from that book (and I'm quoting from memory): \\"of all the delinquent countries in the world, Pakistan is the most delinquent of all\\". This was written, mind you, at at time when Pakistan was the US's primary ally in the fight against Al Qaeda in Afghanistan.BHL embarked on a year-long journey arounnd the US and wrote his observations in American Vertigo. The project was financed by the Atlantic Monthly journal, which asked BHL to follow the footsteps of Alexis De Tocqueville, the French historian who travelled to America in the early 19th century and wrote an analysis of American civic life in the monumental work Democracy in America, considered one of the classic books in political thought. The idea was for BHL to retrace Tocqueville's journey and provide observations about life in America almost 200 years later. (On a side note: why don't I get offers to travel the world for free for a year? I guess my ruminations are not, sadly, as in demand as BHL's...).The book turned out to be very different from what I thought it would be like. Instead of a long philosophical treatise about the US, the book is a collection of short vignettes, each 2-3 pages long, about the various encounters BHL had during his journey. Having said that, the last third of the book is a heavy-going \\"summary\\" of the journey, more typical to BHL's previous writings.The journey took place around election time in 2004. BHL covered many walks of American life: politics (he met, among others, Obama, Clinton and Kerry), Hollywood (Sharon Stone, Warren Beatty), prisons (the original aim of Tocqueville was to study the American penitentiary system), entertainment (Vegas, a brothel in Nevada), sports (Baseball Hall of Fame), religion (from born-again evangelists to Brooklyn Jews to Mormons), US history (Mount Rushmore) and much much more. Each vignette describes shortly what he experienced and then expands on the subject by putting it into context. \\"The big picture\\" is a motive that runs throughout the book, with BHL trying to frame each experience within the theory he builds for the American experience.And the theory is as follows: America is indeed an empire, but not of the sort Rome was. Its fierce protection of individualism, coupled with a deep sense of integrity and accountability, make it a power to be reckoned with despite the predictions of its decline. It is a land of contradictions: puritanism coupled with promiscuity, religious fervour coupled with materialism of the lowest kind, isolationism coupled with a sense of global duty. As dysfunctional as America is, BHL believes it will endure. He is an \\"anti anti-American\\" and repeatedly berates his compatriots for being so automatically against anything American and for falsely predicting the failure of the American model.As impartial as BHL tries to be, his love for America is apparent throughout the book (although I think he will refuse to admit \\"love\\" is the appropriate word). He writes lovingly about Seattle, calling it the one place he would choose to live in if he were to move to the US, only to trade it later in the book with Savannah, Georgia. All in all, I don't think he was successful in \\"retracing the footsteps\\" of Tocqueville, but nevertheless this is still an interesting and stimulating book."},{"Title":"History of the certified township of Kingston, Pennsylvania, 1769 to 1929;: Together with a short account of the fourteenth commonwealth, (Pennsylvania county and regional histories.

The one hopeful element of Graglia's tale is that while people in Washington, DC proved supine in their unwillingness to oppose the Supreme Court's misdeeds, average people from Denver to Boston took to the streets in defense of self-government. The politics of the last 23 years owe much to the arrogations chronicled in Graglia's book."},{"Title":"Paul Celan and Martin Heidegger: An Unresolved Conversation, 1951-1970","review":"One of Paul Celan's most widely-known works is \\"Todtnauberg\\", which enigmatically documents the poet and Holocaust survivor's meeting with the philosopher and unrepentant Nazi supporter Martin Heidegger. But Celan's engagement with Heidegger was much vaster than his 1967 visit to the philosopher's estate. Celan had been reading Heidegger since the early 1950s, they met more than once, and their correspondence lasted until Celan's suicide in 1970. James K. Lyon documents this uneasy relationship in his monograph PAUL CELAN AND MARTIN HEIDEGGER: An Unresolved Conversation.Charting Celan's reading of Heidegger is a task made easy by the poet's habit of scribbling in the margins of books he owned, including such details as the date he finished reading them. The basic chronology for Celan's study is thus established. Lyon's interpretation of many of Celan's markings is highly speculative. Nonetheless, it is clear that Celan's poetic language and thematics were enormously influenced by what he read in Heidegger. A poem in Celan's difficult late collection FADENSONNEN, one that had long baffled me, is readily made clear by one passage in Heidegger.By the end of the 1950s, a correspondence had been established between Celan and Heidegger. Only a couple of letters survive, but contact between the two is attested by mutual acquaintances like Otto P&ouml;ggeler. Lyon exhaustively documents Heiddeger's influence on Celan's poetics. It is not only the poetry that shows the profound traces of Heidegger's thought, but also Celan's 1961 speech \\"The Meridian\\" benefits from a knowledge of the philosopher's work. That said, Lyon notes that many of Celan's ideas predate his discovery of Heidegger, but the poet did find the philosopher's unique language helpful for expressing those ideas.Lyon also does much to overturn the established reading of \\"Todtnauberg\\", which has the poem expressing Celan's disappointment at their encounter. In fact, over the following week, Celan was in unusually high spirits and the meeting seems to have reinvigorated him. It wasn't until his return to Paris, after he had written the poem, that his memories of the meeting turned to regret.This is an informative book, even if discussion can be abtruse for those without a philosophical background. Lyon nonetheless attempts to make it accessible by translating all quotations (with the German original following). I found it hardgoing at times, but I did gain a better understanding of Celan's hermetic late poetry (the volumes \\"Atemwende\\", \\"Faddensonnen\\" and \\"Lichtzwang\\"), and therefore I can recommend it to passionate fans of the poet."},{"Title":"Gotta Have God: Ages 6-9","review":"I bought this devotional for my 6 year old son and we love it.

This is a great devotion for kids who are really in tune with God, or for parents to do with their kids. It asks a lot of questions about tangible ways God works in the life of the child (&#34;How has Jesus shown himself to you?&#34;), & though these are all great questions - I feel like they're a tad old for 6-9 year olds. Our son is 8, & is a believer on his own, but has a very difficult time answering these questions by himself. Definitely a discussion-type devotion. It's also disheartened our son a bit - he wants to physically SEE Jesus, the way The 12 did.

Through a series of fun and easy checkpoints I discovered my SoulType and the kinds of spiritual nurture that my soul needs to feel stimulated and renewed. What I realized, with some wry humor, is that I have been, in an unconscious way, living the themes (core values) and the purpose of my life without even knowing it.

The main role of DNA is the long-term storage of information and it is often compared to a set of blueprints, since DNA contains the instructions needed to construct other components of cells, such as proteins and RNA molecules.

What the collection Lost Face has, however, are several other Jack London short stories that are sure to hold your attention. The title story, \\"Lost Face,\\" depicts how a man's ability to keep his head in a dire situation saves him from a fate worse than death. My personal favorite in this collection is \\"That Spot,\\" a great story for anyone who has owned or had to deal with a difficult dog. The narrator of \\"That Spot\\" remarks that there was something about Spot that made him uneasy, and the reader soon understands what that meant. This is a great collection of short stories, one which I recommend to anyone who likes Jack London's writing."},{"Title":"Lost face","review":"Lost Face is a collection of seven short stories by Jack London, all of which take place in Alaska or the Yukon Territory around the time of the Klondike Gold Rush. It is most notable for being the collection which contains \\"To Build a Fire,\\" the classic story of a man trudging along the Yukon Trail, alone but for his dog, who finds himself struggling for survival against the 75-below-zero cold. It is London's most famous and widely read piece of writing, about as perfect as a short story can be, and sure to be read in junior high school English classes for centuries to come.In addition to this renowned masterpiece, Lost Face is loaded with unexpected gems. I had never heard of the other six stories in this collection, and I was greatly surprised at how good they are. By the time Lost Face was published in 1910, London had already published five collections of Klondike tales, ranging from the excellent (The Faith of Men) to the OK (Love of Life). In the latter book, London showed signs of exhausting the subject matter and running out of ideas, but here in Lost Face he comes up with seven very solid, original, exciting tales.The title story, \\"Lost Face,\\" recalls the odyssey of a Polish freedom fighter who is imprisoned by the Russians, then escapes from the mines of Siberia and ends up in Alaska. He finds himself faced with torture and death at the hands of a Native American tribe, and desperately tries to come up with a way out of his predicament. \\"That Spot\\" is a comical tale in which the narrator recalls a dog he owned during his prospecting days in the Yukon; a magnificent, powerful, keenly intelligent beast who absolutely refused to perform the slightest bit of useful labor. In \\"Flush of Gold,\\" two travelers on the sled dog trail stop at a cabin on Surprise Lake, where dwells a beautiful, mysterious woman who pines for a former lover. As one of the men relates the woman's history to his companion, the reader discovers the bizarre love story that darkens her past. \\"The Wit of Porportuk\\" tells of an Alaskan Indian chief, famous for his generosity and extravagance, who runs up big debts to a miserly money lender. When the time comes to collect the debt, the lender, Porportuk, sees it as an opportunity to claim the chief's beautiful daughter El-Soo for his mate. The girl, however, being very clever and well educated, comes up with a scheme to avoid becoming the greedy old man's property. Neither party's plans prove entirely successful, however, and just when you think you know where the story's going, it turns in a shocking and unexpected direction.Comparing the stories of Lost Face to London's Klondike tales of a decade earlier, one really gets a sense of how much he progressed as a writer. These seven tales are rendered in smooth and beautiful prose, skillfully plotted, and remarkably vivid in their depiction of time and place. Reading Lost Face transports you to the bygone world of the exotic North. Through London's eyes, it's a wild and unpredictable place where the powerful beauty of nature is ever present and invigorating adventure is commonplace."},{"Title":"Lost face","review":"This fine little collection is a real keeper. Jack London's superb storytelling shines through, and each little short story in the book means something. I highly recommend this book.One of the reasons I admire Jack London as a writer, is because of his ability to capture your imagination, and transport you to his character's settings and world. &#34;Lost Face&#34; is a great example of that."},{"Title":"Lost face","review":"The book is collection of 6 stories and all are good and a few are great. I especially liked the Lost face story ending and to build a fire."},{"Title":"A scandal in Bohemia","review":"A Scandal in Bohemia was a nicely written short story. It was engaging and it is my favorite Sherlock Holmes tale. Its nice to see that for once he went up against someone whose mental capacity was in the same league as his. At first I didn't really like Irene Adler for no reason I can think of now. But she grew on me and by the end of the story, she was my favorite character. The King was an absolute idiot."},{"Title":"A scandal in Bohemia","review":"\\"To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name.\\"Well this was a surprise; the classics and especially mysteries are not my usual fare but due to my recent obsession with the BBC series SherlockSherlock: Season Two(How yummy is Benedict Cumberbatch BTW?) and then watching Downey and Jude Law in the movieSherlock Holmes: A Game of ShadowsI realized that I had never actually read any of Conan Doyle's stories. After some research trying to figure out where to begin, I eventually boughtThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmesand settled on this story. And wow, I didn't expect to enjoy this half as much as I did (or at all for that matter) but I guess this is why Sherlock Holmes is still relatable today.I'd initially expected to have to put in considerable effort just to get through this, I mean it was written in 1892 so it was bound to be very, well literary. You know all formal and tedious. In fact I'd anticipated needing a dictionary just to be able to understand what the characters were talking about, but to my surprise A Scandal In Bohemia turned out to be an absolute delight to read. The actual story is quite basic yet also filled with complexities and hidden meanings and I would also have to call this a romance -of sorts. It's also funny, relevant, cunning, witty, romantic and ultimately sad. What a great introduction to the world of Sherlock Holmes.Told from Dr. Watsons POV (now that I didn't know - I'd just assumed these were Sherlock's stories.) We begin with Watson \\"dropping by\\" Baker Street to visit Holmes. He hasn't been by his old residence or seen Holmes of late due to his recent marriage and the two have drifted apart. I guess you could say he feels nervous about visiting because he never really knows what state Holmes will be in; elated, depressed, manic, high on opium or cocaine or in some clever disguise? It's always a bit of a crap shoot. In any case he appears happy today and also excited due to the prospect of a new and exciting case. Sherlock then asks if Watson will assist him;\\"I shall be delighted\\"\\"You don't mind breaking the law?\\"\\"Not in the least.\\"\\"Nor running a chance of arrest?\\"\\"Not in good cause.\\"\\"Oh the cause is excellent.\\"\\"Then I am your man.\\"\\"I was sure that I could rely on you.\\"The client turns out to be the King of Bohemia; he requires Holmes' assistance in obtaining an incriminating photograph of himself and one Irene Adler before he marries. It seems this past affair would ruin him because of her \\"station.\\" So far the King has tried unsuccessfully to buy it (she won't sell) to bribe her servants and finally even to steal it but Ms. Adler is always one step ahead. Holmes dons several disguises throughout his case, first as a groomsman to gain access to Adler's property and spy on her and then later as an (injured) clergyman. Irene Adler is a fantastic character, gaining the upper hand and in the end even outsmarting Holmes. I suppose it's her cleverness that causes Holmes to fall for her and why in the end she becomes known only as the woman. Cheers"},{"Title":"A scandal in Bohemia","review":"I loved it! the first time I ever read a short detective fiction in English. I liked the \\"the woman's\\" cleverness.

He uses the term \\"paradox\\" to mean a person who has views or theories contrary to the established system, in a variety of fields, including mathematics, the sciences in general, religion, politics, etc.This book is a single paperback book containing both Volumes 1 and 2. This was originally published as two volumes in 1915. However, the material all dates from the 1860's and earlier, and Volume 1 was apparently published in that time.This book is about people as revealed in their books and letters. In most or all cases, these were books or pamphlets or letters which were in de Morgan's collection. They are taken in chronological order, meaning the subject will jump from geometry to atomic theory to religion and back again. Some are described in a few sentences or paragraphs, some in a page or two, and some run on for multiple pages.One of the more common themes is the squaring of the circle or the related question of the calculation of pi. It might be assumed that de Morgan would go into detail about the methods used, the errors introduced, refutation of the false ideas, etc. But this is a book mainly about people, and so you'll find a discussion of this or that person, and generally what their ideas were, but in most cases, not a detailed analysis of their work or their errors.A general understanding of mathematical and scientific principles is helpful when reading the work, although, as noted, it is not a book of math theorems. Fortunately, most of the French and Latin quotations have been translated by the editors.The value of the work seems to me to be threefold. First, it reviews a great number of works and people, many of which were obscure in their own day, and many of which would be impossible to find today. Secondly, it serves as a window into the 19th century (and earlier) world of math and science, the ways of thinking, and the relationships between different groups. Thirdly, de Morgan does have occasional real gems of humor or wording in his work, and what might be otherwise very dry writing is made considerably more interesting by his sense of humor."},{"Title":"A budget of paradoxes","review":"The first edition is London: Longmans, Green, 1872.

I was a missionary in training, had just read an earlier out-of-print copy of this book, and even did a book review and report on the book for a missions course I was taking that semester. Next thing I knew, he was coming to campus and a request went out for students to house visiting missionaries. When I saw his name on the list, I jumped on it right away. Stories from Frank's life, that I had already read about, were now being told to me in person by Frank himself in the late night hours of dorm life. It was a deeply and permanently impacting week in my life.Frank and Marie were serving among the Jivaro/Shuar people in the jungles of Ecuador, not far from where the Aucas famously killed Nate Saint, a missionary pilot, and 4 other missionaries (including Jim Elliot) that became well known to the world after the incident. Frank Drown was among the first responders, leading a search team of missionaries, journalists, and military through the jungle.You do not have to have Frank stay in your dorm room to be impacted by the journey of his life. The book is written in a way that allows you to feel the jungle, get a sense of life in a challenging environment, experience the thrill of seeing remote tribal peoples come to know the Savior, and envision the passion that Frank and Marie had for ministry.I am thrilled to see that this book, which I had only read years ago using the Moody Bible Institute library copy, is now back in print. I plan to purchase and read it again."},{"Title":"Mission To The Head-Hunters","review":"This book is one of the best I've read.

I like to read books on historical fiction because you learn of the past and use it in the present to help you make decisions of things you go though. You also learn of things that you never knew took place. The main character, Martin Crawford, a young Scottish person, joined the alliance with the Robert the Bruce, king of scots, in 1290's. The Bruce is at war with King Edward, who is known as Longshanks. Martin's mother sends his brother, Sean, and him off to fight with the Bruce. Martin is not a fighting person, but he is a very clever lad, so the Bruce made him his page. As time goes on, the Bruce wins many battles and Longshanks dies. Martin's mother also dies in the book.

Sean, Martins older brother joins the army and uses his dead fathers spear. There are many battles in this book. The Scots win a lot of them. This rallies up more soldiers just as the Bruce wanted. Martin is sent on spy missions to find out what the British army is going to do or when they are going to attack. The Bruce wants to win this war badly, for his family's sake. His family was killed by the British, and they also took his daughter hostage in a castle. Winning the war also means Scotland's freedom. You will have to read the book to see if Scotland gets its freedom back, or if the Bruce gets his daughter backI liked this book because it has a lot of action. There are battles when you have no idea what is going to happen. It keeps you thinking, or wondering what is going to happen. You could expect something to happen but the exact opposite happens. There is nothing that I didn't like about this book. It gets right into action right away and that is what I like.I would want someone to read this book if they liked action / war books.

In Omoo, however, Melville shores up his powers of characterization, creating a fine supporting cast of individuals.If you are only familiar with Melville's later work, you will be surprised by the wry sense of humor Melville flashes throughout. Detailed descriptions of practical jokes, drunken brawls, and cultural faux-pas will make you smile, and sometimes laugh out loud. Certain passages are actually a riot!Also, in this novel (as compared to Typee), Melville's intrusions into the narrative are less glaring than they are in the previous novel. Yes, some of the diversions take the steam out of the narrative, as in Typee, but these diversions oftentimes give necessary exposition to illuminate characters' motivations.The beginning of the novel effectively captures the claustrophobic atmosphere aboard a whaling ship, and the crew are indeed a motley lot.Though you do not have to read Typee before you read Omoo (although the first page of Omoo is, literally, a continuation of the last page of Typee), I recommend you read both in conjunction. Be prepared to absorb a beautifully rendered atmosphere, describing the life of two roving beachcombers in the South Pacific in the early 19th century."},{"Title":"Omoo","review":"I am approaching the writer Melville with little prior knowledge about the man Melville. Apart from the Whale, read 30 years ago, I knew only Typee before taking up Omoo. Omoo is of course a sequel to Typee. While Typee's core theme is the narrator's life in captivity among an intact tribe of 'savages' in the Marquesas, Omoo continues his adventures as an island hopper, a sailor involved in a mutiny, a jailbird, a farm worker...All is told with a light hand, in short chapters. Interspersed are thoughts about colonialism and missionaries and about the fate of the native population of the islands. There is lots of ethnology on mainly two exotic tribes: the population of the whaling ships, and the people who live on Tahiti. The attacks on the missionaries seem to have been toned down a bit in view of criticisms at home. The sequel was less well received than the first book.What strikes me as curious about Omoo is the extent to which the author hides behind a mocking and sometimes self-ironic tone. He is not much given to reflections about himself, or at least not to sharing those with us. What do we conclude about the character of the hero? Obviously he has some problems integrating in his various social environments. He is always the outsider. He runs from his first ship, is an exotic guest in Typee, runs away, joins half-heartedly in a mutiny on his second ship, stays apart from the jail crowd and 'walks away' from prison, doesn't like the work on the potato farm, escapes from some unclear danger in the next village... Would one extrapolate so far, does it seem likely that he will succeed in settling down to any longer term project? He seems unsteady and shallow, aloof without much depth to offer. The story itself is fairly simple, the author does not appear to have a message above the adventure narration and a few rather superficial thoughts on the evils of civilization. In other words, one hopes he will grow up some time. Let's see."},{"Title":"Omoo","review":"The word that keeps coming to mind as I think about this book is \\"charming\\". Melville was in a good mood when he wrote \\"Omoo\\", no doubt enjoyed looking back on a very pleasurable period of his still-young life. While it is true that \\"Omoo\\" wasn't nearly as successful as \\"Typee\\" had been, it is still an impressive work for a young man in his mid-twenties.I enjoyed his portraits of the people he meets, and especially of his doctor friend, \\"Long Ghost\\". His descriptions of Polynesian life and the historical context are quite interesting. And it's funny: Melville had very good sense of humor, displays it throughout \\"Omoo\\".While the book is mainly a picaresque story of adventure, recounting the details of daily life in an exotic setting, and is a much happier book than \\"Typee\\", there are a few scenes that preview Melville's later narrative power. Here is the \\"Julia\\" in a tropical Pacific gale:\\"Under such a press of canvas, and with the heavy sea running, the barque, diving her bows under, now and then shipped green glassy waves, which, breaking over the head-rails, fairly deluged that part of the the ship, and washed clear aft.\\"And here is a glimpse of the brooding quality of his later work:\\"But my meditations were soon interrupted by a gray, spectral shadow cast over the heaving billows. It was the dawn, soon followed by the first rays of the morning. They flashed into view at one end of the arched night, like - to compare great things with small - the gleamings of Guy Fawkes's lantern in the vaults of the Parliament House. Before long, what seemed a live ember rested for a moment on the rim of the ocean, and at last the blood-red sun stood full and round in the level East, and the long sea-day began.\\"But these are very isolated examples. By and large, \\"Omoo\\" is a great contrast with Melville's other books. It is a light, easy, and amusing read. Highly recommended for Melville fans.Helpful critical works on Melville:Newton Arvin - \\"Herman Melville\\"D.H. Lawrence -\\"Studies in Classic American Literature\\".F.O. Matthiessen - \\"American Renaissance\\"Note: This particular edition is from the Northwestern-Newberry Edition of Melville's works, and is an MLA Approved Text. As such, it is authoritative, but it lacks an explanatory introduction, which may be a slight drawback."},{"Title":"Omoo","review":"As Melville stated himself, Omoo is only a sequel to Typee in that it follows the events that occur to the narrator after his experience with the Typee people from his first book. Only referred to once by his nickname Typee, the otherwise unnamed narrator agrees to temporary employment on the whaling ship Julia but finds himself in the middle of a crew that is dominated by a first mate while the captain has abdicated his responsibility and retreated into his infirmity. Upon the rejection of appeals to the local British consul to be exempt from active duty due to their own infirmity and the insistence of the mate that they get back to work, the narrator joins a group of mutineers that are taken ashore at Tahiti and confined to a makeshift jail from which escape is absurdly easy.Along with his fellow escapee and roving companion Doctor Long Ghost, the narrator proceeds to wander among the islands, seeking nominal employment only when it requires little effort and changing plan and direction upon momentary impulse. The two wanderers work for a pair of Australian and British planters briefly, then hear of other Westerners obtaining respectable employment as translators/private secretaries to chiefs of some of the clans and consider that that prospect might be enjoyable as well as respectable. As soon as they settle on one occupation they discard the idea in favor of something more appealing.The book takes on the rambling, episodic shape of their wanderings and lacks the cohesive narrative arc of Typee. In that book a thread of tension inherent in fear of the narrator that his benevolent captivity masked the true intentions of his cannibalistic captors of preparing him for a nice, hearty meal. In Omoo there is no realistic sense of danger. The rovers roam freely, escape captivity easily and possess an ease of mobility that the character in the first book never attained. This book is a loose narrative that merely serves the purpose of providing a framework in which Melville can describe the local culture, including brief explanations of dress, history, lifestyle, industry and so on.The most riveting portion of the book occurs early, with the description of the whaler and its crew. Notably, Melville's experience on a whaler such as the Julia not only enabled him to describe a whaling ship with verisimilitude but also provided him with the setting for Moby-Dick. The Julia and its crew is a greatly inferior forerunner of the more vividly realized Pequod and its array of memorable characters. No real whaling is described in Omoo and the conditions that precipitate the mutiny and subsequent Tahitian adventures are never sufficiently conveyed. The mate John Jermin is a weak predecessor of Captain Ahab.Omoo is intermittently interesting and the depiction of the native life varies in the extent to which it is successful. After reading the facts of Melville's experience from which he derived the narrative, I can see that he indulged in a great deal of fictional invention, conflating events and creating composite characters. What he failed to do was to create a compelling story. I would recommend the book only to readers who, like me, are curious about the books that Melville wrote before Moby-Dick changed the course of his career and secured his position in world literature."},{"Title":"Omoo","review":"This book can be read on its own even though it is the sequel to TYPEE. There are 82 short chapters that cover life on a whaler and various experiences on the island of Tahiti as well as surrounding islands. We get a feel for life on a whaler and for life on the islands and how foreigners, especially missionaries, influenced the natives for the worse.Omoo means a rover or one who wanders from island to island. Thus the title fits the feel of the narrative, but also points out a shortcoming as the book roves too much. We are taken from situation to situation a bit too abruptly. There are many characters and events that are introduced, but usually only on a superficial level. I would have liked more in-depth analysis from Melville as many of the characters were just that--characters. Also there are many, for me, unknown nautical terms used that made the reading hard work.However, enough of the stories give you the sense of being &quot;omoo&quot;, especially in a time vastly different from our own, that I recommend the book, even with the many sections that make you plod."},{"Title":"Imre: A Memorandum (Broadview Literary Texts)","review":"Oswald, a British aristocrat, meets the Hungarian soldier Imre in Budapest, and they develop a friendship. After some time, Oswald confesses his homosexuality and fears losing his new friend, but Imre's own confession changes both their lives. Privately published in 1906 under the alias Xavier Mayne, \\"Imre: A Memorandum\\" is one of the earliest novels with positive homosexual characters, and is especially notable for its happy ending. The story is more of a discourse about homosexuality and serves somewhat as a precursor to the author's later study, \\"The Intersexes\\". In his introduction and through various appendices, James Gifford tells about Stevenson's life, includes some other excerpts from Stevenson's works, and includes a review of \\"Imre\\" from 1907. This is a fascinating edition of an important work in queer literature."},{"Title":"The Economic Appraisal of Natural Gas Projects (Oxford Institute for Energy Studies)","review":"This is probably a good book for in depth theoretical approach to analyzing gas projects, but as a financial analyst that has modeled power plants and pipelines, this book did not supplement my appraisal skills, however misleading the title may be.It is filled with formulas and complex theory that business people really dont need to know. I think that this book may be helpful for engineers, or academics, but is too detailed to be of use to the asset developer looking for good ways to appraise or financially model a pipeline project.In short THIS IS NOT LEISURE READING MATERIAL, it does not flow from one paragraph to the other, and is jampacked with technical references that will make you pull your hair out.I rated this three stars because I am sure that somebody will find the technical Blitzkrieg of the author useful, but it wont be financial analysts or business developers."},{"Title":"The Economic Appraisal of Natural Gas Projects (Oxford Institute for Energy Studies)","review":"I totally agree with the previous comment on this book, it is not a book for leisure, it is a guide to setup energy economic models, understand them and use them.I bought this book in the year 2000, just when I was starting my BS thesis in Chem. Eng. By that time there were few detailed sources on energy pricing, most of them were written by and for financial analysts.This book is big on theory and formulas, ways to tackle economic assesments, forecasts, pricing, financing, time value of money, fuel properties, and so on....The way it is structured helps a lot, specially for engineers, to get a deep understanding on how fuel markets, money, time, strategies, micro and macro economics are inter related.I could, not easily though, to follow the majority of the chapters and setup my own spreadsheets and models to mimic in many cases the same example that was in the book (Pertamina, Indonesia), and use it for my thesis \\"natural gas penetration in the chilean market\\".

It is not a linear life history, nor does it focus primarily on musical quotations. It digs deeply into Beethoven's spirit and tries to grasp what made him so special. That is a fundamental bias of the book, so if you find Beethoven less a genius than Bach or Mozart or Mahler or Wagner, then you probably won't agree with Sullivan's conclusions. But, as a mathematician, he approached his subject without the standard musicologist biases, and that shines through in a work that is accessible to anyone who wants to think deeply about the ultimate meaning of great music, and how one person could create what Beethoven poured forth in his life."},{"Title":"Beethoven (Life and letters series)","review":"Sullivan examines Beethoven's spiritual development and how that development was reflected in the composer's music.

The organic feature of his works shows the timeless conflict between the will and the fate ; the horizontality of the destiny and the verticality of the irrevocable and untamed human character .Ernest Newman has said : \\" The peculiarity of Beethoven imagination is that it raises over and over to heights since we can do a new appraisement , not only of all the music but the life , the emotions and the ideas\\".Think in the Final of the last variation of his Third Symphony and will understand the message ; you have to fight always without expecting anything in change ; because the hero attitude is to make not to think . And you know this wisdom statement of Goethe: \\"We are what we do\\".This book is admirably compelling and reveals unknown facets , interesting letters and even I do not agree with the value of the last stage of his life in which the transfiguration and the evasion would seem derivate making a simple analysis of the endings of his last three Piano Sonatas , the text is a must for any reader really interested in the life and work of this icon beacon of the mankind : Ludwig van Beethoven."},{"Title":"Beethoven (Life and letters series)","review":"Written in wonderfully old fashioned English, Sullivan illuminates the meaning of much of Beethoven's music.

HOWEVER.. this is just a note to say THIS REALLY and truly is a BRILLIANT BOOK.... and for anyone wanting to dive straight into the deep end as to what Beethoven and ART and Classical Music par se is and the mind of a composer and the struggle of a life between Art, creativity, God and love and genius is all about this is the one book to get. Yet, surprisingly not only all made very understandable but then clarity and inspiration and feel good factor was never made so good in a book on a composer, also made so enjoyable. A true and real learning journey in this book.Priceless. I felt myself on tour with the writer and the works and mind of life of Beethoven as though the man was his art and his work. Out of MUCH self taught reading on classical music. This book truly remains my ALL TIME FAVOURITE book about any single composer. Supremely well written and written with clarity and passages I underlined endlessly. It is one of those books. Just well researched, well written and written about from angles and insights that you really DID want to know and not written anywhere else and never realised you did want to know and it is a real journey. If you feel a journey with Beethoven\`s music this is the best book ever written to get into his mind , and his art and the music and his life as one.... A real cherished classic. I hate the phrase. This book is one of 20-30 that I look back really does come under the heading \\"life changer\\" and can give a truer real insight into the mind of genius and ART in capital letters and an artist\`s intention and the working of a mind and spirit..and it explains the music so well in relation to his life and genius. A seriously great gem , where every page is a page turning inspiration and delight. Seriously 5+ Not a normal book. Exceedingly well done... This book is special. Class of it\`s own and essential reading on Beethoven. Trust me. And write your own review. I challenge anyone not to adore this book and give it a 5 having read it. I\`m serious. Think about it compared to all the others on Beethoven and dull ill written biographies and over detailed stuff. This book really hits the spot and is very very well writen in style and content and theme and insight....and is concise. : ) I.e not only readable but also exciting and a a book to learn from not just factually but with real thinking and a journey and highly enjoyable read. The world it takes one too to the mind of the composer and the music and the journey it takes one too is first class. A really enjoyable mind expanding insight. Seriously good. i.e Great."},{"Title":"Beethoven (Life and letters series)","review":"After over 30 years since my first reading of this book, it remains one of the most important in my life. Sullivan was a science writer, not a musicologist and this is no academic treatise. After 3 chapters examining the various meanings and definitions of music and making a case for music as communication of non verbal reality, Sullivan looks at Beethoven's life as it developed and how it developed from the young power playing virtuoso to an artist who has probably gone farther in spiritual development than any other. Keys include the fact that his music got better and better as he aged, as his life developed as an organic whole, being absolutely true to his own experience."},{"Title":"Beethoven (Life and letters series)","review":"Sullivan's book has remained in print for over 70 years, despite not being a definitive source book for facts about Beethoven's life and work. Sullivan's achievement is different. Sullivan wrote one of the very few biographies, about Beethoven or anybody else, that captures and understands the level of \\"depth of life\\" that results from identifying one's life with the search for the meaning of life and of the universe, if there is any such meaning. Beethoven lived on this level and the particular path Beethoveen pursued and expressed in his music is uniquely understood by Sullivan. This biography is a masterpiece in its own right."},{"Title":"Beethoven (Life and letters series)","review":"Sullivan was a mathematician, scientist and philosopher, but music had a high priority in his life. And Beethoven was at the top of his list of greats. He says: &quot;Perhaps even Shakespeare never reached that final stage of illumination that is expressed in some of Beethoven's late music.&quot;As the title says, this is not a biography so much as a description of Beethoven's &quot;spiritual development. If you love Beethoven. You must read this book.And you might ask yourself the question: Why has this book remained in print for 73 years?"},{"Title":"Beethoven (Life and letters series)","review":"This book profoundly deepened my experience of music. It opened doors of appreciation for both listening to music and expressing myself musically. It inspires one to put the whole of themselves with ever increasing passion into their creative endeavors and by extension their lives. As Beethoven said, \\"There is no loftier mission than to approach the Godhead nearer than other people, and to disseminate the divine rays among humanity.\\" Read this book. You will not regret it."},{"Title":"Beethoven (Life and letters series)","review":"This short masterpiece was written in 1927, probably to mark the centennial of Beethoven's death. It's an extraordinary book that gets inside the mind of Beethoven and requires no technical knowledge of music or anything else for one to profit from its considerable insights. In fact it was the first book I ever read on the composer, back when I was a classical music neophyte, and it really helped me appreciate the music I subsequently heard. Saying you're dealing with a book that \\"gets into the mind\\" of the subject is hardly unusual...after all, Maynard Solomon is always professing to do this. But this book *does.* The author says nothing radical about the personality of his subject, but he does a thorough job of exploring Beethoven's mind and explaining why his greatest masterpieces are just that. Written at a time when Beethoven was widely considered THE greatest composer (a view I hold as well), the book has no problems with absolute statements about the relative values of different elements and aspects of music, and what Sullivan (and many others of the time) valued about Beethoven was his constant growth, growth to higher and more refined realms of consciousness. We are not so comfortable with pronouncements like this today in this more relativistic age. And Mozart is today considered at least Beethoven's equal and more often his superior, often by people unfamiliar with both composers beyond a superficial take or else publishers/performers all to eager to jump on the public's \\"Moe-zart is divine\\" bandwagon for reasons having more to do with box office than any true conviction. Here Sullivan, who is a truly gifted writer when it comes to music, demonstrates the inexorable artistic growth of his subject and how that growth changed all Western music forever, causing us to really understand and value the content of the middle and late string quartets, the Missa Solemnis, the Hammerklavier, and Op. 111. We live in an era where we've, for sociological reasons, shied away from extra-musical meaning in music. Fortunately, Sullivan was born long before such concerns came to be, and so he isn't afraid to tell us the Op. 131 string quartet contains a more refined level of music thought--in the way Beethoven *organically* organizes his material, chooses harmonic presentation over the stormy conflict of his second period works (5th symphony, 3rd piano concerto, etc.), and breaks the expected bounds of four movements and certain key structures. Beethoven's earlier music has roots in Haydn, Mozart and just the general Viennese music of its day, but as Sullivan points out, his late period is sui generis. It has no precedent, although arguably with it he gave birth to the avant-garde, for better or worse. Really, is there another composer who journeyed so far and changed his musical approach, his way of solving musical problems so much, who never stopped developing (many say in his very last works they hear the buddings of a \\"fourth period\\" that was cut short by illness) as Beethoven?Sullivan makes us aware--it seems obvious but it is often overlooked in books about the composer today--how Beethoven was the first to envision the whole work as an organic organism. While Mozart may have given us a Jupiter Symphony, for example, and as magnificent as it is, only the last movement is truly \\"Jupiter,\\" the other movements *could* be excised and attached to other works with the same key flow without harm. Even early Beethoven functions this way. By Beethoven's second period, organic elements begin to dictate form and content--starting essentially with the Eroica symphony and continuing with the 5th, where the real interest is not with the famous da-da-da-duum first movement but rather the scherzo-finale transition. This type of organic logic was a precursor, Sullivan shows, to the unity of the three Galitzin quartets of the late period, which he rightly considers three of the greatest if not *the* greatest creations in Western music.To be sure the book isn't without flaws. His suggestion that Beethoven was perhaps unique among artists (not just composers, but artists) for his continuous and organic spiritual growth till his death, and that he channeled this growth into his work, had me wondering if he'd perhaps like to also consider Rembrandt. The author glosses over Beethoven's personality shortcomings in an effort to show the artist is as sublime as the art (widely believed in those days...but this was before we saw newsreels of Hitler and Goebbels listening to the Ode to Joy). His circular reasoning (on p. 128) involving Beethoven's dealings with his publishers regarding the Missa Solemnis would be hilarious if Sullivan weren't completely sincere. And he gave me a chuckle when the commented early on that advances in modern (1927) society will likely soon mean that people know little of personal suffering that afflicted the artists of Beethoven's time, or words to that effect. But overall this is a superb study of why Beethoven *matters,* why his sacrifice, life and illnesses contributed to the advance of the art of composing, and why it was very conscientious on the composer's part. Rereading this work (I originally bought this book on impulse when I was in 9th grade and hadn't read it since), I gained an even deeper insight into works I thought I knew well. He shows how the light-to-darkness transition that marks the 5th symphony is superseded by a much more mature understanding of suffering and the outcome of that suffering in later works such as (the first three movements of) the 9th symphony and the B-flat Major late quartet (with the Grosse Fugue included). He gives a convincing argument that despite the 6th being Beethoven's \\"Pastorale\\" symphony, it's the 7th that's really his hymn to nature. And his interpretation of the events that transpire in the 4th symphony are very eye-opening and interesting, even if you think you know that work by heart. Considering he was writing in an era before recordings of these works (Schnabel and Weingartner had not even made their earliest Beethoven discs) and that he had to become familiar with all these pieces--and the late ones were not so often played at the time, a mass public not yet being ready for them--either by concert performance or by score, assuming he could read scores. The fact that this music was far less available in his day makes me think that more of those who were lucky enough to hear it listened actively, and thought more about what they heard.There are a few musical lapses. With the exception of the Hammerklavier, which gets a whole chapter, he short-changes the late sonatas somewhat. (No mention of Op. 101 or Opp. 109-110.) Another mature masterpiece, the Archduke Trio, gets only a brief nod. And the Diabellis and Bagatelles are ignored when discussing Beethoven's late period masterpieces. Still, this is an impressive book overall, giving more insight into Beethoven in 170 tight pages than many a tome five times its length. This book should be on every Beethoven-lover's bookshelf, even if you think you already have read everything you need to about the composer and his greatest masterworks. Highly highly recommended."},{"Title":"Beethoven (Life and letters series)","review":"Amateurs tread upon the musicologist's turf always at their peril - a tendency doubled in the case of one amateur reviewing another. J.W.N. Sullivan was one of the most gifted popularizers of science (i.e., THE LIMITATIONS OF SCIENCE) between the world wars, conveying in clear, polished prose the main lines of scientific development tailing Einstein's once-in-a-lifetime comet. When he turned his hand to music, as in this short appraisal of the inner development of Beethoven as it found expression in his work, he brought to the task his customary literary gifts, and the result is a joy to read. Sullivan spends a fair amount of throat-clearing time early in his book in discussing the capacity of music to convey deep, extralinguistic truth (a topic ground to dust by every would-be philosopher since at least as far back as the pre-Socratics). The remainder of the book highlights the unending round of struggles - physical, material, emotional - faced by the composer, and the ways in which he strove to express and overcome them in his music. Especially from the vantage of today, with the wealth of fine scholarship at their disposal, Beethoven specialists may quarrel throughout with Sullivan's pet notions. But general readers, who have claims of their own, will be hard put to find a more moving or better-written short attempt at conveying what stirs us still in the life and work of a composer who, to paraphrase the great musicologist Sir Donald Tovey, will always occupy a central place in a sound musical mind."},{"Title":"Beethoven (Life and letters series)","review":"This book is essential reading for all who appreciate Beethoven's music. It would be futile to try and review it here; indeed, the book needs no review. It will be appreciated by all who know, after listening to Beethoven, that this is not merely music for entertainment, but music that uplifts, in the very real sense of the word."},{"Title":"Beethoven (Life and letters series)","review":"I recommend the book not only for its intertwined information about the composer's life and works, but for its demonstration of Beethoven's inward evolution. My one criticism is that the author tends to see in some of Beethoven's clearly neurotic behavior (e.g., his obsession with his nephew; his incredible personal messiness; his narcissistic rages at certain colleagues) an overabundance of some sort of energy--which may indeed be the case at a very deep level, but hey, misbehavior is misbehavior. Nevertheless, an excellent Beethoven resource."},{"Title":"Beethoven (Life and letters series)","review":"Artists of all persuasions have a story to tell. Artistic genius is the manifestation of the artists journey from despair to hope. The journey is never easy and so the struggle is usually momentous. Recently, I reviewed biographies by Denton Snider, who, as it seems, was a contemporary of J.W.Sullivan. Perhaps it was in the spirit of the day to talk about spiritual awakenings and their manifestations in the creations of geniuses; like Beethoven, Lincoln, Dante, Shakespeare, to name a few. It is an inner yearning to be free that propels the spirit to transcend its limitations and reach for the Divine. Whether in remarkable accomplishments such as in music, or literature, or poetry, or politics, we get to glimpse into the abyss before we recognize where truth, beauty, and art intersect. Read this biography by Sullivan or better yet, listen to the music his biography is based on. No doubt you will agree, that, truth and beauty are better than fiction."},{"Title":"ExamKrackers MCAT Organic Chemistry","review":"If you did well in organic chem 1 and 2, then this book is great for a quick review. the best part is you can even go through it quickly."},{"Title":"ExamKrackers MCAT Organic Chemistry","review":"Top notch book that makes learning the Organic section of the MCAT as painless as possible.

The problems are quick and can be done in the head (no need for paper) so they can be done pretty much anywhere.

Ethanol, benzophenone, methyl benzoate or triphenylcarbinol.\\" The answer they give is triphenylcarbinol, \\"because it has extensive resonance stabilization of the conjugate base's negative charge.\\" While resonance stabilization of the anion makes a proton more acidic, triphenylcarbinol doesn't have any of it. Most of the errors are along these lines; they won't give you completely the wrong answer, but they might force you to say \\"huh?\\" and look it up on wikipedia before deciding the book is incorrect.(Also, if typos annoy you, don't buy this book - it is FULL of them.

This is a rather specialized book on casseroles, and most of the recipes are quite elegant, often requiring wine or unusual combinations of ingredients like fruit and meat. There are no instructional pictures or diagrams, but the recipes are simple, they produce terrific-tasting meals, and it's just so easy to throw everything into one casserole dish.From the Foreward: \\"The main dishes are devoted to meats, poultry, fish, and soup-stews. Side dishes of rice, barley, and bulgur are followed by ideas on cooking vegetables and by a few vegetable recipes. Some general notions about salads are given, together with some specific recipes for them and their dressings. Five recipes for breads and their several possible variations, eleven desserts, and a final section on a few drinks and appetizers complete the book. The number of side dishes is purposely limited for the convenience of the cook. . . . All the recipes, like a deck of cards, may be shuffled in various combinations; their use is not dictated by the menus as given.\\"The main dish recipes are accompanied by suggestions for side dishes, wine, and desserts. The flexibility built in to the menus makes it so easy to experiment. Often meals can be made a day ahead, and there are \\"At this point you may stop and continue later\\" instructions if you want to ready the casserole before cooking it for convenience. Though the recipes lean toward the gourmet, they are quite easy to understand and follow. There is no reason to be scared away by something unusual or French. This book may open up a whole new world of cookery for you as it did me with wines, organ meats, and different nationalities. Recipes are for 6 persons, and you'll need a 5 or 6-quart casserole dish; a smaller dish may be in danger of overflowing for some recipes. Sometimes salt and other spices will need adjusting, and 16-ounce cans in the 1960's are now 14 1/2-oz size. With these recipes Corningware is your friend (vintage Corningware, not the new junk) because you can brown on the range top and then throw it right into the oven--and later into the fridge or freezer if you like.Recipes we have made and enjoyed over the years are Tongue with Cranberries, Chicken with Apricots and Rice, Chicken with Lemon and Sour Cream, Chicken with Lemon and Tarragon, Chicken with White Port and Coriander, Duck with Olives and Mushrooms, Bread en Casserole (superb), Rice Pudding, Seedless Grapes in Sour Cream (elegant).I consider this book to be a companion volume to The One-Dish Cookbook because they both deal with one-dish meals made in casseroles. We have treasured the recipes in this book. Though out of print, Amazon and other venues still offer plenty of used copies of this book. It makes a great gift for people who care about good food and like something a little unusual."},{"Title":"Legends of Our Time","review":"Elie Wiesel has always been one of my favorite authors.

Feeney does this in a very painless and enjoyable way. I read it over the space of a weekend, (120 pages with a glossary at the back) and was laughing out loud at times. At other times, I was thinking very deeply about the content and its implications. Its a roller coaster and incites both emotions, almost simultaneously.

It reads like a business start-up guide but between the lines is good solid advice (importance of Vision statement, training, business planning, customer servicing, quality control, management styles, finance, sales, Etc.). Not being from a large organisation, I always wondered what 'Human Resource Management' was all about - Now I know, its about paint-ball and treating people (human resources) like four year old kids!I liked especially the section on 'extreme management' Chapter 24 - its expensive training at 50,000 Euro but a great way to avoid Tax - Everyone in Ireland is involved in Tax scams! There's very few people (apart from PAYE workers) paying Tax.In Business planning he writes about the Business Expansion Scheme, another great Tax dodge, currently 'on-hold' pending European investigation. Little to do with Business expansion, the 'scheme' was aimed at expanding the amount of Tax you don't have to pay.Its an eclectic mix of wit, organisational observation, satire and is a roller-coaster ride for anyone involved in the 'black art of management' - whether you're a manager OR report to a manager, you'll still experience the same spasms of recognition on reading this colourful little book."},{"Title":"America in Prophecy (aka The Great Controversy)","review":"As Africans we have always asked ourselves &quot;Who is financing the wars in our continent&quot;.

These are really great questions that obviously took a lot of thought to come up with as they are all open-ended and don't expect any \\"right\\" answers. In fact, in the introduction it is stressed that each individual comes to a book with their own personal background knowledge and experiences a book differently from other readers. The goal is to encourage children to be discerning readers, to really think about what they read, without judging them for their answers.The only downside is that this book was published decades ago and while some of the books covered are modern classics, such as Harriet the Spy, others are hard to find or nearly unknown now. It is my hope that by reading it I will be empowered to come up with stimulating questions for any novel, but oh, how I hope I can find as thorough treatments of other books out there somewhere. Mr. Reasoner, you did an excellent job."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"still a good read but not as good as the other books in the series"},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"If you're looking for a romantic, clich&eacute;, smooth novel, then SPECIALS is not for you. However, if you are searching for a fast paced novel with adventure and twist and turns of every kind, I highly recommend this book. As the finale to the UGLIES trilogy, Westerfeld has truly outdone himself, in more ways than one. There's a quick pace with a helping of on-the-edge excitement that makes SPECIALS a good choice for almost any teenage/young adult reader. I say teenage/young adult reader because younger children would most likely be confused as to what is what in this futuristic society and older adults, though I am not counting them out entirely, might not understand the teenagers \`petty' problems and reasons for taking the actions they do. To be blunt, to really enjoy the book, the reader must be able to fit themselves into the characters shoes. However, with a twist and turn around every chapter, once the reader has begun, it is impossible to stop.The third book in the UGLIES trilogy is a grand conclusion to Tally's adventure. Unlike many series I've read, SPECIALS ends it with a bang, but not a terrible cliffhanger. As the story moves along, the reader will find it more and more suspenseful. I personally have found this to be a book you have to sit down and just read in one day, and its size makes that very possible. Another plus to this book is that the reader doesn't have to start at UGLIES and work their way up, the basic plot is explained for the most part. Finally, Westerfeld's imaginative land of beauty and perfection doesn't end at PRETTIES, but instead reveals a very fascinating side in SPECIALS.However, I still found the book to be lacking very important pieces. As I found in UGLIES and PRETTIES, SPECIALS is also difficult to understand from time to time. The environment is very vivid and creative, but I don't believe Westerfeld's writing abilities capture its full potential. Even though there is obvious improvement, the action scenes along with some descriptive settings become confusing at times. There is also the beginning of the book. For a reader starting the book, the beginning may be fine, but if the reader is coming from PRETTIES then problems occur. There isn't a smooth transition from PRETTIES to SPECIALS at all. Yes, there was a large gap between UGLIES and PRETTIES, but the readers had background information on the pretties then and knew what was going on. As for the opening in SPECIALS, without more information on the specials, Tally and the others actions leave the reader questioning how they are able to do what they do and why they're doing it in the first place.Overall, I enjoyed SPECIALS, but it wasn't the most spectacular novel I've read. Indeed, the ideas, creativity, imagery, and almost everything about the book astounded me and left me asking: How does he come up with this stuff? But, as I said though, his writing style didn't seem to fit the mood or flow. I did love the ending the most, but I probably shouldn't be commenting on that part. In my opinion, it's a good book for a rainy day, one the reader can read again and again and still find new things. Surprising, I usually prefer a fantasy/horror genre over the sci-fi/technologically-advanced stories, but SPECIALS was just... well... a special book."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I didn't like pretties very much but when a friend of mine offered to lend me specials I couldn't pass it up. Why I'm baffled is that several times during this book I screamed out loud \\"this book sucks\\" or \\"I hate this book\\" Somehow though it got better towards the end and by the end of the book I somehow had recieved the impression that it was a good book.The internal struggles of Tally are the main focus of this book. She tries to figure out who she is, who the actual person inside of this body that has had all these operations done to it is.However, the main reasoning behind the book fails to make sense. If the government is trying to stop violence by preforming operations on people to subdue parts of their brain, why wait that long, why not start at the genetic stage? In this series everyone has the actual genetics of an \\"ugly\\" \\"random\\" person. Even today in the times of genetic engineering this could easily be controlled. Humans could have certain alleles and genes added and removed to control appearance. So it makes no sense in the series that if the government truly wanted to control people that everyone receives an expensive operation when subduing this part of the brain could be done permanently at the genetic stage. With gene splicing and cloning we're probably already capable of these things.I'm blathering but that really struck me while I was reading this.So, storywise it was a slow, frustrating, creepy start but the book redeems itself at the end and made it worth reading."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I read this book and i thought it was fantastic! I think it focused on some boring details too much sometimes, which made it just ok at times, but for the most part i LOVED it! I read the following books in the trilogy, and they were good as well. I think the first book is the best, though. The second and third books get a bit boring as you read farther into them, but the first book was no doubt a wonderful adventure! All three of the books are filled with unexpected events. I couldn't put them down!

Twice appearing two times on the same page. I couldn't take it. I really wanted to finish the series but with the word Random and Tally about to betray her first love David. I stopped reading early on.I agree that the author overused the same words making it difficult to continue reading. I also agree with another review regarding Tally's transformations from Ugly to Pretty to Special made it difficult to relate to the heroine."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"The first half or so of the book is somewhat clumsy, and rather hard to get into. There is just something off and unconvincing about the attempt to be inside Tally's icy new mindset. These shortcomings are especially notable as the first two books in the trilogy are so cleverly written and the shifts in Tally's mindsets always so seamless and believable. Westerfeld never quite captures Tally's voice in Specials until a little into the second half, when the book really starts to take off. From there to the end, the action is gripping and Tally is once again convincing. Perhaps the author never felt quite comfortable with Tally as a Cutter.As great as this trilogy is, there is one facet of all three books that stands out. Whether or not it detracts from the series is up for debate, but it is hard not to notice that there is never a single point where Tally does not have a male counterpart with whom she has sexual tension. First, there is Peris. And then David. And then Zane. And even when she is in the middle of a (supposedly) Pre-Rusty civilization deep in the wilderness, leave it to Tally to buddy up with Andrew Simpson Smith. One would assume this is just a typical convention of young adult literature, but it got to be a little trite."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"i know this isnt like the other reveiws you are reading...but this is my feedback:1. uglies was awesome, it was an excellent beginning to the series.

It was worth the wait. This book, unlike many other teen novels, was never predictable- it left you guessing until the end. I found the end a little disappointing but I know many other people who disagree with me. If you have read all of the books in this series, you should check out some of the other books by Scott Westerfeld.

At least she hasn't forgot about Zane. She's determined to get him in a as a Cutter and makes promises to Shay in order to get her help to turn Zane into a Special even if it's not what Zane wants. They pull off a huge trick that not only allows Zane and friends to escape but starts a war. A great ending to a wonderfully entertaining trilogy."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"This last book, was undoubtedly the best book in the trilogy. It was well developed and reavealed some shocking facts about the world inhabited by Tally.This was the most developed book, scott really took his time with this one.\\"Face it Tally-wa you're special.\\" Whoever thought Shay might one day regret those words?Tally has now become a Cutter,a special special, a super fighting machine ready to take on and destroy any opposition. But what happens when you're too special, more than even the extreme level?Tally now works with Shay, Fausto, Tachs and Ho from Pretties, together they form the Cutters team along with 11 others, but lets not forget Zane.Zane has been transformed back to a pretty, but this time, he wastes no time in helping with the revolution. Now faced with the choice-- Lose Tally or betray the smoke, he's going to have to make the ultimate decision-one that may resulting in loss of life.The Smokies have new allies now, they are more grouped together.They manage to take the specials by suprise, first by kidnapping Fausto and ambushing Shay's team, then showing that the specials are way behind--thousands have started receiving a new cure-- not the old one, Zane and Tally took, a much better one Tally might have mistakenly discovered. Throughout the story the Smokies suprise everyone with how far they've come.But all is not cat and mouse, war is beginning to stir up between Diego--the Smokies city and Dr. Cable's world, as a result of an action by Tally and Shay, but Tally may end up being the only Special left............I especially loved the ending, i would tell you all, but i don't want to spoil it. A hint though: There's a new special circumstances."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"Though not as excellent as the first two books, Specials is quite well written. It is surprisingly short and digs up many characters from the past - I reccommend reading it while the other books are fresh in your mind. What I found the best of the book was its very existentialist theories. The futility of Tally's situation is thoroughly examined and her fight to find truth is interesting. It was compelling to see how much intelligence Special Circumstances really has and made me wonder if our world, our country will soon suffer the same fate.8/10"},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"As a 28-year-old woman, I have been surprised and pleased to find myself as engaged by these books as I am. They are well-written, fast-moving and intriguing, and provide a lot of food for thought. The world is so different and vibrant that it feels real to me even after closing the books, which is somewhat rare for me.This stunning last book in the series features Tally and Shay being \\"rewarded\\" for their amazing skill in becoming clear-minded and escaping the shackles of pretty-hood, by being made into Specials, the police force that takes care of \\"Special Circumstances\\" in the city and beyond. Shay heads up an elite Special force which is charged with taking down the Smokies, the rebel community that lives from the wild and never turns pretty.The Smokies are infiltrating the city and curing large numbers of pretties, and only the Specials can stop humanity from reverting to the horrible ways of life previous to having Pretties - when humans burnt and chopped down forests, decimated the wild, killed animals and each other, and generally spoiled the land so badly that many parts are completely ruined.The Specials embark on a journey to find the New Smoke and destroy it, to preserve their way of life. They follow Tally's old boyfriend Zane, a revolting ordinary pretty, and the Crims, as they try to find the New Smoke. Even with Tally's Special brain, though, she hasn't forgotten what Zane meant to her, and her conflict between who she was and who she is helps drive the story to its ultimate conclusion.This was an extremely satisfying ending to the trilogy. I can't wait for the new book that is set in the future, with new characters - Extras. Do be sure and read all of these in order, though - they wouldn't make sense otherwise."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"Bought this book for my 15 yrs old daughter.

A great summer read for any guy or girl.."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I am most definitely pleased with this trilogy. From the beginning I was pulled into these books. The first book, Uglies, was full of excitement, the most thrilling book of this trilogy, and(as I always am with sci-fi)I was forever trying to learn more about Tally's world. The next book, Pretties, was a bit less exciting, but a very good book, none the less. I thought this second book seemed a sort of standstill, kind of a stall between the cliff-hanger beginning and the climatic ending, though still a good read and a necessary piece to this series. The final book was probably my fav., and, I thought, the most complex piece to this 3-part story."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"Specials is the third -- and very satisfying -- end to a trilogy that is positioned as a teen book but made its way through our whole family. It touches on many intruiging themes...ethics, the shape of the future, what it means to be ugly, pretty, or special, and what it means to be an individual. Excellent!"},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I loved the idea of the world Westerfeld created. That was the only thing that got me to finish through 'Specials', and attempt the delve into 'Extras'.But there are just too many inconsistencies. One that has bothered me all throughout the three books is how Tally was able to outsmart a Special in 'Uglies' - only to be told in 'Specials' that Specials have superfine senses that can detect the slightest things. Wouldn't a Special have been able to detect what she was planning in her movements before Tally - as an ugly - moved?But the most painful to read was how inconsistently annoying Tally was in 'Specials' - it would have been less painful is she had been consistently annoying. I understood that her irrational behaivor was due to being turn into a Special because of the behavioral modifications. But her rational moments popped up in random spots, without any consistency as to why she was suddenly rational. How does she switch back and forth from rationality to irrationality so quickly, without any lingering effects of either? There was absolutely no middle ground for her character to learn and grow and actually change in a believable manner.What bothered me the most in 'Specials' was how the cure worked. The cure made the Specials slow and stupid. I thought the whole point of the cure was to let everyone regain their own minds - not to change their physical appearance. Why couldn't Fausto or Shay given Tally a sharp slap when she was going mental? Their bodies and strength never should have changed; it should have only affected their free will."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"This is the 3rd book in the Uglies trilogy and while it was a good book it did not grab me as much as Uglies did. In a way it was sort of a repeat of Pretties taken up to another level. Tally once again has been transformed without her consent and has to \\"rewire\\" herself to remember who she really is. There is continued tension between she and Shay which I was really hoping would get resolved in a happy way. I would have liked to see more interaction between Tally and Zane. The ending was a little cheesy but I am satisfied.Stop here if you don't want any spoilers.I have to say I was satisfied with the ending except that Zane was killed off! That really bugged me. In Pretties it was such a big deal how \\"bubbly\\" Zane was and how Tally chose him over David. In Specials Zane is pretty crippled and is portrayed in a pretty sad light. Tally is disgusted by his averageness and it never really gets resolved until he dies and even then you never really know what would have happened between teh two of them if he was cured. What I also found cheesy is how she ends up back with David and goes off to live with him. There wasn't much build up as to why she started to like him again and it seems so sudden after Zane's death that you really have to wonder about Tally's fickleness."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"Read this a the recommendation of a friend.

She and I share a love of fantasy / sf novels, and we often trade books back and forth.I thought this series would be a bit juvenile, and yes, it is definitely targeted for teens. However, it is also well written and entertaining, with some fascinating concepts centered around a dystopian-but-hopeful future society. If you are a fan of light science fiction, dystopian fiction, or &#34;futures imperfect&#34; type stories, you will enjoy it I think. It's a quick read and a real page-turner.This is the third book in the series, and was not quite as good as the first two (I liked &#34;Pretties&#34;, the second novel, best.) However if you are already invested in this series, it will not let you down . . . it's quite enjoyable!"},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"This whole series kept me wanting more. I found myself looking around at the people I was in contact with on a daily basis and just wondering... It kind of mirrors our government these days. It was very interesting and I would reccomend it if you like to imagine the world in another way."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"The beginning was rough for me. It started out very fast paced. Tally is now in a special group who themselves the Cutters. They are like one person in five bodies. Shay is the leader of this new group. Their main goal is to bust the new Smokies and stop the spreading of the nano pills.The story Takes place a couple of months after book two. Tally has been in training to be a special. They are fast, intimidating, intelligent, and dangerous. I am not sure how I felt about this particular part of the story since I had grown to dislike Special Circumstances so much. I was hoping, like the other two books, she would overcome this roadblock. Tally's character has always been a pleaser, and she is no different in this book.The struggle between the Specials and Smokies heat up in this book. The new Smokies are more prepared than they used to be. They have unknown allies lurking in the shadows. I liked this turn of events! I hate when people rush head first into things so it was good to see some improvements on their part. Their ally is a neighboring city by the name of Diego. The city is extremely tolerant and allows the Smokies to hide out there and to also bring runaways in. They allow their citizens to have any kind of surgery they wish. This was a little weird for me at first. The way Westerfeld described these people's \\"surges\\" was just silly. The part that made me laugh was when I read that some of these folks went as far as to put snakes on their pinkies. WOW! I would have never thought to do something as outrageous as that. I was constantly eager to see what would happen next.The cities in this book are beginning to fall through. The cure is working better than ever and more and more pretties are regaining their ability to think for themselves. This was one part of the book I thought turned out well. I liked the fact that these mindless citizens were finally granted the opportunity to have a free will. I was not so certain that immediately curing them was the answer. They have been so controlled for so long I figured all hell would break loose. Yet, surprisingly they were all living a peaceful existence.Although I was on a neutral level with Shay's character in the past, I had come to fully dislike her in this book. She has become cruel, self centered, deceitful, and manipulative. The worst part is she seemed to enjoy it. Shay had become the villain in this book. Then out of no where, Shay saves the day. ( Yes, I understand mind control plays a huge part of her personality throughout the book, but I was just very thrown off by her anger). Shay never seems to find happiness in anything she does. She always has to find ways to make things good for herself. In this book, it involved cutting. I am glad that Westerfeld touches base on the fact that cutting is a fake pleasure that only makes you \\"icy\\" (happy) for a short while. I believe this is a message that a lot of teenagers could learn from.\\"pretty heads\\" would say, \\"totally bogus!\\" The fact that she thought they had to better themselves to be with her set my blood to boil. Let's just say I did not get along with her personality in this book very well.I gave this book in the series three stars instead of five because I was slightly disappointed with the story line. I felt that it was at this stand still throughout half the book. It was more of the same things happening over and over. Yeah, the story in general is good, but I found myself expecting a little more. The only big changes that saved this book for me was at the end. ******SPOILER SKIP TO NEXT PARAGRAPH**** The war between the cities, Zane's death, the despecialization surgeries, Dr. Cable cured, and Tally and David running off together to save the world! This is where all the interesting parts happened for me. This is what made me antsy to read the last book.The other reason I gave this a three star is because the romance in this book dwindled away. I wanted to see maybe a come back with David, or at least a spark with Zane. Instead, I got a self indulgent, superficial Tally who believes they need to become better for her to want to be with them. She seems to continually struggle with her self throughout the book. Tally hates the fact that she sees Zane as weak andOverall, Westerfeld has shocked and pleased me so far. This is definitely a series I would recommend. Although this book was kind of slow, the story is still great. It was not until the end that I found myself unable to put this book down. I am eager to pick up with Extras where he left off. I cannot wait to find out what happens in the end of it all."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"Part of the Uglies series. Great light read for ladies or YA.

Her best friend Peris has already had the operation and she can't wait to see him again. Tally is so desperate to see him she actually sneaks into Pretty Town to see him. She gets caught and then runs away by jumping off of the building. Tally then meets Shay, a girl running away from the operation. Tally follws her and they go an a crazy adventure together. The Smoke ( where Shay lives) is revealed to the Pretties and they come and attack. Tally then decides to go with the operation for the sake of medicine to help a boy she met, David,'s parents. Then the book ends after that. It was a really exciting read that I would recommend to anybody!"},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I thought this was one of the best books written. This series is very close to the hunger games. It has action,romance,and thrill. I wish there were more books like this cause once i start to read it i can't stop reading. once i stayed up till 3:30 in the morning reading it cause it was so good."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"This was a great book overall. I was happy with the ending but I would have liked a little more details about the remaining characters. I don't want any spoilers in my review so I won't mention names but I'm a sucker for a good love story so of course I wanted a little more. It was a great trilogy and overall I really enjoyed it. It gets pretty crazy in this 3rd book but it all makes sense in the end. I was told by many not to bother with the 4th book called the Extras because it wasn't as good and it wasn't necessary to read because this was only meant to be a trilogy. So I took that advice. Only downside is that these books are not sold as a trilogy. You have to buy all 3 seperate and that was expensive. I still recommend the read."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"This series just kept getting better. Tally has undergone another round of surgeries to make her Special. But not just any Special, she's Super Special - a Cutter, one of Shay's band of renegades within Special Circumstances.It seems that Tally never really got to choose who she was going to be throughout these books. In this one she finally comes into her own and uncovers a secret the world is hiding from the people of her hometown. Lots of shakeups and excitement in this book, as in the others, but Tally must decide who she wants to be and which side she's really on. The ending is surprising and brilliant.Loved this series and highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"What I like most about this series (this is the last in a trilogy...first book is Uglies) is that while you pretty much knew where the book was going to end, HOW it got to that end was always in question and Specials is no different. Much like Pretties, Tally's voice changes with her physical change, which is creative and interesting (though I have to agree with some reviewers who pointed out that Westerfeld seems to use the same 10 words over and over (in this case, random and icy are used a lot)).The plot of Specials is much like the others in the series. Tally has been changed by the city, an event happens, Tally sets off into the wild, another event happens, Tally ends up back in the City with a few surprises thrown in.Tally is hard to identify with in this book because she is so changed (and SPOILER this is never really resolved). I personally prefer the Tally of Pretties (in the second half) but I understand why her character is the way it is. Shay's evolution continues (and is great) but I was saddened by the way Westerfeld threw Zane's character away, the way he never made Peris an actual character (honestly, the series could have been done without Peris with no ill effects) and the way he left David as one-dimensional and, again, never really resolved the character.The main problem with Specials is a lack of a firm ending. I'm not saying a book needs to wrap up all the story lines, but it seems pretty clear that Westerfeld is keeping his options for more books with Tally, Shay and David open.The Uglies series isn't my favorite YA series, but it's a solid interesting story with a complex world. The world is actually more interesting than some of the characters. If you like YA literature or dystopian books, this is a series to check out."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"Specials is by far the best in the series. I can't wrap my brain around how awesome it is...and that's saying a lot.Tally gets another operation that she doesn't want and ends up a special Special. Dr. Cables group of specials, that is. Along with Shay, Fausto, and other Crims (all of which are now specials and are now called Cutters) they're out hunting Smokies, trying to stop the spread of the cure. At least, that's how it is up until their plan goes awry.This time, Tally really confused me. She has so much going on, so many things conflicting, it was hard to decide if I liked the new Tally or hated her. She didn't have Zane to keep her grounded. She had only the Cutters to rely on. Even though she's a special, deep down, she's always Tally and I couldn't help but like her. Zane, my cool cat, isn't a special. I don't want to say too much, but he still has cognitive problems thanks to taking the wrong cure pill in Pretties. Zane doesn't have much face time in Specials and neither does David for that matter.That's truly the only problem I have with the Uglies series. Her love interests don't have enough time in all the books. I like David, I like Zane. Tally likes David, Tally likes Zane and vice versa. Do you see the problem? Tally has been cut up, manipulated, and she still can't get a decent kiss in with a love interest. Now that, my friends, is just criminal.Once again Tally is tromping through the the wilderness and saving people and trying to 'rewire' herself. The girl can't catch a break no matter what she does. Tally's adventure this time is actually my favourite out of all three books. She has so much to get over and I feel so terribly sorry for her because of it. All throughout the book you can see the change that being a special has done to her as she's trying to cure Zane, find the New Smoke, it's all just breathtaking (and heartbreaking) at what she has to do.There's a lot of stuff blowing up, people jumping off of buildings, causing trouble, and basically just trying to save the world from being brainless Pretties. You definitely won't be disappointed in Specials."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"My few complaints are what kept this book from getting a 5 star review from me1. Tally while not a weak character is confused and fragile and now has a temperand is no longer as relatable2.I dont beleive the book asks as many thought provoking questions as the previous 23.and some things the characters do dont make logical sense to meother than that it is an incredibly good book that deserves to be read and enjoyed by anyone who has read the other 2. but i can not completly fault the author for tallys transformation because that is one of the things that has made this series so spectacular is Tallys personal growth and various operation. and another thing there is no big war or rebellion really like I was expecting but that is one of the things that makes this series unique. also i do not like how the love triangle was resolved but that is personal prefernce.so please read it and enjoy it."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"The series took a bit of a turn with this book because Tally became a Special, and to some degree, wasn't really the same person. It's hard to read a book when the main character is not how you expect them to be or different in some way. I sort of liked where the story went, but I felt the ending didn't work. I was a tad disappointed, but still enjoyed this one."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"My daughter loves this series and the US edition does not have such a cool cover photo."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I suppose the series ended the way it should, but Zane died so I'm annoyed. I knew it would happen, there was such a sense of forboding, but I was still hoping that I would be wrong. Cudos to Westerfeld for writing so well that I didn't even noticed I was getting played :). My hopes for Tally were forever evolving, the only thing I insisted upon was that Tally keep her feelings for Zane and she did. Great book."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"So Tally wakes up changed...again. She has to beat her programming and figure out the truth...again. She needs to track down the Smoke...again. Pretty much the same general plot points as Pretties, but the meat is different. That and \\"bubbly\\" isn't used 300 times. They use \\"icy\\" in this book, but it's not annoying because it happens very little.Tally is now a Special, and her newest assignment is to figure out how the residents of the Smokes are smuggling cure pills to pretties. To help out one of Tally's other friends, Tally and her friend, Shay, perform a trick that ends up endangering everyone in her city. Tally follows a group of pretties and finds that the world outside her city is much more different than she ever could have imagined. While there, Tally is confronted with a series of choices that will help to shape the future of humanity. Tally did have a couple of defining realizations, which made me like her character much more:\\"I'm not sure what I am anymore ... Sometimes I think I'm nothing but what other people have done to me - a big collection of brainwashing, surgeries, and cures ... That, and all the mistakes I've made. All the people I've disappointed.\\"\\"Travelling alone gave Tally a lot of time to think, and she spent most of it wondering if she really was the self-centered monster Shay had described. It didn't seem fair. When had she even had a chance to be selfish? Ever since Dr. Cable had recruited her, other people had made most of Tally's choices for her. Someone was always forcing her to join their side in the conflict between the Smokies and the city. Her only real decisions so far had been staying ugly in the old smoke (which hadn't worked out at all), escaping from New Pretty Town with Zane (ditto), and splitting up with Shay to protect Zane (not great so far). Everything else had happened because of threats, accidents, lesions in her brain, and surgery changing her mind for her. Not exactly her fault.\\"One of the characters dies, and it's sad. The ending is decent, but not mind-blowing. I wasn't in awe of it, but it wasn't as bad as Pretties either. In terms of the series as a whole, I'd say Uglies was the best, followed by Specials, and finally Pretties."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"What I really liked about the series is that the main character is \\"real\\", meaning that Tally is just an ordinary girl who makes mistakes, and faces complicated situations that change her life completely, she comfronts everyone of them step by step. The ending wasn't just a typical happily ever after, but an insteresting one, different. It's really worth reading them all, it might even change the way we think of ourselfs and people. What really matters is how we are from the inside, not the way we look. I highly recomend it."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"This book was the perfect ending to a spectacular trilogy. The plot is so well crafted and there are twists and turns that you would never expect. Scott Westerfeld executes the story perfectly (again).

This is one of those books where you just can't seem to make yourself put it down."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"Great finale, I really loved the ending very unexpected by me. The book can get slow at times (even though there still is a lot of action) but not for very long. I would highly recommend this series and was NOT one bit dissapointed with this book. Another great job by Westerfeld"},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"In the third book of the Uglies series Tally is finally a Special. A fighting machine. She and her best friend, Shay, are still with the group they formed as Pretties - the Cutters. Dr. Cable has given the Cutters permission to capture The New Smoke in anyway they want. Yet even though she wants to destroy it, Tally still has memories of The Smoke and the time she spent there. Does she really want to wipe it all out?I enjoyed this book, though not as much as the first two. It was action-packed with twists and turns but it was missing something. A certain character's death didn't seem that real to me and the characters seemed to have changed more than they should have. David, for example, was a great guy. Sure, Tally wasn't that fond of him at the end of Pretties when she was with Zane but suddenly, he had seduced her? It could be my memory but I'm pretty sure it was nothing like that and the Tally I loved in the first two books never would have thought that. I realize that she changed but that part, along with others, didn't seem right to me. I also wasn't too fond of the ending but that's something I can get over.Besides those parts, I loved that book. It was great to hear more about Tally, Shay, David, and the rest of the characters."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"This was another excellent book in the Uglies series (Uglies, Pretties, Specials, Extras) by Scott Westerfield. It demonstrated good writing skill and an interesting plot line. The main character, Tally, is a dangerous \\"Special,\\" a surgically altered human with extra strength designed to keep control in her city. The only thing that bothered me in this book was how some of the characters cut themselves when they were under a lot of stress, a problem which is fortunately resolved at the end. Otherwise, \\"Specials\\" is a unique and thought-provoking book. This is not a five star book because it's not a book that I would re-read over and over. It was enjoyable, and I read it twice, but somehow it just didn't draw me in as Uglies and Pretties did. The middle of the book slows down and drags a little bit. However, this is still a book worth reading."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"As a high school English teacher, I read many books marketed for teens to decide to have them in my classroom. I found the first book of this series sort of slow moving but once I got into the series, I found it really interesting. It is a dystopian view of the future but told through the eyes of teens who are trying to fight the system. Great book to teach about problems in society like conformity and the idea that everyone has to look perfect. The fourth book, however (which I have not read), isn't about Tally Youngblood as the first three are. I didn't buy it for my classroom since I didn't think that anyone who'd read the first three would want a book not about Tally. But I may still buy it. So far, not many of my students have picked this one up and my 13 year old daughter, who is an avid reader, only got half way through Uglies before giving up."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"My grand-daughter (14 yrs) had quit reading but after the \\"Uglies\\" sat around for months, she picked it up and now she called and said \\"Grandma, do you suppose you could send me some more of these books\\".

Reading is a door to enlightment and because of Scott Westerfeld, she has a worthwhile past-time."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"To be honest reading this series wasn't my first choice. I had originally gone to buy a book published by Scott Westerfeld's wife, Justine Larbalestier. Instead I found the Uglies. At first I wanted to read it because it had a similar plot to an old Twilight Zone episode \\"Make me look like number 17\\" or something along those lines, but then I ended up getting sucked into the series with no hope of leaving till I read the whole triology.What I love most about this series is that you can't choose sides. You are truly able to follow along with Tally Youngblood as she goes through her transformations from an insecure ugly, to a beautiful and ignorant pretty, and finally to a dangerous and slightly psychotic special (All at the age of sixteen!). You get to see all asepects of each life, each with their pros and cons, so it makes it difficult to choose a side and stick with it.The Specials is exciting, heart-renching, and it even inculdes a nice little theme about respecting the environment for us. (Yes fellow rusty, that means you too.) Alhough it may not be the picture perfect ending where the princess gets her prince, freedom, and all her friends in faerie la-la land, it gives a realistic closure that is logical and perfect for this series. No one could have done it better.Good Job Scott Westerfeld. Next time I go looking for your wife's books, I'll keep you in mind."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"This is a great book. After the cliff-hanger ending in Pretties, I couldn't wait for Specials to get out. To say the least, I was not disappointed.I checked this book out of the public library as soon as I possibly could, and within twenty-four hours I had finished it. The next day, I started re-reading it again to better grasp the wonderful plot.The plot is definitely spectacular. I couldn't have thought of something even close myself. It's one of those books that you can't put down until the very end.During maybe the first half of the book, I was very confused with my own feelings since I apparently didn't really want Tally's side to win. But in the middle of the book, Tally and her Special clique the Cutters change sides, and soon I was totally on their side again.I loved the return of David in Tally's life, and how much all the characters deepen and true personalities are revealed.The character development get so much better as the book goes on, but they are still not quite there, at the point where I almost feel as though I know each one of them.Out of 10:I rate the characters a 7.I rate the plot a 9.5.I rate the quality of writing an 8.Admittedly this is not that great of writing, but I just couldn't put it down and I still loved it.I would highly suggest Specials to anyone, particularly those already familiar with the trilogy. It's better to read Uglies and Pretties first.Even though I loved Specials, I still think Uglies was the best. Specials is just a bit better than Pretties, though.Read it! You'll love it!"},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"This book had a very similar plot to \\"Pretties.\\" Tally became something she didn't want to be, tries to fight it, etc, etc. I started to lose steam reading this book and eventually started to just skim pages. (Spoiler) I couldn't even muster any emotion to Zane dying. It seemed like Westerfield just wanted to be done with the love triangle. It also shows how poorly done his characterization was. By the time I started this book, I honestly didn't care what happened to any of the characters.Save your money and buy a book that's actually worth reading."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"Tally has changed since she was caught by Special Circumstances. She has become one of them; a Special. Her body and mind have been altered and she is now an elite fighting machine with super-fast reflexes and a hardened body that can withstand almost anything...but none of this can really make her happy. Tally is surrounded by \\"friends\\" but none of them can take away her memories of her friends from the Smoke and the lessons they taught her. Then her and Shay get a breakthrough and once again whiz off into the wild on their hoverboards searching for the elusive \\"New Smoke\\" where the rebels are said to be hiding. If they can find the New Smoke and bring their boss Dr. Cable to it their lives will be easy at last...or so they think.Although it was great to be once again back in the futuristic world that I have come to know and love that Westerfeld created, \\"Specials\\" lacked a certain charm that was palpable throughout \\"Uglies\\" and \\"Pretties,\\" this books predecessors.In \\"Specials\\" Tally is actually the antagonist as opposed to the protagonist and the flip in positions is a giant leap from the end of \\"Pretties.\\" What disturbed me most about \\"Specials\\" is that I stopped liking Tally. She became sort of a mean person and I was less drawn to her character. I don't really know how to describe it other than that she became less...interesting? I don't know if that's the right word.In any case, the end of the series for me was less than satisfying to say the least. \\"Specials\\" left me disappointed. I felt Westerfeld definitely took the easy way out by ending the series the way he did, and I will probably protest his next book because of it. If you've already read \\"Uglies\\" and \\"Pretties,\\" you will have to read \\"Specials\\" just to satisfy your curiosity, but don't expect much.

One night an innocent trick turned intothe destruction of the military equipment, special hovercars, and the Armory.This caused Tally's boss, Dr. Cable, to blame a far away city for thedestruction, so she led an attack. The cities were not meant to go to war, ever,but after Tally and Shay's trick there was a war raging. Meanwhile, Tally wasnot aware of war, she was focused on getting to the New Smoke; to do this shefollowed her love Zane as he traveled there. At the end of the trip, Tallycaught onto a helicopter and was carried to the New Smoke, which was just a citytransformed! When she arrived, her Special friends were \\"despecialized\\", thecity was under attack, and Zane died from brain damage. After the area wascompletely destroyed, Tally made a quick journey back to her home city to tellDr. Cable that she was the one who destroyed the Armory, only to find Dr. Cablealready knew! Then Tally \\"cured\\" the un-suspecting Dr. Cable from Special-ness.Tally was captured, though, and was about to be \\"despecialized\\" when Dr. Cablecame and helped Tally to escape. This novel was very exciting and futuristic andI would recommend it especially those who enjoyed the first two books in theUglies trilogy.The plot of Specials by Scott Westerfeld was very intriguing and was a main partof the book because there were no new characters. The author kept the oldcharacters, but enhanced their personalities. For example, he kept David,Tally's first love, from the first book, but in this novel David was much moremature, forgiving and passionate about both the New Smoke and Tally. Dr. Cablewas also a character in the first and second books and in this novel she wasmuch more developed as a character, exhibiting both good and bad charactertraits. She was unkind, bossy, and temperamental in the beginning, but then shedeveloped affection and caring for Tally: especially after being cured.Therefore, it was good that no new, distracting characters were added and thatthe old characters such as Fausto, David, and Dr. Cable were more developed.Another reason that I really loved this book was because it was a page turner.It was very hard to put the book down the whole time because of the constantaction and futuristic gadgets. One of the most suspenseful parts of the book waswhen Tally and Shay broke into the Armory because they met an old man whileinside and he was shouting at them for being there. Also during that part in thenovel Tally and Shay narrowly escaped the hungry nanos that were destroying thewhole Armory, which was exciting. Another moment that I was the edge of my seatwas when Tally was lying to Dr. Cable's assistant so she could talk to Cable andconfess about destroying the Armory. When the cured Dr. Cable knocked out thedoctors and broke machinery to free Tally from another operation, it was alsovery exciting.\\"She then shot into the blackness, disappearing instantly, like somethingwinking out of existence.\\" The simile here was just one of the many used in thisbook. The figurative language and details not only helped in making the storymore interesting, but it was sometimes used as a translator for the futuristicterms used in this book. For example, when Tally escaped out of the dying Armoryher jump was described as \\"night silence enveloped her and for a moment shesimply let herself fall.\\" Also just after Tally made it onto the helicopter, shefelt \\"its vibration rumbling through her like crashing waves.\\" Hoverboarding, afuturistic activity, was described as both \\"low and fast\\" or \\"it was whiningfuriously now but she urged it upward...\\" Those helped to understand the storybetter.In conclusion Specials was a very good book that kept me on the edge of my seat.It was very descriptive and the author developed the characters really well. Themain reason for my recommendation was because the novel was suspenseful, but notsuch a detailed plot that it was confusing. In other words, I could infer whatwould happen next or who would change sides. I thought that Zane would die, andI knew that the person who broke Tally out of the operation wasn't Shay. Irecommend this book to people who enjoy science fiction or a great read.-C. Chaudhury"},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"We have followed Tally Youngblood for hundreds of pages by the time she's made into a \\"Special\\" - yet for me, she never seems quite as vivid, believable, or possible to empathize with, as she does for the first 2/3 of \\"Uglies\\". (She also never seems as compelling as Shay - I kind of wish Shay had been the main character.)In \\"Uglies\\", Tally is motivated by loyalty and love first for her friend Peris, and then for the mysterious David. At the heart of both of these motivations is Tally's desire to be part of something, not alone. This underlying motivation (fear of being alone) stays with Tally throughout the series, but it manifests itself in a random, chaotic fashion, such that it's hard to empathize with her or really even like her very much.In \\"Uglies\\", once Tally falls for David, she's happy to forget Peris (which frustrated me). And in \\"Pretties\\", even after her brain is fixed, she's happy to forget David after falling for Zane. It is her love for Zane that motivates her through much of \\"Specials\\"; but this love seems kind of random and distant - as a reader I couldn't really understand what the attraction was, probably because neither Tally's character, nor especially Zane's, were very developed.I think this is because Westerfeld, while an undeniably talented action writer, is not so good at the interpersonal drama. Too often he resorts to \\"telling\\" rather than \\"showing.\\" The relationship between David and Tally in \\"Uglies\\" is largely told rather than shown. The best example is the \\"fight\\" between David and Tally during their journey back to the city. We're told they have a bitter fight and then don't speak for an hour during a storm one day during their trip. This \\"fight\\" is completely out of the blue. Tally and David have absolutely no history of fighting; there aren't any points of tension in their relationship that the reader is aware of. Even more frustrating, Westerfeld doesn't bother telling us, or even hinting at what the fight was about. He merely mentions that they had a fight one day and didn't speak for an hour, but then they made up and everything was fine. This left a sour taste in my mouth, which only intensified in \\"Pretties\\" when suddenly and inexplicably Tally is so madly in love with Zane, completely over David despite the fact that her memory has returned and really it was only a few months ago that she was so crazy about him.Again and again, we are told that Tally is special (even before she becomes a Special). David is constantly saying it to her, the Crims are saying it, and even Dr. Cable. But what's really so special about her? Is her ability to rewire her own brain without the cure also what enables her to move onto new boyfriends and new friends so quickly? Tally's relationships (and even Tally herself much of the time) feel contrived and fake, and the reader feels cheaply manipulated at times.To sum up: I would highly recommend these books to anyone, young adult or real adult, looking for a great, exciting read and a fictional world to escape in for awhile. But I wish Westerfeld put as much effort into developing his characters as he did into the plot."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"Being 31 years old, I am not the target audience for this \\"young adult\\" novel. However, I liked it very much anyway. The author creates a fully developed and internally consistent world, which happens to be one of the most creative futuristic concepts I've encountered. The series' central themes (including identity and self-determination, discrimination, sustainable development, the role of the military, environmentalism, social engineering, biological experimentation, nature vs. nurture, etc.), are all modern concepts relevant to today's world and are raised naturally as a part of the story. In this final book of the series, the central protagonist's view and understanding of her world and its structure and organization is expanded, as she continues to mature and discover who she is and who she wants to become.If this series were intended for adults, I would give it four stars rather than five, as the storyline and character development are not sufficiently intricate to meet my expectations for regular adult fiction. However, it is an absolutely perfect \\"young adult\\" series, and I recommend it to adults as a quick but engrossing read because of the excellent writing and because of the author's exceptional creativity in creating this universe."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"As I was reading the final chapter in the Uglies Trilogy \\"Specials\\", a rather glaringly large flaw in logic kept me from enjoying it.Now let me first say that I am not an environmental alarmist as the author clearly is. I don't really believe that we as a society are headed toward certain doom if we don't adopt wind farms and hybrid cars and stop eating beef. However, if the historical facts that are clearly and repeatedly emphasized in the story are correct, then DR. CABLE WAS RIGHT. Having complete free will inevitably and inexorably leads to the destruction of the planet.Now I know that the author's target audience is teenagers, a group who may be appalled at the idea of curtailing independent thought and freedom of self-expression at *any* cost. But when you put that on the scale against THE END OF THE WORLD, which is the more important issue? Which is the more valuable to preserve? When you really evaluate the lesions vs. the destruction of the planet, which is ultimately worse? The lesions don't even change what fundamentally make you *You*. Tally proved that time and again. They simply remove the worst of the human psyche.So as David and the rest of the New Smokies went about self-righteously shoving enlightenment down everyone's throats, I couldn't help but wonder what this meant for the planet as a whole. But then Westerfield tied himself into knots in order to have his cake and eat it too (i.e. have free will AND a healthy planet) with Tally's Manifesto. Even if the author made Tally into Superman, complete with supersonic flight and impervious body, it wouldn't be enough to hold the line against millions upon millions of newly awakened pretties now demanding more space and more resources and all the things that led to the Rusties ignoble end.Although I did enjoy the plentiful action and drama in the book, I simply couldn't help but laugh at its ridiculous resolution."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I give this book of the series 4 stars, but the series gets 5 stars. This book, takes us from a few months after Pretties, when Tally becomes a Special, well a SPECIAL special, known as a cutter, and they Cut themselves like many people with psychological disorders do to get clarity. They become ICY, just like the pretties want to be Bubbly. Same thing, just worse. I enjoyed this novel, as it shows how far Tally had/has come from the beginning of the series in Uglies, but how much she has refused to change.In this book, the Cutters, find the \\"New Smoke,\\" and it is a city, named Diego, where they have set up a New System, where there are no guides on what the pretties can and can't do to themselves in terms of new surge(surgery to make them have their skin change to beats of music, make their fingers really be a snake and so on). Eventually Tally's city declares a war on Diego, and Tally must stop it, she makes Dr. Cable not be a special anymore due to a new cure that every other of the Cutters is given, except Tally.At the end, this book offers a message of warning and hope, now that the Pretties will stop getting lesions on their brian, to make them docile, and not care about anything. They will actually learn things that were lost before the people of the past destroyed themselves in a war on fuel. This was an exciting book and series, and I am sad to see it end.I eagerly await the next book from Mr. Westerfeld, which is called \\"Last Days\\" which is a quasi-sequel of his sorta-vampire novel \\"peeps.\\""},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I just got to read this, and I was very happy with the ending to the trilogy. Once I picked the book up, I couldn't put it down. I just had to know what happens and whether Tally will become less self-centered, and I was very pleased with how everything turned out."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"Specials left me in a funk. Yes, it's the climax of the series, and it wraps it up logically, leaving room for subsequent tales (such as Extras). But I guess I'm a cranky old romantic, and these books are edgy, realistic speculative fiction (and not even all that edgy, I suppose). I can't give away what made me sad without writing a spoiler, which I don't want to do.Westerfeld continues to demonstrate his fluency in illustrating human mental flexibility. We've known Tally now through several surgically-enhanced incarnations, where her head and her loyalties have been messed with in various ways. Westerfeld doesn't just tell us his theories -- he shows us real people.There are real people who cut themselves, for example -- out here in the real world. It's not something I've done, so I don't know how realistically he depicts it, but he seems to do it well. The first time Tally sees Shay cutting was in Pretties, and it seemed a mysterious and bizarre ritual. In Specials, she does it too, and we get to see what goes on inside a Cutter's head, just as we get to see inside a Special's senses after only observing their exteriors in the earlier books.The books aren't perfect, and by classing them as YA speculative lit I absolve them of facing criticisms one might have of adult literature. That doesn't mean they are inferior works. Westerfeld has given us YA fiction here that is both good and provocative, as well as a bit dark and even unhappy, as much of life often is.Tally's not a princess, but she is a trouper. Mostly I would recommend these books. Just be careful if you are sensitive. You might get attached to a character and then be sad when s/he dies. That's all I'm saying."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"Unfortunately the library had this book available before the second book. :( However, I was able to \\"fill in the holes\\" as the story progressed, though it felt hard to connect with Tally's further metamorphosis from an ugly to a pretty to a Cutter, a *special* Special. Specials are basically the ones who keep order in Tally's city.In this adventure, Shay (the Boss), Tally and other Cutters try to track down the Smokies who have infiltrated their city and passed on their \\"cure.\\" Smokies are those who have runaway and live in the wild, refusing to undergo an operation at the age of 16 to become a pretty. A doctor from the Smoky society invented a pill to cure lesions found to cause the obedience and air-headedness of new pretties.So Tally and Shay hunt down another group of runaways from their city, which includes Tally's (ex?) boyfriend Zane who was affected for the worse trying this new cure. Tally finds out where the New Smoky is - it seems somewhat out of the blue - and figuring for herself what it means to be \\"Tally\\" and a Cutter. Apparently cutting themselves (or burning) brings clarity and makes them \\"icy.\\" (Sometimes the slang in these books is quite annoying...) This leads to a rather quick and action-packed climax.The end of the book does leave possible books for other books set in this universe, which Westerfeld has indeed done, though Tally is not the main character.At times this book felt too rushed, especially at the end."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"Why to folks feel they have to retell the stories in these reviews?No matter.I read all three books, rather lengthy for YA books, in three weeks. I read the last in one day. They are magnificent page turners.The hero, Tally Youngblood, is character that will stay with me.It is science fiction but bares little resemblance to the space operas of Heinlein and less to the end-of-the-world stories of my youth (I am 55).Tally and her friends have developed characters. At sometimes it seems not but over 1,000 pages even minor characters evolve in unexpected ways.I was very sorry when the books came to an end and will be looking for more of Westerfeld's books in the future.Note that some of the tags for these books include vampire & vampire romance. There are no vampires in these books."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I loved the Uglies Trilogy and the book Specials was no exception. However, I had a certain expectation of how the book was going to end and the book didn't fulfill my hope; the ending left me slightly disturbed and unfulfilled. Looking back I can see that the author was leading in this direction all along, so I suppose the ending is logical. The description of people who keep cutting themselves is also disturbing--I hope it is not giving people ideas who otherwise wouldn't have thought of it."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I really loved this book!

The thrill! The rush! I just can't get enough of this book. What a mind boggling experience."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"And now Tally is not only Pretty but Special, a super-human commando whose body and brain have been surgically altered to make her the perfect weapon against her old friends. Can Tally rewire her own brain to save herself, her friends, and the world?Well, maybe not the whole world, but their corner of it, anyway.Like in Pretties, Tally is confused about the past and uncertain about the present. But unlike Pretties, she doesn't know she's confused about the past and it isn't until she sees Zane and David again that she really starts to question her new role in Special Circumstances.Specials barrels forward at the same pace as previous two books, helped along by Tally's confusion and frustration and Special enhancements. She is forced to choose, over and over again, between Zane and Shay, or between David and Zane, or between the new Specials or her old friends. Much of the book takes place with Tally alone, or nearly alone, so some of the introspection and internal struggle that was in Uglies but missing from Pretties returns.Overall, it's a great trilogy; action-packed stories with characters that it is easy to care about (if not Tally, then Shay, David, Maddy, Zane) and fun to read about. Beyond that, there are powerful messages skillfully mixed into the action. You may get different messages, but here's what I got: Looks don't matter as much as you think. Protect the environment. Cherish your friends. Body autonomy and free thought are vital."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I am still in the middle of Special but I have had the same though about this series for a long time.It is a fantastic plot and when I imagine the story in my head Tally seems to live in a interesting world.The books take me FOREVER to finish.I love reading and I can read fast but this series just has somthing in it to keep me from finishing it."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"This is my favorite out of the whole series.

I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading a good story."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"This is a pretty standard trilogy of a Young adult novel - young girl in a not-so-near post-apocalyptic future, thrust into the middle of a struggle between \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\", in love with boy A in first novel, in love with boy B in second, and choosing between the two in the third. That said, I still couldn't put any of the books down until I was done with them. A nice variation on our possible future and a pretty original \\"end of the world\\" scenario. I enjoyed all three books and recommend them if you liked the Hunger Games."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"This review contains spoilers. I found the first two books in this series totally engrossing and couldn't put them down. But Specials, not so much. Tally is made a \\"Special\\" and becomes what she's fought against in the first two books. And she enjoys it. Physically, Tally sounds like some kind of monster cyborg and I kept hoping she'd finally get an operation to change her back to maybe an ugly, or at least something less horrifying than a Special because I couldn't relate to her as a villain. The author teases the reader about this twice in the book, taking Tally to the point where she almost is \\"de-specialized\\" but then \\"rescued\\" at the last minute. This was really annoying.The book is overly long and could have used some editing. I didn't buy the part where Tally \\"cures\\" herself again as she did when she was a pretty. She certainly retains her arrogance by the way the book ends. I decided to skip the next book, Extras."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"This book is definitly the best book i have read in a very long time. Throughout the whole story i was on the edge of my seat worring for the characters, wondering what was going to happen next. Right when i thought i figured something out i got hit with something totaly unthought of and creative. I would recomend this book to anyone who likes an amazing book and to thoes who dont, you should still read it. By the end of the story you will feel so connected to all the characters that you will be sad it is over."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I'm sure we've all had a time when reading a book when we simply yell out in rage, or laugh in glee, or cheer with triumph. And many of these emotions are foucused around, surprisingly, the antagonists of the book. I myself love antagonists. They add more to the story, and if they have a POV, let you into the other perspective, rather than just viewing the story from a slightly biased point of view. Yet sometimes in a series, even the best, most central protagonists become antagonists. This was one of those series.When we last left off with PRETTIES, the reader is clued into the fact that Tally Youngblood has become a Special. SPECIALS opens with a mission that Tally is on with the other Cutters (a group of young, slightly rebellious Specials specially engineered by Dr. Cable) to intercept a lesion-curing pill giveaway at a party. However, the mission goes bad, with David ultimately thwarting Tally and Shay and stealing away with their high-tech hoverboards. Furious, both Tally and Shay have a new mission. Tally's is to convince Dr. Cable to make Zane (who Tally now views as weak) into a Cutter, and Shay's is to discover the New Smoke and become the most powerful Cutter ever. Yet both are unprepared for what they find- a New Smoke bigger than they had ever imagined and a rebellion that has gone too far to be stopped.When reading this book, you have to ask yourself: how do you respond when the protagonist goes bad? Everyone can deal with that in their own way, but personally, I was just filled with disgust. I no longer respected Tally like I used to, and found it hard to empathise with her like I used to. Tally has gotten a special surgery, and now has razor-sharp teeth, fingernails that closely resemble claws, lightning fast speed, and virtually unbreakable bones. Yet the way the author described Tally's new body filled me with disgust and repulsion, not awe. I'm not sure if this was intentional, but even though Tally is still the central character in the series, I no longer thought of her as the \\"good guy\\". It simply wasn't possible. And yet. I found it intruiging to view the story through the antagonist's point of view, and even though it didn't change my opinion about Tally or what she was doing, it was interesting. I found it hard to believe that Tally was just another woman madly in love and willing to do anything, and for that reason some of what Scott Westerfield said didn't agree with me. I found myself wishing that Tally could beat whatever made her Special just like she overcame the lesions, but I suppose that that would've been too outrageous for even Scott Westerfield to handle.At the end of this story, the techinal end of a trilogy (even though there IS a fourth book- EXTRAS), I found myself wanting more, even if this was my least favorite book. I wanted to know what would happen to Tally and the gang. I wanted to find out if the New Smoke would succeed. I wanted more of Tally and David's intuitive idea at the very end of the book. I wanted more.Overall (16/25):Plot: 5/5- I feel like Scott Westerfield took this plot in a whole new direction than before, and I liked that.Characters: 1/5- I just didn't connect and understand Tally as well as I used to, and I think that Scott Westerfield could've done a bit better with making Tally's character seem antagonistic, but still likeable.Setting: 5/5- Tally's world was getting a bit old for me, and I liked the setting move to Diego. The fact that the New Smoke was central there got me.Romance: 1/5- Tally's romance with Zane didn't seem believable anymore, and her pain over his death didn't seem quite real either. However, her rekindling with David gave me hope.Teenage Factor (because I am one): 4/5- Teens could easily get bored with these, even if they loved the other books in the series. However, I wouldn't suggest putting SPECIALS down; the ending is magnificent."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"As the title says, this is my favorite of the Uglies series by far. To see Tally's mental transformation throughout the books have been well executed and convincing. Also, it was a nice change to move outside of the city, and into other locations in the country.I think Specials does a great job of working the Tally-Zane relationship and the conflict that Tally faces with it (plus the end-portion of the book will break your heart). I thought the ending was pretty decent--satisfying, but not overly so, to make sure we keep coming back to re-read."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"If you've read this far into the series, then I think you can figure out what's happened to Tally Youngblood. For those of you that haven't, but are still reading this, I'll keep the spoilers to a minimum in the first couple of paragraphs. At the end of Pretties, Tally's former friend Shay had a new trick up her sleeve: she'd turned into a Special, one of Dr. Cables surgically-altered attack dogs trained specifically for optimal performance outside city walls. Specials monitor activity outside of New Pretty Town, making sure no one dares to challenge the authority of the government. If they do, there's a unique future ahead of them. It involves razor sharp teeth, nails, and senses fine-tuned for ultra-clarity. Specials are made to be tough and indestructible. Their bones are replaced with high-grade materials designed for light weight and fast movement; their tendons and muscles are similar. With bodies full of swarming nanos ready to repair any damage, Specials are as much construct as they are human. These cyborgs are kept as a threat to their fellow citizens who fear their power as much as they fear wolfish eyes and cruelly-angled faces. Specials were designed to be feared.With the exaggerated features and artificial enhancements, Specials have an elevated sense of themselves. Their egos are blown out of proportion and they're quick to anger. Shay's group of Specials are culled from the Pretty clique known as the Cutters. Despite their physical advantages, they feel the need to cut themselves, achieving the same bubbly clarity from pain that Pretties got from a rush of adrenaline. Specials, though, need to be extra bubbly: they need to be icy. With their overconfidence and new slang, the Cutters go around finding Uglies and Pretties trying to make their way out to the New Smoke. Among these runaways are the ringleaders--David, Tally's former boyfriend, Maddy, his mother and mass producer of the Pretty cure, the other old Smokies, and a new recruit, Andrew Simpson Smith, one time experiment and full-time freedom fighter.But Tally finds herself in a precarious situation. Zane was recaptured and is still a bubblehead (the Cutter term for Pretties). As a new Special, Tally struggles with the tell-tale signs of his illness: the shaky hands and wobbly gait he's been left with after taking the wrong pill scream imperfection to Tally's heightened senses and need for perfection. Once again, Tally has to learn how to rewire herself just in time to save the day from her own screw-ups. Only this time, she finally comes to terms with the selfish behavior and excuses she's been tossing around for the past couple of books. Owning up to her mistakes isn't easy, but I think it made the end of the book more worthwhile.It was pretty difficult reading Specials. Tally makes a lot of bad choices and is so unlike what we've seen so far of her that it was a surprise when she didn't just snap out of it in the first few chapters, like in Pretties. Shay wasn't that much different although, with her temper and mercurial disposition, she was always a loose canon. As a Special, her friendship with Tally has turned into one big ugly abusive sneer-fest. She's quite mean and bullies Tally regularly, not that Tally is any better. But reading from the perspective of one bitter, hypocritical, and vengeful Special interacting with another (especially ones who engage in the queasy act of self-mutilation) wasn't easy. They're insulting and derogatory of \\"randoms\\"--non-Specials; on top of a massive sense of entitlement, Tally, Shay, and the other Specials don't come off as very attractive characters.There are concessions to this. When Tally finds herself in Diego, she's confronted by a middle pretty who mistakes her Special tattoos and sharp body parts for a fashion trend, a fad, something entirely non-threatening. This puts Tally off-balance, but was so hilarious I wanted more. It was about time she got pulled down a notch or two and finding not just one person, but an entire city of people who didn't care who, or what she was, or much less knew they should be very afraid of her, disarmed Tally to the point of feeling like the very type of aberration she'd begun to loathe: a random. It was even a relief when she was locked up in a padded cell, unable to use her fancy new enhancements to force her way out of the situation. I didn't particularly sympathize with her in this series, but in Specials least of all. Although she does exhibit some redeeming qualities by the end of the book, I was disappointed she got to keep everything--all of the enhancements and the good looks--on top of befriending David again. I suppose her punishment was watching what happened to Zane along with whatever mind-altering realizations she came to, and it's probably cruel of me to think so, but I think I wanted a little more out of her than that.I am, however, pretty entertained with the last chapter. Overall, it wrapped up the series nicely; all Tally seems to be missing is a ranger hat and some brown fur to go with her new Smokey the Bear persona. After all, with everything that's happened, it's too easy to get caught up in the personal drama of Tally and her friends without remembering the wider implications of their situation. New Pretty Town and other cities like it destroyed themselves with wasteful habits and practices. They relied too much on technology that kept them in a vicious cycle of destruction and dependence--one that nature couldn't continue to replicate for them forever. When we discover that it's really an oil-eating bacteria that ultimately brought about the downfall of 21st Century Rusty culture, I couldn't help but wondering: why does it always have to be about oil and the environment? Obviously, authors of dystopian novels seem to pick up on the same niggling fears and reality, but it's interesting to see the very different futuristic fictions they come up with for what are ultimately, the same factors of destruction.It wasn't until Specials that Westerfeld finally gives the reader clues about the rough location of Tally's city. With mentions of Death Valley, Diego, and what I can only assume are the Rocky Mountains, Tally's New Pretty Town must be close enough to California for the Diego mentioned to be, maybe, a future San Diego. I don't think the location really matters, but it's nice to finally be rooted and have some kind of map in my mind to navigate the whereabouts of Tally and her friends. It gives a little more perspective to the environment and context for culture.One last thing I really enjoyed was watching Tally and Shay having to resort to the \\"old ways of the forest\\" (p. 98) when Special tracking methods weren't going to work out in the wild. With all of the technology available to them, and everything that's supposedly made society better than the old Rusty culture, it was entertaining to watch them sober-up their techie highs and tone it down to do things the old-fashioned way. It was also touching to know that Andrew Simpson Smith and the other villagers had something important to pass on to the much more advanced and better off Pretties and Uglies. It begs the question: just how much of an advantage does technology really give us? Or, does it, like the book and series implies, create an easy way out for habits that don't ever get fixed, but simply replaced with others? Human nature doesn't seem to change--Tally and Shay's evolutionary status doesn't remove them from the ultimately war-like tendencies brewing under the surface. But it's very uplifting to know that humanity can change, if only they put their minds to it.Specials is filled with non-stop action. It's the perfect way to show off Tally's new skills, culminating in an inter-city war that literally jars the foundations of everything she's come to understand. Westerfeld's writing is, like always, very accessible to readers, even when there's a lot of explosions and hoverboard action. It's ironic in an intelligent way and now that I've finished up the third book, don't feel as shocked as I was with the overwhelming accusations of Uglies. I think Westerfeld has a talent for exploring the concerns of SF. I'm glad he's writing books that I think anyone can pick up and enjoy.Thanks to Kathryn at Simon and Schuster UK for the review copy!"},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"The book came in the time promised and looked like it was brand new.

I couldnt put the book down because there were so many twists in the plot i had to see what happened next. What makes this book so brilliant is that it shows you how our future could be if we become to obssesed with looks. I definetly reccomened it to teens looking for a series full of action, rommance, and rebellion."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"Very good, the best of the series was the Uglies and the Pretties, this one and the next The Extras are good, but sort of drag a bit."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"So this is book 3 in the Uglies trilogy, and while I won't be spoiling the book (I assume people are looking for reviews to learn if they'd like a product before they get it), I will be assuming you've read the first two books in the series. You should NOT read this series out of order and you should be able to judge for yourself if you like Westerfeld's writing enough to proceed with a third book. For me, it was a simple answer- His writing is a style I enjoy.I was heartbroken at the end of Pretties when Shay and Tally reintroduced the dynamic of \\"enemies\\" to their complex relationship. This flavour permeates the novel, as the girls continue to seek their own kind of redemption both with one another and with themselves. I was glad to see a shift back to them after Pretties put the focus on Zane and Tally, though that was both understandable and necessary for the story it told. I agree with an earlier reviewer that this Tally was harder for me to relate to, but I think that was intentional. The story is full of the richness of the first two books and takes elements from them to weave a complex and fully-realized story. I'm not satisfied with how it was explained that Tally could rewire her thinking from Prettytown, but Shay was doggedly determined to stay a bubblehead after spending all that time out in the wild with them. I suspect I'm supposed to overlook that detail for the greater good of the story, but Shay is an awesome character, and part of me protests again and again that if -Tally- could do it, surely Shay could overcome the programming, especially in that environment.As the final piece of the trilogy, Specials does a very good job of fully realizing the story that began with Uglies, but I still find myself wondering what was missing from the other two. Uglies is my clear favourite of the three, but I simply can't define why that is. Maybe I'll find it when I read through the series a second time. I really like Zane, so it wasn't a personal \\"David vs. Zane\\" conflict. It's possible that I liked how ordinary Tally and Shay were to begin with and the progression left them both very not-ordinary. It's still a great read, and I would still recommend that anyone who enjoyed Uglies should read the rest of the books!Here are some standardized book questions I'll be asking myself for reviewing purposes:Was it worth my time AND money?As with all of Westerfeld's books, it was very much worth my time and money.Will it be seeing a trip to the local used bookstore as a trade-in?Nope!Was there ever a point where I groaned because I just knew X-event had to happen?Yeah, at least one major plot point seemed very obvious- but it was clever regardless.Was there anything truly incredible or surprising about this story?Yes, there were themes of redemption throughout, and we meet up with some surprising people.Did the characters ever act in a way that felt forced or inconsistent with the rules of the universe as the author has presented them? (Or, did the author in any way hijack the characters and sacrifice their realism for the sake of a plot point?)Yes, but only what I mentioned above about Shay at the end of Uglies. Specials itself seemed consistent with characterization.Is it a guilty pleasure?Nope, I've talked about reading these with several people.Two word summary:Heartbreaking, satisfying (yeah, how's that for a contradiction?)"},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"Tally wakes out of Pretties and is now a Special. But more than that, she is a Cutter, a special Special. Her senses are icy sharp, and she is basically a human weapon with every part of her body designed to kill. Shay and Tally compromise that if they get Dr. Cable to make Zane a Special-head like themselves, Tally will stop worrying so much (annoying Shay) and be carefree like the rest of the clan. And so the book goes on into a story of stunts and stalkings to fulfill the promise.Shay was a very unlikable character and soon after Tally was too. She would not even look Zane, the boyfriend that she apparently loves, in the eye because he shakes a little bit, which was ultimately her own fault at most. And then after all but getting everything straight with him, she turns her sneak suit into spikes and cuts him just because she is so disgusted with him.Shay just needed to calm down sometimes.On the other hand, although the characters had some bad traits, I still loved the book. Because to me, whether I love the main characters or not does not decide for me if it was a good book. Why do authors write books? So that they can easily create preferable charcaters? I think not. I know that I am in love with a series if I badly want to live in its world.And yes, the ending was very sad, but it was also quite unpredictable. Stories don't usually come with a perfect ending."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"(daughter of user)SPOILERS MAY FOLLOWThe Uglies series was introduced to me by one of my best friends, and I'm glad it was. I thoroughly enjoyed both Uglies and Pretties. Tally was a character that the reader could identify with, a character, who like many of us, strives to be perfect/\\"pretty\\". In the last book, Specials, it became difficult for me to continue to identify with her. She had become too inhuman. My personal favorite character, Zane, was not given the ending he deserved. He tried to become what Tally wanted him to be, and in the process, didn't survive. I will admit that this upset me a great deal, as well as the whole section of the book where Tally is repulsed by him, and he tries desperately to get her to understand that she doesn't have to be a Special, that she could be herself. When she pushed him away, my heart broke for him. I was just extremely disappointed with the treatment of his character.

She's a Special, the elite police force of the city, imbued with super strength and speed, unbreakable and unbeatable. Perfect.Yet Tally can't forget Zane, her boyfriend from her pre-special days, tragically damaged in his attempt to reverse the mind-dulling effects of becoming \\"Pretty\\"--damage Tally still blames herself for.Now Tally is once again torn between allegiance to her best friend and fellow Special Shay, and feelings of love and responsibility for Zane.This was probably my favorite (so far, anyway, since I haven't yet read \\"Extras\\") of the \\"Uglies\\" series. In the previous two books, I had a lot of trouble \\"bonding\\" with Tally and relating to the decisions she made.

I actually felt the confusion of Tally when she tries to figure out what's real and what the surgery is making her feel. The only con is the romance part of the book. I felt like there wasn't enough of a relationship established between Tally and Zane in the previous book and he's just missing in this one.

You find out that the Uglies Trilogy takes place about three-hundred years in the future. Tally Youngblood has become Special and is part of a clique called the Cutters that Shay founded. The Cutters are trying to find the New Smoke because the people from the New Smoke have been giving pills (the ones Tally and Zane ate in Pretties) to the pretties to stop the lesions in their brains. While chasing a girl who was giving out pills at a party Tally confronts an old friend who she now disgusts. When Tally goes to see her boyfriend Zane she is shocked about his appearance but she feels more superior to him. Then she starts to wonder if the reason is because of the surgery to become a Special and a superhuman. Tally wants Zane to become a special so they can be with each other but Zane wants to go to the New Smoke so he can get cured by Maddy (David's mom). Tally and Shay decide to follow the Crims ,secretly, to the New Smoke. While following the Crims Tally decides to separate from Shay and meets a few people who she met in Pretties. Finally Tally finds the New Smoke but everything does not go as expected. I had trouble getting through the beginning of the book but towards the end of the middle and end of the book I got more interested. In my opinion the ending is terrible because it is a cliffhanger that just ends. I like how Uglies and Pretties end when you read the last word and the same goes for Specials. Like Mockingjay I would only recommend the book so you know what happens at the end. In fact the two books are a lot alike so if you liked Mockingjay I would recommend this book to you but you should read the first two books in the series first so you know what is going on. I think my favorite book in this series is the first book, Uglies. There is a companion novel titled Extras but I do not think I will read it. It is written from someone else's point of view about how life is after what happens in Specials. So try reading the Uglies Trilogy and let me know if you like it or not. (That includes Extras.)"},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"This book was okay. The first one, Uglies was much better. I wasn't a big fan of Specials though. You should read Uglies though, great book."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I liked this book. This book was very exciting I coulding put it down. I was always wondering what was going to happen next."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"Tally Youngblood is now set on her most exhilarating adventure yet, because she has now been changed into an unbelievably beautiful special. Her nails and teeth filed down to sharp points and her bones are now made to be indestructible. She is build to kill anything that comes in her way of her plans. Now, Tally is ordered to find the new smoke, a camp for run away pretties. If she finds it, she is ordered to end it. The question now is will she find it, and if the opportunity arrives, will she listen to her past or destroy the smoke forever.The Specials deeply connects to me because of how many common themes there are that relate to any other normal teenage girl's life. It deals with the desire to belong, acceptance, and the measures people take to fit in. Tally only wants to belong to a group of people who will accept her for who she is, which is a similar trait I see in my everyday life. This book, without even realizing it relates to my daily life, which is why I think it appeals to me so much.One book that might also appeal to you if you enjoyed the specials, would be the Hunger Games. It deals with action, romance, and the government misusing its power just like in the Specials. If you enjoyed the suspenseful action sequences and the fight for survival in the Hunger games, you may also enjoy the Specials' invigorating liveliness of the intense chases and the following out of dangerous missions. They both will force you to fly through the pages because of the intensity and romance that is woven among them.Reading the Specials was defiantly one of the better decisions I've made in my life. It definitely has sparked my imagination, and given me a whole different perspective of clicks and the desire to belong. The only thing I didn't like about it was that it was told a bit too fast for my liking. Besides that, I loved the whole concept of the book, and plot was amazing, full of twists and unexpected turns. It's definetly a book that I would highly recommend for any teenage girl."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"The book arrived as described within the time frame identified. No complaints! It is a great read. Wish I would have bought the whole series at once though."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"Specials is the last book in the \\"Uglies\\" series with Tally as the main character. In the beginning of this book, 300 years in the future, Tally wakes up from a surgery that made her into a \\"special\\" person. She was one of the few chosen by the government of the city to treat special circumstances. She now has new features, an advantage for being in the Cutters group, like razor-sharp fingernails and the quickest reflexes. Once Tally is out of the hospital with her new surge, the other Cutters in her group welcome her to fighting special circumstances and troubles in the world. Tally's mind has been rewired to betray her former friends, the Smokies, but she still manages to maintain traits from her normal personality. Tally's friend from the previous book, Zane, has brain damage thanks to Tally. She wants to find him and turn him into a Special so that they can finally be together again. Things usually don't turn out as planned, though. After longs days of journeying to find Zane, Tally finds him. Due to Tally's transformation with brain chips transplanted to direct her, and the lesions in her brain, she is incapable of seeing him as a normal person. He is very weak from brain damage, and even though Tally knows that she desires to be with him, her mind is programmed to see his imperfections. It's like she's more superior than Zane, and it's hard to imagine being wih him again.Later, Tally returns to Shay and the rest of the Cutters. Shay and Tally go on many adventures and a particular one leads the Special circumstances team to the Smokies. Smokies live in a place called the New Smoke where they are separated from the lesions from surgery that don't let people think for themselves. It's not right for Special circumstances to capture the Smokies and destroy their new city. Even Tally knows that this is not right. She's slowly thinking herself out of the brain damage done to her, so she finally can have her own opinions. Tally soon finds David again, her love from the first book, and she has to fight the cruel Dr. Cable, who is the head of Special circumstances. During the war of the two cities, Zane can't take the brain damage any longer and dies. Tally is furious and decides that she needs to do what is right for the growing new humanity. Soon, Tally outsmarts Dr. Cable, as usual, and the New Smoke moves on to replace Special Circumstances and create a new government. Tally, Shay, and the rest of the Cutters are the new Special Circumstances for the New Smoke. Finally, everything is back to normal.

Now she is specially enhanced to help keep the people of her city in line--the pretties stupid and the uglies ready for their operations.Once again we have the all too long passage of isolation where Tally is forced to reconsider her life while out in nature alone. I get that it is a theme, that being out in nature changes you. At the same time, it gets slow and tedious and a bit repetitive. (I say that despite enjoying the book.)It is hard to get in touch with Tally and the other main characters because their personality change from one moment to the next. Tally is the sort of character who tends to get forced into situations and only takes action as a last resort. As a result, she is not my favorite character (of the many books I have read), but the fight itself--the bigger struggle against the city and the operations--is still interesting.[SPOILER:] I am not sure how I felt about the resolution of the love triangle, it felt like an easy out. Tally never truly had to choose and technically she got them both in the end yet there was never the sense that her feelings for David ever resurfaced exactly. It is powerful to see her reaction to Zane once she finally sees him. It really highlights the ideas of being obsessed with beauty, being controlled by the government and brainwashing in a way that nothing else could.Though not my favorite dystopian series, Westerfeld has a way with words that makes even the slower sequences enough to keep you turn pages."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"Fast read, sad there is only one more book. I hope it ties everything up and doesn't leave me wanting for more!"},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"Specials is the third (but not final) book of the Uglies Trilogy. If you haven't read the first two books, I'd steer clear of this review (could contain spoilers) and start off with the first book, Uglies. For the series to make sense, they have to be read in order.Tally has been quite a few things in her life already; ugly, rebel, pretty, and now she's become a special. An elite group, Tally is even better than that, she's a special special. She and a few others are a team that can practically do anything all in the name of maintaining order. With New Smoke growing larger every day and causing trouble, maintaining order isn't as easy as it used to be though. They've developed a cure for the brainlessness that affects all the pretties and as its dispersed, more control is being lost in the city. Tally, with her icy emotions running through her veins is beginning to be affected by some of these rebels though, and she doesn't know what side is the right one to be on.Tally is a bit wearisome in this book. It seems like things are always happening that are her fault, but she can never control and the theme is growing old. Just once I would have liked to see something go her way without it being chance. For being a hero, she rarely actually makes an impact intentionally. All the other characters are somewhat shadows of themselves as well. Poor Shay, as said in other reviews, I can't help but feel sorry for her character, she never seems to win at life. The rest of the characters were somewhat minor and not described as much as they are in previous books.This book saw the themes a little more mature than the previous two. Self mutilation in the form of cutting is mentioned several times and I can see some people having trouble reading those parts. Otherwise, this is still a book for young adults and there isn't strong language. But there is a lot of anger. The best thing about Westerfeld's writing is that linguistically, he is very creative. He makes a different speech for all these types of people and I find it fascinating. While this book wasn't as good as the first one, it still was a pretty good ending to the series.I enjoyed the series and may have to check out the spinoff Extras. Seems like if it keeps the pace of these books it should be pretty good.SpecialsCopyright 2006372 pagesReview by M.

The main character tally seems to change her state of mind in every book. Yet there is always the same conflict. Special circumstances.But in this book tally is a special. She isn't just any special she and her friends are called the cutters... the special specials. In this book tally is working against the cure. Yet in the last book she was working with the cure. But anyways she is working to stop the cure. She is trying to stop the new smoke from spreading. But it is gaining thousands by the minute! Can she stop them?This is a great book! I was immediately drawn into tally's world fighting alongside her, sneaking through the forest. Westerfeld does an amazing job. If you like pretties and uglies you will love the specials! I recommend it to anyone who loves action, suspense, drama, and sometimes a little romance!"},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I felt that the third book in the Uglies series was right on par with the others. Once again, I was sucked into Tally's world and went on a whirlwind ride with her. There are some great surprises, even one that I didn't see coming (though I totally should have). I'm not really sure what I thought about the ending, though. It wasn't really the ending I wanted or expected. What was really strange, is that Tally's reasoning for this ending was based on environmentalism... I was kind of like, huh? Since when is environmentalism one of her priorities? That was kind of strange. It also kind of annoyed me that the Tally was ugly in the first book, pretty in the second, and a special in this. I had seen it coming because of the titles, but still bugged me. I also had wished Tally had held onto more of herself when she turned special, since she was so terrified of them throughout the other books. I also didn't like seeing Tally acting like a true, uncaring Special as much as she did. Perhaps that was just because it seemed repetitive after her similar experience being pretty. However, these were just small pet peeves that really didn't detract from the enjoyment of the book. And, these complaints are in retrospect after giving the book some thought - I never really felt any of this while I was reading. Don't let my complaints get you down. This is still a great book that I loved!"},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"Hard to put down,yes, but the action got so intense, and emotions so high, I had to walk away for my own health. This is the sign of an excellent writer when he can move his readers from left to right so easily. But I was unhappy with the ending, plus Tally wasn't as likable as in the other two books. Shay, whom I was never really fond of, was true to form and David was always in the background. I suppose it had to end the way it did because of him. Tally never lost that hard edge from beginning to end. It was hard to believe she was only sixteen even though her mentality was a bit immature. In the first two books, I loved that the kids fought for free thinking. In Specials there was a marked change in that theme favoring entitlement and dependence. It seemed to carry an almost political message that troubled me. Still and all, if you've read the other two book, this one is a must read."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"The Uglies trilogy is amazing on so many levels that it blows my mind. If you haven't read the first two books yet, make sure you read Uglies first, then Pretties, then Specials. Lastly, Westerfeld wrote Extras which is a sort of extension of the trilogy. But it won't make much sense if you don't read it all in order.Anyway, the writing is very good, very engaging and there is something to appeal to most people within the story. Love plots, friendships gained and lost, betrayal. It speaks of the fickleness of teenage romance and friendship, and of society. It has all of the disutopian ideas and fears that any great novel of this genre should have, yet never too over your head - anyone aught to be able to understand what is going on or at least figure it out easily enough while reading.For parents buying for their children, it's really mostly suited to girls just due to the main character being a girl, and spending a lot of time thinking and talking about girl things, but it's not racy so don't worry about that. A very smart read and yet also falls into the category of a light read or book candy. I devoured the series way too quickly."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I just finished reading this book and it was amazing!

This is the 3rd installment of the Uglies series. She is part of a ultra police unit, that she joined unwillingly. My favorite part of the book was when Tally's flying low on her hover board with night/aura vision to seek out her former friends. Tally and her new friends are a super group of special cops that are called The Cutters. They are ambushed and unexpectantly get over powered. Two of her friends are captured and three of the special police's hover boards are taken. I recommend this book because you can relate to Tally. She's just a teenager like a lot of people. This is an awesome science fiction book because there are drones, hover boards, and hover cars."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I thought Specials was the best so far. SO much action and emotion. Quite beautifully written. Good job mr. westerfield"},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"Specials, by Scott Wetserfeld, is a gripping book. The main character in the story is a girl named Tally Youngblood who started off as a normal ugly and was turned into a member of the Cutters. Her first mission as a \\"Special Special\\" was to find the cure, to being a bubblehead, and stop the production. She searches for the cure and finds both the producer and the distributor. Her old boyfriend was helping give out the cure, and he had changed by becoming \\"imperfect\\". The producers were none other than the survivors of Smoke. She had unclear thoughts about her boyfriend and decided to do all that she could to make him a special like her. Tally ends up doing everything she could to help cure his \\"imperfections\\", but in the process she causes a war. Soon, she is facing the truth that everything was because of her and she had to fix all the problems. She goes back meeting new people and recognizing old friends from her past.I really enjoyed this book because of the plans and the changes that took place in Tally's world because what she did in the past. I also liked the irony in how everything was her doing even if she didn't want for it to happen. My favorite section was about how she wants to turn Zane into a special even though that was the opposite of what he really wants. The different worlds reminded me of the different ethnic groups and cliques in our world and how we clash amongst each other too.I highly recommend this book and the other two books in the trilogy to all teenage girls."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"Having just finished the third book in the series, \\"Specials\\" I would have to say that in a word I am disappointed.Book 1 is a great read with fascinating twists, characters and something that the reader can really relate to. Sadly, this is the high point. While present in the first book, book 2 brings the green agenda ever further into the story, taking very pointed jabs at today and in doing so continually alienates the reader, and almost loses sight of the plot entirely at points. Book 3 ends with Tally continuing to remain the \\"center of the universe\\" by proclaiming herself guardian of the wilds. A sort of self styled Poison Ivy if you will. Telling the people that if they attempt to expands outside of their cities that she will know and that there may very well be a consequence or retaliation from the \\"Wild\\"Was very disappointed to see such a great series with such promise come crashing down around its own ears."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"This series is pretty famous in YA. I thought it was worth a read, but it's not. Tally changes personality from one book to the next. There's so many random things that don't connect and the pretty-speak drives me crazy. Not worth it."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"In a futuristic world built on the ruins of our own where extreme cosmetic surgery makes everyone beautiful, some people stand out for other reasons.Tally Youngblood has always been special. She uncovered, betrayed, and ultimately aligned herself with a resistance group known as The Smoke while she was an Ugly. Her Pretty clique, The Crims, changed life in New Pretty Town forever and sparked the beginnings of revolution.But Tally doesn't care about any of that anymore. Because she's a Special, part of the elite group of enforcers known as Special Circumstances. Enhanced to be a deadly predator, Tally doesn't want to hurt you. But she will if she has to in Specials (2006) by Scott Westerfeld.Tally didn't plan on becoming Special, let alone joining Special Circumstances after being exploited by the group for so long (two whole books!). But when her best friend, Shay, and the Cutters become Specials, Tally once again finds herself at the mercy of other people's plans.When one of Tally and Shay's botched schemes leads to the first all out war since ancient times, Tally and the Cutters will have to race against the clock to prevent the inevitable. As Tally struggles to save her world from the ravages of war, will she be able to save herself?I really love all of Scott Westerfeld's books. Because he's awesome. That said, the Uglies trilogy (not including its companion book Extras) lost momentum for me as the series progressed with this one being the slowest, and in a lot of ways the most disappointing, of the three.On her blog Westerfeld's wife and fellow YA author Justine Larbalestier recently mentioned reviews suggesting that Specials starts off slow despite its being filled with insane action sequences which she thinks is a silly thing to suggest. Which is true. Specials is jam packed with new technology, epic battles, and action-packed chases. Unfortunately that doesn't leave a lot of room for character development or \\"real\\" (by which I mean not involving a chase or battle) plot development.While the conclusion of Specials shakes Tally's world to its very core, the plot is strikingly (and annoyingly) similar to the premise of Pretties once you change some of the slang and substitute settings. In summary, I was excited to see how the trilogy ended, of course, but without the first two books Specials is nothing special."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"Specials, is the third book in the Uglies series and wraps up the story of Tally Youngblood. Mr. Westerfeld has done a wonderful job with this series and I was very pleased with all three of his books (Uglies, Pretties, Specials). For YA novels they possessed a depth that I haven't experienced with other newer authors. Mr. Westerfeld's commitment to his writing, characters and plot had me categorizing him with other great authors that I love as a child such as CS Lewis and Madeleine L'Engle.I mentioned in an earlier review of Uglies that Tally Youngblood wasn't so much a likable character as a respectable one, and she remains that way throughout the series. In Specials, Tally transforms from the bubbly pretty into a Cutter which takes her character from vapid to vicious. This transition is the hardest one that Tally has to face, but underneath it all she is still Tally and she has to fight against the gods.The book takes you on a break neck journey through Tally's world. It introduces you to new things that you only suspected were in existence, but the author never revealed. The Smokies take the game to a whole other level...and Tally finds herself facing off against people she once loved and called friends.With each twist of the plot Mr. Westerfeld led me down paths that I never expected, all the while entertaining me and making me question my beliefs and prejudices. I also do not feel that the conclusion of the Zane/David/Tally triangle was an easy way out, my opinion is that the author handled it very well - in a way that I did not expect.A wonderful conclusion to a great series. I recommend this for adults and their teenagers."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"This is the third, and final, book in the Uglies trilogy by Scott Westerfeld. I think that this book was the best of the series.In this book Tally is a Special. She is part of a Special group that Shay leads called the Cutters. Zane is strangely absent in the beginning and Tally sometimes wonders about him but not as much as you would think. The Cutters are on a Special assignment to find out where all of the Pretty curing pills are coming from and eliminate the source of them. The Cutters (as the name suggests) cut themselves to stay \\"icy\\"; it helps them to see the world in perfect clarity. The Cutters are finding out that the Pretty cure is something that is much bigger than their own city.Once again it was interesting how the Specials operation changed many aspects of Tally's personality. All of the neat abilities of the Specials were really fun to read about. This book was the fastest paced of the three; still a really fast and easy read. There was a ton interesting technology introduced in this book. I also think that a lot of the characters grew up some in this book.This book was the most fun of the three books to read. It was also the most significant as far as discussing more worldly issues. I was still a little disappointed in how the author dumbed things down. I also though the final manifesto was a bit over the top, unnecessary, and cheesy; it was a very juvenile statement from a character who seemed older than that by the end of the book.Overall this was a good conclusion to a mediocre series. This wasn't a bad series, but I don't think it really deserved all the acclaim that it got. There are other young adult sci-fi series out there that are more deserving of praise. There is now an additional book out to this series called Extras that deals with the same world but different characters. I don't think I will be reading Extraas; it bothers me when an author commits to a trilogy and then extends the series because of good sales."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"There's got to be a great end to the highly commended Ugly trilogy - and it is Specials. In the finale, Tally becomes a special, of course. She finally gets flopped over to the government's side, and she's assigned to go and foil the New Smoke's plan. But yet again, she has to battle between her old, ugly, patriotic, self or the new re-wired Special brain that has taken her over. And without our hero, Zane, she would've been a bland Special all throughout the story. Zane, with brain-eating nanos inside of him, spices up the story by encouraging Tally to change; to turn herself back into the rebel that we love (or hate).\\"--his whole body shivering like a littlie in the cold. And suddenly Tally could see inside him: his damaged nervous system, the corrupted connections between body and brain. She tried to blot the image from her mind, but it only grew clearer. She was designed to spot weaknesses, after all, to take advantage of the frailties and the flaws of randoms.\\" -Excerpt from Specials.As we sympathize with Zane throughout the story, we're urged to show Tally the real way of seeing the world. That's something that this novel can make us do. It causes us to really think about the characters, and really try to get them to think. Tally is one of the well-rounded characters, and that makes it hard for her to balance. And that's what readers need - a protagonist that needs help, that's self-conflicted, to make the book something to connect to. Like Pip, Catherine Earnshaw, Heathcliff, and Guy Montag, facing the real fact and humanity is just something Tally has trouble doing.What makes this novel really unique is how unexpected Tally can really be. Judging by Pretties and Uglies, we predict that Tally's going to be predictable; like squabbling with herself and her friends and breaking down from thinking about the overwhelming consequences of every choice she selects. But this time Tally does unpredictable things without thinking, and it shows that Tally is just a regular person. Not a Special, just a person with enormous society problems that aren't even a bit remorseful. In the end of the end, Westerfeld brings all things to a circle, finally bringing the troubles of Tally to a very special finale.Irene, 7th Grader"},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I absolutely LOVED Uglies.

Both were good, but nothing compared to Uglies."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"So Tally has been Ugly and uncovered some evil things going on under the prettiness of the world. Then the evil people turned Tally pretty to keep her quiet. Now these evil people have recruited Tally as a Special. The Specials jobs are to keep the pretties stupid and the uglies under control until they become pretty. But the Smoke has become a problem yet again for these evil people and now Tally has to decide whether to be a follower or a leader.An excellent book that deserves your attention."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I'll make it short and sweet... There is nothing more you could ask for in this book. It ends the series so perfectly, and makes Uglies and Pretties worth reading. I found it to be the best book of the trilogy, although, I thought it was VERY different from the other books. If you've never read any of the books, start with Uglies and work your way to this book so you can get the full effect. You won't be dissapointed."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"Oh goodness, I really should have read this book back in the day when I read the first two in the series. I loved those two books, but the shine is definitely off the apple with this one. Maybe it is because in the intervening years, I have read some remarkable young adult dystopian / science fiction novels and this one is showing its age.Originally published in 2006, the third book in the Uglies trilogy (which I have come to find out that there is a 4th book in the trilogy) has Tally becoming a member of the surgically enhanced group called the Cutter. This group has found that if you cut yourself, you will become more clear-headed in spite of the brain lesion used to make people pretty-minded. Because of this ability, they have been recruited into Special Circumstances where they are giving additional abilities.Yes, this is a bit confusing, but when you start the series from the beginning, it does make perfect sense.This book gets a bit confusing and twisty when a cadre characters and multiple situations are brought in, and once again, if I had read them all at once I am sure I would not constantly be playing catch-up. The Crims, the Smokies, Rusties, Crumblies, Fausto, Zane, etc., your mind begins to reel with the who's and what-for's.Being a Special is not all it is cracked up to be, you become pretty-minded and are repulsed by those less attractive and skilled than you are, so when Tally is cured, a whole new world and set of responsibilities open up for her. What will she do with this and how will she ensure that nature is protected from mankind's excesses.Apparently, there is a movie in the making for this series. Uglies opened the door for books such as Delirium and Hunger Games, so I guess that it is fitting that Hunger Games continues to hold the door open for Uglies in hope that there is a large enough market for this type of futuristic teen in peril plot."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I enjoyed the first book for what it was and liked Tally. The second book was also good, but not as good as the first. From there, the series just gets lamer and lamer. I couldn't finish the last one. I definitely recommend reading the first one. See what you think."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"Specials is the third book in the popular Dystopian Uglies series by Scott Westerfeld and while I didn't like it as much as the other two I still enjoyed it. Again, for those wanting to read the series you may want to skip reading this as there is no possible way to avoid spoilers from the first two books.At the end of Pretties Tally is captured again and this time she wakes up as a Special, but a different branch of them called Cutters and her friend Shay runs the group. The Cutters are more powerful and very much more adventurous than a regular Special with unbreakable ceramic bones, sharp teeth and nails, better hearing and vision - basically they are like machines. They cut themselves to feel more 'icy' meaning more in control of the situation they're in.Tally's biggest issue is that Zane is not with her. Zane was Tally's boyfriend who in Pretties ingested some pills with her to take care of the lesions in their head but unfortunately he got the pill that ate up his mind instead. Tally wants Zane to be a Cutter because she is completely turned off by him being just a pretty. One thing the Cutters seem to have is a very over-inflated ego and they feel they are above all others. So she keeps at Shay until Shay agrees to make Zane a Special but with conditions. Zane must lead them to the New Smoke.Even though Tally is this machine like person now, she still seems to have some of her old Tally self lingering. When Zane tells Tally to start thinking for herself again, this starts her to wondering what this new life of hers is really all about. Then Tally and Shay decide to pull off a stunt that changes everything, even the scope of their own world and when Tally reaches the New Smoke she realizes how much.The story takes off from here and we're back to hoverboarding everywhere and Tally doing things that made me hold my breath at times. Tally is still my favorite character but at times I was annoyed with her in this book because she so easily followed Shay. I know she was programmed to be the way she was and over the course of the story she does try to think for herself again and that brings me back to liking her again. I think it's important that Tally realized that she didn't need to cut herself to be special - a very important point to get across.Specials is the final book in the Uglies trilogy and for me it both disappointed me in some ways and impressed me in others and well that's all I can say about that without ruining the story for anyone. I will say though that the ending did surprise me as it wasn't what I expected and while it wasn't what I may have wanted, it was a satisfying end to the trilogy. There is another book Extras but it isn't a continuation of this story. I will read it at some point but not right now. You can see my reviews of Uglies here and Pretties here; the first two books in the series."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"WARNING...Spoilers ahead...Let me begin with what I loved about the series- they were many very exciting books and I couldn't put them down! I was reading all day and night until I finished them. Amazing!In Specials, Tally is a very difficult character to deal with. Sometimes many of her views become annoying, and you are left wishing that she felt a different way. In addition, Shay's character is very complex, and it left me thinking if she was really a good friend or not. Sometimes Shay becomes aggressive and has views that are shocking.All of Tally's surgeries were caused by her one way or another- in Uglies when Tally becomes a pretty to prove that the cure for \\"bubbleheadedness\\" works, and then in Pretties when Shay teams up with the manipulating Dr. Cable, betrays Tally and forces her to become a Special (This really had me angry with her character). Then Shay is saying how Tally thinks that the world revolves around her, and that she is one of the most selfish people she has ever met- even in her ugly days. Shay is always obsessed with \\"getting even\\".Shay has an issue, too!Most of the things that have gotten Shay mad were not even Tally's choice! When will she finally be able to choose? In Uglies, Shay becomes angry with Tally for supposedly \\"stealing\\" David from her (NOT HER CHOICE), and then again for betraying the smoke- which in the end was an accident she was only trying to get rid of the tracking locket.Also, what has left me brokenhearted was the death of Zane. What did he do wrong??? I would have rather seen a character like Dr. Cable die- which would be a punishment for manipulating all of the people of the city and then beginning the war against Deigo when she knew that it was actually Tally who was to blame for the destroying of the Armory.Zane, on the other hand, was a perfect match for Tally. The only reason that he died was because he loved her and wanted to be with her so much that he decided so undergo risky surgery and it was because of this and Tally's own mistakes that he died!Tally had also changed from being a Pretty and a Special because of her love for Zane. He CHANGED her! And then in the end, he dies. This was extremely disappointing to me and seemed like an easy way out to end the Tally-Zane-David triangle.Then, after loving Zane for much longer she ends up with her ex-boyfriend, David (who in my opinion was Zane's \\"runner-up\\" and a way to get over her heartbreak). I would have rather seen Tally be with Zane- who was willing to do anything for her and ended up dying because of it."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"Specials was my FAVORITE book so far of all of the Uglies books. Specials are a lot more complex in their thinking than Pretties, and brainwashed even more. This book, like Pretties, starts off in the middle of Tally's existence as a Special, skipping over the in between stages. This makes the book all the more exciting, and more mysterious. The lesions on a Pretty's brain was known, but it was unsure how Tally's brain had changed when she became a Special. Did it change? Or was she brainwashed? Or was this how she really was? This can only be known from Tally's changed outlook on life when comparing her voice to past books.The main plot of this book is that Tally and Shay want Zane to be able to become a Special--and the only way this can happen is if Zane proves that he is able to still be \\"tricky.\\" To do this they help Zane escape to the New Smoke (doing this to also save a fellow kidnapped Cutter and to gain credit for finally discovering where they are now located in order to destroy them). Zane is very weak now after all of his brain problems, and as a result, with Tally's new Special vision, she is disgusted by his weaknesses--very similar to how she saw Uglies when she was a Pretty.What makes this book especially morbid is the cutting, which she and the other \\"Cutters\\" (the Specials that work under Shay) need to do in order to feel anything. Tally still notices that she is different than the other Cutters, mostly due to her love for Zane. I was sad at his small part in this book, but at the same time the Specials were so fascinating, I at first took their side over the New Smoke, rooting for them to catch David and the others.Towards the end of the book, I was conflicted over who was right on what a better society would be--Dr. Cable's versus the New Smoke. I suppose Extras will prove this. This book was much more thought provoking, and I was continuously conflicted and debating with myself. My favorite book, one that I would DEFINITELY read over."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I personally thought this book was fantastic.

Uglies was great, Pretties was interesting but dropped a little, and Specials, the finale, is brilliant.We last left Tally just as she's being forced into another operation- this one to turn her into a \\"Special\\", part of Dr. Cable's team of cruel pretties with wolfen eyes, flash tattoos, inhuman reflexes and razor teeth and fingernails. Tally thinks that she sees the world clearly as a Special- the New Smoke, which has been growing everyday, is a problem that needs to be fixed, starting with getting rid of one of their leaders and her old boyfriend David.But before Tally can settle into the life of a Special, she wants Zane back. She is dismayed to find that he was permanently damaged from Maddy's nano-eating pills, and that with her Special eyes she can't even bring herself to look at him. She wants him to join her as a Special- and to do that he has to prove himself \\"bubbly\\". And what better way to do it by escaping the city? With help from Tally and Shay, Zane and a group of his Crims break into the wild to meet up with the New Smoke. What they don't know is that Tally and Shay are tracking them, waiting to find out where their enemies are.Specials goes where Pretties and Uglies didn't. At times you forget who's good and bad, and what side you want to root for. Tally does plenty of wrong stuff, too- enough that maybe you don't even want to feel sympathetic for her. The end of the story ties up nicely and shows that there isn't really good and evil- everyone going to do something wrong, and then there are the people who stop them. Whether or not those people are good or bad is up to the reader to decide."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I loved the book Uglies and pretties so I decided to read Specials. I thought that the book was a little awkward at times but its was still one of the best books I have ever read.

Oh and David is still in the picture with Tally near the end but at first she hated him and wanted to do nothing else but kill him. I still loved the book and finished it in 1 day and didn't want it to end. But I hope that Mr. Scott Westerfeld will come out with book to officially end the series becuase Specials had a good ending but it was a little weak.

Tally and her best friend Shay are the ones that go from uglies to pretties to specials. This is the weirdest book in the series.It includes total destruction to loved ones dying. Who knows what will happen next? These are some of the important relationships between Tally and the other characters. Tally and Zane are boyfriend and girlfriend. Tally was forced into turning special while Zane stays pretty and stupid.This causes a major problem because now Tally and Zane live totally different lives. Also Tally and Zane's relationship changes because, something happens to Zane.Tally and Shay have been friends since they were uglies.Tally and Shay's relationship changes because, Tally and Shay get in a ginormous argument. They seperate and do not communicate for a few days. One out of whack thing that Tally and Shay do is go into a research center/museum. They purposely let out a substance that destroys everything in their path and then expands itself. I won't tell you what happens but, I can tell you this it really isn't pretty.

I'll be honest I stopped reading this novel about half way through. Maybe that means I shouldn't count it but it pissed me off so much I decided I should get the credit for agony. Westerfeld picks out his favorite words and uses them over and over and over again. Seriously I want to track him down and loan him my thesaurus. If you really enjoyed the first two novels then go ahead and finish up the series but if you were like me and was always two seconds away from giving up on the series then don't even try to finish up the series out of some convoluted notion of completing something you have started. It's not worth the headache.My main point of grievance with the series is the reader never find out what lead to these mandatory surgeries. The reader never has a complete picture of what happened to society that destroyed it many many years back. The reader also never truly understand how job functions are taught and how the society manages to function with what seems to be no blue collar workers. One of things I enjoy most with dystopian fiction is learning how the government has rebuilt itself after some great disaster. This never attempts to describe the society past or present and it makes the novels feel incomplete."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"Spoilers ahead... This book illustrates why radical environmentalism is no lover of liberty. Even though Westerfeld clearly understands the need for human freedom, he just can't reconcile himself to let man be free to learn from his past mistakes. Instead, he takes his protagonist Tally, a champion for freedom, and turns her into some sort of all powerful specter who watches humanity to ensure that they don't step out of line again. Tally's manifesto, which punctuates the end of the book, reads as if Westerfeld cribbed it directly from the Unibomber. How's life in the shack treating poor Tally? Not well, I fear. Our valiant hero has been turned into a modern day eco-terrorist. She threatens to descend on humanity like some avenging angel to right the wrongs done to the trees and the rabbits. No meat for you!! Not one thought is given to the idea that maybe there are responsible ways to use the resources God has provided for us.If I had to sum up this series, I would say it is Brave New World meets an Inconvenient Truth. Unfortunately, the result is a squishy mess which says more about the goals of the modern environmental movement than it does about the enduring power of freedom. First they come for your light bulbs, and next they will cut right to the chase and take your power to think for yourself. Not knowing Mr. Westerfeld personally, I can only hope he that he meant for that ending to be ironic. Don't waste your money or your time.

The \\"Specials\\" were just way above what you would be thinking they would be. It just seemed that they could not have survived much of what happened to them (guess I am being too much of realist in that regard). For the young readers (of which I am not) the book would probably be more of what they are happy to read. I love to read dystopian novels and am glad that I read this trilogy, but I still like the Hunger Games much better. That being said I think the series is worth your time. The fact that these books were written quite a few years ago...it is amazing that they are becoming popular now (that is a talented author).

Now Shay is not only her best friend, but her boss as well. After a few months of training in a Cutters' camp with Shay and their group, Tally is sent on her first assignment. They are going to crash an Uglies party incognito. Of course something goes wrong and Tally ends up saving Shay's life while another Special is kidnapped by the New Smoke. The only thing Tally cares about in this story is finding Zane and being reunited with him as a Special.Even though Shay is Tally's best friend and always come through for her, I was truly sick of her by this book. I even considered Shay as a younger version of Dr. Cable because she is so cruel and controlling. The disturbing part is that Shay genuinely loves Tally, but she knows how to hold a grudge. Shay has no concept of forgiveness and keeps giving Tally guilt trips whenever it's convenient. I understand that these two girls have a history together from when they were Uglies, but I've never considered Shay a true friend and I couldn't understand why Tally still tolerates her at this point in the story.Here's an excerpt:\\"I don't want this,\\" she said softly. Her stomach was uneasy and the moonlight on the water was too bright, its lines too sharp in her perfect vision. \\"I don't want to be this way.\\"Shay angled her board sideways, sweeping directly into Tally's path and spinning to a sudden, dangerous stop. Tally leaned back, and both hoverboards shrieked like buzz saws as they halted, coming to rest only centimeters apart.\\"What way? Annoying? Pathetic?\\" Shay shouted, her voice all razors and ground glass. \\"I tried to tell you not to come!\\"Tally's heart was pounding from the near collision, and anger rushed through her in a torrent. \\"You knew that seeing him would do this to me!\\"\\"You think I know everything?\\" Shay said coldly. \\"I'm not the one in love. Haven't been since you stole David from me. But maybe I thought love might make a difference. Well, Tally-wa, did it make Zane special for you?\\"Tally flinched, something inside her flipping over. She looked down at the black water, feeling like she was going to throw up. She tried to stay icy, to remember how Zane had made her feel back in pretty days. \\"What did Dr. Cable do to us, Shay? Do we have some kind of special lesions in our brains? Something that makes everyone else look pathetic? Like we're better than them?\\"\\"We are better than them, Tally-wa!\\" Shay's eyes shone like coins, reflecting the lights of New Pretty Town. \\"The operation gives us the clarity to see that. That's why everyone else looks confused and pitiful, because that's how people are.\\"\\"Not Zane,\\" Tally said. \\"He was never pitiful.\\"\\"He's changed too, Tally-wa.\\"\\"But it's not his fault...\\" Tally turned away. \\"I don't even want to see this way! I don't want to be disgusted by everyone who's not part of our clique, Shay!\\"Shay smiled. \\"You'd rather be all happy and loving, like a clueless bubblehead? Or live like a Smokey, crapping in holes and eating dead rabbits and feeling all virtuous about it? What part of being special don't you like?\\"Tally's fingers curled into fighting position. \\"I don't like the part where Zane looks wrong to me.\\"\\"Do you think he looks right to anyone, Tally? His brain's a mess!\\"Tally felt tears burning inside, but the heat didn't spill into her eyes. She'd never seen a Special cry, and didn't even know if she could. \\"Just answer me: Is there something in my head that makes him look wrong? What did Cable do to us?\\"Peris also makes a brief appearance in this story, but Tally has lost all respect for him and greets him with sarcasm. There are two curse words, hell and bad*ss. Tally kisses someone in the story, but her special abilities are sharper than she realizes and the weakness inside the person makes her sick. She almost throws up as a result, but her heart never changes about the person. She risks her life to protect him. There's a part two and part three in this book as well. Part two goes into describing the cure for Specials. In part three Dr. Cable declares war on an innocent city to take back control of runaways with the New Smoke. Shay and Tally do their part to stop the attack and that's where the story ends. There is more violence in the book, but nothing graphic or surprising.I DID NOT LIKE the way this one ended; I truly had hopes for a happy ending for Tally and that doesn't seem likely the way things turn out. Something happens to Dr. Cable in this book that changes the outcome for everything, really surprised me. Again, this is my second time reading it and the only thing that changed for me is wishing Shay would disappear from the story. She makes more trouble for Tally than she helps out, but I can see how her friendship creates more drama in the story. I keep forgetting that these girls are only 16 or 17 years old and despite their transformations, they're still just teens. This book is also a library copy with the original cover that I prefer and it's for ages 12 and up. As a Special, Tally must deal with anger and control more than ever. She craves the closeness of the Cutters, but she also longs for her independence and this creates more confusion with her character when making decisions. Regardless of what Tally goes through, she is always determined to do the right thing and that's what makes her stand out from her friends. She is loyal, but she cannot be controlled no matter what the rules are. This makes her both a threat and as asset to consider depending on which side you stand for. Tally will always choose freedom and defending the weak."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"The first thing that readers of the third installment of the \\"Uglies\\" universe need to know is that if you think you know how this story is going to end, think again.In this book we have a brand new Tally, not as relatable as in the previous novels, but still something about her seems real. It's hard to give an in depth synopsis of the book without revealing any spoilers so I'll be brief.Shay has turned Tally into a Special now but not just any Special, she's a Cutter. Tally is eager to prove herself but is also desperate to be reunited with Zane, he is after all why she allowed herself to be caught in the first place.After she discovers that Dr. Cable hasn't made Zane a Special, Shay cooks up a plan to discover the New Smoke without the help of the other Specials, she wants the glory for herself and the other Cutters. Their plan involves some seriously illegal stuff that leads to some very bad consequences. Tally goes along with the plan because it involves the doctor finally realizing that Zane should have become a Special all along. The flawed plan finally reveals the New Smoke and how the world outside of their little city operates. Before long Tally is fighting everyone who wants to change her and those who want to destroy others for power.This book is very different from the first two novels in the series. It wasn't as engrossing as the first two books for one thing, Uglies took me 1 day to read but I kept stopping and starting on this one, debating whether I wanted to finish. When I was about 3/4 of the way through I was already considering how to rate this book and I was planning on giving it 3 stars with a disclaimer that it was really a 2.5 star book. I thought I had already figured out how everything was going to end. Boring. And then the book threw me for a loop. Because of the non cookie cutter ending I decided to bump it up to a 4 star rating (although to be fair, it deserves 3.5 stars).The characters have completely transformed, Tally is no longer the girl who was just looking for herself, Shay has went from slightly impulsive and lovable to sadistic, calculating and clever, Zane is no longer confident and strong, only David is similar to the original character but that may be because he didn't have many appearances in the book. Although the characters may not have turned out like I wanted them to, in the context of where the author wanted to go with the novel, they were well executed and the message at the end is a great one and should be heeded by more people today."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"This book explains and submits so much info your brain will explode with TAWESOMENESS!!!! (Totally Awesome) Tally is simply devilish and Shay pure malice."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"The Specials was the most action-packed of the first 3 in the Uglies Series. The writing and the pace moved along quickly, keeping you interested and maintaining your need to see how all of the characters from the first 2 books come together. You also begin to incorporate all three stories with the overlapping moral and ethical issues broached by Westerfeld, causing you ponder and reevaluating the plots and twists from the Uglies and the Specials. This one left me with the most unsettling feeling of the all the books, but all questions were answered and ends tied-up. I'm just not sure how I feel about society any more, especially living in Southern California where we are not to far away from this way of thinking. I would defiantly say you have to read all three to get the true feeling Westerfeld had intended and would give the overall series 5 stars. It was defiantly worth my time."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"i loved the book but there was too much about tally. i know she is the main character but still, she is too much acting like she is the center of the universe&#62;when she ISNT.

The fourth book is a complete waste of time and doesn't really have much to do with the other three."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"i absolutely love this series...its amazing...but honestly the end was a let down...it was rushed and what evr happens 2 tally and david? definitely reccomend this book...only if ur ready 4 a let down ending"},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"This review assumes that you have read the first two books of the trilogy: Uglies and Pretties. If you haven't this review may spoil them for you.At the beginning of Specials, Tally and her gang the Cutters have been turned into agents for Special Circumstances. They are still Cutters though and need to cut themselves into order to think clearly. (I was a little uncomfortable with the whole cutting aspect of Tally and her friends. I hope that it didn't glamorize cutting for teenagers and make them want to try it.) Their mission is to track down the New Smokies. The question is will Tally help destroy the Smokies or will she be able to think way out of her specialness in time to save them?This book was a nice ending to the trilogy. (There is a fourth book, Extras, but from what I understand it's set in the same world but not a direct continuation of the series.) There was plenty of action, like in Pretties. A new city was introduced and I liked reading about the way that city did things compared to how Tally's city. I highly recommend this series to fans of dystopian science fiction."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"My favorite book series of all time is the Uglies series by Scott Westerfeld. It has 4 books- Uglies, Pretties, Specials, and Extras. But my favorite book of all from the series is Specials.Tally Youngblood has just turned Special, which basically means secret service\\\\CIA agent. The Specials are brain- washed humans with military modifications like unbreakable bones, cruel beauty, lots of strength, and the speed of a cheetah. But she's part of a clique of the younger Specials [16 -19] called the Cutters. The clique was started by her best friend Shay. They cut themselves- which is why they're called Cutters.Tally's only missions? Destroy the Smokies [which include her old boyfriend David and the Cure for bubbleheadness,] make her new boyfriend Zane Special, and have the Cutters stay Cutters- without a cure for Special-ness. But on her adventure to do this, Tally cures herself in an unexpected way... but not without losing some important things first.I really liked the book because there's a lot of fast- paced action. And it really gets under your skin; because it shows who the characters really are.If I could rate Specials on a scale of 0- 1,000,000, I would say it's a 1,000,000,000. Off the charts. I read this book when I was 10, but I would say it's for kids ages 11-18. Same with the entire series.-Shay-la YoungbloodPS:If you like a lot of romance do not buy this.there isn't that much[yes!!]and something baad happens to ZANE"},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I started \\"The Uglies\\" trilogy a while back, and finally finished The Specials recently. The series itself is an interesting concept of the future, and, while The Specials ties the story up nicely (but not too nicely), the main character, Tally, was not nearly as likable as she was in the first two novels, simply because she is now a Special and doesn't experience things as normal people do. I liked that this novel had a lot of action and suspense, and while I'm no longer a \\"young adult\\" in the teenage sense, I can see how this novel would have tons of appeal. I really liked the ending, as well, because it wasn't traditionally happy, and I appreciate that Tally stayed true to herself in a way that she was unable to do throughout the other novels."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"Where, oh where did Tally go? Rather than starting with all the good points in this book, I will begin with the only flaw. Our main character Tally, who has never really been easy to understand is completely gone from Specials. When you finally thought you grasped what kind of character she was in Uglies, you read Pretties. In Pretties you start to slip-she has a different point of view. In Specials Tally has yet another point of view-the very hardest to grasp. In a way I suppose that was Mr. Westerfeld's point; to get across what the surgeries do to your brain.In Specials Tally is determined to get the Smokies-not to help them, but to destroy them. All the while she still is trying to get to Zane, who the Specials claim is going under surgery to become like her.Now she and Shay discover that Zane has succeed and intends to continue spreading the cure. But Zane is also weak-ever since he took only have of the Cure. Whenever Tally is near him she is disgusted by him.Upon arriving in a town where everyone has been exposed to the cure, Tally has no idea what to do. Help Zane or complete her mission? Before long a full fledged war breaks out and Tally may be the one who started it.I liked it.

Once again, Scott Westerfeld does his magic with Tally, Shay, Zane, and David."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I loved this book and thought it was the best of the trilogy. The excitement of Tally and Shay's destruction of the Armory, Tally helping to defend Diego from attack, and other scenes - written so well that I could almost feel the adrenaline pumping through my own veins. The feel and speed of the book had a cinematic quality. I imagine Westerfeld wrote in this style on purpose to capture the style of the Specials, just as the second book had an \\"airhead\\" style of writing. The vocabulary also reflects the subculture of the Specials with words such as icy, which indicates the state of being clear-headed. I was saddened by Zane's death and disappointed that Tally could not have had more of a good-bye with him before he died, but I did like that she was reunited with David. I'm rather split as to which boyfriend of hers I prefered, since Zane and David are both very different and compliment Tally in different ways. Fortunately, Westerfeld made that decision for me.The small glimpse I am given of the city of Diego has me thirsting for more, which I know I can look forward to in the fourth book Extras. I also hope that this book accounts for the lack of attention given to the protection of the wild in Specials."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"This review will more than likely contain spoilers if you have not read Uglies and Pretties. Read at your own risk!I was really excited to read another adventure with Tally and Shay. I honestly didn't realize this was the last book with Tally! I didn't want to accidentally come across any spoilers so I had not even read the blurb for Extras. What I'm getting at is, I was not prepared for that ending!In Specials Tally is.....a Special. In other words she is very unlikeable! I know it wasn't her fault. She was brain-missing but I just really didn't like her. It was hard for me to adjust. The first two books all the New Smoke lives and this one was down with the New Smoke! You can see where I had a hard time.I still gave this book 4 Stars because even if Tally and Shay are unlikeable Scott Westerfeld still created a interesting story line that kept me reading. Even though he kil.......I mean.....oh nevermind....That's really all I have to say. I don't want to put too many spoilers in here! Overall, I really enjoyed Tally's story. I highly recommend them!"},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"SpecialsScott WesterfieldBook ReviewThis book is about Tally. This is the third book in a series about Tally, she has gone from ugly, to pretty, to special. Finally Tally is a Special! Specials see the world differently, everything is way more clear. Their five senses are all sharpened. She is a special special, one of the \\"Cutters\\". They cut themselves to stay \\"icy\\". Since Shay started the \\"Cutters\\" she is the boss. Tally and Shay are going on a special mission. Dr. Cable has ordered them to hunt down and capture everyone from the \\"New Smoke\\" which is a camp for all runaways. The leader of the camp is David, and his mother, Maddy. Maddy was the doctor who discovered the brain lesions for pretties. The brain lesions are little cells implanted in the 16 year olds brain that make them think and talk like a bubblehead. Zane and Tally were together when Tally was a pretty, and a brain lesion pill ate away all of Zane's brain cells. The hospital fixed Zane as best they could, but when Tally and Shay go to see Zane to talk to him about helping to catch the \\"New Smoke\\" it repulses Tally to look at him, because of his frail condition. Well, that's what she thinks anyway. Shay and Tally convince Zane to run away into the wild, to find the \\"New Smoke\\". Shay and Tally decide that they will track/follow the group of Crims to the \\"New Smoke\\" and then they will shut it down. But what they don't know is that Maddy has a cure.... and that Specials have brain lesions too. Tally never thought that she would encounter David again... but of course she does. Shay and Tally discover the \\"New Smoke\\" is bigger and better than they thought. When they arrive in Diego, they have no idea what to think. Tally and Shay have another huge fight... Will they ever be friends again?? Will the specials capture the New Smoke members?? Will Tally get back with Zane?? Will Tally ever really, truly be happy???I enjoyed this book. I liked the details of the Special's senses, especially the way that when Tally was hoverboarding through the woods, she tasted the freshness of the air, she smelled the pine of the pine trees. Tally heard every little twig cracking in the woods, for miles and miles. She even felt the sting of the little branches as they whipped her arms and she saw the trees blurring past as she rode at top speed. I also liked the way the author described how everything in her life and that she had ever known fell apart. I really enjoyed the way Shay and Fausto were different when she went to Diego. The author did a really good job describing the way everything in Diego was so totally different from the only way of life she has ever known. Everyone was different there, while back in her city everyone was the same, uglies, pretties, crumblies, and littlies, as the other. They all looked the same and acted the same. Also the way everything fell apart was very realistic.I would give this book about a 7.5 out of 10 because it was a good book but it wasn't the best. This book was a LOT better than Pretties and Uglies. I think the events in the story were more realistic, like the \\"New Smoke\\" growing larger and larger, and Tally and Shay fighting. I can relate to best friends having fights. It happens all the time. I really think people who like the alternate universe type thing would really enjoy this book, only because the world in this book is really a whole different type of world and society compared to our own. In our world most everyone mixes together, but in this world that Scott Westerfield created, people are separated. If you want to read this book, I say read it!!! You really won't regret it!Haley"},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I can say at once that it was not as good as the first, but then it is hard to top a thing like that, and this book evolved in its own way so we get to follow all \\"different\\" kinds of people, from the uglies, to the pretties and now the special.Tally is now scary, with fangs, and all hard angles, she has the body of a machine, and on top of that she cuts herself like the rest of the cutters. it is something to feel, to make them more special. yes I am very sure Westerfeld has a point with that, and how some fall into it to feel, when everything else is dark.She also looks down on everyone else and thinks the specials to be the greatest people ever. Even Zane, her pretty ex is just boring and average. She is scary in her believes, and it is hard to like her in this book. But then she is the extreme.The story in this book is how to get Zane special too, and by doing that they start something really bad. That and fighting the rebels will shape her world. It has been crumbling for a while now and the governments are not happy, and they are also scared.I like his world, and the history he made into it. And even if it is an extreme world they do have points. By making everyone pretty there is no jealousy, wars, and fights (and yes they have stuff in their brains). And they are not destroying the earth. The question here is whether freedom is more important than the earth itself. For when people are free it will start again.One thing I did have a problem with, the way things gets fixed, it seems so easy even though it is hard, and it does makes Tally to the center of the world. But other than that this is a most to the trilogy, and to find out how it all ends for this beautified world."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I thought these books are amazing and every one wanting to read an excellent book should choose this series.

These books seem to have a guideline that they all follow -- turn Tally and her friends into something they didn't want to be, Tally forgets that she didn't want to be that way and enjoys it, Tally goes through some stuff that ultimately changes her mind back to remembering who she was before and how she doesn't actually want to be the way she currently is, Tally tries to save the world. It just felt a bit monotonous and like I was reading the same story over and over again.With that said, I did somewhat enjoy Specials. It was interesting to learn more about the people who are Special Circumstances -- through Tally being one -- and why they act and think the way they do, after reading about them in the previous books. I still think that the premise behind these books is a unique and interesting one.In this book, Tally and a lot of her friends are Specials. They go around trying to find and destroy the Smoke, which they loved so much in the previous books. Tally and Shay are friends again and they both hate David, as they blame him for what happened to Zane. Tally is a different person for part of this novel, just like she was a Pretty in Pretties. She goes through many ups and downs, while trying to figure herself out. As I said above, it was interesting to see Tally as a Special, because the reader is able to gain more information about Specials and to truly understand them. Neither David nor Zane had prominent roles in Specials. In fact, they were barely in the book at all, which was disappointing.Overall, I am glad to have completed this trilogy (I will not be reading the latest edition, Extras, as I feel the story was wrapped up nicely with Specials and I just don't care to read any more about this world). I somewhat enjoyed the series, but it wasn't one of my favourites. I would recommend the series to younger teens, rather than older teens/adults. I will also say that I liked how Specials ended.Read more of my reviews on my blog: SIK Book Reviews"},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I have finished reading it and it is deriving,and inspiring I reccemend it to all ages who love fast paced futureistic books"},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"Specials is the final book in Scott Westerfeld's Uglies trilogy (after Uglies and Pretties). In this installment, Tally wakes up from surgery and finds herself part of an ultra-cool team of Specials (bio-engineered, covert law enforcement personnel) called the Cutters. She has snazzy techno-features, like embedded computer chips, unbreakable ceramic bones, and razors that come out of her fingernails. She's the ultimate weapon.It's a bit disturbing to read a book in which the heroine of the series has been essentially co-opted by the bad guys. Tally now works for Shay, her complex best friend, and is expected to find and betray the New Smokies (her friends of the first book). But she does maintain traces of her former self, and she is particularly motivated to find Zane (her now brain-damaged love from the second book), and convince Dr. Cable to transform Zane into a Special, too. However, when she does find Zane, she is revolted by his weakness, by his not being \\"special\\" like she is. She struggles with herself, knowing deep inside that she loves him, but programmed to see the world so keenly that his imperfections grate on her, and so sure of her own superiority that she can't really imagine being with him again.A series of adventures follow, during which Tally and Shay pull a stunt that turns out to have disastrous consequences, and then set off on the trail of the New Smoke. Tally re-encounters David (her love from before she met Zane), and has to go up against the seemingly invincible Dr. Cable. The ending is satisfying in many ways, although the resolution of the Zane vs. David choice is a bit of an anti-climax.Overall, I found it a fascinating story, full of unexpected twists, chases, and cool special effects. I think that the Westerfeld says some interesting things about what constitutes beauty, about making up your own mind vs. letting others tell you what to do, and about the balance between governmental protection and control. Tally's changing personality makes this series a bit tough, however, after the first book. You like her. You dislike her. You pity her. You don't know what to do with her. For me, I prefer to have a main character that I can identify with more. Tally's evolving personality makes that a bit difficult. I'm left feeling that Scott Westerfeld presents some intriguing ideas with this series, and that teens will enjoy it, but that I didn't love it the way I do when I identify with the main character. Still, it's a fun ride. And I'll definitely see the movies if there ever are any.This book review was originally published on my blog, Jen Robinson's Book Page, on June 11th, 2006."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"Tally has been forced into yet another cruel surgery. And now she is a Cutter (a new kind of Special with flash tattoos, super-fast reflexes, and wolf-like eyes). Tally can think more clearly than ever, but her memory has once again been altered. She now thinks of David and the rest of the Smokies as enemies, and she wants nothing more than to end the Smoke forever. Well there is one thing she wants more......Zane, now severely effected by the brain lesion nanos, is entirely weak. Tally can't even look at him and won't rest until he's a Cutter, too. Shay comes up with a plan to make Zane a Cutter, so that Tally will be happy, and the same plan will end the Smoke forever. What could be more perfect, right? Wrong. Their innocent plan evolves into something much bigger. Someone will die, many will question who they are, and the world will change, forever.Specials is a brilliant end to the Uglies trilogy. It had many of the same themes seen in the last books, along with a few new themes. The story of the Rusties, billions of people that died from a human-made virus, is told in both Pretties and Uglies. Few of the Rusties survived, all because they went too far environmentally. Specials increases the importance of this small theme from the last two books. It reminds us what happens when we take the environment for granted, and this is the base for the fabulous, unexpected ending to Specials and to the Uglies trilogy.I encourage everyone to read these books. They are wonderful and do not let you down."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"'Tally- your special' Tally can still remember the haunting words of Shay's that have destroyed her life a pretty forever. Even the days when she was and Uglie- specials seemed like legendary figures, myths, something people talked about but never saw- Tally would never have guessed in her wildest-dreams that she would become one. And now she was.Being a special, bring a new and beautiful aspect to the life of Tally. She feels abnormal, everything she sees has a simple and somewhat- crystallic beauty to it. Everything shimmers with loveliness and grace and beauty- life is unreal now, that Tallys a special.Then Tally is given an offer- to stamp out the rebels of the New Smoke- once and for all- whether she does or whether she doesn't, darkness has crept into Tally's life- like a dangerous fume, like pure hatred from a bleeding heart. Whatever she chooses, Tally's life will never be the same now that she is a special.The third and final book to this amazing trilogy had a beautiful shade of darkness to it. The characters were well-developed, personality changes occured, and the readers grow close to Tally like a weed entwining a fern that had gone from pretty and bonny- to breathtakingly beautiful with a hardness to it.I have enjoyed reading Scott Westerfield's other books to the series: Uglies and then Pretties. The originality to both of them is wonderful and creative, and over-all adds up to a great teen read, that depicts an amazingly modern world- perhaps the future, for us humans."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"This is a review on the audio book version of \\"Specials\\" performed brilliantly by Carine Montbertrand.I will assume that anyone reading this book has read the previous books in this series. If not than stop reading this review and go read them. The last we saw of Tally Youngblood, she had escaped pretty town and on her own made it to the New Smoke ready to reunite with her boyfriend Zane. Poor afflicted Zane, who took the cure with her and started to experience terrible headaches. At the Smoke, Tally is told by her old beau Ugly David that the cure pills were meant to be taken together (although in their directions they never said so!) and Zane got the Nanobytes that apparently lurved to snack on brain matter nonstop, while Tally got the pill that stopped those Nanos from that third trip to the buffet. Tally realizes that she has cured herself of pretty-mindedness. She is sort of like Keanu Reeves in the Matrix but without the leather outfit or Laurence Fishburne.Tally is soon revisited by her old friend Shay, who is now a Special by her own choice. Shay wants Tally to be Special too, and whisks her back to Pretty town for yet another operation. Specials are like the Men in Black from our society, you hear of them but never see them, yet you fear them anyway. They don't have the brain lesions, so they aren't airheads like the Pretties. Specials have all sorts of add-ons, for sight and stealth and strength. They have \\"skintennas\\" built in so they can talk to each other on a network, they can see in the dark, and have tattoos covering their bodies. They also have wolf like features and sharpened teeth, the better to eat you with my dear!Tally, as a special, is deadly beautiful. Along with Shay and the other Crims they are still cutting themselves to get the most excellent clarity, or to be \\"Icy\\" in special-speak. The Cutters are Dr. Cable's elite force. Tally wants to know why Zane isn't a Special also, and her and Shay go visit him in Pretty town, where she realizes that Zane's brain damage couldn't be fixed and he is a shaky mess. She still loves him, but her Special mind is turned off by his flaws. The only way he can become a Special is to pull off a serious trick and lead her and shay to the New Smoke. So they arrange for him to be freed, and follow him.The rest of the book is built around Tally and Shay causing havoc in a Military building, freeing Zane from his beacon, following him to the New Smoke and discovering a whole new town called Diego where surgeries to enhance oneself have gone awry and Tally has to choose between curing herself, and saving her town from War.These books, especially this third one, have dealt with so many issues albeit in a different way, that we all have to face. We all have found ourselves looking in the mirror and seeing how much we have changed, either by time or by circumstances. We all must either face those changes, accept them and grow or try to gain back what we have lost ignoring the futility of that action. There comes a point in your life where you must see the scars that life had given you and embrace them. You must take your losses and make them count for something.That's what these books have spoken to me through Tally and her experiences."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"This clever futuristic novel has brought my teenage mind into a new perspective of our world. I have always cared for the environment, but never quite will think the same way again. Not only this book but Uglies and Pretties have made me a reader, (which i never relly had done before Uglies). I love these books and encourage any reader to read them. These books are my all time favorites and I recommend them to everyone. All my friends are reading them now.As you follow Tally through adolescence the reader begins to notice the twists and turns of this ultimately imprisoned life. The third book (Specials) is an interesting way to keep thoughts and ideas flowing about the future, even if there isn't a fourth sequel. When you start reading you learn of the past life of Tally Youngblood, start to see her future, and you watch her struggles and recoveries as being special alters not only her once plain pretty body but her relationship with Zane and her once special enemies. The transformation in these books is incredible and again, I definitely recommend them. The reason I am writing a review is to say that Scott Westerfield is brilliant and that everyone should stop to think about the world's future not only in the novels but here on Earth... how much longer until all of us our considered stupid for destroying ourselves by the only people left?"},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I am kind of holding onto hope that this is not the end of the story. This third book just didn't seem to tye it all together like the others did. I am a huge uglies fan(the second book being my favorite)and I felt so let down by the third. Here's why...1. The whole thing with the smoke joining with the city didn't really work. I mean the whole point of the smoke was that they were this rebelious little group...you know, the smoke against the world. But then they join the city and all of a sudden they are these ruthless people living in a messed up city of wierdo's. I don't get it.2. The whole Tally cutting herself thing was horrible. I was horrified when i first read about her doing this, Shay is one thing but Tally,well yeah. It may not have been so bad if the whole thing had been resolved, but like so much else in the book it seems like tally never fixes this problem. 3. The end did not work for me. I had always assumed that Tally would go back to pretty or maybe even ugly( although I really like her pretty). Instead she heads off into into the wild- still this vicous special. And i just don't really like the whole going off into the wild thing. Especially not with David. Now don't get me wrong, i like david. But what is the deal with them are they a couple or not? which leads me to my big complaint...4. Scott really messed up his love triangle in this book. Actually his love square. I always loved the charachter of Zane, from the moment he appeared in the books, he added a great element of drama. I was also a David fan,just because he was always there and because he always added something to the plot. I had also always wondered about Shay, the fourth in the love square. Irritating as Shay could be she always managed to be the first one out there. I mean you can see Tallys whole journey reflected in what happened to Shay. So imagine my horror when there is almost no romance in this book. None. David is in maybe three scenes where he says and does nothing of value, and Zane while in more scenes, pretty much does nothing except shake and try to persuade Tally to fight her specials lesions. Shay however predominates over 2/3 of the book, yet still the big Shay& Tally conflict is not solved. At the end of the book they have not had the talking that needs to happen between them to remedy everything that happened. Its just like Shay suddenly woke up and forgave tally, which did not work for me. And now for my Zane rant. I do not mind so much that Zane was killed. It is the way that he was killed that horrified me. After being left out of most of the book he is suddenly killed in a bad operation. At this point you are not really even sure how much tally cares about the guy and it shows. For maybe half a page tally mourns Zane, then she is done with him. Occasionally, as if the author just remembered that he died we hear tally feel depressed about zane. Deeply depressed. But she never comes to terms with it!!! She is just left at the end of the book still struggling over his death, and there horrible last encounter. Then david pops up and everything is all fine and dandy with him. They were another one that needed a good long talk. It seemed like scott tried but he couldn't really pull it off. I always knew that tally would have to choose between zane and david, that one of them would probably have to die, and i always thought(to my deep distress) that it would be zane who scott would make kick the bucket. however the way he did it was so badly laid out that i am only left desperatly hoping that a fourth book might be written and zane might come back, or tally learn to deal with the loss by falling in love with david or something.So i was pretty disapointed in this book. The plot line wasn't as good and this story just seemed all over the place."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"This is a spectacular ending to a fabulous trilogy. The plot and characters provoke questions on the importance of friendship and physical power. Tally Youngblood has undergone her second operation: she is now a fierce looking special who keeps Uglyville and New Pretty Town in line. What she used to call bubbly is now icy, and she is endowed with lighting-fast reflexes and superhuman strength. Tally soon discovers that the lesion curing pills have gone in to mass production, and are being handed out all over the city. Her special circumstances operation makes her believe that this is horrible, and that it is something to stop. On a trip back from crashing a pill-distributing party in Uglyville, she forces Shay to take her to Zane, who she has not entirely forgotten. They see that he is now cured, though he still feels the aftereffects of their pill-taking mishap, and that the Crims are now up to more serious tricks than crossing the borders on hoverboards. When he and some others of their old clique go on a journey to the New Smoke, Tally tracks behind them and in doing so disobeys orders from Shay. When she gets to The New Smoke, after a long time of struggling to understand how the Crims' minds are working, she gets a big surprise. During her time there she takes some heart-crushing blows, and learns in the end that specials really can cry. This is a remarkable book that leaves you to contemplate Tally's character and her strength- mentally and physically. It has a great ending, with an unexpected story twist that leaves you wondering whether she will ever live happily ever after. Read this if at all possible, and the other two in this trilogy along with it!"},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I picked up Uglies on a whim one day and was immediately sucked into this original and thought-provoking series. Specials is the thrilling ending to my favorite sci-fi read since Ender's Game.Tally and Shay are fascinating characters who have grown and evolved in each book. You love them and you hate them in equal turns. In this story, we see them at their finest. They have to differentiate between what is really right and true and what they have been programmed to believe is right and true. The whole series explores cultural beliefs on beauty, self esteem, and control of the masses. This book brings Tally's world crashing into the world Outside, with amazing consequences.I was so annoyed with the whole Tally-David-Zane love triangle at the end of Pretties, and I'm so satisfied with the complex resolution to that in Specials. I love that this story is never predictable. Just when you're sure you know what will come next, something totally unexpected happens. And you get to see just a little bit more of Tally's futuristic world.Excellent conclusion to an excellent story. Here's to hoping for more after the trilogy."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"Tally is now a Cutter, a new branch of Special Circumstances. The Cutters, led by Tally's longtime friend Shay, arrive at an uglies party looking for outsiders crashing the festivities to stir up trouble. Tally and the other Cutters are disguised as uglies, which causes Tally to feel nostalgic as she watches the poor uglies awkwardly interacting.Tally has been completely remade. Her bones are now aircraft ceramic, light but indestructible. Her muscles repair themselves. She can hear the faintest, most distant sound through her skintenna. All her senses are supernaturally sharp --- and she actually smells the party-crashing Smokey.Smokies have been smuggling in pills with nanos, which destroy the brain lesions that keep pretties stupid and mellow. Unfortunately, the nanos can also destroy brains entirely (Tally has seen this firsthand when the pills destroyed her boyfriend Zane's mind). Now Tally moves to arrest the Smokey, who escapes by zooming up into the air by use of a bungee jacket. The fugitive is rescued by Smokies on hoverboards, including a leader Tally well remembers: David.Immediately, Tally and the other Cutters are on their hoverboards in a thrilling race to capture the Smokies. An extra incentive drives Tally and Shay --- their personal vendettas against their mutual old boyfriend and now enemy, David. Even with the Cutters' many advantages, however, the Smokies shock them by retaliating in unexpected ways, ultimately leaving Shay and Tally to fight the outsiders in the most primitive manner. The Smokies have the advantage in the struggle, kidnapping Shay and another Cutter and stealing the Specials' hoverboards. Tally is alone and stranded in the forest until she recovers and is soon back on the hunt.When Tally reunites with Shay and most of the other Cutters, she learns something astounding: The pills were to be delivered to one of the Crims, a troublemaking clique. That Crim is Zane, Tally's boyfriend. She is dumbfounded. Why hasn't Zane joined Tally if he's recovered?Tally and Shay visit Zane, who is still a pretty. He is also not quite right and is still damaged from the pills. However, he's helping the Crims pass out thousands of pills, resulting in a new breed of intelligent pretties. Tally asks Zane to betray his Smokey allies, and he reluctantly agrees to do it for her.While Tally still feels love for her boyfriend, she is also repelled by his disabilities. If she and Shay can help him escape, they'll all be in peril. Yet Zane may become a Special after he helps bring the Smokies down. Their mission begins with the most dangerous trick ever. Will Tally and Shay survive it --- and the consequences?Packed with action in the face of relentless danger, the stakes continue to increase with each plot twist. During Tally's quest she discovers one surprise after another, but when she arrives at her destination, she's in for the most shocking revelation ever. This page-turner dishes up thought-provoking social commentary on government, cliques, humanity, appearance and redemption --- all wrapped up in a tremendous science fiction adventure --- and is a satisfying and triumphant conclusion to this extraordinary trilogy. Highly recommended.--- Reviewed by Terry Miller Shannon"},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"Specials, the third book in the Uglies trilogy by Scott Westerfeld, offers just as much intrigue and action as the previous two installments.What if everyone in the world was pretty? What if things were more peaceful because of it? Would you conform to the norm or fight to be unique?When Tally was almost sixteen, she was ready to get her obligatory operation, just as everyone else gets at that age. She thought the world was a pretty okay place and took her surroundings and standing in stride.Then she learned that not everyone gets the surgery, some escaping to a safe haven known as the Smoke, where people look and live as naturally as possible. Forced by the authorities to visit the Smoke, Tally found herself siding with the dissenters - a decision that risked her life and the lives of those she loved.After the smoke cleared - no pun intended - Tally found herself one of the Pretties, having undergone the surgery anyway, again under the thumb of those in power. At first, she did not know any better, but once she learned of their mind-altering surgeries, she fought back, this time stronger and smarter than before.Now she is one of the Specials - stronger than she ever could have imagined, with special privileges and high-powered contacts. But at what price? Sure, she enjoys the power, the strength, the immunity - but she has been given all of these gifts from people who may not have her best intentions at heart.One thing is for sure: Tally is no longer the blissfully ignorant girl she was a few years ago. She cannot be. She can, however, attempt to right some of the wrongs she has been a part of, and, in the process, change her life and her society.Readers of Uglies and Pretties will not be disappointed. Specials delivers all that it should and more. The action sequences are packed with octane, an the writing is imaginative and descriptive. The ending of Specials will challenge readers to think, really think, about what they take for granted and what they should truly value."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"Ever since the first book(Uglies), I have loved Tally. I love how she can always be herself and escape what other people try to force her into being. They can't force her to look a certain way or be a bubblehead. She chose that on her own, to help her friend, Shay. This book, Specials, kind of made me sad. It seemed like Tally stopped caring about other people, and she did some pretty selfish things. But it was an amazing book. It shows just what society and social standards can do to people. It also shows how people can change for the better and the worst. I think this is a great book for teens."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"In \\"Specials\\", we see the final stage of the natural progression of the heroine Tally through the stages available to her: Ugly in the first novel, Pretty in the second, and now Special in the conclusion to the trilogy. Pretties undergo a mandatory surgery at 16 to become stunningly beautiful (albeit with an insidious side-effect). Specials are those Uglies and Pretties who have shown a predilection to live on the edge, and are thus recruited to become part of an elite force that ensures that the city is safe. Specials get their own surgery: their beauty becomes cruel, and their bodies become superhuman. Again, there is an insidious additional side effect to the Special surgery, which Tally discovers toward the end of the book.Tally, as a Special, is tasked with finding the Smokies that have infiltrated her city and are sharing the secret of the true goal of the Pretty surgery. In the process, she discovers that her Special surgery has made her see Zane in an entirely different, and entirely unflattering, light: she can only focus on his weakness and how her new body is in every way superior to his. She decides that Zane must also become Special, and hatches a plan to convince the Special leader that Zane too deserves the distinction. Zane succeeds, but not without a high cost.Throughout this book, we see Tally wrestle with her demons: her guilt over Zane's debilitating injuries from the previous novel, her guilt over the city's discovery of the New Smoke in the first novel, and her complex relationship with her best friend Shay that has unfolded and grown ever more messy in each novel. Her demons come together in unexpected ways. I don't think that it's fair to say that she wins the war with her demons, but they are dispensed in one way or another -- not always to Tally's benefit.Westerfeld's Pretty dystopia is anything but pretty, and presents a captivating discussion about the nature of beauty and our desire to avoid conflict. He doesn't present a neat ending where everyone lives happily ever after. Specials is a satisfying ending to the trilogy."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THE FIRST TWO BOOKS IN THE UGLIES SERIES.Specials could be one of the best books I have ever read. Having read the first two in the series, I really think this was a delightfully thrilling follow up. Not a moment of action or emotion is overlooked or labeled as \`unimportant', in all 372 pages of this immensely satisfying book. I greatly applaud Scott Westerfeld's immersion in the world that is laid out before you as the pages turn. As your eyes scan a page, a scene is set in your mind. The detail never lets you forget any aspect of the story.Tally, the main character, has gone through many a transformation. She was at first, \\"ugly\\" then to the classical \\"Pretty\\", and then finally, \\"Special\\". She has gone through more than just physical transformations though. Her brain has been tampered with, her body re-wired, and her whole sense of self, lost. She is now a member of a group known as \\"the cutters\\". A group of specials who stay \`icy' and alert by slashing their skin.This group monitors and captures runaway citizens, who fear the operation that transforms them, into something un-natural, a programmed pretty. There is now a pill that clears the legions that reside in the pretties brains. A pill that clears there mind, making them more human. But the government attempts to keep it all at bay. If the pills spread, it means rebellion, it means disobedience. But is it too late? The pills have already spread to many people, and it seems that there's a headquarters of sorts, that manufactures the pill. This time it seems bigger than the previous \\"Smoke\\". All the specials begin to fear that this new fortress might be stronger than they suspected. On top of everything, Zane, Tally's long time lover, is very sick. He is pale, and he shakes constantly. To some, this would not matter, but because Tally is special, and notices each detail, Zane has become disgusting. She loves Zane and at the same time, can't stand him. Why does Tally see Zane like this? Why is it so different when she's special?... Find out in \`Specials'.Because the book is set in the future, there are new contraptions and inventions that are introduced to you throughout the books. They are very skillfully described as if you already new these items, and as you go along, you find that somehow, you do... Everything becomes oddly familiar, as if you'd known, and used them your whole life. For instance, the hoverboard. Somehow, since it is such a big part of that book, you almost feel that when you put the book down, you could just put on some Crash Bracelets and grippy shoes, and just call up a hoverboard. With Scott Westerfelds' writing, anything seems plausible.I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure, and the wonderful world of Si-Fi. I cannot wait to read \`Extras', the next book in the Uglies series."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"Tally is now a Cutter, a special Special - designed to hunt down and take out the New Smoke, wherever it may be. However, she still has some troubles. She needs Zane, her old boyfriend, to be Special like the Cutters (so named because they cut themselves to retain \\"icy\\" clarity from the overwhelming input their new bodies and senses give them). In order to convince Special Circumstances to turn Zane Special, she and Shay devise a plan, a tricky plan, one that will change not only their lives but the entire world.I loved this book! It went along at the same fast-paced speed as Uglies: as fast as Tally's new hoverboard or as her reflexes as a Special. I couldn't put it down except when I was too tired to keep my eyes open. I wanted to know what was going to happen - was Zane going to be alright? Were Shay and Tally ever going to be reconciled? Were David and Tally ever going to be reconciled? What was going to happen to the New Smoke, to Tally's city, and to Diego (the city Tally eventually tracks old friends to)?I highly recommend this series! It has so much going on - sci-fi, dystopian fiction, a social commentary, an environmental commentary, and the list goes on. And it does it all flawlessly, in a fast-paced, high-adrenaline story you can't stop until the last page is done. I've got the next book, Extras, on hold at the library and am eagerly waiting my turn with it."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I love love love this series!!!

The whole series are definitely books worth buying!"},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"This book is hard to put down and I read it in under a week. I found this one was action packed and thought provoking in between. It is missing some of the romanticism of the first book, and also alot of the mystery. What you gain is the insight of the mind of the special which is actually really cool. Scott Westerfield also thankfully did not destroy Tally's evolving character. I am glad he didnt muck up this book in an attempt to make it like the others, although I think I needed more mystery. I think some of the anxiety / horror of the first books, where people were afraid of transformation, and fitting into different cliques is not in here. I am not sure if teens will relate as much, or anyone for that matter, but its still amazing, and if I wanted that again I could reread the first book. I would rate Specials a B, and say that its alot better than pretties, and there is really nothing bad I can say about it. Must Buy."},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"One surgery can change a life, for better or for worse.A year ago, Tally Youngblood had her first surgery, which made her a pretty, someone who has no skin flaws and never gains a pound. She just had her second surgery, which made her a Cutter, a special type of pretty with razor teeth and fingernails, ultra-lightweight indestructible bones, special eyes that have infrared vision, and special suits that camouflage themselves no matter what the surrounding environment is, and turn into armor when told. Tally greatly misses her boyfriend Zane, who was in the hospital after taking a dangerous nano pill, a pill containing millions of nano robots that ate his brain. However, when she finally gets a chance to see Zane, she is disgusted by how shaky and unlike her he is, so, along with her friend Shay, she breaks into the armory, a place where all of the rusty robotic weaponry is stored, to get a tool that cuts through Zane's orbital alloy interface collar. Tally helps Zane and his friends escape, and Zane (with some help from Tally) finds his way to New Smoke, a city that is rebelling the operation that makes you a \\"pretty\\". While Tally is in New Smoke, she is kept a prisoner for being a lethal weapon. Tally's city believes that New Smoke destroyed the armory, so they start a war, attacking New Smoke. When the primary attack is over, Tally finds Zane in the hospital after his brain rejected his replaced brain tissue. The doctors finally take Zane off of the respirator, and he dies. Tally goes back to Dr. Cable, the leader of her city, admits that she broke into the armory, and secretly injects her with a cure for being special. Tally is about to go into surgery to get \\"despecialized\\", when Dr. Cable comes and knocks out all of the doctors so that Tally, the only special pretty that hasn't been cured, can live as the last of her type.This book, while confusing at some points, was very descriptive and entertaining.There are many inventive ideas for the future in this book. The main form of transportation is hoverboarding, using magnetic grids under the cities. The Rusties, people from our time, are considered poor role models because of all of the wars that we started. Most of the Rusties died because a terrible oil bug was invented, causing everything that used oil to explode, so anyone that wasn't killed died of starvation. The standards of being pretty were so different that people had tattoos that twisted or blinked with their heartbeat, and you could change your fingernails out for televisions.All of the details in this book were very finesse. On the first page, Tally is describing how it felt to be hoverboarding and feeling the \\"brittle, freezing wind across her bare hands, and the shifting gravities of her feet against the hoverboard.\\" During the battle, there is a part that says, \\"Streams of cannon fire ripped trough the air, their traces burning across Tally's vision. Explosions battered her ears, and shock waves thudded against her chest, like someone trying to rip her open.\\"Tally's past actions come back in this book. For example, Tally had stolen Shay's boyfriend, David, before her first pretty operation. In this book, Tally and Shay work together to try to capture David and turn him into a pretty. Also, Tally was the only person who had thought her way out of being a bubblehead pretty, which helped her get out of the mindset of a special.This book was well-written and a great science-fiction novel to end the trilogy.~c. brady~"},{"Title":"Specials (Uglies Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"I was very pleased with how the trilogy turned out.

From the intimate details that discuss the life of Gaudi and all the information I received on my trip from guided tours of the Sagrada Familia, La Pedrera (Casa Mila), and Guell Park, I have an amazing appreciation for Gaudi.Also, the pictures in this book are excellent and are much more detailed than the ones that I was able to take. They make a great addition to my visual explanations of my trip.I would recommend this book if either you are going to Barcelona, or have been there.

I found it to be a fun read, something that I could pick up and put down for weeks at a time and then pick up again and read on. That is not something you can say about many books.I agree with a lot of Malachi's advice, for example about what to look for in selecting a teapot, and little details like warming the pot; and found his description and advice regarding reading tea-leaves to be interesting and helpful. Mr. McCormick is Irish, and thus speaks with more authority, and assurance, about the subject than might most Americans. The book reminds me a bit of Michael Caine: proper, wise & knowledgeable, but not without a certain humour.I only found it a bit dated because as it happens I do drink loose tea also, and there are a lot more good sources now than there were when the book was published. So most of my favorites aren't in there, at least one of the ones he recommends I find to be mostly too weak, and the others I am definitely going to try out.There are recipes, which I will probably not make, but I can wish I would, like scones and tea brack. There is some history of tea in the front of the book. All in all, there is an amazingly large amount of information packed in this slim (80-page) volume, yet the pages are fair and have a generous amount of white space.It is a pleasant book, highly recommended for the gift basket or personal treat."},{"Title":"A Decent Cup Of Tea","review":"This charming little out of print book by Malachi McCormick will find a place in the heart of all those who love the almost magical world of tea, and the men who have labored to bring us better and better teas."},{"Title":"A Decent Cup Of Tea","review":"I found this informative little volume full of wit and charm.

My only complaint is that art of the Middle East does not include Egypt at all and there are plenty of Bedouin craft traditions still practiced though to a lesser extent. Covering so much territory however, does not allow for a wider coverage. However, it is well written, with some better known contemporary artists featured as well as local art traditions that are less well known. Abby Remer's book is a must have for art historians to supplement discussions regarding women artists, non-western art, women's studies, etc. Highly recommend this well illustrated book."},{"Title":"Interzones","review":"Nowadays, most of us would assume some (and I stress, some) people may turn up their noses to interracial couplings or encourage their children not to partake of it, Little would most of us realize that the government and various police departments were actively engaged in keeping people of different races from getting sexually or romantically involved with each other. Well, just like now, the couple that reaps the greatest wrath is that of a black man and a white woman. Here, Dr. Mumford shows that in the 1920s, demarcated areas of large cities became places where the races mixed surreptitiously, just as others would drink alcohol during Prohibition or engage in any other stigmatized practice.I enjoyed hearing of my hometown of Chicago in the same breath as New York City. Usually, academics focus on the latter and forget the former. This book was a breath of fresh air which reminded me that there was a long period when Chi-Town was the Second City. Dr. Mumford states that other cities, such as Cleveland and Detroit, had interzones. Graduate students in those localities may want to use this book to write their own specific research in this area.Even though this book covers sexual activities, it is far from sexy and that will disappoint many. This text does not give juicy accounts of people from 100 years ago talking about their own interracial sex lives. Instead, it is filled with quotes from police investigators discussing this activity. If you got a kick out of seeing the film \\"Mandingo\\" or reading about Malcolm Little's exploits \\"across the color line,\\" you will find nothing that titillating here.Dr. Mumford asserts that anti-vice advocates suppressed white prostitution and thus prostitution became a whiteman-blackwoman activity. This is not surprising since this sexual coupling was common before the Emancipation Proclamation. However, there are many racist people that would not hold company with blacks. Dr. Mumford suggests that white clients were more than happy to contract black prostitutes, but I imagine that in the pre-Civil Rights era, many clients would have said, \\"If I can't get a white woman, then I don't want anybody at all.\\" Dr. Mumford mentions that the Cotton Club had black entertainers and white audiences, but refused to allow black audiences inside. I wonder if the same dynamic happened in these interzones. Did white men go to brothels in black neighborhoods, but still in pursuit of white sex workers?Dr. Mumford actually discuss venues where Asian men danced with white women before talking of black-white couplings. Thus, he breaks the black-white binary that many Latino and Asian academics lament. However, he never mentions whether these brideless Asian men could have or tried to connect with African-American women. Other academics have noted that in California Asian Indian men married Mexicanas when their were no Asian women around to marry. Did the same thing happen in Chicago and NYC? Why does the author ignore the potential dynamic between groups of color?Dr. Mumford states that he is biracial and wants this book to be a source of strength for other biracial persons in America. While an admirable goal, I highly doubt this book would make biracial readers happy because it says nothing about happy mixed couples raising children with positive identities in a supportive community. This book was all about authorities trying to break up mixed couples and mixed couples usually getting together for X-rated activities or failing to be allowed to marry. While we grow from learning the tragedies of the past, reading of that past can be a bitter pill to swallow.Dr. Mumford includes a chapter on gay dynamics in these interzones. Gay studies enthusiasts may really want to peep this chapter. Dr. Mumford cites John D'Emilio, Jeffrey Weeks, and other gay studies experts. It truly shows how their founding work has influenced many aspects of the study of sexuality. Still, I found the gay chapter to be a bit cluttered.The back cover states that Dr. Mumford is an independent scholar who lives in Madison, Wisconsin. Any college should jump at the chance to hire this author, especially UW at Madison, given it lack of racial diversity and its controversies surrounding it. They would be foolish not to hire him for a tenure-track position immediately. In fact, any college in or around New York City or Chicago would greatly benefit by having such a rigorous and promising scholar in their history department. A guy this sharp who can write a book this strong should not be just floating out in the wind.Dr. Mumford's book mostly move chronologically, then, near the end of the book, he mentions \\"Birth of a Nation,\\" a film made in 1915, not the Roaring Twenties. This non-linear move doesn't make sense. I also thought the conclusory chapter was irrelevant. Dr. Mumford moves from police reports to theater to more police reports to a film. This vacillating between life and art may bother some readers, especially hardcore historians. However, since I think art influences life and culture heavily, I did not have a problem with it."},{"Title":"Headwind","review":"I've read all of John Nance's books but this is his best so far. I'm not a pilot so if he missed some of the technical stuff it escaped me but I know that I hated to put it down. Seldom does a book force me to take a deep breath to release the tension but this one certainly did. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a suspenseful read."},{"Title":"Headwind","review":"The most enjoyable book I've read in months. While you want to beleve in the president, doubts are always there. Not until the last pages do these change. As an action book it is not the greatest, but the tension in the plot keeps you right there til the end."},{"Title":"Headwind","review":"I enjoyed the book, as I have all of Nance's books. One big question kept me haunted me all through the book though. Wouldn't a former US President travel on a diplomatic passport? If so, the whole premise of the book collapses. Generally speaking this book stretched the limits of the real world more than is typical of Nance's books."},{"Title":"Headwind","review":"A top international lawyer is hired by the Peruvian president to arrest the former president-for tortures committed in Peru-when the plane arrives in Athens. The captain of the European carrier that is carrying the ex-president has different ideas and will do what ever is possible to keep this from happening. While flying all over Europe to evade this legitimate warrant for arrest, the reader is treated to some suspenseful reading and some interesting cat and mouse ploys. This is a fast paced action thriller with some political overtones. Most of the action and descriptions seem to come from a knowledgeable pilot/author, but I truly must question one glaring error I noticed in the book that a pilot would never make. Squawk 266.....9? A nine? In a squawk? Not likely Mr. Nance.Overall great entertainment."},{"Title":"Headwind","review":"As always, the book moves at a very fast pace. Believable, too, that this could happen. He takes you off very quickly, then there were a couple of places where it bogged down. I re-read Blackout several times...couldn't put it down. Not quite the same with this book. For an &quot;airplane mystery&quot;, I doubt you'd find a better writer."},{"Title":"Headwind","review":"I have read and enjoyed Nance's previous books, his knowledge of the aircraft industry has contributed greatly to his writing. However this book is trashy. The premise is so weak and the political plot line so boring, that I could not finish the book. I hope Nance regains his style before writing any more books."},{"Title":"Headwind","review":"After giving a speech on world hunger, retired President John Harris flies from Istanbul to Rome with a stop in Athens. However, at the airport, the Greek police try to serve an international warrant filed by the head of Peru against the former President insisting he violated the Treaty Against Torture while in office by sanctioning CIA acts of violence against innocent people. Pilot Craig Dayton realizes the former President is in danger and makes a daring unauthorized take-off before the police arrest Harris.International lawyer, Sir William Stuart Campbell represents the Peruvian government in the World Court. William has a personal grudge against John and goes all out to nail the former world leader. The pilot, the president, and his attorney seek a nation that will provide a safe and fair hearing, not yet realizing the drama that will unfold when they select that country.As action thrillers go, John J. Nance typically writes some of the genre's best works. His setting of an airplane for his story line produces chills even for those readers who enjoy flying. For those who fear the air the background provides tremors. The characters including the President, are three dimensional and complex adding to the feel of a thriller. HEADWIND is top gun material and sure to place Mr. Nance on all the best-selling lists.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Headwind","review":"Using the real-life Augusto Pinochet extradition case as a seed for an imaginative plot-line, John J Nance has penned the perfect light-on-the-grey-matter combo legal/political/techno-thriller for you to take along on your next flight over the big pond!Former US President, John Harris, has been charged by the Peruvian government under a recently ratified treaty - the International Treaty Against Torture - with authorizing the cold-blooded murder of hundreds of civilians during a CIA raid on a Peruvian drug factory. British lawyer, Sir William Stuart Campbell, who has been hired to represent the Peruvian government, makes his first attempt to execute an arrest warrant for Harris as he sits aboard a Boeing 737 about to take off from Athens. When Captain Craig Drayton learns of the legal process that is about to take place on his aircraft, he quickly reaches the emotional and patriotic decision that the charges couldn't possibly be anything other than a bogus attempt to kidnap and ultimately execute the former president, as well as embarrass the US government. Faking a hijacking attempt, he rolls his plane, takes off with the former president and a full load of passengers who have no idea of the perilous adventure in which they are now embroiled.When Harris asks his friend and former law partner, Jay Reinhart, to represent him in the ensuing legal battle, he also advises him that the plane, ostensibly en route to Rome, effectively has nowhere to land that wouldn't endanger Harris' safety! Campbell, a brilliant barrister and legal strategist, has filed a warrant at virtually every airport in Europe. The only obvious escape route is to land at an American Air Force Base in Europe, spirit the former President aboard a US jet and run like a scared rabbit for the safety of US home turf! But the sitting president refuses to condone that particular rescue because of the enormous political fallout that would certainly result! The entire world would recognize that the US signature on the International Treaty Against Torture was absolutely meaningless!When a secretly recorded video surfaces that clearly films Harris authorizing the black-op that would kill the innocent civilians during the execution of the raid, the problem is no longer how to save a former President from legalized assassination by a kangaroo court in Peru! Now the question revolves around Harris' guilt and whether the US government should force Drayton to deliver Harris into the hands of the Peruvian government for a legitimate trial.From the standpoint of a Canadian reader, the patriotism and flag-waving is typical, blustery US jingoism and, at least in my opinion, is outrageously overdone. That a senior airline pilot would unilaterally reach the decision to endanger his own life, his plane, his crew and a full load of passengers to save a former US president from a dubious legal process is more than a bit of a credibility stretch. BUT, that said, Nance does a fine job with the plot and the legal process on an international stage. It's a compelling page-turner in which I found myself fully absorbed despite my misgivings at the likelihood of such a series of events. Unlike many thrillers, Nance even takes time to develop his characters and make them considerably more life-like than the typical cardboard cutout heroes of many of today's thrillers.With a minor suspension of credibility, \\"Headwind\\" is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"Headwind","review":"I made it as far as I can - chapter 31.But I just can't take the excruciatingly pedestrian writing style, the shallow, stereotypical characters, and the inaccurate, out-of-place aviation references sprinkled throughout. I put a lot of blame for this waste of paper on his editor/publisher. This book should never have been released.I don't know if this is Nance's first book, but he is NOT a good writer. Indeed, he would be an average writer for the High School level. Granted, he's got a great idea - very intriguing. But (and let this be a lesson to you future writers out there) sometimes you need to let someone who has actual writing talent take your great idea and go with it.This is what Mr. Nance should have done."},{"Title":"Headwind","review":"I have to admit I have bought different kinds of books looking for a good story. About halfway into a novel, I get bored or uninterested and end up not finishing it. \\"Headwind\\" is the first novel that I read till the end. I even read this in less than a week. The pacing was fast from start to finish. Each chapter added more to the original plot.The story itself is about a former president being charged with criminal acts by another government. The former president is protected by a rogue airline captain that performs some dangerous manuevers on his 737, in order to prevent the unjustice capture of the former president. In the midst of it all, the former president hires a trustworthy lawyer that he knew in the past to go against a determined international lawyer, bent on capturing the former president, and try to find answers.The novel can be described as an exciting aviation adventure, as well as a great courtroom drama. There is only one thing bad about the novel and that is the unnecessary romance. That's why I gave this novel only four stars. It is not needed and slows down the action, but not by much. But after reading other John Nance books, I change my mind and give this 5 stars because it is one of the plausible of his books.John J. Nance has shown me that not all books are bad. I will end up reading some more of his novels, starting next with Pandora's Clock. I recommend this novel to anyone looking for great entertainment other than a movie, even though this book felt like I was watching a movie. Exciting book overall!!!"},{"Title":"Headwind","review":"I'm usually a big fan of this author and his work, but there was just something about this one that didn't do it for me.A lot of times I felt like Mr. Nance is writing novels simply to show off his aviation knowledge. Yes, he's an expert, but I'm not and it's very confusing to try to follow a story where so much of it is wrapped up in technical talk. Trying to follow the storyline up in the airplane was next to impossible."},{"Title":"Headwind","review":"If you like a book that is low taxing on the brain then this is for you. Basically, we are dealing with a Jack Bauer type pilot flying all around the place to protect an ex-president. There just happens to be a tour group of ex-marines on board and some of the dialogue that is spouted out to protect their former commander-in-chief just makes you cringe. Also, the interaction between the pilot and co-pilot (who is portrayed as an English twit) is truly awful.Our legal \`mastermind' that is hired by the ex-president spots problems in the case that everyone else conveniently misses (this is not a spoiler!). A very poor conclusion to a case that supposedly had dozens of layers working on it.One line from the book mentions a lawyer from Ireland and says about him that \\"he doesn't drink, not even Guinness\\". This is one of the most idiotic sentences that I've ever read in a book.This book was sold without any quotes of recommendation on the cover from newspaper critics. After reading the book, it's easy to see why. Do yourself a favour and avoid this book."},{"Title":"Headwind","review":"OK. Let's get the biases right up front. I am a pilot, a lawyer and I have an interest in politics and current events. So naturally I am going to give five stars to a book that deals with all four, right? Not so fast, Pilgrim.Mr. Nance has earned his rating with this novel which details the efforts of the President of Peru to arrest and extradite a former United States President under the Treaty Against Torture (the same treaty that Chilean ex-President Pinochet recently dealt with). The story takes us from Greece to Sicily to London to Belfast and to Galway as well as from Laramie, Wyoming to Denver, Colorado on a ride in a Cessna Skyhawk that none of us would want to have been on. The international flying is an odyssey of the finest kind as the captain of the German commercial airline's 737, a US Air Force Reserve Officer, tries to keep his former Commander in Chief from being arrested much to the chagrin of his British First Officer who sees their jobs evaporating with each new escapade.Add to the excellent flying portion of the story, a chess game on the ground between two international lawyers with very different backgrounds and the story only gets better.The Peruvian government has hired a British Barrister who is tops in his field. The American ex-president hires a former partner, who while once a very able international lawyer, has had a bit of a time of it lately, having been disbarred as a Judge and suspended as a lawyer and is waiting out his suspension teaching classes at the University of Wyoming when the call comes.The Peruvian government seems to have irrefutable evidence of the crimes of the former president and therein lies more twists and turns in this most compelling novel.The characters are well drawn, the dialogue flows smoothly and the story moves seamlessly across the pages of the book until, alas, you are at the end. Looking for a page turner? Look no further."},{"Title":"Headwind","review":"Craig Dayton is the American pilot of a German 737 passenger jet. After boarding travelers in Athens for a flight to Rome, Craig is faced with the Greek police who want to arrest one of his First Class passengers, John Harris, a former President of the United States. Harris is wanted on an Interpol warrant initiated by the Peruvian government. Peru charges that Harris, in violation of an international treaty against torture, sanctioned atrocities that occurred during a CIA-sponsored raid on a Peruvian heroin factory during the Harris Administration. As a former U.S. Air Force pilot now in the reserves, Dayton's instinct to protect a former Commander-in-Chief takes over, and he backs his jet away from the gate, overturning a loaded baggage tram in the process, and vamooses out of Dodge, so to speak. Thus begins a chase across Europe, Harris in the 737 pursued by the Lear carrying Stuart Campbell, the international lawyer retained by Peru to bring the fugitive to bay.HEADWIND is an engrossing read if one accepts the shaky premise that an American pilot, sufficiently dedicated to guard the welfare of an ex-President, would also be enough of a cowboy to endanger his job, his crew, and the 118 paying passengers aboard his plane. To a certain degree, Dayton is a hero of the plot, though a bigger one is Jay Reinhart, a friend of the ex-President's and an expert in international law, whom Harris retains as his attorney. Jay, a former Texas District Judge, has recently been reinstated to the bar after having suffered a suspension for falling in love with a female defendant on trial in his court for murder. In any case, Jay now has to scramble from his Wyoming hideaway to Europe where the chase is on.Author John Nance does a swell job alternating the action between foreign courtrooms and the 737's flight deck, and there's sufficient tension, especially in the latter, for me to have gnawed away the edges of my expensive manicure. (Darn! Where's that emery board?) And all the while there's the question, \\"Is Harris really innocent of the charges?\\" After all, there's that pesky videotape.Although the ending is cloyingly happy as all loose ends are tidied up - a pet peeve of mine, HEADWIND is the perfect thriller for your next plane flight. If you're going roundtrip coast to coast, you'll finish before you touch down on the home leg. Check to see if any of our ex-Presidents are in First Class as you board, and yell \\"Hey, Bubba!\\" if you see Bill."},{"Title":"Headwind","review":"A man without a country - that's what a former United States President has become during an innocent trip to Europe. An international arrest warrant has been issued against former President John Harris for alleged crimes that he is said to have committed during his tenure in office. Peru claims President Harris ordered a CIA-backed attack of a biological weapons factory that resulted in the deaths and carnage of Peruvian lives. Under the same international treaty that foiled Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet into a long detainment in England, Peru wants the former U.S. President arrested and extradited to Peru to stand trial.The former President is on board a German commercial airline, en route to Rome, when he learns of his legal problems. Since most of the free world has signed the treaty, including the United States, it seems as though there is no place to run to. But the former President has friends in all the right places, including the cockpit, whose captain is a U.S. Air Force reservist who has strong feelings and loyalties about defending a U.S. President, active or otherwise.The hunt for a safe haven, while on board a jetliner, makes for a fast-paced and exciting drama that is irresistible to put down. The velocity quickens, and even the headwinds build, until the plane takes the former President to his final destination.This is a breakout novel of sorts for author John Nance as it has less to do about aviation, (as his fantastic previous airborne thrillers are), and more to do about the human, political and legal ironies of our times. There are a couple of courtroom dramas that bar none, as well as insightful forays into the decision processes of the Oval Office and 10 Downing Street, both of which give new meaning to the definition of leadership. This is pure adrenaline from takeoff to landing, and author John Nance at his very best."},{"Title":"Headwind","review":"Headwind is impossible to put down after the first page.

Peru is claiming that a CIA operation resulted in the murder of hundreds of innocent civilians and was santioned by then President Harris.

The legal battle is finally fought in Ireland with a wonderful series of legal manuevers [...]Read the book for the rest of the story. The characters are well developed, the dialogue is believable, and the landings are incredibly suspenseful."},{"Title":"Headwind","review":"John Nance's theme is thrillers about or occurring on airplanes. In Headwind, his latest, the airplane action is less interesting that what happens on the ground, but the story is arresting anyway. Former US president John Harris is traveling on a commercial flight that makes a stopover at Athens (Greece). Just before departure, the captain is informed that he must delay to allow police who are on their way to arrive and arrest one of his passengers-the former president. The captain-a US national, Air Force reserve officer who is master of a German-flagged commercial flight-doesn't like the way that sounds and fakes an emergency so that he can take off and continue to Rome. What he doesn't know is that the Italian police are also waiting to serve an international warrant on the former president, and police are on standby in nearly every European nation! In the 1980's, in an effort to be able to punish human rights violations by dictators, most nations signed a treaty that made the infliction of torture by any official in a country a &quot;borderless&quot; crime. In other words, a warrant could be taken out by people in one country and served on a citizen of a second country while in a third country-and extraditions treaties would not apply. This is the treaty that was employed for a Spanish court to claim jurisdiction to try former Chilean ruler Pinochet and to have him arrested in England. That actual case dragged on for quite some time and was finally moot because of Pinochet's age and health. In the novel, it seems that the current dictator of Peru had a brother who was killed in a terrorist raid on a drug processing plan some years ago. The claim is that the raid, which included the torture of women and children who were there, was a covert CIA action sanctioned by then President Harris. The dictator's avowed purpose is to take Harris to Peru, give him a trial, and execute him. The treaty would allow him to do that. The principal characters are the airline captain and a &quot;defrocked&quot; judge who has just been readmitted to practice law. The former judge was a junior partner in the former president's law firm years ago, and is the one person Harris wants to help him now. This, of course, drives the US State Department crazy. The story line is good, the characters are interesting, and the novel is a good, solid read. Reader will enjoy some good barbs thrown at bureaucrats, learn something about international law, and learn a lot more than they probably want to about the fuel problems of flying a Boeing 737 from Ireland to the United States."},{"Title":"Headwind","review":"It's super great for a light read!!!

[This part of the story was exciting and lived up to Nance's expected and well written prose.]The ex-president hires a former associate that was defrocked as a judge and is now teaching at a law school in Laramie, Wyoming - this lawyer while doing internet research is also contacting legal firms in foreign countries to determine where he should have the plane land - the plane lands at several airports to quickly find out that they are going to ship the ex-president direct to Peru - there is a lot of subterfuge going on to keep the authorities and Peru's international attorney at bay - has the airplane been high-jacked? - has it crashed? - did the ex-president slip away? - finally the lawyer who is afraid to fly arrives in Europe and then . . .This may be a five star read for you as you may like the soft ending.

Every aspect of this book has been thoroughly researched in order to make this a realistic courtroom drama. Nance knows how to attract reader interest with his novels and this one is no exception.

I recommend reading some of his other stuff before this one.Yes, Mr. Nance has a great knowledge of aviation, and is able to demonstrate that, this just isn't his best showing.Also, as I have come to really appreciate the number of starts a book has as a gage of whether to pick up a book or not, I feel as if the 4.5 stars this title currently has is over rated.Thanks, MR"},{"Title":"Headwind","review":"Although the plot for this book does not seem exceptionaly strong, John J. Nance's passion for the subject matter comes through in this suspenseful and intriguing thriller. The legal aspect of this book basically comes from the Pinochet extradition law which the U. S. helped to sponsor and is now being turned against them. (There is an underlying message here about the best intentions don't always make the best laws.) As a pilot and a licensed aerospace attorney Mr. Nance's knowledge and passion for both of these subjects communicates itself throughout this book. Filled with wonderful aeronautic and legal details this book is a marevelous combination of Martin Caidin and John Grisham. If you are looking for a thriller that has decent characters, and well-detailed and interesting plot developments then you should enjoy this book. However you should be warned if you have a fear of flying than you may not want to read the author's description of flying a Cessna into a thunderstorm-one of the better sequences I have read in any novel in a while."},{"Title":"Headwind","review":"Nance's book \`Headwinds' is multifaceted. When you open the pages of a book like this you should not be expecting to encounter the next James Joyce or Pynchon, so its kind of silly to judge Headwinds against real literature. What is appropriate on the other hand is to judge it against Hollywood films or other genre stories of a similar nature. In my opinion, Hollywood films are synonymous with cliches and plots that you haven't encountered just once or twice, but hundreds and hundreds of times before. Often the characters are 2 dimensional which allows for the viewer, or in this case reader, to apply whatever characteristics they wish to upon the protagonists. Nance does all of that here.Headwind accomplishes all that you would expect from a military/thriller, no new ideas, no new slight takes on character development, and a story arc that you %100 know already. Nance is no Hemmingway. He pulls together three primary first person accounts; a pilot (brave and patriotic), a former president (%100 riotous and good), and a lawyer (the greatest legal mind of our time, but lacking in that he was suspended for serious legal errors while on the bench). None of these characters are tested really, even though the whole book is a test on character, because they have nowhere to go... they are already the greatest living Americans the world has ever seen.Anyways, I am giving this book three stars because I was able to finish it and wanted to see exactly how it would be resolved. This is Nance's strength. Nance sets up a legal study on international law and fictionalizes it. This here is the saving grace of the book.Three stars might be a little generous. I feel like I have rated books I like more with less stars in the past. I would never ever recommend Headwinds to anyone. I would suggest Clancey or Mrazek (a new historical military writer that is very good)."},{"Title":"Headwind","review":"When a bogus warrant is issued for a former president of the United States under the auspices of a Torture and Terrorism treaty, you have plausible pre-September 11 scenario.There is a combination dramatic legal arguments and a globe hopping President attempting to stay one step ahead of the process servers in a chartered 737.AFter a couple of clunkers, it was good to read a well-paced and well thought out book."},{"Title":"Headwind","review":"This book is a good fairly quick read, with several interwoven plots and themes.

But seriously, this book is a big departure from the theme of Nance's past adventures, which consist mostly of flying and onboard danger, with a little bit of ground perspective of what's going on up there. What we have here is a former US President onboard an airliner while a corrupt South American president tries to have him busted for murder because one casualty of a CIA drug raid was el Presidente's drug lord brother. He then sends a high priced legal hired gun to serve the warrant. So the former US President retains his old law partner as his lawyer. As a result, a lot more of the action takes place on the ground and onboard other planes. For example, there's one tense sequence where the ex-President's lawyer engages an amateur pilot in a tiny Cessna to get him to his overseas flight that's right out of Ernest K. Gann--ice on the wings and screwed-up instruments and what have you. As one media reviewer correctly puts it, this story has as much John Grisham to it as it does of Captain Nance's earlier material. When Stephen Coonts decided to depart from his accustomed fare of Top Gun-type stuff because his fighter jock hero was getting too old for it, it didn't quite work. For Nance to broaden his material a bit, however, seems to be working."},{"Title":"Headwind","review":"This is my second Nance book (the first one being \\"Blackout\\") and I like it. I have the impression that Nance is trying to write a new niche thriller - \\"airborne legal thrillers\\"! Good effort, but certainly room for improvement. In fact with Nance's background I believe he should be able to produce a very good one next time.This is not very typical Nance's style but it is nonetheless a page-turner. For readers who have not read Nance's previous novel this one would be a starter.Keep up the good work, Nance!"},{"Title":"Headwind","review":"Once again I finish one of Nance's books within a week.

The best part about this book is that the action begins on the very first page. The pilot's are great, the women are strong, Sir William is a perfect villian, Jay is wonderful. The ex-President is probably the weakest character but he is still very good. This is a great story if you like thrillers. It was every bit as good as Pandora's Clock and if you haven't read Pandora's Clock...what are you waiting for?"},{"Title":"Headwind","review":"Like all the other Nance novels, it centers around commercial flight, but has a different type of plot than the previous ones. This one is a study in international law and politics as well. Have read all the Nance novels and have found all of them to be a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Headwind","review":"A one term President? Who is kidding who? Aside from reading a book where a politician walks away from politics, I really enjoyed this book. Nance has done a wonderful job selling the reader on ex President Harris, his character and his motives. The technical aspects of a Nance novel remain true to form and the plot moves along. As an action novel, it is light, but as a thriller, it is dead on. The sign of a good book is if you can not put it down, I found it hard to put this one down. If you like books based on political fiction, you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Headwind","review":"I'm a big fan of John Nance books but I was disappointed with Headwind. A former U.S. President is set to be arrested on an international warrant while travelling in Europe. Fast paced and interesting story premise that is ruined by the transparency of the character's actions. The story constantly ignores the ability to use other obvious and simple ways for the President to get of the problem. Also, throughtout the book the characters are constantly amazed out how other characters can anticipate their only obvious option. Sorry, but I was disappointed."},{"Title":"Headwind","review":"Headwind - yet another aviation term for John J Nance to hang on to his latest thriller.A former American President is chased on a whirlwind hunt from country to country aboard a 737 commanded by a patriotic fellow countryman. The Peruvian government is seeking the President's arrest through Interpol in response to a botched CIA raid on a Peruvian drugs factory.Our President has a choice - face certain death from a kangaroo court in Lima or take his chances with the 737 crew and try to make it back to American (or American sympathising soil)....Being a Nance novel we knew that we could count on this latest offering to have a fast-flowing plot, strong dialogue and intriguing characters caught up in fantastically detailed aeronautical situations leading to a narrowly avoided disaster of apocolyptic proportions.Wrong. Headwind fails on almost all these counts. It seems that Nance has chosen to move away from the fly low, fast, furious formula that made previous thrillers such as Final Approach, Medusa's Child and Pandora's Clock an absolutely riveting read.The characters are weak and unconvincing.We get to learn little about so many of the potentially interesting characters that crop up throughout the book. Nance literally wastes the opportunity to develop our sympathy with the President or his followers. We find the premise of extradition to Lima weak, especially given the usual global scope of a Nance novel.We learn little about the 737's commander, apart from that he is willing to have his pilot's licence revoked over a questionable hunch over his former President's status as a wanted man.The flying sequences are short, undescriptive and very, very tame in comparison to those that had us on the edge of our seat in previous Nance outings. Much of the narrative is spent in courtrooms, on telephones, in briefing rooms....This is not a Nance novel. We've come to expect spine-tingling aviation related thrillers. We want the good guys to win. We want the bad guys to buy the farm. We want 747-400's upside down in mid-air, with the good guys hanging on the tailfin.But Headwind is sadly little more a courtroom drama that gets bogged down in international legal red tape. By the end we don't care who wins, who gets extradited, who ends up in the dock or anything else. I was more worried about whether I'd left the iron on.Nance is a fantastic fiction writer. He needs to get out of the courtroom and back in the flight deck for his next outing. Leave the law to the professionals John. Write us books about planes!"},{"Title":"Headwind","review":"When Peru issues an arrest warrant for an ex-president of the United States claiming his responsibility (by proxy) for the torture and slaughter of Peruvian employees inside a biological weapons factory, it falls upon the shoulders of Pilot Craig Dayton and former Texas judge (recently re-instated from suspension international attorney) Jay Reinhart to save the day and keep the ex-president from being sent to almost certain conviction in the Peruvian courts. It's hard to decide what the focus of this novel was supposed to be. Is it a political statement concerning making national leaders responsible for the orders they issue to murder the civilians of the places they invade? Or maybe it's an observation about how legislation of any kind in any venue can be manipulated to serve the purpose of whatever villain comes along. Or maybe the purpose is to portray the ways in which lawyers really don't care whether they win or lose; what they care about is who becomes Master of the Game with the best overall legal strategy. In other words, it's all just a game of chess for sophisticated legal minds. Then again, it could be about men who have monumental egos and the women who love them. This novel had good potential with such multifaceted possibilities. Unfortunately it didn't really deliver on any of them. The characters were not very well drawn, especially the chief troublemaker, Sir Stuart Campbell. He's somewhat of a cross between Donald Trump and Johnny Cochran only without the humility. And when all of these components are set for the most part aboard a Boeing 747, it all becomes... well, rather silly."},{"Title":"Headwind","review":"I'm a big fan of John Nance books but I was disappointed with Headwind.

The first was \\"Turbulence\\"-- which I liked well enough so that, when I spotted \\"Headwind,\\" I promptly grabbed it.This book is a serious \\"page-turner\\"-- in fact, I was to eager to find out what happened that I found myself skimming many passages rather than actually reading them.Having worked for many years in law firms, I found the legal maneuverings quite convincing and fun.The characters aren't all that believable-- but then, are the characters in action-suspense novels ever really that believable? No. This is a genre in which you can't expect characters to be really true-to-life; all you can ask is that they be convincing enough to carry the story... and Nance more than meets that requirement.For a good, fast-paced, action thriller, you can't do any better.

Great storyline."},{"Title":"Headwind","review":"Reading this book was like performing a chore you'd put off for weeks. Finishing it was rewarding because all the bits and pieces scattered around the apartment in the beginning of the story were finally packed neatly away in their proper places. The politics of international law and treaties can get pretty messy.I'll admit the story was a bit drawn out and predictable, but somehow I found myself returning to its pages wanting to hear the author's tale of heroism in the cockpit and the courtroom. I learned a thing or two about both in reading this book. The author's knowledge of aviation is what gave this flight the tailwind needed to reach its destination safely.

Now, because there is an international treaty against torture, Peru has issued an international arrest warrant for former President Harris and it's Interpol's duty to enforce it.Dayton doesn't have any intention of turning Harris over to the Greek authorities or anyone else. He takes matters into his own hands, backs the plane away from the gate and takes off on an unused runway without clearance.

The hero is a young American on vacation in his mother's home country of Lutha. He hopes to find some good game hunting. Instead, he is mistaken for an escaped king who has been deemed crazy by his wicked uncle who is serving as the Regent. Entertaining folly persues as he is captured and locked up instead of the missing king. As in many of ERB's stories, the hero is strong and virtuous and a hardy fighter who falls in love with a beautiful and worthy maiden. The story is very charming and adventurous with many surprises.I know it is hard to believe, but not only is this story a page turner, but there is no foul lauguage and the hero always acts in an honorable fashion. Today's authors could learn from ERB."},{"Title":"The Mad King","review":"An exciting romance adventure involving royalty and conspiracy and more twists than a corkscrew.

There are so many twist and turns. I am an older woman, but I think this is a GREAT adventure book for a boy!!"},{"Title":"The Mad King","review":"Outstanding read for fun and humor nonf of which is lost in a book over 86 years old. The only book he wrote which is better is the first Tarzan book."},{"Title":"The Mad King","review":"Edgar Rice Burroughs excelled in authoring fantastic flights of fancy, and, while THE MAD KING isn't considered a classic in the same vein as his Tarzan and Barsoom series, it's still very much crafted in the patented pulp-adventure Burroughs style and, as such, deserves a read. Honestly, I can't recall a boring book that this man has written; ERB's prolific imagination still impresses (although, with this one, he does a bit of lifting from other authors).THE MAD KING's plot: Barney Custer of Beatrice, Nebraska is vacationing in Lutha, his mother's beloved European homeland, when he rescues a beautiful woman on a runaway horse. The woman he saves is Emma von der Tann, a princess who is betrothed to Leopold the \\"mad king.\\" For the past decade, Leopold had been kept in the custody of his scheming uncle and currently regent of Lutha, Peter of Blentz. Except that the mad king had just escaped.Although wanted posters throughout Lutha proclaim Leopold's madness, this malady was an invention of the ambitious regent's, who himself seeks to ascend the throne. A similarity in appearance and playful words by Custer lead Princess Emma to believe that he, in fact, is Leopold of Lutha. Barney spends most of the book's first part denying that he is the king, but to little avail. This case of mistaken identity propels him to many harrowing adventures in Lutha as he chooses to fight to save a princess and regain the throne for the rightful monarch.While ERB's plot borrows heavily from the pages of THE PRISONER OF ZENDA and even a bit from THE PRINCE AND THE PAUPER, he makes the premise his own with the infusion of his inimitable sense of romance and high spirited adventure. ERB's heroes are pure and noble, with no vaccilating towards the gray area, like much of our cynical, modern anti-heroes. Nowadays, these old-school types of protagonist are outdated and maybe even unrealistic. But it's still nice to hearken back to the pulpy golden age once in a while.First published, respectively, in 1914 (All-Story Weekly magazine) and in 1915 (Blue Book magazine), the Balkan exploits of Mr. Custer are narrated in two serials, the first being titled THE MAD KING, with the concluding part comprising of the serial, BARNEY CUSTER OF BEATRICE, which chronicles Barney's return to Lutha after two years away. This second installment, by the way, is somewhat colored with World War I implications, which might be of interest for readers with a historical bent. The Ace Books edition I own is also graced with a Frank Frazetta cover (sadly, not as good as his Conan covers). And for those who want to read more about the Custer family, ERB's THE ETERNAL SAVAGE (aka THE ETERNAL LOVER) tells a strange tale of reincarnation, involving Barney's sister, Victoria Custer, whose story begins at the African ranch of a certain John Clayton. Barney is in this book as a supporting character.As mentioned, THE MAD KING isn't one of Burrough's all-time bests. But ERB completists will want to check this one out, as will also the more casual pulp magazine reader. This author may not have been the most celebrated of writers but, much like Robert E. Howard, he plied his trade with an infectious enthusiasm and remained true to his fans, giving them what they craved for his entire career. And, besides, there's only so much Austen or Dickens I can read before I start yearning for yarns with rousing, blood and guts derring-do. In that area, Edgar Rice Burroughs is without peer. 3.5 out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Mad King","review":"I have always been a fan of Egdar Rice Burroughs and have read many of his series, but I had never run across this one. Since it was a Kindle Freebie, I decided to give it a try. It turned out to be very enjoyable.This novel is set somewhere in a small kingdom in Europe, where an American is confused with a King that has just escaped from an insane asylum. This has all of the main things one would look for in a pulp novel; romance, action, battles, intrigue, and a nearly perfect hero that gets into and out of some very sticky situations.This is not great literature, but makes for fun, light reading. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Mad King","review":"Building up my library so no time to read-then-review but looks good at first glance.

Indeed these \\"Threads\\" spell out much more than the one metaphor. The threads of Yakov Azriel invoke a wide range of religious and cultural Jewish sources and genres. His subjects are not only Biblical, but vividly so, exponentially so, as Azriel enriches his words with Jewish imagery. All of Torah can be found in almost every poem. And that means all of life"},{"Title":"Threads from a Coat of Many Colors: Poems on Genesis","review":"The first book of the Bible, Genesis is one which has inspired worlds of literature and commentary. In \`Threads from a Coat of Many Colors' Yakov Azriel writes poems of commentary on \`Genesis.' These poems seem to make use of all the contemporary learning Azriel has, instilling the text with new meaning.Here are the closing two stanzas from the poem,' Photosynthesis' a commentary on Genesis 1. 11 on the creation of the vegetative world.\\"When I look into myself,Water's no problem,And plenty of hot air and dirt,But where is the cholorophyllThat can captureThe LightThat infiltrates, invades, pervades and surrounds me?To photosynthesizeThe chlorophyll of TorahWill grant you a gardener's green thumbSo that whatever you touchGrows sacred green\\"Was this my imagination?Or did the leavens on the bushes whisper their secret to me?Azriel knows the Biblical text well, and has a rich imagination. And it is a relief to read a poet who does not scream out the pleasures of Nihilism, or confine himself to some minor empty corner of his own psyche. Azriel's poetry gives pleasure in that it provides a certain knowledge, a certain information about the worlds he is talking about. His concerns and questions are real ones. And he does not provide dogmatic solutions, but rather writes out of a religious faith, which is both real and yet questioning of itself.He often imagines himself into the heart of the Biblical character and extends the story in new ways.And one senses throughout the book that there a world of religious values informing it, an intelligence that believes in goodness and truth and beauty.In some ways the poems though more complex and ambitious remind me of the poetry of the late Jerusalem poet Abe Weiss, whose special goodness and faith in Israel gave his poetry a simple strength."},{"Title":"Threads from a Coat of Many Colors: Poems on Genesis","review":"Threads from a Coat of Many Colors by Yakov AzrielIn this first of a series of poetry books based on the Torah, Yakov Azriel brings us the contemporary voice of a religious poet and the spiritual insight of a true lover of the Bible. He begins, for example, \\"In the Beginning\\" with a creative account of the Creation in such lines as:\\"The light emanating from the nameOf God, hidden and hiding inWorlds within words, breaks out to shine.\\"Likewise, \\"Let There Be light\\" shimmers with poetic descriptions, \\"As red/ As supernovas...\\" and \\"As Blue/ As Jerusalem's summer skies,\\" while \\"Somewhere Between the Waves and the Winds\\" rolls through Genesis 1 and reveals how \\"The waters gush and churn/ Brewing a thick broth of amino acids.\\" Later, the poets poses \\"Questions for Eve,\\" asking \\"Why did you talk to the serpent?/ Don't you know that even then he was planning the gas chambers,/ Blueprinting the crematoria?\\"This pattern of questioning, imagining, and identifying with Bible peoples of all kinds effectively continues throughout the book, flowing through free verse, sonnets, ballads or hymns while occasionally echoing the Song of Solomon. If the publisher had not sent a review copy at my request, I would have been eager to buy it! Surely, avid readers of the Bible and of poetry will also come away refreshed and, perhaps, ready to see what God has to say to us as we, too, revisit familiar stories in the living word that still speaks to us today."},{"Title":"Threads from a Coat of Many Colors: Poems on Genesis","review":"A good poem may take the reader to a different time, or may bring a character from a different time to the present. Azriel's best poems do both. Starting with the creation \\"Do you wish to know how light, can find a voice and sing\\", many of the Genesis stories are included. By giving a modern voice to \\"Ancient\\" names, we can begin to understand how they feel, or give new perspectives to events in our own time. For example in 'Question for Eve\\", \\"In the camps / In the predawn Polish cold? / You cloth yourself in the luxury of fig leaves ....\\" A poet picks what stores to include, and here there is even a poem about Zebulum (Jacob and Leahs 6th son). Voice is given to many of the important women, \\"My Dinah\\" gives voices to the family after the rape of Dinah. It us surprising to me that some of Genesis richer stores like the Binding of Isaac or Jacob's wrestling in the night are not further explored."},{"Title":"Threads from a Coat of Many Colors: Poems on Genesis","review":"Yakov Azriel's lyrical re-creation of Biblical stories, woven with rich imagistic detail, pulls the reader into the Biblical landscape, magnetizing him to the Biblical scene. Familiar Biblical characters spring to life on Azriel's colorful canvases replete with olive trees and Mediterranean sun.Threads from a Coat of Many Colors is a must (re-)read for every lover of true poetry, the Bible and mysticism."},{"Title":"Threads from a Coat of Many Colors: Poems on Genesis","review":"Yakov Azriel is an award winning poet who lives in Israel. This first full length book is a shining example of why his tenderly crafted work wins awards. As he leads readers step by step through the book of Genesis, God's words and covenants come to life in human form. And yet, it isn't necessarythat we be Jewish, Christian, or religious to appreciate Azriel's poetry. His blending of modern day humanity with the ancient historical icons of Genesis is that skillful.Scriptures from Genesis introduce each poem, starting with the Creation and ending with Joseph's Coat of Many Colors. Each poem, regardless of topic, melds the modern with the historical in insightful ways. Consider, for example, this excerpt from \\"Questions for Eve\\":Why did you talk to the serpent?Don't you know that even then he was planning the gas chambers,Blueprinting the crematoria?How can a mother be so naieve?Snakes devourDust, like the cinderOf children belched from the chimneys.Lucky you -- only one son will be murdered.Azriel uses various poetic forms, from formal rhyme to free verse to haunting metaphor as he shares the Song of Songs and the Generations of Jacob. One of the most chilling works in this book, and ultimately the most glorious, is \\"As the Stars, As the Sand\\", based on God's promise to ancient Israel in Genesis 22:17: \\"For I will surely bless you and surely multiply your seed, as the stars of the heavens and as the sand on the sea-shore.\\"Threads From a Coat of Many Colors is a wistful paean, a universal spirit prayer carried on hot desert winds.

All of his books are heartfelt, compassionate, richly illustrated, and can bridge the gap among all races; he was doing the multicultural thing well before it was &quot;multicultural&quot;ly defined and politically correct. Stevie fits in with our current PC climate without coming off as trendy and purposeful. It simply tells a tale of a young boy, Stevie, who is sent to stay with an older boy and his family while Stevie's mother works at her new job. The older boy, Robert, resents the intrusion of Stevie in his life. Always tagging along, getting footprints on the bedcovers, and acting &quot;like a baby&quot; to Robert's mother, Stevie is the classic irritating but innocent little brother who, in the end will be sorely missed by Robert when Stevie's mother finally comes to take him back home with her. As a young white reader who grew up in a very white world, this book, about two African-American boys, was always my very favorite children's book not only because of the stunning illustration, but because of the commonality and familiarity this book held with me: it could have easily been my story. And it could have been any story for any child anywhere. I loved the fact that it was introduced at a time when race relations needed bridging and commonalities needed awareness. It is a book for the ages."},{"Title":"Stevie","review":"I'm 33 years old, and my parents never took in foster children.

Perhaps it wasn't as common where I grew up because most of the families were stable? Perhaps family means more to some people than others?STEVIE is a simple book about a boy (possibly 10) whose mother takes in a 5 year old during the week. Robert doesn't know why, and it doesn't say in the story. We only see his perspective, and that's the best thing about it. All we see are the things that Robert wonders about; why the boy is \\"babyish,\\" why he's called \\"Stevie,\\" why he didn't bring any of his own stuff, etc.Foster care is a major part of life in some communities.

By grouping and order I mean the major manufacturers and either chronologically by number or even by date of patent, design or manufacture date. Or even the design groupings.

Now, as a 44 year old, I thought I would reread this book to take a stroll down memory lane. I wasn't disappointed. This story of the Brooklyn Dodgers in the late 1930's is the sequel to The Kid from Tomkinsvile. The &quot;Kid&quot; chonicles the season that leads up to the World Series and this book disects the seven game classic against the Indians. At eleven, I cheered and cried for the heroes in the story; and at 44 I did the same. This is a wonderful book, and a great look back into time, for any young boy or girl."},{"Title":"World Series","review":"In some ways, this is an even better read than &quot;The Kid From Tomkinsville&quot; because Tunis keeps the story within the framework of a series as opposed to two seasons in &quot;The Kid.&quot; In &quot;World Series&quot; you get to see how a battered and bruised Roy Tucker handles his first postseason, although the novel also puts a lot of time in on Brooklyn manager Dave Leonard (who shows himself to be a lot more complex than in the first book). Tunis is very good at getting the feel of what baseball was like in the 1940's, and &quot;World Series&quot; contains perhaps his best game-situation writing of all the novels. And the banquet scene is priceless. Very much a companion piece to &quot;The Kid,&quot; and it's well worth buying them both and reading them one after the other."},{"Title":"World Series","review":"Nobody does it better than John R.

A master."},{"Title":"World Series","review":"Written in 1941, much of the context of this book will be incomprehensible to the modern teenager. And yet, the basic story is timeless. Baseball is baseball, whether it was played fifty years ago or last summer. The Brooklyn Dodgers managed by Dave Leonard and starring Roy Tucker, \\"The Kid From Tompkinsville\\" are in the World Series, having won the pennant on the last day of the season. They are a battered team, their first string catcher split a thumb and cannot play. The Brooklyn pitchers are worn out from the long season and everyone else is hurting. In his first at bat of the series, Roy Tucker is hit in the head by a fast ball and is suffering from dizzy spells.This is a story about the drive to succeed and the desire to win. It is also about teamwork, all members working together to achieve a common goal. Manager Dave Leonard takes over the catching duties and by sheer will power, forces his forty-year old body to perform like it is once again twenty-something. He is leveled at the plate and holds onto the ball to save a run and get the vital out. I first read this story when I was in middle school, loved it then and enjoyed it just as much when I read it this time. It takes you back to an age when people played the game hard, for only a few thousand dollars a year and where winning was the only thing.This is a sequel to \\"The Kid From Tompkinsville\\" and Tunis is once again at the top of his writing game. It is a classic sports story that can still excite and inspire the modern child."},{"Title":"Spy Handler: Memoir of a KGB Officer- The True Story of the Man Who Recruited Robert Hanssen and Aldrich Ames","review":"Started this book on a warm weekend and was done by Sunday evening.Very well laid out text, informative, exciting & sometimes gripping.All in all a very well written book."},{"Title":"Spy Handler: Memoir of a KGB Officer- The True Story of the Man Who Recruited Robert Hanssen and Aldrich Ames","review":"The shipment came before the date given.

GREAT stuff.The memoir could have had more narrative color. \\"It was a dark and stormy night ...\\" \\"The sun shone brightly that day ...\\" That kind of stuff.

The book drones on in bureaucratic style, sometimes being insulting toward U.S. intelligence agencies, preferring to present them as inept and climbing a very steep learning curve. Cherkashin , i think exagerrates his love of the motherland in the last few chapters. By chapter 8 the reader begins to suspect that the book was written solely to counter allegations made by his former KGB colleagues that he was somehow less loyal than he seemed through connection to Oleg Kalugin, former KGB major General. Sure, the parts about Ames and Hanson are interesting, but do note that there is almost NO mention of the NSA, and that Cherkashin gives the impression that the KGB was very easy to join, mainly because everyone in the SU was magnificently suited to intelligence work, leave it out on your coffee table to impress but, don't read it."},{"Title":"Spy Handler: Memoir of a KGB Officer- The True Story of the Man Who Recruited Robert Hanssen and Aldrich Ames","review":"Cherkashin was a senior KGB figure in numerous Soviet outposts all over the world during the 1970s and 80s. He had a very important stint in Washington DC where he \\"handled\\" Aldrich Ames, one of the most damaging spies in the history of the United States. The tone of this interesting book is neither adversarial nor arrogant; Cherkashin certainly didn't write this memoir in order to make himself look like the most important KGB operative in the history of the USSR, and for that we should all be thankful.Cherkashin worked his way up through the ranks of the KGB and along the way we are exposed to the different units of the KGB, what their roles were, and the figures that led them. Sometimes the terminology and names can get a little overwhelming to those like me who aren't fully versed in the language of the spy game. Then again, I doubt there are many people, outside of ex-CIA and FBI personnel, who wouldn't have any difficulty.Brushing aside the frequent but not too distracting names and titles, this book could easily be called \\"Spycatching for Dummies\\". Cherkashin talks candidly about the methods of recruiting a spy (hint: blackmail works wonders), handling a spy (hint: stroke their ego), and what to do when something goes wrong (hint: find a scapegoat). Machiavelli would have been proud.That said, I really liked Cherkashin's style, everything is delivered very matter-of-factly and one is left with the distinct impression that he is telling the truth about a lot of things. He talks about the information that Ames and Hansen handed over to the Soviets and the damage that it did to US intelligence collection. What is even more amazing is that Ames and Hansen both forked over secrets for so long a period.If you're a fan of LeCarre or James Bond films, you'll definitely enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Spy Handler: Memoir of a KGB Officer- The True Story of the Man Who Recruited Robert Hanssen and Aldrich Ames","review":"In the words of Victor Cherkashin, \\"Aldrich Ames (CIA) was worth every penny of the $2.7 million he was paid.\\" Moreover, Ames was indeed the \\"deadliest\\" KGB spy because he unmasked the CIA's intelligence network in the Soviet Union. However, Robert Hanssen (FBI) \\"was much more important (to the KGB) because he allowed the KGB to penetrate U.S. intelligence to such a degree that the KGB came to regard him as the greatest asset, surpassing Aldrich Ames,\\" according to the author. Ironically, both Americans were \\"walk-ins,\\" and were never actively recruited to betray the United States.\\"Spy Handler: Memoir of a KGB Officer,\\" by Victor Cherkashin is an outstanding narrative of how former CIA agent Ames and how former FBI agent Hanssen gave the KGB the \\"mother lode\\" of information on the United States intelligence efforts against the former Soviet Union. To America, Ames and Hanssen were monsters...but the author demonstrates how in the eyes of the KGB both men were heroes. Interestingly enough, Ames declares he cooperated with the KGB because, \\"he worked for an agency that deliberately overestimated Soviet Union capabilities to wrangle more money for its own operations.\\" Hanssen basically cooperated with the KGB because he loved the danger of it and truly thought he was much too smart to get caught.This book covers much territory. The author reports the unmasking of Soviet spies Ronald Pelton, the NSA cryptologist, former Navy sailor John Walker, and Edward Lee Howard. Cherkashin makes mention of Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard but only in his description of 1985 as the \\"year of the spy.\\" In conclusion, the author does an excellent job of describing how a series of lucky breaks dramatically altered the landscape of U.S. - Soviet espionage. He also does a professional job of explaining the Soviet spy strategy of observation, orientation, decision and action. Highly recommended.Bert Ruiz"},{"Title":"Spy Handler: Memoir of a KGB Officer- The True Story of the Man Who Recruited Robert Hanssen and Aldrich Ames","review":"There is a large number of books dealing with Ames and Hanssen, and Cherkashin is the latest in a long line of former intelligence officers to write his memoirs. However, of all the accounts I have read, this one stands head and shoulders above the rest.Many of these books are very dry. Here, the writing style is engaging and accessible, and allows Cherkashin's personality to show through. There's a lot of interesting background as to how Cherkashin got started with the KGB, and some of the operations he was involved in to entrap foreign businessmen in Russia during the late 1950s and 1960s, prior to moving into foreign intelligence in Beirut.It seems one of Cherkashin's motives in writing this book was to set the record straight. In another memoir, not available in English, another KGB officer named him as the one who gave Aldrich Ames up to the Americans for money. Cherkashin goes to some lengths to reject this accusation and establish his loyalty to his former service and country.There are some mysteries he discusses. Was Vitaly Yurchenko a real defector or was he sent to confuse the CIA by giving up Ron Pelton and Ed Howard in order to draw attention away from Hanssen, Ames and a suspected (but as yet undiscovered) fifth mole? In the main text, Cherkashin gives the impression Yurchenko was a real defector who changed his mind. But he also mentions that Yurchenko \\"kept the Americans guessing for years\\" which, possibly, was the whole point. Interestingly to this day Yurchenko refuses all interview requests and has remained in Russia.Cherkashin also claims that on a visit to the US, after being taken ill with stomach pains at a conference and taken to hospital, he was given truth drugs by the FBI in an attempt to find out what he knew - presumably about undiscovered moles in US intelligence. I find that claim a little difficult to believe; he states that his suspicious were aroused when the doctor gave him an injection without first examining him. Given his background, and that he was not completely incapacitated, why would he have allowed this?The memoir has obviously been in production a long time - possibly awaiting clearance from the KGB's successor agencies. Although the book was published in 2005 Cherkashin refers to Ed Howard as \\"living in Moscow and running a small insurance business\\". Howard was found dead in unexplained circumstances in July 2002.There is also a great deal on the vicious internal politics of the KGB. Despite successfully running (from the KGB's point of view), the most productive agents since the Cambridge Five, upon his return to Moscow, Cherkashin was treated with suspicion, because these agents had revealed the extent of CIA and FBI penetration of the KGB. In the end he was unfairly pushed out of foreign intelligence.Cherkashin touches on his experiences subsequent to the fall of the Soviet Union. It's impossible not to feel for the guy when he finds that after his forty-year career, due to rampant inflation, his pension does not cover the cost of the gas required to drive to Yasenevo to sign for it. However, the upper ranks of the KGB - and particularly foreign intelligence - were staffed by the best and brightest of Soviet society, and Cherkashin is obviously no different. After a few false starts, he ends up with his own security company employing ex-KGB special forces to protect all the new banks which sprang up to handle the profits of the 1990s privatizations in Russia.If you buy any book about the final years of the cold war and focusing on the events of 1985, the \\"year of the spy\\", buy this one."},{"Title":"Spy Handler: Memoir of a KGB Officer- The True Story of the Man Who Recruited Robert Hanssen and Aldrich Ames","review":"This is a very disturbing book on many levels, except from the view of someone like the writer---a patriotic Soviet. Not Russian, mind you, but Soviet. Vladimir Putin told us infamously, on the sixtieth anniversary of VE day, that \\"the collapse of the Soviet Union was one of the great tragedies of the Twentieth Century.\\" I'm sure Vladimir Vladovich and the author get along quite well (assuming the two former KGB officers are acquainted).What is even more disturbing is that the \\"Spies\\" Victor Cherkashin\\"Handled\\" revealed many Russians and Americans helping the CIA. Cherkashin knew they would be assasinated without trial (or at best with a mock trial). On one occasion, Cherkashin, who'd been given information from both American spies Robert Hannsen and Aldrich Ames fingering Valery Martynov as a double agent must think of a way to get him to Moscow without fleeing. With well-written detail that truly helps us get to know Martynov in a sparse half a page, we are told of how well Cherkashin knows this very young man, his wife, and two children, on whom he dotes. Cherkashin convinces Martynov he is to receive a reward in Moscow, in order to get him on the plane that will instead take him to his execution.So why the four stars? The book is well written, but that is a minor point, unless you hate non-fiction, in which case the writing will certainly help you through it. There's a co-author, Gregory Feifer, so I don't know if Cherkashin deserves credit for that particular fact. But the dramatis personae truly come to life in a way that increases your empathy for them (if not Cherkashin). My favorite characteristic of the book, however, was the amount of detail in it. About all the aspects of the author's life. Life growing up in the Soviet Union during the \\"Great Patriotic War\\" (World War II for all non-ex-Soviets). Life in the KGB. And of course, life in the CIA, because, after all, the KGB were very good at finding that out."},{"Title":"Spy Handler: Memoir of a KGB Officer- The True Story of the Man Who Recruited Robert Hanssen and Aldrich Ames","review":"Spy handler is an inside look at how the Russians engaged in Cold War espionage, and how luck and skill were equally important in trying to outwit their adversaries. It shows how spies were recruited and how some volunteered, and the lenghts taken to figure out if they were legitimate or indeed double or even triple agents. Anyone who has read any of the books on either Aldrich Ames or Robert Hannsen should consider this book a must read."},{"Title":"Spy Handler: Memoir of a KGB Officer- The True Story of the Man Who Recruited Robert Hanssen and Aldrich Ames","review":"There are three sides to every story...your side, my side and the truth. Victor Cherkashin delivers a well written, fascinating and almost \\"folksy\\" version of the KGB side of the cold war. While his biases are clear, so are those of the people who have written the CIA version of events such as Antonio Mendez. In fact, part of what makes this book so fascinating is comparing the various authors' views of the same events. This memoir is a \\"must have\\" for the collections of those looking to find that mysterious \\"third side\\" of the story of the cold war."},{"Title":"Spy Handler: Memoir of a KGB Officer- The True Story of the Man Who Recruited Robert Hanssen and Aldrich Ames","review":"This book is excellent. It reads like an Ian Flemming story but only better. The better part for me is that it was real. This book almost seems like a movie. The author, Victor Cherkashin is sort of like the Forest Gump of the spy world. I say that only because he seems to be in on every major case of US people spying against US. This guy saw it all, the Ames Case, Richard Hansen of the FBI, and several other cases he writes about in the book. The big and the small cases are covered. He was even in on the Clayton Lonetree case. (Marine Embassy Guard in the 80s). It was spell bounding to hear about those cases from the other side. In the book he does detail some of the information that these US spys gave up. This is information that US sources has not reported on. He goes into detail about what Ames and Hansen did to the United States. After reading the book the reader might be a death penality supporter. Those guys gave up some very, very damaging information. You also get to hear about some of the good things the CIA did in the book. You learn about the vast numbers of spies that they collected in Russia. Also he talks about some of the innovative techniques the CIA employed which the KGB caught. These are things that either the press here in the US doesn't want to talk about or the CIA won't talk about in the interest of secrecy. You also get a good does of background knowledge on how spying is conducted today. It isn't James Bond stuff but it isn't normal duties either. If you read this plan on reading it all at once. You won't be able to put the book down."},{"Title":"Spy Handler: Memoir of a KGB Officer- The True Story of the Man Who Recruited Robert Hanssen and Aldrich Ames","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The characters are easy to identify and it isn't just a long list of KGB players during the Cold War (like the Sword & the Shield).

But don't mistake the genre of history with fiction, it's just degrading to history."},{"Title":"Spy Handler: Memoir of a KGB Officer- The True Story of the Man Who Recruited Robert Hanssen and Aldrich Ames","review":"SPY HANDLER reveals a career officer's unique perspective, his experiences and insights. Often pithy, the anecdotes are charming and well-told, and the author remains remarkably objective throughout.SPY HANDLER reminds us that ultimately the most effective spying is not mechanical but human, known as HUMINT (Human Resource Intelligence). The current market is swamped with a plethora of books on the technical side of gathering intelligence, that is, SIGINT, or Signals Intelligence. Like the obsession with forensics in law enforcement, this focus on technical expertise is only a portion of the story.However, HUMINT is a necessary but double-edged blade. As SPY HANDLER demonstrates, HUMINT is necessary because of the \\"old school\\" value of impressions, manipulation, and the wisdom of an officer with years of experience; double-edged because most security leaks--indeed, the most notorious cases from the Soviet Union and the United States--have always involved all-too-human spies.In a genre filled with posturing, pontificating and self-aggrandizement, SPY HANDLER stands above the rest as an excellent personal history of a significant period in recent history. Recommended for fans of intelligence books and modern history."},{"Title":"Spy Handler: Memoir of a KGB Officer- The True Story of the Man Who Recruited Robert Hanssen and Aldrich Ames","review":"This book differs from other books of this genre I have read before in that the author offers you- the reader-almost all you need to know about spying in the modern age.He is cold, ruthless,yet the bureaucrat - officer who hunts down his adversaries all over the world.I can guarantee you that you will not get bored even for one second.Brilliant!"},{"Title":"Spy Handler: Memoir of a KGB Officer- The True Story of the Man Who Recruited Robert Hanssen and Aldrich Ames","review":"Excellent Quality, Timely Receipt, Excellent Price.

His confessions added new information to already known spy cases of Penkovsky, Ames and Hanssen and many others. This book is the story of a KGB officer during his long career, detailing his experience when posted in Lebanon, India, Australia and US. His accounts about US events are interesting from many points of view.First, it is a KGB insider's story about above-mentioned cases. Second, he provided additional info about their capture and investigations.Thirdly and the most important, he confirmed the existence of \\"the fourth mole\\", an undiscovered spy within US intelligence. Thus, we have the necessary corroboration (parallel with Milt Bearden's book) from the mouth of the person that could even handle this fourth traitor, responsible for the some of lost spies. He didn't reveal too much, but his confirmation is enough and really fascinating.A really good contribution to the Cold war history; highly recommended."},{"Title":"Spy Handler: Memoir of a KGB Officer- The True Story of the Man Who Recruited Robert Hanssen and Aldrich Ames","review":"I purchased and read this for a security/intelligence class book report project.

Reading the author's side was very interesting especially his story about who really turned in John Walker. He claims it was on one of the Russian spies later revealed to the KGB by both Ames and Hanssen. Widely held reported story is that Walker's ex-wife did it.My only problems with the book: Its seemly almost exact re-telling of information from other books on both Ames and Hanssen. Its subtitle claiming that the author \\"recruited\\" both men. Not true. It is well known that Ames literally walked into the Russian embassy in Washington offering his services, and Hanssen mailed a back to the home of an Russian embassy worker which contained another package specifially addressed to the author while he was a KGB officer at the embassy. He did not recruit them. Welcomed them, yes. But he didn't recruit them."},{"Title":"Spy Handler: Memoir of a KGB Officer- The True Story of the Man Who Recruited Robert Hanssen and Aldrich Ames","review":"I will save you a lot of time. If you are a James Bond fan you will love this book. I had to call in sick the next day as I got very little sleep. If you do not have any accrued sick leave do not read this book at bedtime,Cherkashin and Feifer who speaks fluent Russian have teamed up together to produce a facinating, scary, insiders viewpoint of the Human Intelligence from world war two to the demise of the Soviet Union in 1991. Read remarks by Amazons Editorial Reviews and booklist. Bottom Line...the only way to stop recrutment of Spies is to remove Human Beings from intelligence gathering. Phillip Knightley author of The Second Oldest Profession/Spies and Spying in the 20th Century and Leonid Sherarshin former acting KGB Chairman and David Major former Director of Counter Intelligence, National Secutity Agency all give this book top marks. Cherkashin also adds a bit of spice with secret meetings,blackmail, seduction,and recruitment and what happens after recruitment. Aldrich and Hanson are covered and Oswald, and Kennedys blockade of Cuba. Cherkashin is now retired and felt that he wanted to make the record straight. Names have been changed and he states that this book was not published in Russia. It is absolutely amazing that this book did not have anyflak from British or American intelligence agencies Its like all the dirty linen from British and American Intelligence agencies is displayed in this book!! He states that \\"he continues to care deeply for the KGB'S reputation\\" yet he says some damming things about the KGB (and the CIA)he quotes David Major, retired (and former head of our counter intelligence agency) as saying that Ames told us that the US was porous and \\"that you didn't find 29 spies incide the CIA or the NSA, or the FBI. You found one or two. You found much more in the KGB because it was corrupt. The KGB was a good spy organization but a corrupt system. And thank God. Because they had us for lunch with the amount of intelligence they had. The United States was penetrated very broadly butnot too deeply. Lots of agencies were losing secrets, but they did not have huge penetrations.\\"Cherkashin has another view of our intelligence network. \\"Ames is called America's deadliest spy because he unmasked the human intelligence network leading to many deaths. But Hanson was even more important to us because his disclosures went to the heart of Washington's intelligence infrastructure. He gave us documents about the natioal MASNT (measurment and signature intelligence program, revealing the American spy satellite program.\\" Ames was responsible for the exposure of many of our spies in the KGB, there was no mention how many or why Ames did this. As far as I know Ames is in prison.

You'll get the strong impression that Cherkashin definitely knows his subject, and there are some good tales told.Unfortunately, as the book wears on, you begin to sense a hint of bitterness and and self-service. While Cherkashin does criticize the KGB, he seems more inclined to protect it and to wax remorseful over the demise of the USSR. By the end of the book, I was beginning to doubt the honesty within significant portions of the book.It is worth a read, but you'll not want to put it on your shelf to keep."},{"Title":"Spy Handler: Memoir of a KGB Officer- The True Story of the Man Who Recruited Robert Hanssen and Aldrich Ames","review":"I find this book very interesting as it relates to the infamous American spies Aldrich Ames and Robert Hansson.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Spy Handler: Memoir of a KGB Officer- The True Story of the Man Who Recruited Robert Hanssen and Aldrich Ames","review":"The thing I enjoyed the most about this book was that it was written by a Russian and therefore approached spycraft from a unique vantage point relative to what you would find with an American author. It reads like more of a history book than a thriller but is informative and intriguing all the same. If you are looking for an excellent book about the famous spy cases of the 1970s and 1980s, I would reco Spy by David Wise (re: Hansen case) or Spy Hunter by Robert Hunter (re: Walker case)."},{"Title":"Spy Handler: Memoir of a KGB Officer- The True Story of the Man Who Recruited Robert Hanssen and Aldrich Ames","review":"Fascinating history of espionage activities by the KGB against the United States in the Cold War. Focuses on the Hanssen and Ames cases and with Soviet counterintelligence activities and methods.When paired with Milt Bearden's book \\"The Main Enemy\\", it provides a pretty comprehensive behind the scenes look at US v Soviet intelligence activities though the latter half of the Cold War.One of the things I found curious about both books is the polite, almost fraternal, way in which these intelligence professionals write about the other side. I doubt that any of the histories to come from post Soviet Russia, or Iran, or Syria or Saudi Arabia or Egypt, maybe even Israel will have the same collegial tone."},{"Title":"Spy Handler: Memoir of a KGB Officer- The True Story of the Man Who Recruited Robert Hanssen and Aldrich Ames","review":"To hear Victor Cherkashin's perspective on the Ames, Hansesen, and other espionage cases towards the end of the Cold War. While the book is not perfect - it is exactly what it is supposed to Mr. Cherkashin's perspective. (A perfect book in my mind would have had a comparative viewpoint on the various episodes described in the book).The book is quite simple in communication style, but that is what makes it quite engaging and difficult to put down. The selective insertion of Russian words gives the reader a feeling they are there, as part of a conversation or interaction.Again, considering this is Mr. Cherkashin's memoir, if you are willing to accept some of the bias of any memoir, this is a fantastic read. Of course, some of the stories regarding our own CIA, makes you wonder that we ever got anything right. But he also gives the perspective of disappointment when it is revealed about the vast number of agents within the KGB the CIA has.Mr. Cherkashin also provides a good overview throughout the book about the compartmentalization of the KBG and what the various Directorates did/do. Even though the author sprinkles in a bit of his political leanings, it adds to the book, and helps to understand his personal thought process, rather than becoming a manifesto for the old Soviet system.The book is a great read - never gets boring with too many personal details about the author's life or the subjects life. It provides some insight into the thinking of various spies - on both sides of the Atlantic."},{"Title":"Spy Handler: Memoir of a KGB Officer- The True Story of the Man Who Recruited Robert Hanssen and Aldrich Ames","review":"Voted for a 4.5 STARS.Victor Cherkashin is frank and candid from the very beginning. He informs the reader that he has tried to avoid falling \\"into the trap of polemics,\\" that this is no James Bond-style novel, that he makes his \\"views about the KGB, the CIA and Soviet and American politics and affairs clear,\\" and that he has not tried to \\"aggrandize my career on KGB.\\" He also touches on the subject of how his memoir has caused some retired-KGB agents to denigrate his name in the Russian press or veteran circles.After finishing this captivating and intriguing read, I can say, that Cherkashin has been true to his mission that he outlined in the Preface. If there is one book on espionage you want to read, I would highly recommend this one.The read is mostly chronological, outlining his early life, his career start with the KGB, his advancement within this spy agency, and his multinational work abroad.This memoir does an excellent job at psychologically looking at the secretive, spy, and detective mouse and cat work of the CIA and KGB. The spies catch spies business. One revealing detail was that Cherkashin, as a high ranking officer, spends 70 to 80% of his time just filling out paper and communicating back and forth with HQ in Moscow.He does give specifics regarding handling some recruits and spies. Cherkashin also talks about the job of handling the two greatest American spies to work for \\"mother Russia\\" - Robert Hanssen and Aldrich Ames. Cherkashin is also keen on mentioning some top secret and super-tech CIA projects that were uncovered in or around Soviet Union's borders (eavesdropping operations). He never gives too much detail, as he knows that some info is still sensitive. His conclusion that \\"Despite the billions of dollars spent on counterintelligence, almost all exposed spies are betrayed by other agents\\" is quite telling.What surprised me the most, is how the author Cherkashin (with the aid of the editor Gregory Feifer) discusses freely his background, his love for Russia and Russian culture, his family, his dangerous operations, his fears and memories of victories, his rage and his cunningness during counterintelligence operations in such a casual manner. It really felt like the author was carrying on a normal conversation with me, and he was giving his testimony of what it means to work for the KGB, and what the job of a Handler is. And he speaks with patriotic pride, with honest self-analysis and KGB and CIA critique, and candid admiration for what is just and right.Another interesting fact is that even nowadays, post-Soviet Union disintegration, the spying business is very much alive and kickin'. Proof of this is the 'recent' catch of American spies Hanssen and Ames."},{"Title":"Spy Handler: Memoir of a KGB Officer- The True Story of the Man Who Recruited Robert Hanssen and Aldrich Ames","review":"When I read the insight flap of the book, I was immediately attracked to this. The author spent more than 30 years working for the KBG, inculding two tours working from Washington.At the beginning of \\"Spy Handler\\" (338 pages), Victor Cherkashin (and ghost writer Gregory Feifer) makes clear that if one was expecting James Bond-like \\"jump out of the plane\\" situations, this is not the book for you. Indeed, Cherkashin explains that a lot of the \\"spy\\" related work is in fact very mondane work, sifting through lots of information. A good part of the book is devoted to 1985, the so-called \\"Year of the Spy\\", because so many deep penetrations on both sides (KBG/CIA) occurred that year. Cherkashin's most famous involvement is for \\"handling\\" both Aldrich Ames and Robert Hanssen when they decided to spy for the KGB, and those pages read like a Le Carre thriller, expect of course this is real leife, not some novel.Very interesting also is the next-to-last chapter, dealing with the post-1991 era. Cherkashin does not hide his disdain for Gorbachev, whom he blames for the break-up of the Soviet Union. Cherkashin left the KGB in 1991, and now runs a security firm. Somewhat ironic is that his daughter eventually married an American. That said, even though Cherkashin of course wants the KGB to \\"win\\", his repsect for his counterparts at the CIA and for the US is very clear as well. Overall, a very interesting book, even if you're not as such into \\"spy\\" stuff."},{"Title":"Spy Handler: Memoir of a KGB Officer- The True Story of the Man Who Recruited Robert Hanssen and Aldrich Ames","review":"So many books have been written about the CIA and FBI over the years. Many of them are by people with an axe to grind, interests/agendas to serve, and or secrets to protect. This book by former high-ranking KGB officer Victor Cherkashin breaks that mold. In it he details his 40-year distinguised career with the KGB including the \\"highlights\\" of his recruitment & handling of the two most damaging spies in U.S. history --- Aldrich Ames of the CIA and Robert Hanssen of the FBI. He clears up a lot of the myths that both were inept bumblers and rates both highly as spying professionals. He also makes clear that both of them were not caught by any great efforts of either the CIA or FBI, but were simply informed on by Russian agents out in the field.Interestingly, he clears up a lot of the misconceptions about the height of cold war spying in the 80's between the U.S. and Russia. Mainly that a lot of the spying that went on was almost like a game between the two countries with little of National security importance on the line. He portrays it as the old \\"I know something you don't know.\\" game playing out on an international scale like a competition for information.At the end of the book he gives a very valid and timely assessment about the current world intelligence situation, Iraq and terrorism. He argues very convincingly that the Bush administration along with the CIA was well-aware that Iraq had no WMD before the war. Also that the CIA and George Tenet were used as a political tool and later a scapegoat to advance the real reason behind the war --- OIL. He describes the Bush administrations' later spinning of the war --- Operation Iraqi Freedom as \\"laughable.\\" His other main arguement is that intelligence all over the world has gotten too big and too self-important for its own good (probably true).The reader is given an honest matter-of-fact account of spying in the past, present, and future by someone intimately familiar with what is at stake. It's more than a little ironic that we as Americans can read about all this in 'Spy Handler' by someone who was considered a former enemy."},{"Title":"Spy Handler: Memoir of a KGB Officer- The True Story of the Man Who Recruited Robert Hanssen and Aldrich Ames","review":"Characteristic of this genre of history on the former Soviet Union is the narration of Cold War operational activities, depicted in all their unfavourable moral light with minimal apologetics. The potential reader should not come to works such as Cherkashin's _Spy Handler: Memoir of a KGB Officer_ for anything other than a 'clinical' (if partial) report of what was done, where, and when. Arguably apologetics are uninteresting (and transparently fabricated), and have no place in works like this, since the reader is going to pass his own moral judgement in any case. That this book avoids undue moralizing makes it extremely interesting for a reason the author didn't intend: it provides a window into Soviet Cold War psychology, if in retrospect.As Alex Krooglik (another Amazon reviewer) wrote, Cherkashin's operational narrative is indeed reported in a relatively neutral tone -- mistakes made on both sides of the Iron Curtain are freely offered when relevant to a central argument.This is not to say that the report is necessarily objective. The book is primarily concerned with rebutting recent political smears made against the author by his former intelligence colleagues; this makes the motive of the writing obvious: Cherkashin wishes to clear his own name among the old Soviet elite, and also demonstrate his exemplary and loyal nature (it is material that the author still resides in Moscow).Cherkashin's defense comes in the form of descriptions of certain periods of his counterintelligence career with the KGB; the book therefore doubles as both biography, and a brief history of select Soviet counter/intelligence operations, with emphasis on the handling of the American double agents Hanssen and Ames.This work also narrates a selected history of KGB Cold War intelligence breakthroughs via recruited/double/triple agents; importantly, it includes both Western and former Soviet Bloc examples. In pursuing this line of discussion, another urgent message of Cherkashin's book emerges: the utter primacy of counterintelligence operations within the wider context of intelligence networks, which the author argues will never fade in importance. He avers that recruitment of (various types) of agents, not bureaucratic analysis of field intelligence, is responsible for major operational victories -- a message that has particular relevance in today's post-9/11 world.Cheerleading for the KGB is kept to a minimum, but is present; contrasts in historical operational procedures are explored, with the general argument that the KGB was more successful with less resources than the contemporary CIA/FBI.The current volume also provides a first-person glimpse of the megalithically Byzantine nature of the former Soviet bureaucracy; a very interesting section on the fall of the USSR and its immediate political aftermath is also given.Since Cherkashin's motive is to demonstrate his loyalty, the picture he paints of himself is of a devoted Communist; he contrasts this with the message that willing spies rarely betray their country for ideological reasons, but rather out of spite for being slighted in their professional careers, and/or just to make a few extra bucks on the side. In short this book is no exercise in the dull reporting of operational data; it is sharp in its narrative, and loaded with the author's intriguing reflections on a life spent managing spies.On the downside, the author makes the astonishing claim that the KGB was never a political tool of the Soviet Communist Party (in the manner, says Cherkashin, that the CIA is and was the tool of the Bush administration, particularly on policy regarding the second invasion of Iraq). The reader will detect in several places where Cherkashin's pro-Communistic remarks seem empty, absurd, or robotic, lacking authenticity and almost tongue-in-cheek. It is consequently uncertain where the gloss in this book begins, and where the true Cherkashin (as opposed to the pseudo-ideologue) lies.This volume was written from one man's perspective given his first-hand experiences, so it functions moreso as biography than historical overview. It makes no claims to comprehensiveness, so readers looking for that need to go elsewhere; the author's skill is however such that a thorough examination proceeding from the operational history (as opposed to discussion of selected events supporting a political and personal argument) would be ideal.Three and half stars given for the matter-of-fact reporting of, and perspectives on, select details of Cold War and post-Cold War politics and counterintelligence operations; the format and tone is constrained however, and its basic motive and organization is suspect, so in the end it delivers only a slice of what we know to be a very large pie. It is however a quick read, and would be requisite for those interested in establishing a primary bibliography of Soviet intelligence activities in general. Well done."},{"Title":"Spy Handler: Memoir of a KGB Officer- The True Story of the Man Who Recruited Robert Hanssen and Aldrich Ames","review":"Getting an insiders view of spying throughout the past 40 years was interesting - Cherkashin's accounts of cold war spy vs spy tactics are personal and credible. I found especially interesting his stories of high tensions within the USSR during the Reagan 80's, and his perception of the Russian weaknesses that caused the fall of the wall throughout Europe. The quotes and stories from US intelligence agents were good.I was disappointed the writings seemed very scattered. Cherkashin sounds like he had a big chip on his shoulder about his government. Not one of my favorite reads."},{"Title":"Spy Handler: Memoir of a KGB Officer- The True Story of the Man Who Recruited Robert Hanssen and Aldrich Ames","review":"This is particularly interesting book written by a legendary member of the KGB services. I found it, ironically, because I watched an episode of No Reservations Required where they briefly spoke to the author about various aspects of country life and cooking.Yeah. Seriously. The Spymaster who cooks.What I got from his book was a fascinating journey through time. The author directly responsible for recruiting Aldrich Ames and Robert Hansen. Ames was considered the deadliest spy in the united stated for the number of people he turned into the KGB. Hansen was considered the most dangerous spy since the Manhattan project.I enjoyed tremendously the information provided regarding the operational use of spies, recruiting and management. The author doesn't get into specifics for obvious reasons. But none-the-less there is plenty of information. I also enjoyed watching the working of the CIA and KGB as they tried to out play each other. You could say the same about the early days with the British SIS (intelligence) service in Moscow.Over all...this an interesting read. He downplays a number of American successes and filters it through the eyes of a KGB Colonel. And this also exposes the issue I have with this book. Where you see heroes you will also see traitors. Where you see traitors you will see someone's hero. I remember when some of these things came to light. This is serious life and death stuff with zero room for error.Ultimately the most riveting part of this book was the way Hanssen handled himself rather than letting the KGB manage him. Had it not been for the author's desire to know The Source (Robert Hansen)...he may never have kept a garbage bag used a drop...and from there...a turncoat at the top of the KGB turned in his \\"get out of jail free card\\" and turned him in...much against the author's desires.If you enjoyed this book you may also find My Silent War by Kim Philby (British Turncoat) and Spy: The Inside Story of How the FBI's Robert Hanssen Betrayed America by David Wise."},{"Title":"RE.LA.VIR","review":"Once I finished reading the last page of this novel, I wondered about the possibility of any of the material being real. It gave me a sinking feeling inside to know that any of the actions taking place in the novel could have been done in reality as well. The sexual abuse and violence within are presented in a form appearing to be \\"machine processed\\" and so allow itself to disconnect from traditional human narrative and into a digital form not unlike a computer's command line interface. The broken recollection of the sequence of events adds an air of internal thought seemingly coming from the victim(s). Torture is shared to us in raw, sometimes stuttering lines that define the urgency, pain, and fear experienced during the re-tellings. Subconcious, disjointed scenes of neutral nature slip in to reveal a feminine undertone that is an abrupt change from the slickly worded and almost poetic verses of sexual assault that are coldly observed. The command line program puts an unemotional quality to the novel's presentation which give me the idea of stoic intermissions read in monotone that help to preserve and organize the mass of subconcious abuse streaming as words on the page. It feels as though, ultimately, I can attempt to explain the novel logically, but it won't give you the full scope and experience that can only be had by reading it."},{"Title":"RE.LA.VIR","review":"Jan Ramjerdi takes a different approach to tell a story of crime that occurs daily within the world.

A must read."},{"Title":"RE.LA.VIR","review":"A Brief Description: Re.La.Vir is written in a style that is a stylized \\"HYPERTEXT\\" that mimics \\"command line\\" style computer programs. Using abbreviations, dots, dashes, underscores, unusual capitalization, and page formatting, the pages of this book immediately call up images the internet, and the computer age. The pages seem to scroll by, and the text itself seems to be almost interactive requiring mental input on your part, in order to yield any meaning. The book opens with a \\"read-me\\" section, which reads just like the read-me files that come along with almost every piece of software ever published, complete with technical support numbers, instructions for reading and a breakdown on the greater structure of the book. Throughout the book there are sections where each line has a little checkbox next to it on the left, which kinda' makes you feel like your supposed to click one too make a selection, and there are little hand symbols that seem to mark the start of each \\"page\\" (I mean that in the web page sense, not like the pages of a book)Interpretation of form: I read a lot of online reviews in preparing to write on this book. A question I saw come up a few times was, what is the point of this material being written in this form? I kinda got stuck on this...for the most part, reviewers who brought up this idea seemed to be looking for some overly academic and premeditated answer. From my reading of the book, the actual narrative material was probably the least important aspect of this book. What I was interested in, was the method of modeling thought processes used in this book. Cognitive psychologists have been using computers to attempt to model the human brain and it's processes for more than a decade now. This book, in a way, does the opposite using a human brain to model the characteristic of a computers processes. So in a way, this book is like a new flavor of stream of consciousness, a human mind mimicking a computers stream of consciousness. Of course a computer has no real consciousness of its own, which is what makes this all really interesting to me. What we might preserve as a computers \\"consciousness\\" is really just a shared social construct. A image we have collectively formed through exposure to each other, filtered through the technological world, i.e. the internet. In other words, every word and image anyone has ever seen on a computer monitor is the result of another humans mind, but we've reached a point in our modernity, where we can actually visualize this collective output as the \\"thought process\\" of an intimate object. So what does this form have to do with the subject matter? As I see it, the narrative fits it's form well, and that's all that's really important. A very visual and striking depiction of rape is possible in this image and sound driven format. The repetitious or cyclic nature of software illustrates very well the way ones own thoughts can haunt them. Adding to this is the \\"plastic\\", impersonal feel some of the computer language gives off, which is so opposite the subject matter of the narrative, that it borders on satire.Conclusion: So what impressions has this book made on me in terms of writing style. Well it's hard to say... I guess I'll really know after I've done more writing, but I know that at the very least, reading RE.LA.VIR has shown me a example of stream of consciousness that truly puts the idea of writing for your reader out of it's misery. This is kinda comforting, it's nice to know that there is a market in the world interested in real emotion and originality, as opposed too form following remakes of remakes (which make up most of the American literary market)."},{"Title":"The Power of Thetis: Allusion and Interpretation in the Iliad","review":"There's not one wasted word in this little opus, and I was fascinated by a perspective on Homer that I'd never thought of before.Okay...I know I really shouldn't say this, but there's another reason why this book is dear to my heart, so I'll leave serious comment on the contents of this book to others.The evening after I read Power of Thetis I had to go to this stuffy dinner party. Anyway, there was this really interesting woman there--really hot, too. It was driving me nuts just sitting next to her. Normally she wouldn't have looked twice at the likes of me, but it turned out that she was really into Greek literature. Well, I'm no Homerist but since I had just read this book and its arguments were really lucid and easy reccounted, I was able to get into this intense conversation with her about Achilles. It was really cool. And the end result was that she went home with me. Thank God for books like this."},{"Title":"Aratos of Sicyon,","review":"From the Author's Introduction -\\"In Aratos of Sicyon there is a subject eminently suited to biographical treatment. If not one of the greatest, he is at least one of the most fascinating figures Greece ever produced, and peculiarly significant for the understanding of the third century B.C. in Greece. His significance he attained not by forcing events into the shape he planned (he was no Alexander), but by identifying himself almost completely with the most important political movement of the time.. After 245 it was impossible to think of Aratos or the Achaean League apart from each other; and for thirty years Aratos maintained his place at the helm, steering to suit the current, and controlling the wheel with a skill such that few realised that it was ultimately the current and not the pilot that determined the ship's direction.\\"\\"Aratos was very Greek in both his virtues and his vices, and in many ways resembled Themistocles; he had the Athenian's diabolical cunning - in reading of the negotiations with Macedon or the methods by which from time to time Aratos recovered the temporarily wavering allegiance of the Achaeans one is again and again reminded of Herodotos' account of Themistocles before Salamis - and if he had not the latter's foresight, he had at least Pericles' virtue of being wholly incorruptible; finaly, if one traces their respective lives to the very end, the balance goes down heavily in favour of the Achaean. Furthermore, like Themistocles, Aratos lived a life of mingled statesmanship and adventure; in spite of the air of calculation and inevitability which seems to hang over so many of Aratos' actions, there is an element of hazard and romance in such exploits as the capture of Sicyon and the Acrocorinth, and the rout at Cleonae, which makes the \`Life of Aratos' one of the most interesting in Plutarch.\\"Greece in the third century BC was much reduced from former glories, thanks primarily to the activities of Philip and Alexander of Macedon and their Successors, but with plenty of help from the Greeks themselves - see The Theban Hegemony, for example, for the last glory days of Sparta and Athens. In the period covered by this book, Athens has sunk almost to the level of a tourist site (and the Romans, who are on the horizon - both literally and figuratively - will soon turn it into a theme park), and Sparta is a feeble shadow of itself, but still willing to have another go at world domination. During the course of this book, the Spartan magistrates - the Ephors - are murdered on three separate occasions, and themselves massacre their opponents on a fourth occasion, just in case they are understandably, up to something; and many other Greek cities do the same sort of thing. Aratos, at the age of 20, in 251 BC, leads a plot which successfully liberates his city of Sicyon from an oligarchy, and in order to provide security, obtains membership in the Achaean League for it. He then goes off to serve in the League's army for five or six years in order to build up prestige, and in 245 BC he is elected to the annual \`Generalship' of the Achaean League, making him the military and political leader for the year. He manages to get elected to the office for almost every other year for the rest of his life - constitutionally, you cannot hold the office for successive years - he manages 17 terms in office. During that time, he manages to conduct wars and diplomacy, which keeps the League top dog in the Peloponnese for over thirty years. He is not actually a very good general, and usually loses battles when he is in sole charge, but he is able to build alliances, and gets the young Philip V of Macedon \`on board' with his vision of a Greece, which, if not unified, is pacified under a \`Symmarchy', or federation of various Greek leagues. And, while not being a good general, he is able to pull off cunning plans, and literally single-handedly manages to capture the Acrocorinth.This is a very interesting book, on an interesting central character, in the last phase of (semi)-independent Greek history. The next chapter, after the period covered here, will be the Romans getting fed up with interminable Greek squabbles and \`pacifying' the lot of them.The Contents are -P001: IntroductionP029: The Struggle with Antigonos GonatasP057: The Leagues against DemetriosP070: The Cleomenean War: the Threat from SpartaP089: The Cleomenean War: the Return of MacedonP114: The Social War: the Symmachy in ActionP134: The Social War: the Last Years of AratosP158: ConclusionP167: Appendix.

We're talking about a sea of people who work before they clock in to avoid overtime,often have to take work home, and have no recourse because turning in their boss also exposes their illegal status.The irony is this is an industry that is dominated and run by liberal democrats and the anti-union forces are stronger than any republicans can ever dream about. Alot of ungodly reprobate Democrats run these apparel companies who rob the poor and then run out to their charity functions to be seen of men, all with money that is not their own, but robbed from the mexican single mothers and other poor immigrants. So, just crooks pretending to be generous. It's mercy at the expense of justice -- they understand mercy by giving, but not justice because they give what is not their own. It's pretty sickening picture of what's going on -- and it'll probably never change.Somehow the subs need to unite under one banner, so, apparel companies in LA who want stuff \\"made in LA\\" which they do, have no other option. The subs need to become one imo. That's what corporate america does, they become one thru consolidation and shake down farmers who have no other buyer to resort to. CARGILL is nothing but the accumulation of thousands of companies. There has been like around 10,000 consolidations in teh food industry in last decade -- so, the potato farmer has one buyer for his crop, and its not a price where he can make money, and there are no other buyers. So, only option for potato guy is to join with the other potato farmers, and become one also. Mano a mano. Look at it this way, if you have an auction, and one guy shows up, he controls every bid. That is what Cargill does, that is what the apparel industry does, and that is how workers can fight back by becoming \\"one\\" company by consolidating all the subs together. Fight consolidation with consolidation.Good thing for apparel execs Im not in charge of LA -- I'd turn you life upside down for being rotten crooks that you are.Good book, some slow parts, but all in all very interesting.

It traces Collins' rise to prominence from his boyhood in nationalist Cork County through his ten years in England working for the post office and financial firms, his return to Ireland to participate in the Easter Rising of 1916, his increasing influence in Frongoch prison in Wales and in nationalist/republican circles upon his release in 1917. This biography reads more like a riveting novel given the almost mythical qualities of the central character. Coogan conveys not only the facts about Collins and his exploits during Ireland's fight for independence but also his charismatic personality, engaging wit and humor, capacity for ruthlessness, magnetic leadership qualities and passionate devotion to his country and its people. This is also a fascinating textbook picture of a successful guerilla war and intelligence operation led by a man with a genius for conspiracy, the so-called \\"Dublin Pimpernel\\", the most wanted man in the British Empire at that time. Highly recommended, particularly for anyone who would like to have a better understanding of the troubles in modern Ireland."},{"Title":"The Man Who Made Ireland: The Life and Death of Michael Collins","review":"Coogan's biography of Collins is often called the definitive one and for good reason: no other author to date has undertaken the sheer level of work studying the life of Collins, period. Coogan walks the reader through virtually every aspect of Michael's life, some good, some bad, some momentous, and some minor. His preface to the American edition alone is phenomenal. His biography (as most tend to do) goes in chronological order, from Michael's birth to his poignant assassination in 1922. We are given the details of Michael's family life, his friends, his comrades, his guerrilla warfare tactics, his temperament, his favorite books, etc., etc. Coogan's chapters are as follows: The Little Fella, Easter 1916, Kicking Down a Rotten Door, The Twelve Apostles, The Year of Terror, The Sky Darkens, Peace Comes Dropping Slow, Settling This Old Strife, Fighting the Waves, Wading Through Blood, Setting up the Six, The Mouth of Flowers, and Honouring the Dead. There are also notes, an appendix, and many b/w photos. Coogan spends a good deal of time on the Easter Rising, the events surrounding Bloody Sunday, and the negotiating of the Anglo-Irish Treaty. He also addresses several of the controversial issues surrounding Michael's life and death, e.g. allegations that Collins was a homosexual, claims that de Valera might have instigated Collins' assassination, and Collins' supposed dalliances. Although Coogan's writing is not what I would particularly call easy or light reading, I do believe this selection could make a good starter book for anyone's investigation of Michael Collins. If you are interested in any way in Collins' life and times, you absolutely must own this book."},{"Title":"The Man Who Made Ireland: The Life and Death of Michael Collins","review":"If Michael Collins had lived, there would be no \\"Northern Ireland\\". That was a foreign word to Michael. Eamon Devalera said that History would treat Michael better than himself. This book does a handsome job of describing that. Tim Pat Coogan does a thoroughly interesting job with this subject. Read It!"},{"Title":"The Man Who Made Ireland: The Life and Death of Michael Collins","review":"I ordered this book and paid extra for shipping so I could read it on the trip to Ireland.

I also have my &quot;Team Baseball Card Checklist&quot; for working on Yankees cards by companies other than Topps. I do not have a need for the &quot;Beckett Baseball Card Alphabetical Checklist,&quot; but I can see exactly what sort of collector who would value this book, namely those who are trying to get all of the cards for their favorite player. Of course, that was a lot easier to do in the olden days when there was pretty much just one major baseball card company producing cards. I shudder to think of how many dozens of cards come out each year for Derek Jeter or Alex Rodriguez. But if your favorite player is anyone from Henry Aaron to Jerry Zimmerman, then this is the book that will tell you what you are looking for when you hit the shops and shows (actually some guy made the majors this year who replaced Hammerin' Hank as the player whose name appears first, but I do not remember his name).As always, the good doctor provides more than well over a thousand pages devoted to players from A to Z. The introduction section contains sage advice on how to collect that covers everything from obtaining and preserving your cards to the differences between collecting and investing. There is also practical advise on how to use the alphabetical checklist. The target market for this particular checklist might be relatively small, but collectors will certainly appreciate having this available (I cannot speak to investors). Collectors of older cards will benefit even more from picking up this checklist because you do not need to pick up an updated version. There are thousands of new cards coming out each year, many of them featuring players who will never make it to the major leagues in the great quest to have the first official rookie card for the next Barry Bonds or Kerry Wood, but they are not making any more cards of the baseball cards of our youth."},{"Title":"Functional Isometric Contraction System of Static Contraction","review":"Functional Isometric Contraction was the original work published on isometrics during the isometric fad of the 1960s by it's leading proponent and guru Bob Hoffman, Legendary U S Olympic weightlifting coach, founder of the York Barbell Company, founder of Strength and Health Magazine and author of numerous books. I recommend this book,but I would also suggest that you purchase \\"Isometric Power Revolution\\" by John Peterson,the current recognized expert on Isometrics, which is the updated and expanded current Bible of Isometrics. After the fad of the 1960s Isometrics fell into disfavor because some of the athletes that claimed great results were found to also be using steroids. Today Isometrics are very popular and may turn out to be the ultimate and most effective form of exercise that there is.Bob Hoffman, said of his father who was a student of Alois P. Swoboda, \\"So often I have said that my father had more muscles than I have seen since and we must remember that I am in the muscle business and that I have seen thousands of extraordinary physical specimens. He exercised incessantly and he could make most of any muscle group in his body feel like blocks of wood. I always believed that his exercises verged more on the tension type, rather than Functional Isometric Contraction,but there was a close similarity.\\""},{"Title":"CUTTER","review":"The Gail McCarthy series is right up my alley. I like anything with horses, suspense and character development. I enjoy following a lead person and seeing what happens to them in their life. All of my wishes are satisfied with these novels."},{"Title":"CUTTER","review":"Feels like Christmas and I have the best gift under the tree each time I start a Laura Crum novel! This author nails it for me with her charming descriptions of familiar places and her horseback eye view of the world around her! As a lover of horses and mystery books and as a Santa Cruz local..this series is my match made in horsey heaven!"},{"Title":"CUTTER","review":"I found this book very enjoyable! It's clearly written by someone with an understanding of the horse world, but aimed at adults! Great suspense, awesome ending, and believable characters. It was refreshing not to feel the need to 'fact check' as I read. Looking forward to reading the rest of the series!"},{"Title":"CUTTER","review":"Having lived in Santa Cruz for 17 years, boarding my horse on the road that the main character Gail lives on, working at a veterinary hospital while living there, and also working at a kennel across the street from the author's family ranch, it was fun to read a book that I could totally relate to. I am not sure if I would have enjoyed the book as much if it weren't for those things, but it is a fun mystery and I believe many horse people would enjoy it. I am now reading her second book, Hoofprints. So far it is entertaining and fun. I will continue to buy or get her books from our library as long as I enjoy them this much!"},{"Title":"CUTTER","review":"I just finished reading Cutter and truly enjoyed it. I am always looking for new mystery books and Laura Crum is terrific. The book was constantly moving and Gail is a wonderful character. This is my first time reading Laura Crum, but not the last. I hope Lonny, her boyfriend, will appear in another story. I enjoyed their relationship. This was definitely a fun book to read."},{"Title":"CUTTER","review":"Ms. Crum's clumsy and, in many places, below average writing style detracted from what could have been a decent first effort. While I did not expect this to be a piece of timeless literature, I was shocked at the elementary prose. Her editor at St. Martin's Paperbacks let her down. First he or she neglected to edit run-on sentences such as the following at page 15: &quot;We had grown apart after my folks died and I'd changed from a typically rebellious teenager into a suddenly serious adult, but we'd never quite lost track of each other and when I returned to Santa Cruz to work for Jim Leonard I'd discovered Bret working as a horseshoer, and our friendship had sprung back up.&quot; Then the editor allowed ineffective word choices throughout the story. As but one instance, Ms. Crum seemed unable to describe color as anything but &quot;blue,&quot; &quot;green,&quot; &quot;brown,&quot; or &quot;blue-green.&quot;The murder mystery plot, while slim, is generally entertaining. Ms. Crum's insertion of the budding romance for Gail McCarthy, the heroine/veterinarian/detective-wannabe, didn't fit and only made McCarthy into an Ally McBeal-like character. While it works on television, it doesn't in the story. McCarthy comes across as annoying, unsympathetic. In fact, the women characters in Cutter suffer from stereotypical, unflattering descriptions. They are one-dimensional. And why does Ms. Crum seem to go out of her way to portray all the blond women (that is, all the women in the book except for McCarthy) in such a negative light? The only reason I even note this is because Ms. Crum highlights, multiple times, the blond hair color of the other women characters.Based on the other reviewers here, I am sure there are many readers out there who will vehemently disagree with my rating. In the end, I did give it one star because, from the author biography, acknowledgements, and Ms. Crum's comments on this website, Ms. Crum does seem to be a very nice lady - and she loves horses. I give Ms. Crum a lot of credit for starting, completing and successfully publishing a book. Good for her for having tried!"},{"Title":"CUTTER","review":"I enjoyed this book ,I found it to be fastpaced and very factual .the setting and storyline were a plus for me . I can highly recommend the book and the author. Mystery and/or horses are not my main interests but the writers style worked for me"},{"Title":"CUTTER","review":"It's a pity that Crum's earlier books seem to be out of print; as with any mystery series, you're always best advised to begin at the beginning, which is this one, followed byHoofprints. Amateur sleuths who are veterinarians are not unknown, and many literary sleuths interact with smaller animals like cats and dogs, but Crum has made horses the focus of her mystery, and in the process imparts a lot of information about them (though I question her assertion, or rather implication, that *all* horses eat wood; some do (they're called \\"cribbers\\"), but it's a habit of which they can be broken (if that weren't true, there would be few 19th-Century barns and stables still standing!)). She has clearly done her homework regarding horse-based eventing (cutting, endurance riding), and knows something of equines at work (her descriptions of cutting horses working cows verge on poetry). She also has a gift for humor--she had me giggling helplessly over her description of Lonny Peterson's kitten Gandalf. She's a bit slow getting started--it isn't till we're more than a third of the way through the book that the body is discovered and the detection actually gets under way--but once she does, the mystery unrolls with suitable red herrings, and the ultimate perpetrator isn't one I would have suspected. I'll be looking for further novels in this series."},{"Title":"CUTTER","review":"I had been tearing the local bookstores apart looking for a Laura Crum book, after reading a review of her latest in Western Horseman. After ordering a paperback copy of this book from Amazon, and reading it (a total of two hours) I have hope that Laura Crum may turn out some really good horse-related mysteries, but alas, this is not one of them. Don't get me wrong, at less than [price] it's decent entertainment, but nothing great. Parts were a little thin, characterizations were only so-so (my own favorite character was Blue, the grouchy old Australian Cattle dog) and when the murderer is finally revealed, I found myself thinking, who? Oh, yeah, that guy. There are no really stunning twists or revelations. However, the horse related details were accurate, and probably, if it hadn't been for the equestrian slant, this book would have been awful.I do have hopes that the books will get better. I didn't like the first Carolyn Banks book I read, but now I love her little mysteries. I'll buy my next Laura Crum book in paperback, and we'll see how that one reads."},{"Title":"CUTTER","review":"Have not finished the book yet, and may never. She has already made so many mistakes, it is terrible. Granted she knows a lot about cutting, and the bloodlines, but fails sorrowfully on basic horse knowledge. 30 years of raising, breeding, and training horses gives me a basis of knowledge. For me, her glaring mistakes ruin the book."},{"Title":"CUTTER","review":"I enjoyed this book by Laura Crum and look forward to readingthe others. The main character is very independent and the storyresolves around horses and a good mystery. Another favorite to add tomy list!"},{"Title":"CUTTER","review":"I first read this book almost 20 years ago when it was first published. I enjoyed it then and I enjoyed it again when recently rereading it on Kindle. Laura Crum's books were hard to find for a long while, so I am thrilled to finally have the chance to read the series as they are released for Kindle at a low price. The stories are chronological. I'm currently reading them in order. Cutter is the first story. The biggest strength of these stories to me is that Laura Crum is a horsewoman herself, and all her horse details are accurate. It drives me crazy when authors write about horses and make mistakes that just aren't true to life. This Kindle edition has some minor formatting issues, mainly with paragraphs, but it doesn't detract from the story. I recommend Cutter and all the Gail McCarthy series to everyone who loves horses, the central California coast, and cosy mysteries."},{"Title":"CUTTER","review":"this book kept me on the edge of my seat until the very end. I wish she (Gail McCarthy) really existed.

Though no expert in the cutting world the mystery surrounds, Gail puts her able, inquisitive mind to the unsettling mysteries cropping up, with a little help from a charming paramour and an endearing, trusty old dog. Laura Crum's first effort presents us with a fun read including accurate equine information and descriptions that horse lovers are sure to appreciate regardless of their chosen disciplines. Fans of women detective mysteries will also enjoy some of the sly dialogue and the flavor of a strong female lead."},{"Title":"CUTTER","review":"Our hard working equine veterinarian seems to have a knack for finding trouble and too much curiosity for her own good. You ride along with her and get deeper and deeper into her personal investigation of the murder. I often wonder why she chooses to follow a career as a veterinarian when she should have been in the investigation field. As usual this book keeps you guessing right up to the end."},{"Title":"CUTTER","review":"This was a fun read with lots of twists and turns.

The workbook brings probing questions for consideration and discussion. Some people in the group wished that we had alotted more time to go over the materials (we took 12 classes) of the Changes That Heal book and workbook to delve deeper into the weighted topics. The areas that Henry Cloud has targeted for change are the roots of many painful life experiences. Open discussion among trusted friends is very cathartic and has a healing effect."},{"Title":"Changes That Heal Workbook","review":"This book is an excellent guide to help understand the basics of healthy relationships. The only drawback is if you are unable to see your own flaws then this won't bring about the changes the book is addressing. Some people will need the help of a really insightful, competent counselor."},{"Title":"Changes That Heal Workbook","review":"The easiest way for me to discuss my thoughts on this book would be to break it into two categories of pros and cons.Pros:I absolutely loved the first 1/4 of this book and thought it was extraordinarily insightful. I found myself highlighting and underlying so many great passages. I also enjoyed that Henry spoke so openly and honestly about the human nature within all of us and how it relates to our ability to live out the Christian expectations of us. So many Christian books try to deny the sinful nature instead of embracing and realizing that we all have one no matter how hard we try to be pure and holy. Henry even points out how dangerous this denial is and that it is impossible to find healing, peace, and grace if we are still in denial of our sins. For those reasons I thoroughly enjoyed this book.Cons:The book spent a little too much time pinpointing symptoms or negative side effects from not establishing boundaries, relationships, or our own identity as adults. I know I have problems I know what most of my downfalls are, at least the ones I am most interested in fixing. I didn't care to spend so much time reading about what can happen to us if we don't resolve certain issues because I had already diagnosed myself with issues I didn't need the Christian take on the DSMV. I also felt that it got a little repetitive and could have been a much shorter book if he didn't spend so much time repeating himself or belaboring the point.Overall I would recommend this book to anyone considering reading it, if it sounds like it could be of use or a good read for you I'm sure you will gain from it. Despite my cons list I do feel that I gained much from reading this book."},{"Title":"Changes That Heal Workbook","review":"It is a good book for someone who has lost a relationship thru death or break up.

I've seen Parks' stories in a lot of magazines, and while I always remembered the story, I didn't always realize that the guy who wrote it was the same guy who wrote that =other= story I liked--and that other one, and that other one... &quot;Oh, wow, that was him too?&quot; Finally, here's a collection of his works all in one place, side by side. This is like buffet night at your favorite restaurant. Yum!Anyone who's enjoyed the Datlow/Windling fairytale-retellings series should pick up this book. But there's a lot more going on here than just the Grimms reimagined. Fairy tales can take many forms. There are ghost stories here and science fiction stories and stories that defy genrification. Parks draws from a variety of world cultures and mythologies ... all the diverse manifestations of the collective unconscious. Looking back over the collection after I read it, I was surprised that the individual stories weren't longer--each one packs a lot of punch into an economical space. They're completely readable--and rereadable. And the sense of wonder ... I don't know how Parks manages to be so profound and down-to-earth at the same time. It's quite a gift.For some reason I'm reminded of Andy Duncan and Michael Bishop. Maybe that's not so strange; all three of them are writers with unique sensibilities and styles, difficult to categorize, wide-ranging in subject matter, and generally brilliant. Or maybe it's a geographical association in my mind. Still, it might be useful information, so I recommend Parks to any other Bishop and Duncan fans out there, too."},{"Title":"The Ogre's Wife - Fairy Tales for Grownups","review":"I finished this easily one afternoon and evening, taking time out between each story to do small chores and odd jobs. The stories are so readable that one is tempted to gobble them like popcorn, and they're too good to be treated that way. You have to let each one sink in before going on to the next. Also, they're all so different in style and content that it's best to come to each one after a short intermission, ready for a different experience. A really fine collection. I'd like to read more by him."},{"Title":"The Ogre's Wife - Fairy Tales for Grownups","review":"If you thrilled to The Brothers Grimm when you were twelve this collection is for you. This short story collection is exceptional and I am sure you will enjoy it. The stories range from fairy tales - not for children - to science fiction to supernatural and all retain a nice distictive style that should leave you with a &quot;Oh Yeah&quot; feeling.Judgement Day is God's monolog and you just have to read it to see where the author takes you. Doing Time In the Wild Hunt says a lot about husbands and wives in a small space and might make you think about picking up some flowers on the way home. Then sit down and read aloud to her, or him, The Orges Wife; the best read-aloud story I have read in a long time. Doppels touches on the same husband/wife theme but in a science fiction setting.

The stories settings are as varied as the charactors and range from the middle ages to the future but all have a core grounded in the commonality of human behavior and relationship dynamics. In one story a young woman is married off to a less than desirable husband but finds a way into a solid relationship and understanding with her spouse using a bit of magic and a bit of common sense. In another a media personality is finally able to shed the burden of fame via something similar to a clone only to find that fleeting fame leaves a void that must be filled.If you enjoy the short fiction of Neil Gaiman; you will enjoy this."},{"Title":"The Ogre's Wife - Fairy Tales for Grownups","review":"I own all the amazing books written by Richard Parks and was fortunate enough to meet him at a dinner where he kindly autographed them all.

But there's more to his stories than sense of wonder and mind-blowing extrapolation. His work is often of the highest literary quality one can -- and should -- expect from a writer of his caliber and standing within the fantasy field. Parks never bothers with re-hashed themes and concepts in his literature. He takes you by the hand, yes, as the story unfolds, but one is always aware of the slight grin of madness on his lips as he gives the story a delicious twist or imbues it with his own inestimable wry humor. A good, broad collection of his work.

This is one of the absolute best collections of single-author stories I've ever read. I'd rate it as high as Wellman'sWho Fears the Devil, but it's possibly even more approachable because it doesn't deal with a single theme as Wellman's excellent collection does. Straight fantasy, oriental fantasy, urban fantasy, and science fiction ... every story is a gem.Jack Vance, John Brunner, Lord Dunsany, Spider Robinson ... they all are great story tellers, and \\"The Ogre's Wife\\" has small reflections of them as well.I suggest skipping Parke Godwin's introduction until after you've read the stories ... it's a tiny bit too revealing for my taste.The book's not perfect ... I have a small complaint about the design of the book. Unlike \\"Worshipping Small Gods\\", which nicely places each story's name at the top of the right-hand page, \\"The Ogre's Wife\\" makes you flip back and see what story you're reading, which is needlessly annoying.I can't determine how the editor/author/publisher arranged the stories ... they're not grouped chronologically, alphabetically, or by theme (although all three Eli Mothersbaugh stories are grouped together), which is always an opportunity lost.If you buy only one book this year, this one should be in the top three you consider.The other two?Worshipping Small GodsandThe Long Look... both by Richard Parks!"},{"Title":"The Ogre's Wife - Fairy Tales for Grownups","review":"This is one of the best books I've read this year.

Oppenheimer was involved with one of the pivotal events of this century and the whole experience comes off like a trip to a neighborhood store.

It's unique among Shakespeare's works in being about Realpolitik in a genuine historical context -- as if a modern American playwright should write a play about George Washington's political compromises, complete with a presentation of the real historical situations that led up to them. Faulconbridge is there to make cynical comments, and yet remain loyal to King John, who almost, but not quite, becomes a child murderer in the course of the action. Earlier, the complexities of wartime politics are revealed when a town refuses to admit either the King of England or the King of France as its rightful ruler until the two kings have fought out the question first -- whereupon the two kings decide to agree on a truce, just long enough to wipe the town out together, then go back to fighting one another. The play is a wonderful mix of history and ironic commentary, one of two plays of Shakespeare's that is entirely in verse (the other one is RICHARD II, which he wrote just before KING JOHN), and it's tragically poetic and satiric in equal measure. Shakespeare never wrote anything else quite like it. If he wrote better plays, they were also different kinds of plays: this one is unique. The Folger edition has excellent notes for beginning students; the Oxford edition is for more advanced students, and also exceptionally good."},{"Title":"The life and death of King John,","review":"King John is one of Shakespeare's least popular plays--unjustly! The play is almost entirely in grand, stately verse, featuring a political struggle intricate and sometimes difficult to follow, and starring a fairly complex though ill-fated villain, the failed King John of England. This annotated edition is excellent: the notes are usually incisive and the several appendices deal in meticulous depth with the play's textual cruces. The introduction is an involved but worthwhile read, and the editor's writing style, though dense, is not unpleasant to read."},{"Title":"The life and death of King John,","review":"Shakespeare's King John contains its fair share of staged action. One man runs on stage holding a head he's just cut off, another character jumps to his death in front of a sympathetic audience, and two kings flamboyantly parade in and out of scenes.But in King John Shakespeare employs another technique to convey that things are happening; his dialogues often pass from one character to another in the _middle_ of a line.The whole play is in verse (most of Shakespeare's plays contain prose passages) in lines of ten syllables, a structure called the iambic pentameter. Reaching the end of the line creates a natural pause in a speech or an exchange. When one character completes his lines, the next character in the dialogue starts his. However, to convey action and urgency, the first character in an exchange says only part of a line and he is then interrupted by the other character who finishes the line without pausing.The clearest use of the technique comes in act III scene iii line 66. In a single line, King John speaks three times and Hubert de Burgh twice.KJ: Death.HB: My Lord?KJ: A grave.HB: He shall not live.KJ: Enough.I can't reproduce the typography that conveys this, but this is really a single line spoken by two people. The replies should be spoken quickly, they need to run into to each other with no pauses at all. If Shakespeare had written an entire line for each reply, it would have sounded like this.KJ: We desire to see Arthur meet his death.HB: My Lord do you really wish this to pass?KJ: I will be clear, have him enter his grave.HB: He shall die; by my hand his life is cut.KJ: We have spoken enough. You conceive me.Well, if Shakespeare _had_ written it he would have written something much better, but you get the point. The long version loses the feeling of action conveyed by the device of having the single line cut into five replies.This is the clearest, boldest, most exciting use of the technique in this play. Shakespeares uses it to illustrate John's tragic flaw at the point that dramatically justifies his death at the conclusion.Vincent Poirier, Tokyo"},{"Title":"The life and death of King John,","review":"the Oxford Shakespeare has been touted as 'a new conception' of Shakespeare, but is in fact merely an update of the cumbersome old Arden editions. Like these, 'King John' begins with a 100-page introduction, divided into 'Dates and Sources' (full of what even the editor admits is 'tedious' nit-picking of documentary evidence); 'The Text' (the usual patronising conjecture about misprints in the Folio edition and illiterate copyists); 'A Critical Introduction', giving a conventional, but illuminating guide to the drama, its status as a political play dealing with the thorny problem of royal succession, the contemporary legal ambiguities surrounding inheritance, the patterning of characters, the use of language (by characters as political manoeuvring, by Shakespeare to subvert them); and an account of 'King John' 'In the Theatre', its former popularity in the 18th and 19th century as a spectacular pageant, the play distorted for patriotic purposes, and its subsequent decline, presumably for the same reasons. The text itself is full of stumbling, often unhelpful endnotes - what students surely want are explanations of difficult words and figures, not a history of scholarly pedantry. The edition concludes with textual appendices.The play itself, as with most of Shakespeare's histories, is verbose, static and often dull. Too many scenes feature characters standing in a rigid tableau debating, with infinite hair-cavilling, issues such as the legitimacy to rule, the conjunction between the monarch's person and the country he rules; the finer points of loyalty. Most of the action takes place off stage, and the two reasons we remember King John (Robin Hood and the Magna Carta) don't feature at all. This doesn't usually matter in Shakespeare, the movement and interest arising from the development of the figurative language; but too often in 'King John', this is more bound up with sterile ideas of politics and history, than actual human truths. Characterisation and motivation are minimal; the conflations of history results in a choppy narrative. There are some startling moments, such as the description of a potential blood wedding, or the account of England's populace 'strangely fantasied/Possessed with rumours, full of idle dreams/Not knowing what they fear, but full of fear'. The decline of the king himself, from self-confident warrior to hallucinating madman, anticipates 'King Lear', while the scene where John's henchman sets out to brand the eyes of the pubescent Pretender, is is full of awful tension.P.S. Maybe I'm missing something, but could someone tell me why this page on 'King John' has three reviews of 'Timon of Athens'? Is somebody having a laugh?"},{"Title":"The life and death of King John,","review":"This is a good play, but it does not match Shakespeare's other history plays. In my opinion too much of the play revolves around a doting mother who wants to see her underage son on the throne even though he is very incapable of ruling. Furthermore, any intelligent observer can see that the King of France only wants Arthur on the crown because a child would be a lot easier to manipulate than the shrewd King John. Remember, John WAS NOT a usurper. Richard the Lionhearted named John as the heir to the crown! On the positive side, Richard I's illegitimate son is a powerful and convincing character. John is an interesting 3 dimensional character. At times he comes off as harsh and cruel. But he also shows himself at times to be to be a strong and competent king. And at times we can feel sorry for him. Shakespeare also manages to squeeze some comical touches in. I feel that to appreciate this play as much as possible, you must realize that Richard I named John the heir to the crown. I also feel you must understand that John did prove himself to be a competent king. (Unlike his unfairly blackened reputation in &quot;Robin Hood.&quot;)"},{"Title":"The life and death of King John,","review":"I recently performed in this play. I had the role of Queen Elinor.

The author gives you an insight into the martial arts world, the medical world, the feelings evoked by relationships, and the mind of a killer. Anyone involved in the martial arts or medial field will appreciate the attention to details. The author has also captured the emotions and conflicts we go through in personal relationships. I can't wait to finish the book but in same respect I hate to see it end. I will write another review when I do finish to be fair... So far though, I would strongly reccomend this book to anyone but especially those in the martial arts or medicine."},{"Title":"Hunter and Hunted","review":"This book is very intense and becomes personal. While reading this book, you become involved in the life of Nathan and his women. Plus - you meet the hunter. He is definitely a \\"sick ticket\\". I lost sleep trying to keep reading and reading!

He protrays the art vividly in this book; its like you are involved in the actual events. The book is a great read, holds your attention and makes you want more!!! The tender scenes are exceptional for a male writer. Buy it..you'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"Hunter and Hunted","review":"Hunter and Hunted is my first full-length novel. It was much more work to get the book into its final form than I would have first ascribed to the process, taking a bit less than a year to write the first draft, but a full year and ahalf to edit into its final form.I set out with the intention to write a book that compares in plot structure to some of my favorite authors novels. If you enjoy John Sandford's Prey Series, involving the character Lucas Davenport, then you should also enjoy this one. Other influences on my writing are John Grisham, Stephen Baldacci, Dean Koontz, and even a little of Tom Clancy. I can only hope that some readers enjoy my story as much as I have enjoyed those several noteworthy mentions to my list of influences.One word about content. I did find myself writing the book with a level of realistic, gritty detail. I did not pull any punches, no pun intended, with the content of the violent or sexual encounters, as they are intrinsic to the story. I merely mention this in the review so that parents who do not wish to expose their children to that type of writing can withhold the book for themselves, and not make of it a birthday present to a child. As an example, I would not let my own 12-year-old daughter read it now, but I wouldn't think twice about giving it to her when she is sixteen. Just my thought.I put a Five-Star rating on this review, because I'm the first review, and I wrote it. Thus, I'm quite biased, but I've got nothing but positive feedback from all who have read Hunter and Hunted, so I feel confident that if you enjoy suspense thrillers with an action bent, you'll like my book. -- J3"},{"Title":"THE BILLIONAIRE DRIFTER","review":"If I could give this book less than one star I would. It reminded me why I don't really like these continuity series'. If you get drawn into the series you almost have to read every book (no matter how bad it might be) just to get all of the pieces. Honey Evans as a slightly ditzy peripheral character in The Player was barely tolerable. As the main character in The Billionaire Drifter she is totally intolerable. I have rarely read a book with a heroine so immature and stupid. She has the emotional maturity and impulse control of a two year old and like a two year old it gets tiresome very quickly. I really didn't buy Honey's \\"poor litle misunderstood rich girl\\" routine in the least and wanted someone in her family to give her a good talking to. Unfortunately, even though everyone is supposed to be gathered for her brother's wedding, (which she bails on right in the middle) she couldn't be bothered to sit down with any of them long enough. She sets out to have sex with a man she knows nothing about and when it does happen (after she practically jumps on him) there is no mention of birth control at all! Let's hope no impressionable teens read that! I really liked Max and thought he deserved someone with more maturity and emotional stability. I don't see a happily ever after for these two characters. The minute Max had \\"expectations\\" of Honey, she would go out and do something rash - like have an affair. Even the rallying around of Honey by the other characters was a bit contrived. Why in the world did these people trust her to be discreet. The only reason I finished this book was to get the next bit in the Family Secrets saga. If you are buying these books and need this one for the Proof of Purchase go out and buy it, otherwise ask someone who has had the misfortune to read this book what you need to know to keep you in the Family Secrets Loop."},{"Title":"THE BILLIONAIRE DRIFTER","review":"Very reminiscent of Jilly Cooper and despite the heroine's antics, I found her likeable. I loved Bird's writing style and this will not be my last Beverly Bird book though it is my first. The pace is light, fun and just the book to de-stress with. The poor-little-rich-girl routine can get a little grating as Max's paranoia regarding the invasion of his privacy. If he's that obsessed about being left alone he should go buy his own private island! After all, he's a billionaire. As for Honey, she has a zest for life and adventure but is in need a of a good spanking and some maturing. Nevertheless, the zaniness of the entire situation is an enjoyable diversion and Max is your typical gorgeous hunk. I don't blame Honey for pursuing him with such energy!"},{"Title":"Torah Commentary for Our Times: Genesis (Torah Commentary for Our Times)","review":"I found this book extremely helpful for my beginners Torah Study.

Realistic and truly helpful!"},{"Title":"Visiting Mr. Green - Acting Edition","review":"There is plenty to like about this play by Jeff Baron, who has written more for television and film. The premise, in which a young corporate man is compelled by a judge to make regular visits to an elderly Jewish man he struck with his car, is loaded with opportunities for character conflict and humor. Initially the men, who are of different generations and different attitudes about their &quot;Jewishness,&quot; are so badly matched the playwright has to cash in some disbelief credit to keep the arrangement going. The terms of their friendship tug at the heartstrings with the neatness and economy of a television 'dramedy.'If you ask more than this of an evening of theatre, for perhaps a deeper and more surprising exploration of a dramatic theme, you will find the water shallow here. Moreover, the playwright's orientation toward film and video shows via some unwieldy scene changes. At one point, the playwright orders the hopelessly cluttered apartment to be spic and span after a blackout between scenes - not after an act break, which would be more practical. The camera can do that; in theatre, we have to move things around in real time.The dialogue is quick, lean, and pretty funny. It might be a wonderful television special, and is much closer to a teleplay than dramatic literature."},{"Title":"Visiting Mr. Green - Acting Edition","review":"This little book, the published script for a play I am currently appearing in, was a real find!

For these offer a chance to at least share the cost and risk of the research, if not necessarily the other downstream costs.The book was written in 1992, but it is at least as relevant now. It has a collection of papers discussing how and when consortia should be formed, and the constraints under which they should operate. Semiconductor and electronics industries are well represented here. One paper is by Robert Noyce, who co-invented the integrated circuit; a seminal event. He studies Sematech, the semiconductor alliance that was formed partly in response to fears of Japanese electronics firms in the 1980s.Technology transfer is the key theme threading the papers. Even if a consortium has found research results, it is not successful until these have been handed off and then used by its members.The papers are substantive. Very little high level fluff or marketing hype."},{"Title":"Saddletramp","review":"This is a fun book for anyone. Jeremy has a great way of telling a story and its a great story.

It is written in general terms, and differences between the ELCA and LC-MS are noted when appropriate. The book is useful to any synod.As the title suggests, it explains the Lutheran Liturgy. The first chapter describes the physical layout of the church building, why the minisiter wears the colors s/he does when, and the church year.The second chapter covers the invocation and the confession; the third chapter the entrance hymn, greeting, kyrie, and hymn of praise, and so on through the chapters, with the eighth containing the Lamb Of God, Dismissal, Post-Communion Canticle, Prayer, and The Blessing. There is a good bibliography in the back. The table of contents resembles what is listed in the Bulletin during Sunday worship services.The tone of the book is very casual, and the author explains some things like what the X in XMAS stands for and what IHS means. He briefly discusses the different ways of receiving communion; for example, why we sometimes stand for communion, why we sometimes sit for communion, and who may receive communion in the Lutheran Church.It is an easy read and I strongly recommend the book for anyone attending Lutheran Church services; it answer the questions of \\"why is the pastor doing that?\\" and \\"why is the pastor wearing purple today?\\""},{"Title":"Exploring Our Lutheran Liturgy","review":"I'm an adult convert to the Lutheran church and I wish we had had this book to study going through New Members class. Now, I'm playing catch up with this book and finally understanding so much of what is done in the liturgy. I gave the book only four stars as it's a bit short on detail on some things. For example, the sanctuary candle gets about two lines none of which explain that this tradition goes all the way back to the synagogues of the Jews, and is a sign of the abiding presence of God. Great book though for those new to the Lutheran faith."},{"Title":"How To Handle Your Cranky and Stressed Out Parents: A Teen Survival Guide","review":"If we'd had \\"How to Handle Your Cranky and Stressed Out Parents: A Teen Survival Guide\\" when our kids were teens, they might have grown up smarter and left home.Instead, they keep coming back, just like Michael Corleone in Godfather III.Parents need this book as much as their teens and tweens.

My two main complaints are (1) I have a very hard time trusting an author who admits that she tricked her husband into pregnancy, and (2) the text is very repetetive, saying the same things, over and over and over, leaving me to wonder whether this was necessary to make a book out of what amounts to little substance."},{"Title":"Motherhood After Miscarriage","review":"What a wonderful book. A friend of mine gave me this book after I miscarried at three months. I was so devastated. I had many friends and family who were willing to be there and do anything for me, but I didn't want to talk to anyone really until after I read this book. It was so comforting to me to know I was not alone and that others felt the way I did. I couldn't put this book down until I was finished.

The clear explanations helped me to understand the miscarriage and gave me concrete reasons that made sense to my head. Ms. Diamond's book also helped my heart by explaining to me that I wasn't alone (I thought I was) and that miscarriage doesn't make you less a woman.I think this book ought to be recommended by every OBGYN or Family Practice doctor who deals with patients who have miscarriages."},{"Title":"Motherhood After Miscarriage","review":"I purchased Motherhood... 2 weeks after my miscarriage and I wished I had gotten it sooner.

Having gone through a \\"missed miscarriage\\" myself, I sought an explanation for what had happened but I also was looking for some motivational support in preparing to try again. In my opinion, the book became very scientific and confusing and I slowly became uninterested and started to bounce around to different chapters. Even though the author suggests that all women should keep trying, though some won't, I didn't feel the author provided much emotional or motivational support that I was looking for and walked away feeling concerned, doubtful, sad, worried, anxious and confused. I've decided that this book was not for me and have put it away with all my other books and doubt I will ever go back to it.

If you are looking for a book that makes you \\"feel better\\" then this one may not be the best (although if you read it carefully, it does that too).

Many of us practitioners found it an extraordinary book when it first came out because it deliberately gave away the precise details of how a major consultancy uncovers the drivers of 'unwritten rules' - in an Appendix that takes up about a third of the book. This is still the only Systems-Thinking-Meets-Culture book that tells you 'How to do it'. Even the famousThe Fifth Discipline Fieldbook: Strategies and Tools for Building a Learning Organizationdidn't get anywhere close. In contrast, anyone who followed Scott-Morgan's instructions could follow in his footsteps. I still do. I'm now reading Scott-Morgan's latest bookThe Reality of Global Crises: Why good beginnings are ending badly and leaving world-leaders increasingly powerlessand I realize that over the last twenty years he's applied the same overall approach across almost every bit of the global economy - which is what made me look back at the book that started it all!

The concept is original, as is the framework of Strategy, Process, Resources and Organization in the context of which the analysis (and presumably management consulting) is performed. Beyond these two ideas the book suffers from a variety of flaws.The language is stilted and regimented into an outline, which prevents a free flowing narrative that would be more appropriate to a case study method. Very little underlying theory is given for the concepts, but more importantly, for the methodology of identifying informal culture in an organization. The author presents many examples, but very little reason as to why and what he is doing.His section on conducting an interview is almost a textbook example of the non-directed interview technique from psychology, and rather than concentrating on which questions to ask and what to look for, he instead gives us the amount of hours details of the brainstorming ritual that his consulting company performs.The language of the book is unprofessional and it steers away from scientific terminology; the book is written in short soundbites and that contributes to the pop management feel of the whole work. The examples of the informal mores are generic and appear similar across his cases - job hop, keep your boss happy, protect your own turf, and yet the author fails to give any observations on this being the weakeness of the corporate exec culture as a whole. He mentions Machiavelianism, but at the same time fails to address corporate politics with any degree of satisfaction. I am not sure if this is a poorly written memoir of the man's professional career or if this is a marketing ploy for his consultancy."},{"Title":"School of natural healing: The reference volume on natural herbs for the teacher, student or herbal practitioner","review":"There are some books that are simply the best.

This man has a thorough and accurate understanding of herbs and their uses. He was a Master Herbalist and I have many books on this subject...this one, however, is the 20th anniversary, expanded version issue and is the Bible of them all. I promise you, even if you're traveling, you will want to keep it with you. His personal life story is a miracle to me, he was an abandoned child found by some loving people in an orphanage when he was a young boy. And what a contribution to humanity this man has made! It's the best book that exist about the use of herbs. Also, helps you to identify plants and tells you what parts to use. I love his work, it's written for all the right reasons, he had been critically ill in his youth and his work sprung from those hardships. It is inspired!"},{"Title":"School of natural healing: The reference volume on natural herbs for the teacher, student or herbal practitioner","review":"Dr. Christopher was an amazing pioneer in herbal medicine. The thick, lengthy book will never leave the wondering mind hungry, delving deeply into a variety of herbs with insightful personal usage, history, and formulas. The book begins with paragraphs under different conditions, but the heart of the book is the herbal details, where Christopher clearly expresses his love, admiration, and faith in natural medicine. He cites other herbalists such as Thomson and Shook, following in the same vein of thought as Eclectics before him, stretching it even further with personal opinions and sage advise. While some of the output is slightly dated, most of it is not, still stands as true today, and will always be invaluable information.If you're ever seeking a reference guide for herbs, this is surely the one, as Christopher goes as far as to describe in a detailed, eye-catching way the habitat, full description from leaf to odor to flower to taste to stem, to properties, dose, preparation, therapeutic action, oral/anal/skin administration of all. So many herbs are covered in such rich detail it's impossible not to use this as a guide when learning a new herb. As many Eclectics were, Christopher was a big fan of the herb Lobelia, devoting here an entire chapter on it alone. However, the old \\"puke your brains out\\" use is now considered unsafe and outdated, but some of the herbs recommendations still stand strong today.After the massive herbal index is read, there's a marvelous chapter on collecting herbs, preparing them in a huge amount of way, from tinctures to compounds to cerates to suppositories to pills to capsules to washes and baths, and much more.Formulas are here in every chapter, from older ones passed down from other great herbalists to lesser knowns, from Christopher himself and what he used in his personal practice, and from general herbal combinations that go under each herb in its own section. He wraps up the book with two great glossaries, and a chapter exclusively discussing his 'mucusless diet', an eating regimen still followed actively to this day. Of course the preceeding chapter brings up the regenerative diet, dietary recommendations on certain food substances, proper ways of living besides herbal therapy, and some deliciously appealing culinary recipes to whip up in the kitchen for a healthful treat.Out of the dozens of herbal books I own, this is one of those I turn to the most, for the knowledge in here is thrilling, and the knowledge almost overwhelming since it covers so much. Well worth the price, Dr. Christopher's name is a household one among herbalists for a good reason."},{"Title":"School of natural healing: The reference volume on natural herbs for the teacher, student or herbal practitioner","review":"All of my teachers and mentors, from Rosemary Gladstar to Michael Tierra have all touted Dr. Christopher and this book!

The 25th edition would be the only one I would by as it is updated for measurements, as well as having complete formulations for every one of Christophers' remedies. As someone new to Herbs, I was able to pick up information useable to me right away and apply it.The book includes excellent cross references for Latin and common names for herbs, as well as copious names used for each herb in case your vernacular calls the plant by a different name (also includes international names).

This is not a book about how emotional and mental disturbances are treated today, and some of the ways the evidence was found are frankly barbaric, like common use of lobotomy and shock treatment. The author was a doctor in and director of more than one mental institution and he draws from his experience, without naming names and having (according to the introduction) altered the circumstances enough to conceal identities. However, despite these drawbacks, quite a few things that are still known to be true today are discussed, and the foundations from which the current reaches of cognitive neuroscience, neurology, and clinical psychology and psychiatry grew can be discerned and are decently covered (though certainly not enough for a neurophysiology course, still well to the benefit of a curious layman). Something as well of a period piece, the main thrust is an attempt at systematic analysis of the brain's regions' functions. The author's conclusions are not belied by the body of evidence amassed and analyzed since it was published, though they are considerably extended these days and some avenues of his speculation have turned out to be dry riverbeds that end suddenly in the middle of nowhere. Still, a great introduction even after all these years."},{"Title":"The Human Brain","review":"John Pfeiffer's THE HUMAN BRAIN is the wonderful story of the most complex and mysterious structure in the universe -- how it developed, how it works, what happens when it goes wrong.

Besides the usual basics, he gives suggestions for each plant on how to grow and use it well (pot, trellis, in shrubbery, etc.), how to start seed, how to overwinter it (if applicable), when to pinch back, which varieties are most floriferous/hardy, etc.He's also very readable -- engaging, often humorous, a bit like talking to a friend about favorite plants.My only regret is that there aren't more pictures, particularly of the less well-known species.

It is safe to say that if we have not been abused, we know one or several women who have been. Jan Coates, author of Set Free: God's Healing Power for Abuse Survivors and Those Who Love Them, weaves throughout the book the stories of several abuse survivors who have risen from the depths of abuse and have been transformed and restored through God's healing power of love.Coates' book serves to remind survivors that what happened to them is not their fault; and that they are valuable and worthy to call on God; to leave their past behind; and to be given a peaceful heart. It also is helpful for survivors to read about others and to know that they too can really rise up and be healed.Set Free is helpful for counselors, pastors, friends and also family members. Often people don't understand a survivor's attitudes or destructive behaviors. The stories explain how abuse affects people.In the back of the book, Coates has provided an 1) extensive resource list, 2) a simple guide to reaching a place of peace with God, and 3) staggering facts about child abuse in the United States.If this book serves no other purpose than to help a survivor begin the journey to restoration, or help someone close to them understand an abuse survivor, or recognize a victim so they can help, it is a resounding success."},{"Title":"Set Free: God's Healing Power for Abuse Survivors and Those Who Love Them","review":"Jan Coates was a victim of abuse, and turned her brokenness into a power for good helped by the grace of God. She bonded with many who were also victims and became an instrument in their healing. This book gives hope to those in despair and are searching for a solution to their problem.However, I was not convinced by the stories of those who recovered. There did not seem to be a substantive relationship between cause and effect, between God's grace and healing. Somehow I had a feeling that some of the healing stories were contrived. We cannot account for miracles, or the effects of God's grace, but somehow there were just too many miracles to make the stories creditable. One of the needs of people who have been abused is hope; for some this book will be an answer to their prayer."},{"Title":"Set Free: God's Healing Power for Abuse Survivors and Those Who Love Them","review":"Jan Coates knows what it's like to hurt.

But if you've been the victim or love one of the survivors, you hope for answers. Set Free may just be what you're looking for.Jan Coates writes candidly about the struggles of abuse in Set Free. She threads her own story along with six other women in an honest journey to be healed with God's power.Coates does not snap her fingers to invoke spontaneous healing. On the contrary, sometimes the road is long. Jan admits the struggle, explores the road to recovery, and provides resources--all strengths in Set Free.It's not easy to read about abuse, but in this fractured age there are generations of walking wounded who need to know there is hope. Jan Coates and others have been Set Free to speak to the pain."},{"Title":"Set Free: God's Healing Power for Abuse Survivors and Those Who Love Them","review":"Jan Coates has written a collection of stories from the lives of abuse survivors including herself.

Years prior to that life-altering event, though, Jan wrestled with the shame and guilt that plagues victims of child abuse.Jan handed her life and her past over to Jesus Christ in 1983, and has witnessed his gentle, restorative work in her heart and life. SET FREE is her gift to the world: a collection of touching, powerful stories by real women who were abused, yet rose above the pain and sense of hopelessness, with God's help. This book encourages those who have lived the nightmare of abuse; those who have found their way out; and those who need to understand that Jesus provides a way through any situation, no matter how grim. He is able to rescue us and heal us to the core.Eleven chapters are followed by well-researched statistics, sources of help, discussion questions for implementing the book as a tool for group support, and more. My hat's off to Jan Coates for allowing God to mold her, use her, and share his love through this excellent book."},{"Title":"Set Free: God's Healing Power for Abuse Survivors and Those Who Love Them","review":"There is a crushing ache in every fiber of some women that longs to be set free from the grips of bondage of childhood abuse. Things like simple love, compassion, communication, and friendship are what these women long for but can't seem to access. Abuse from childhood doesn't stop the second a child or adult is lifted out of an abusive situation.Jan Coates, author of Set Free, shares stories of women who not only hit rock bottom from abuse but literally were set free from being a victim of torment and degradation. In each story the woman blossoms into a completely new person reborn to a life of love, hope, and a future.Set Free is a book for everyone who has been a victim of physical, emotional, verbal, or sexual abuse. Whether you've been abused or live with someone who has been abused, you will be encouraged as you read the stories in Set Free and become part of someone's healing recovery."},{"Title":"Set Free: God's Healing Power for Abuse Survivors and Those Who Love Them","review":"Jan Coates offers hope and help to abuse survivors in her book, Set Free.

For victims of abuse, Set Free can be a powerful tool to steer them to the path of recovery via the love of God.The back of the book is filled with helpful tools which make Set Free more than a self-help book that will end up unread on a shelf.

These are amazing books that are so well written!"},{"Title":"Showdown At Yellow Butte - The Louis L'amour Collection","review":"This Louis L'Amour novel is another variation of the familiar plot of land ownership vs. squatters but with a different twist. A ruthless speculator wants to wrest control of an area where a great cache of Spanish gold may be hidden and hires an outfit of hard cases to get rid of the settlers and their town of Yellow Butte. The story is similar to L'Amour's \\"The Tall Stranger\\", with the same elements of a super cowboy, murdering gunslingers and romance in place. A mysterious grulla, a mouse-colored pony, seems to be the key to the puzzle and points the hero straight to the source of all the mayhem and murder. A nice story in the L'Amour tradition of justice and fair play."},{"Title":"Showdown At Yellow Butte - The Louis L'amour Collection","review":"This is one of the early books written by Louis L'Amour, dating from a 1953 ACE paperback book released under the 'Jim Mayo' name he was using at the time. While the manuscript was first published as a short story under the title \\"Showdown On The Hogback\\".The story is pretty straight forward with a man, Tom Kedrick, being hired in New Orleans by an organization named Burwick, Keith, and Gunter, trying to gain money from the government by evicting the \\"squatters, outlaws, renegades, and wasters\\", from certain lands in the area of Mustang and Yellow Butte. Kedrick quickly finds out in the town of Yellow Butte that the people on the land have been there some as long as ten years with many others at least a couple years. They are honest, hardworking people and they are about to be swindled by the Burwick, Keith, and Gunter 'land combine'.Also, the organization is aware, as the settlers are not, that all this land will soon be set aside by the U.S. Government as a preserve and reservation as areas for the Navajho and Ute Indian tribes. Now that Tom Kendrick realizes what is about to happen he finds himself smack-dab in the middle of a shooting war with lead throwing gunhands on each side. Through the pages that follow events transpire quickly leading to a final, deadly showdown at Yellow Butte.An early story from the pen of Louis L'Amour from the days of pulp westerns and later as a best selling ACE and Bantam softcover western.Semper Fi."},{"Title":"Showdown At Yellow Butte - The Louis L'amour Collection","review":"This book, though a classic regular western as any of the other L'amours is not what you could call the best, like Daybreakers, or Last stand at Papago wells. The action part is not as fast paced as usual, with less emotions emanating in you. Moreover, the courting and love part is also desultry. If you generally like the westerns of L'amour, you can read it in one go, but the high points are few and far apart."},{"Title":"One River Many Wells","review":"Matthew Fox has outdone himself with this work, taking similar themes from the works of mystics spanning diverse traditions. To those who are regular consumers of Fox's writings, this compellation provides a &quot;Bible&quot; for his idea of &quot;Deep Ecumenism&quot;. It is as complete a tome of humanity's spiritual knowledge that I have seen on the bookshelf. The best part- Fox has included sources not just from typical religious sources, but from science and literature as well."},{"Title":"One River Many Wells","review":"Fox is giving the hounds of the status quo a run for their money with this near encyclopedic outline about fighting the good fight. Those with an open mind and heart will find much food for thoughtful contemplation here. Fox admits his book is in no way complete. That it is meant to be suggestive of what future Scriptures will and must contain; wisdom from all Wisdom traditions, a bias in favor of what we have in common; a religious humility that lets traditions other than our own speak for themselves; a use of primary sources; God as experience, not doctrine... Fox succeeds in his stated goal.This book is an encouragement for fighting the good fight. For becoming a spiritual warrior. Anyone can be a soldier telling the Emperor or their Priest or their Boss what he or she wants to hear. Being a warrior means taking a stand. A warrior has a dignity a soldier never realizes. The warrior fights his holy wars with internal enemies before going on any external jihad. The enemies of personal pride and greed and such. Anyone can be a brute, or a terrorist, in the name of God or Country. Fox points out that even in Islam there is a distinction between a lesser and a greater jihad. The greater jihad being that struggle against one's own demons. As the Sufi mystic Hafiz states, battle without love, can render a person mad. As I like to say, it does not matter what a person believes if they don't have love in their heart.With that said, \\"One River, Many Wells\\" is well worth the read. It is a very good outline to work from regarding one's own spiritual journey. Fox brings to light what Meister Eckhart said 700 years ago, \\"God is like a great underground river.\\" Thus \\"One River, Many Wells\\" is short for One Underground River (Source, God), Many sacred Wells-religious traditions. Again, as I like to say, God speaks to anyone that will listen. To meditate is to dig one's own sacred well. Be still and know that I am God. There are no atheists in Foxholes."},{"Title":"One River Many Wells","review":"This book by Matthew Fox is a wealth of information derived from many sources, the Old and New Testaments (Bible), the Koran, the Vedas, African religious traditions, Native American, Celtic sources, and Buddhism. Writing it must have been a huge undertaking but amazingly, the information flows *naturally* as it reveals the outpouring of Spirit in the lives of mankind throughout the world and over the millenia. Many of the experiences described are words which attempt to capture Divinity at work through particular individuals, societies, and their outcomes. The book is an *essential* exploration of mankind's relationship to each other, community, the earth, and the cosmos. It is an exploration of the meaning of Life itself. Like a previous reviewer, I had difficulty getting started. Initially, I tried reading it straight through but could not. Gradually, at different times, glancing at the chapters, I felt a surge of energy. The ideas and concepts explored by the author set my emotions and mind at ease. Eventually, I was able to \\"plunge in\\" and \\"swim\\" through the material with relative ease.The book is divided into five sections, \\"Relating to Creation\\", \\"Relating to Divinity\\", \\"Relating to Ourselves: Paths to Encounter and Enlightenment\\", \\"Relating to the Future: What the Divine is Asking of Us\\", and \\"Where Do We Go from Here? How Deep Ecumenism Explodes our Imaginations with Eighteen New Myths and Visions\\". Each section has further subdivisions where the author expands on specific themes, such as, Creation, Light, Community, the Names of God, Form, Formlessness, Nothingness, the Divine Feminine, Meditation, Mindfulness, Art and Ritual, Joy, Suffering, and Dying, Resurrection and Reincarnation, the Spiritual Warrior and other topics. Each theme is given a thorough examination connecting many different cultural viewpoints and providing unique insights. The author's vast experience in the realm or religion and personal enlightenment, along with his courage to tackle controversial subjects is greatly appreciated and admired.The author's vision for mankind is very broad and inclusive ... he sees beyond the barriers of dogmatic belief, ritual, and any other differences that separate people. He gets down to *personal* experiences as expressed by the Great Spirit of Life in the vast expanse of time both from the past, in the present and future. The subject is spiritual expression in the lives of humanity and how the many different ideas and experiences have only One source. This is a very highly recommended book for anyone who is interested in comparative religions and spirituality. Also recommended is \\"One Heart\\" by Bonnie Louise Kuchler. Her book is an excellent source of quotations and meditations from different religions and spiritual practices. It is a less complex but similar work. Many readers who find Matthew Fox too deep would benefit from her book.
