While that may sound boring the book does it in such a way to bring a chuckle to your lips and a smile to your eyes. Was this you as a kid?

Hall large print for young readers)","review":"I remember reading The Phantom Tollbooth as a child, but not much else about it, so when I was given the chance to revisit the book as an adult, I was pretty excited. What I got wasn't what I remembered - while I remembered the wondrous and imaginative world that Justus created, what I had forgotten is how silly and anarchic the whole book is; if you can imagine Alice in Wonderland as written for logophiles, you'll be on the right track. Absolutely stuffed full of puns, wordplay, clever turns of phrase, and all sorts of clever inventions, The Phantom Tollbooth works completely fine as an adventure story, and it's on that level that my five-year-old absolutely loved it. After all, a young boy who finds himself in a strange land with a faithful dog on a quest for princesses? Pure fun for a small child. But as an adult and a lover of words, The Phantom Tollbooth is crammed so full of wordplay that it's even more fun to read as an adult just so you can see how whimsical and looney the whole book really is. Here's a book with bees that love spelling, people who take your senses (think about it), a Which (who helps people choose which word to say) who's often mistaken for a Witch, and so much more. More than that, the book works well both as an adventure and as an allegory for the search for knowledge; although it's clear that Milo is working to learn more about the world and expand beyond his horizons, watching how Justus underlines all that with his characters and personifications is pretty wonderful. It's really no wonder that The Phantom Tollbooth is still read and loved all these years later; no matter how much time has passed, its love of language, sense of pure imagination (my favorite example might be the sunset conductor), and whimsical story make it a pure delight to read, no matter how old you are or how many of Justus's joke's you're immediately getting."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

He opens the package anyway, and sets up a little tollbooth in his room according to the instruction pamphlet that came with it. Should he be not satisfied with his time using the tollbooth, a full refund (of his time) would be returned to him.

Hall large print for young readers)","review":"As a mother who screens everything her 13-year-old daughter reads, what I'd really love to happen is for said daughter to read everything *I've* ever read as a child. Sadly, a number of books I loved as a child are out-of-print, although I can still scour the Internet for old, used copies. Happily, one of my absolute favourites, by Enid Blyton, \\"The Land of Far Beyond\\", falls into that category. Lauded as \\"The Pilgrim's Progress\\" for children at the time, it is still one of my favourite books to date - and, in many ways, \\"The Phantom Tollbooth\\" is set up similarly, but with more of a secular appeal.\\"The Phantom Tollbooth\\" is one of those books that I've seen in a number of 4th Grade reading lists - even as said daughter, in her review of the book below, points out that the book itself is labeled \\"6th Grade Reading Level.\\" The two huge lessons I was hoping said daughter would get out of \\"The Phantom Tollbooth\\" are: (1) a LOT can happen / can be accomplished in just one hour; (2) there is NEVER a reason to be bored: just take a good look around, especially nowadays. I honestly can't tell if those lessons got through just yet - but it's still just the start of summer this year, so if I don't hear \\"There's nothing to do!\\" for the next three months, I'll be more than happy!For myself, yes, \\"The Phantom Tollbooth\\" is one of those increasingly rare reads that gets better with time, and, not only that - I'm going to be digging up my old copy of \\"The Land of Far-Beyond\\" now ... it's been a while since I took that journey! Said daughter's review of \\"The Phantom Tollbooth\\" follows:\\" 'The Phantom Tollbooth' by Norton Juster was an interesting, humorous read about what happens when a person stops thinking.\\"When Milo opened up the package addressed to 'Milo, who has plenty of time', he figured that it would probably be some unimportant thing. But it's a phantom tollbooth, and soon Milo is in the Lands Beyond, where nothing is logical, and everything is illogical. Milo will never be the same again. Readers will cheer on Milo as he meets the literal watchdog Tock (who ticks), the Humbug, the rulers of Digitopolis and Dictionopolis, and travels across the Land of Expectations, Island of the Conclusions, Mountain of Ignorance and more, all in his quest to find the Princess Sweet Rhyme and Princess Pure Reason.\\"Nowadays, when a book is labeled '6th Grade Reading Level', it's usually because the author uses simple words, a slightly complicated plotline, and maybe a few pictures. However, even though Juster *did* use relatively simple words, and the plotline was straightforward (boy ends up in mysterious land and rescues 2 princesses, and along the way many strange things happen to him), and there *were* a lot of pictures, I think that this book should be 'for all ages', because while a 6th grader can enjoy this book, a grown-up can enjoy this book as well - and can also probably learn from it. Too many people nowadays are just like Milo - existing, eating, drinking, breathing - but they don't *think*. And if we don't think, then we are wasting precious time.\\"I would give the book five stars: two stars for the plot, two stars for the characters, and one star for the places in the book.\\""},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

I only got a snip-it of the book, but as soon as I heard it, I was hooked. I had to have this book! I loved the book so much that I scoured through hundreds of websites to find the book and found \`The Phantom Tollbooth' on Amazon.com.The Phantom Tollbooth, written by Norton Juster, is an excellent story about a boy named Milo, who encounters a tollbooth in the middle of his small room. It doesn't come with a letter, note or a card. When Milo decides to enter the booth, he encounters a watchdog named Tock (who ticks) in the mysterious lands of the Doldrums. Soon later, Tock takes Milo to Dictionopolis, the Kingdom of Words, where Milo is offered a quest to save the princesses of sweet rhyme and pure reason. But there is just one problem, their journey is very treacherous and can only be done with a creature that knows the way. The Humbug, a grumpy old cockroach volunteers to save the princesses with his identic memory of the map to save them.The quest soon becomes difficult after demons come after them. One by one the demons get closer and closer to Milo, a sweet boy who doesn't seem to enjoy anything, and continue to distract him. Will he survive? Will he save the princesses?This book is hard to understand for young children due to the constant clich&eacute;s and play-on words. For example, when the character Milo said, \\"This couldn't be a better day,\\" his body jumped to an island named Conclusions. I would recommend this book to people who like to read action-packed, nerve-wracking books. I suggest that this book should be read from the ages of 11 to 65 years old or anybody that likes a good, old classic book.The Phantom Tollbooth is equal to the Harry Potter Series. Norton Juster's fantasy novel is in the same genre as J.K. Rowling's and they're both about a child entering a new world for them. It takes both Harry and Milo time to adjust to a new place and make friends. One thing that is better about The Phantom Tollbooth is the constant clich&eacute;s and idioms.Overall, I strongly recommend this book to anyone who picks it up.

Rushing through life to get from home to school and back again with no other purpose than to just get there, he is a quite unhappy little boy. What's the meaning of his life when nothing seems to matter at all? Milo, like so many of us, needs a good kick in the pants and he receives just that when he arrives home one afternoon to find a very big, not-quite-square-not-quite-round box sitting in the corner of his room. Inside is a magical tollbooth that transports him and his tiny electric car to the kingdom of Wisdom. There, he meets a special watchdog named Tock who encourages him to travel to Dictionopolis, the city where words mean everything, and where Milo learns about the terrible conditions that have set in since the banishment of the kingdom's two princesses, Rhyme and Reason. The king of Dictionopolis, Azaz the Unabridged, at war with his brother the Mathemagician in Digitopolis (who, of course, believes that numbers are the only important thing in life), begs for Milo's help in restoring peace and sanity to the kingdom. Saddened by all that he sees, Milo agrees to help rescue the princesses from their castle in the air. To do so, he must traverse the dangerous countryside, avoiding the desperate fates like jumping to Conclusions and living in Ignorance and a variety of menacing creatures like The Terrible Trivium and The Demon of Insincerity. More importantly, he learns some very important lessons about life (\\"the only thing you can do easily is be wrong, and that's hardly worth the effort.\\") in his encounters with an amusing cast of characters including Chroma the Great, who orchestrates the colors of the world, the Soundkeeper and the 0.58 boy (of the average family with 2.58 children). When he finally reaches the castle, Milo receives the ultimate lesson from the sisters themselves: \\"You must never feel badly about making mistakes,\\" explained Reason quietly, \\"as long as you take the trouble to learn from them. For you often learn more by being wrong for the right reasons than you do by being right for the wrong reasons.\\" \\"But there's so much to learn,\\" he said, with a thoughtful frown. \\"Yes, that's true,\\" admitted Rhyme; \\"but it's not just learning things that's important. It's learning what to do with what you learn and learning why you learn things at all that matters.\\" After returning them to their rightful place, he heads home to find that he's only been gone an hour but that, in that short bit of time, his entire life has changed because he's looking at everything in a completely new, somewhat wiser way!It is no wonder that dictionary.com's daily blog, The Hot Word, recently reviewed the creative employment of language in this splendid work. The book is classified as children's literature but Juster's imaginative use of words to teach significant life principles will be appreciated even more by adults. Logophiles like me will laugh at his silly puns and giggle at his clever wordplay as much as any child, but (hopefully) won't miss the wisdom that lies beneath! It, more than the entertainment appeal of the book, is what makes this short read a classic."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"My favorite book from childhood. Edible letters and numbers...Engaging all the senses, wonder and innocence of a child's mind."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"This gem of a book is replete with double entendres, allegorical characters, idiomatic expressions, clever wordplay and trenchant wit. Juster peppers his novel with plenty of themes, but they don't slow down the story's progression. Some of his themes have to do with city dwellers, perhaps not coincidentally given that Juster was awarded a grant from The Ford Foundation to write a children's book about urban perception, or how people experience cities. He kept putting off writing that book and instead began writing what later became The Phantom Tollbooth.In Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, falling down the rabbit hole opens up a whole fantasy world for Alice much as the discovery of the phantom tollbooth does for a boy named Milo in this book of the same title. The phantom tollbooth is Milo's ticket out of boredom and into a fantasy world from which he is reticent to leave. Milo's trusty companion is a talking watchdog named Tock, a dog with the body of a loudly ticking alarm clock with parallels to the talking, clothed rabbit with a watch in Carroll's classic novel.Milo is an unhappy boy who lives in an unnamed city and who doesn't know what to do with himself. He's convinced that learning things is a tremendous waste of time. Despite an abundance of toys, books, games and other objects he can't seem to find anything which interests him until one day when he notices an enormous package left on one side of his room. Inside is a turnpike tollbooth complete with a map of places Milo has never heard of before.With nary a thought to dissuade him, Milo hops inside a small, electronic automobile that he hadn't driven in months, deposits a coin into the tollbooth and finds himself speeding along on an unfamiliar country highway, sensing adventure at long last.Juster tackles several themes -- learning from our mistakes, learning for knowledge sake, the importance of being receptive to learning, having the right perspective so that we can see clearly, appreciating all the small things in life and not taking things for granted, and believing in yourself.The book's overarching theme concerns the importance of having both commonsense wisdom and an education. If that sounds cut-and-dried, rest assured, in Juster's fantasy world, it's anything but."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

Meanwhile, it takes its own advice in creating a grand adventure worthy or spending our time on. It is the greatest book I know of."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"Norton Juster knows how to get into the part of a child's mind that revels in fantasy, but also shows kids the importance of knowledge and learning and using their minds. I love the \\"Phantom Tollbooth\\" as it is one of those books I was read as a child. I am proud to own it and my kids can't wait to get to the next chapter to see what happens next."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"The Phantom Tollbooth by Norton Juster is a fiction novel that is truly a doorway into another reality. A children's book by category, it will appeal to younger readers for its sense of adventure and captivating story line. However, older readers will be able to better appreciate some of the concepts that are explored by Milo, Tock and the Humbug while traveling through the Kingdom of Wisdom.We meet Milo at the beginning of the book as a young boy that is already jaded with life, and in a state of constant ennui. Lacking interest in school or hobbies, he merely hurries from here to there without any purpose in life. \\"Nothing really interested him-least of all the things that should have.\\" One day he goes home to find a mysterious package in his room, which he opens to find \\"ONE GENUINE TURNPIKE TOLLBOOTH.\\"Upon going through the tollbooth, Milo reaches Expectations, where he meets the Whether Man. In his further travels through Dictionopolis, the city of words and Digitopolis, the city of numbers he speculates on the meaning of ordinary concepts that he had always known about but had never questioned before. From the Valley of Sound to Forest of Sight, his journey is complemented by a host of unforgettable characters whose originality and pert insights endear them to the reader. Tock, the ever alert watchdog who hates wasting time, proves a steadfast companion. The Humbug, an individual that is a bit self-absorbed and at heart a coward, is reluctant to accompany Milo on a dangerous mission, but still stays faithful to him throughout his adventures.Although the Milo is sometimes sidetracked by stopping in the Doldrums (which you get to by not thinking), and jumping to the island of Conclusions, he proceeds inexorably towards the Mountains of Ignorance, where he must evade the demons that dwell there to rescue the Princesses of Sweet Rhyme and Pure Reason from the Castle in the Air.The vividly described landscapes also help contribute to the pathos of the book as we read; the gloomy and grey depiction of the Doldrums as devoid of motion tell us what a dull place it is. The fact that Conclusions is an island tell us that it is in the middle of nowhere - somewhere that is reached not through a logical path of thought, but by jumping.While the words flow easily, making this an easy read even for younger readers, there are often deeper messages hidden in simple words. The phrases he uses are very direct, but there are also other layers of meaning that are quite obvious at a second glance. A master of wordplay, Juster conveys his fascinating plot in a way that never ceases to amuse the reader. Reminiscent of Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, he uses words in ways that have multiple interpretations, revealed from the very beginning of the book when Milo finds along with the tollbooth \\"book of rules and traffic regulations, which may not be bent or broken.\\"The scratchy-scratchy illustrations of Jules Feiffer also serve to enhance the emotion and message of the book. Just as Juster captures the heart with his unadorned turns of phrase, the clean lines of Feiffer's sketches captures the essence of the characters, conveying the true sentiment of each scene he portrays. In the front cover illustration, from Milo's first meeting with Tock, the watchdog, Milo's newfound curiosity is shown in his face, while Tock's stern countenance clearly shows how Milo perceived Tock at their first meeting.Juster's descriptions of the remarkable Kingdom of Wisdom are a bit like these sketches; although they have just enough to give you a clear main idea, the details are left to one's own imagination. The imagery more materializes in your mind as it will, rather than just going in as a ready-made concept produced by the author. Pictures of the landscapes Milo travels forms in your thoughts as if they had been there all along - and all they had needed was Juster's descriptions to bring them out and into the light. This just serves to augment your empathy with the characters in the book and the ideas that they go into.Milo's world-weary attitude at the beginning of the book is reminiscent of how many of us seem to live today. Wrapped up in our own small lives, we cease to appreciate the greater things that surround us. We immerse ourselves in Illusions, and cease to pay attention to Reality. Becoming inured to life, we stop thinking, thus becoming stuck in the Doldrums, and I'm sure that everyone has many times jumped to Conclusions. The demons of Ignorance too, are becoming increasingly evident in today's world. Too often are we caught up in Terrible Trivium, or find ourselves trying to evade taking responsibility with a Threadbare Excuse. The Triple Demons of Compromise are also unmistakably present: \\"And since they always settled their differences by doing what none of them really wanted, they rarely got anywhere at all.\\"Juster has written other books in the children's fiction genre, such as The Hello, Goodbye Window and The Dot and the Line: A Romance in Lower Mathematics. These are both relatively shorter books aimed at younger readers, though they still show the love of wordplay that Juster has exhibited in The Phantom Tollbooth. The first explores the relationship of a young girl with her grandparents through a window, revealing Juster's understanding of children's perceptions that is also exhibited in The Phantom Tollbooth. In the second, Juster uses his imagination to portray the lives of some geometric figures; it is about a line, wooing a fair circle. The circle however, scorns the line for being in her eyes, less than she.However, The Phantom Tollbooth remains the piece for which he is best known. A true masterpiece of literature, this heartwarming story is timeless, giving us a whole new Point of View from which to look at the way we live our lives. So let this be a reminder to you: don't let yourself get mired in the Doldrums, or lose yourself in the city of Illusions. Pay attention to all the sights and sounds around you, and appreciate your surroundings. Avoid becoming victim to demons of Ignorance, and above all, pursue wisdom in the form of Sweet Rhyme and Pure Reason."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

He soon meets Tock, the watch dog complete with giant size watch faces on back, and is entrusted with a mission--to rescue the Princesses of Rhyme and Reason from the Castle in the Air. But there's a lot of detours to go through before he gets there . . .An absolute delight, filled with puns and plays on words. Varying ages will get more or fewer of the jokes.

He later met a lady who told him about the king's problem with his brother and the only way to solve it was to get two sisters named Rhyme and Reason to solve them. Milo and Tock went to the city of math and met the Mathmagician. Milo and Tock got the two kings' permission to rescue Rhyme and Reason.

When a large, incongruous package arrives in his room, he opens it because there is nothing else worth doing. In the package he finds a tollbooth, a map, various coins for the tollbooth, precautionary signs, a rule book and a small car. He pays his fees and drives through the tollbooth and finds himself in an unfamiliar country. He continues to drive and arrives at Dictionopolis, a place that favors words. The king of Dictionopolis sends Milo a watch dog named Tock and the Humbug, a large beetlelike insect to rescue the banished Princess of Sweet Rhyme and the Princess of Pure Reason. Only they can bring peace between Digitopolis, a place that favors numbers, and Dictionopolis. The three embark on a mission to find Rhyme and Reason. On the way, they meet a boy named Alec who is born in the air and grows down, Dr. Dischord, a creator of noise and Dynne, a noisemaker. Throughout the journey, Milo continues to meet many fascinating creatures and realizes life isn't so boring after all.This cleverly written fantasy by Norton Juster teaches us there are lands beyond our imagination. Juster skillfully uses words and has a great sense of humor. I could see every scene clearly in detail. Although The Phantom Tollbooth never received a Newberry award, it will always remain one of my favorite books."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

I loved the story of Milo, a kid who is bored and dislikes life who receives a gift completely out of the blue (what kid wouldn't like that). I liked the fact that the gift was a gateway to an adventure in another world. I liked the dog he meets who is gruff at first but becomes Milo's best friend. I also loved the strange characters Milo met on his adventures, and I was scared of the monsters he met near the end of the book.As I grew older, I started to learn all of the puns and double meanings strewn throughout the book. I still loved the adventure story, but now I began realizing that the book was very funny as well.During some move or other, I lost the book, but now I look forward to buying it when I have kids and rediscovering the world Norton Juster painted in the Phantom Tollbooth with them."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

I received it as a present from a good friend a couple of years back, and since then, I've read it at least five times. It's filled with far off (or close by) places of strangeness, and imaginative color. If you like fantasy, reality, wacky fiction, and fun, all twisted into a frenzic book based on an interesting quest, then this is the book for you. Heck, even if you don't like all the stuff I just mentioned, you'll still like it. You can't help it. Its just too good a book. I commend Norton Juster for this brilliant work of literature.

I can honestly say that I consider the Phantom Tollbooth my all-time favorite book, and that's saying something, seeing how I'm nineteen and an engineering student. Norton Juster has an amazing way with words that is entertaining no matter how old you may be.The Phantom Tollbooth is the story of Milo, a young boy who just can't see what all the fuss is about. He can't understand why his teachers force feed him all this seemingly useless information, and nothing interests him.That is, until he unexpectedly receives a most unusual gift: a toy tollbooth. Having nothing better to do, Milo sets it up and drives through in an old toy car. Instead of the other half of his room, Milo discovers himself in the Kingdom of Wisdom, where you'd best keep your wits about. Part of the appeal of the book is the play of words Norton Juster throws at you, making you rethink some of the things you've been saying for years. You'll meet such interesting characters as the Whether Man, King Azaz the Unabridged, the Dodecahedron, the Humbug and a boy who represents the .58 of a child in your average everyday family. You'll journey with Milo through such odd places as the Valley of Sound (where there's not any), Alec's Point of View, Dictionopolis (where letters grow on trees and you have to eat what you say), Digitopolis (where numbers are mined and you only eat when you're full), and the Island of Conclusions (where you get by jumping).I love this book. I pull it out whenever I feel a bit down, and it never fails to cheer me up. It is delightfully imaginative and truly creative. I leave you with this tidbit from the Whether Man: &quot;Whether or not you find your way, you're bound to find some way. If you happen to find my way, please return it, as I lost it some time ago. I imagine by now it's quite dusty.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

Even as an adult you can get lost in the story and your imagination kicks into overdrive as you follow Milo's journey! As a matter of fact, I appreciate this story more as an adult because I have more reference points to relate to while reading it. You can appreciate this book at absolutely any age. I promise you that you will not forget even the smallest detail of this book for many years.

Hall large print for young readers)","review":"\\"There was once a boy named Milo who didn't know what to do with himself--not just sometimes, but always.\\" This is the opening line and premise of Norton Juster's timeless classic, \\"The Phantom Tollbooth,\\" a delightfully quirky story that reads like a fairy tale but, if you're not careful, might just teach you something, for it is rumored that there is a moral to every story. A highly imaginative tale, it contains aspects of all of its predecessors--particularly characters similar to those found in \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,\\" magic and travel comparable to \\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe,\\" and a philosophy reminiscent of \\"Winnie-the-Pooh\\"--while maintaining an originality that makes it unrestrained from the limits of time.When Milo enters the tollbooth, he finds himself in a strange world where the literal and the figurative collide. The land of Wisdom is ruled by two feuding monarchs; King Azaz the Unabridged presides over Dictionopolis, and his brother the Mathemagician governs Digitopolis. However, everything and everyone is out of sorts because, as Faintly Macabre the Which explains, the Princesses Sweet Rhyme and Pure Reason are trapped in the Castle in the Air after proclaiming that: \\"Words and numbers are of equal value, for, in the cloak of knowledge, one is warp and the other woof.\\" To restore order, Milo must make the long, dangerous journey to free the Princesses. He is accompanied by Tock the Watchdog and the Humbug, and together they encounter a host of unbelievable creatures on their epic quest. Throughout it all, Juster orchestrates a highly entertaining allegory which will spark the imagination of children and adults alike."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

I did feel the math side was a little badly treated - the author made it more difficult and confusing than the English side, but that could be the engineer bias in me. I hate it when people make math sound hard because, well, I like math.I'm not so sure how well any kid would actually learn the lessons that they're trying to instill in this story, maybe it depends on their age (I'm no expert on kids). But it seemed a lot of the puns were a little convoluted, a little reaching, for younger children to understand. And the plot was probably a little young for older children to really enjoy."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"This is a fantastic book. In my second year of college my roommate read this to me. I loved it immediately. This is a children's book, but there are many things that a child won't get until she is much older...but it is so fun that he/she probably won't notice. I read a lot, but this is my only favorite fiction book and my copy is worn and tattered. I used this book in my oral interpretation class in college because it is dramatic and lends itself very well to such a use. I've even read this aloud to a group of children 6-12 and they were captivated by it - and sat still!Milo is a little boy who doesn't see much point in anything, but plays with this toy (a driveable little car and tollbooth that he found in his room one day) just because he has nothing better to do. In the process he is transported to a land where rhyme and reason have, literally, been banished (two princesses who need to be rescued) and everything is taken literally.Here is an excerpt for those curious; it is just after he enters that world:\\"WELCOME TO EXPECTATIONS,\\" said a carefully lettered sign on a small house at the side of the road.\\"INFORMATION, PREDICTIONS, AND ADVICE CHEERFULLY OFFERED. PARK HERE AND BLOW HORN.\\"With the first sound of the horn a little man in a long coat came rushing from the house, speaking as fast as he could and repeating everything several times: \\"My, my, my, my, my, welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome to the land of Expectations, to the land of Expectations. We don't get many travelers these days; we certainly don't get many travelers these days. Now what can I do for you? I'm the Whether Man.\\"\\"Is this the right road for Dictionopolis?\\" asked Milo, a little bowled over by the effusive greeting.\\"Well now, well now, well now,\\" he began again, \\"I don't know of any wrong road to Dictionopolis, so if this road goes to Dictionopolis at all it must be the right road, and if it doesn't it must be the right road to somewhere else, because there are no wrong roads to anywhere. Do you think it will rain?\\"\\"I thought you were the Weather Man,\\" said Milo, very confused.\\"Oh no,\\" said the little man, \\"I'm the Whether Man, not the Weather Man, for after all it's more important to know whether there will be weather than what the weather will be.\\" And with that he released a dozen balloons that sailed off into the sky. \\"Must see which way the wind is blowing,\\" he said, chuckling over his little joke and watching them disappear in all directions.\\"What kind of land is Expectations?\\" inquired Milo, unable to see the humor and feeling very doubtful of the little man's sanity.\\"Good question, good question,\\" he exclaimed, \\"Expectations is the place you must always go before you get to where you're going. Of course, some people never go beyond Expectations, but my job is to hurry them along whether they like it or not. Now what else can I do for you?\\"Even this bit gets better, but if I went further it would be over 400 words and could then be a copyright problem, so I will stop here. It is very clever and just goes on like this without letting up for about 250 pages. Lots of twists, turns and surprises, never tiring and never boring. When I first heard it, even though I was 21 I was surprised that I actually walked away with a new perspective on life. This book is certainly worth the experience."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"Milo was a kid who was bored.

He's not just bored, he's nearly comatose. But when he discovers a mysterious tollbooth in his room, he decides to go through it. (Why not, he's bored, right?) Milo meets a watchdog named Tock who takes the boy on one of the great wild rides in all of literature. Where else can you meet people like Rhyme and Reason, Dr. Discord, King Azaz the Unabridged, and others? 'The Phantom Tollbooth' is in love with learning and new experiences.

On his journey to save Rhyme and Reason he has friends along with Milo whose names are Humbug and Tock.I liked when Milo, Tock, and the Humbug where on the Island of Conclusions because Canby says all these similes about him self so they will guess his name.

Hall large print for young readers)","review":"I was scrolling through the Top Sellers list when three words jumped out at me: The Phantom Tollbooth. And instantly, I clicked on it, suddenly awash with the love of my favorite childhood book.Its one of the best, if not the best, children's book ever written. It, unlike more recent novels, teaches some valuable lessons in ways so fun and original, they stick. Who can ever say that Harry Potter (no offense meant) ever taught them a lesson that would stay with them their whole life.And even if you're older, and those lessons are already learned, this book charms your socks off with its amazing, stunning, creative twists and turns. It will astound you no matter what your age, no matter what type of person you are, no matter what differences separate readers.The Phantom Tollbooth is a classic book that is a must-have in every library. It's one of my childhood favorites, above C.S. Lewis's and Roald Dahl's works, even.

I actually was not planning on writing a review on this book, although I read the \\"bad reviews\\" on here.I was shocked with the comments left about this story. This is a story about using your imagination. This is a story that was written in order to make a young reader think.The \\"kid reviewers\\" often made comments stating the situation is not \\"realistic\\" and if the same situation happened to them-they would notify the police. When I read that I became a little sad, that the innocence of children has been lost to the point of them being unable to enjoy a whimsical story.I for one adored this story and still do to this day. Of course, rereading it as an adult-the language is very simplistic AND I do not need every concept explained to me ad nauseum.

Have you heard about the boy who spends his life suspended four feet in mid air, grows from the sky down and always has the same point of view!? Have you ever jumped to conclusions, the island that is!? If not, then you need to read The Phantom Tollbooth, by Norton Juster - a book about a boy named Milo who has done all of these things....and MORE!This book takes place in an alternate universe called The Kingdom of Wisdom. This world can only be reached by going through the phantom tollbooth. The phantom tollbooth appears in your bedroom after school; but, only if you are bored, disgruntled and displeased, like Milo. If you are lucky enough to go through the tollbooth, you will be able to explore the Kingdom of Wisdom. Within this kingdom are cities such as Dictionopolis, where they grow ripe and juicy words that taste delicious; or Doldrums, where nothing ever happens and all you can do is sit and be lazy. You may be fortunate enough to meet King Azaz, who is the ruler of Dictionopolis. You may be unfortunate enough to enter the Valley of Sound. I say unfortunate because this is a place of complete silence. You see, no one ever appreciated the many beautiful sounds of the valley, so the Keeper of Sounds collected all of them and left an absolute hush ... pretty eerie and unnerving. All of these adventures work together to change Milo. He enters the tollbooth bored, disgruntled and displeased, just as you may find yourself now and then, but emerges thankful, appreciative and enthusiastic.This book was first-class. I liked it because it was funny and entertaining yet as I read I learned the meaning of many fun and descriptive words. The author uses so many twist of the English language, that while you read you are anticipating the next outlandish city or colorful character. The author keeps things interesting throughout the entire book. I guarantee you won't be bored! I would heartily recommend this book to others. It appeals to everyone who likes a good adventure!"},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"Have you ever gone on a really adventurous trip without your parents? Milo had just that opportunity in Norton Juster's book The Phantom Tollbooth. He found a tollbooth in his bedroom and decided to take his car, pay the toll, and go through. Milo had no idea what adventures would lay ahead of him. This fantasy book takes Milo to places he could only dream about and to meet people he could only imagine.Milo never truly enjoyed life. He was bored until he discovered an unusual box, a tollbooth, in his bedroom one day after school. After entering the tollbooth, he traveled to lands with odd names such as Doldrums, Expectations, and Dictionopolis. While visiting these lands, he met people and creatures with extraordinary names and astonishing characteristics. He met a dog names Tock with the body of a clock that ticked instead of barked. He also met a bug whose name was Humbug. Humbug was a character you wouldn't want to spend a lot of time with because he lies and doesn't agree with anyone. Norton Juster uses a play on words to name places and characters as well as to describe their behavior and actions. Everything and everyone is turned upside down when the princesses, Rhyme and Reason, were banished and taken to the castle in the air. Milo's job was to rescue Rhyme and Reason. Travel with Milo to these strange lands and meet these curious charaters with their bizarre behavior. Find out what lessons Milo learns during his journey. Discover if he was successful in saving Rhyme and Reason.I found this book to be funny and entertaining. I took pleasure in finding out who he would meet and what twists they would add to the story.

It follows the story of a young boy named Milo as he meets strange characters in his mission to bring Rhyme and Reason back to the Kingdom of Wisdom. Milo is continually confronted with logical conundrums and challenges to his assumptions and attitudes. He is transformed from a boy who felt he had nothing to do to someone who considers his actions (or inactions) consciously.This was the first \\"chapter book\\" that I ever read, at the age of 7. Its influence on me has been immeasurable, from knowing that the only escape from the Doldrums is to think one's way out, to an unshakeable conviction that there is an inherent unity between words and numbers, and isolating the study of one from the other will limit achievements in both. This book is a delight to read, whether you are pointing to the words with your finger and sounding them out as you go, or reading the book aloud to your grandchildren."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

While waiting, I looked for a different book to read, but none of them could give me the satisfaction the HP books did. I read A Wrinkle in Time--to many weak characters and mushy ending. Then I read the Golden Compass--practically a highschool-level book; I couldn't understand many of the descriptions and vocabulary. I was just about to give up my interest in reading. Then I finally decieded to read the highly acclaimed Phantom Tollbooth. I was a bit reluctant to read it at first, it sounded so absurd and the title didn't get me too excited.Well, I was wrong. I was amazed at how well-written and creative the book was! It was a world of language and math--two things I show a lack of interest in, yet the book showed the world of those two in such interesting, philosophical, and funny ways. I cracked up at so many parts. Not to mention the characters were so incredibly well-developed, and the hero was so likable. I was sad when I came to the ending of the book, but it really made me think and look at the world differently when I finished reading it.This book is a true classic and is now one of my all-time favorite books.

Having nothing better to do he plays with it not knowing that he will be transported to another dimension, meet strange people, have exciting adventures, and save two princesses named Rhyme and Reason saving the whole world.I'm a sixth grader and in the book there is no action.

My teenage daughter loves it. Norton Juster spins a witty, engaging tale of a bored young man who learns a lot about life on a wild journey through exotic lands...exotic, yet amazingly familiar. The humor is droll and dry and laugh-out-loud clever; the dialog is intricately choreographed, but perfectly accessable. The storyline is exciting and imaginative, and the lessons contained herein are noble and memorable indeed. It's an allegory, a fantasy, a quest, a buddy-tale, a road trip, a comedy, and a parable, all rolled into one.

So, with nothing else to do, he pays the toll and rides through the booth.

There he drives to Expectations, and meets the Whether Man, who tells him he must go beyond Expectations or he won't get anywhere. Then he finds the Doldrums, where you aren't allowed to think, and after enters Dictionopolis.In Dictionopolis, Milo finds the word market, where you buy words, and eat at the Royal Banquet, where you request the words you eat.Then Milo hears the story of King Azaz and the Mathmagician, and how one liked numbers and one liked words, but they hated each other. Their sisters, Rhyme and Reason, always solved thier problems.

This land features two main cities: Dictionopolis (marked by a love of words) and Digitopolis (marked by a love of numbers).In Dictionopolis, Milo is faced with the peculiarities of the English language, as abstract words turn into concrete individuals. He meets the Spelling Bee (who is always spelling words), a Which called Faintly Macabre (who is not so wicked), and the Whether man (who says its more important to know whether there will be weather, rather than what the weather will be.) At the word market place, he has the opportunity to buy a bag of pronouns, and letters of the alphabet. After an encounter with the police Officer Short Shrift, Milo ends up in the palace of king Azaz. Here he meets the cabinet, composed of a duke who makes mountains out of molehills, a minister who splits hairs, a count who makes hay while the sun shines, an earl who leaves no stone unturned, and an undersecretary who hangs by a thread. Dictionopolis is inhabited by strange fellows such as these and the unforgettable Kakofonous A. Dischord (Doctor of Dissonance), as well as a strange places such as the \\"Island of Conclusions\\" (which you get to, of course, by jumping).Juster's word play is so skilful and delightful, that at first you suspect that this wordy excellence will be impossible to match when Milo visits Digitopolis, the city of numbers. But not so - the fun keeps right on going. Whereas Dictionopolis had offered food like synonymn buns and required banqueters to eat their words, Digitopolis offers a diet with things like subtraction stew (the more you heat, the hungrier you get). Numbers are so essential, Milo discovers, to measure the height of high hopes, and also because narrow escapes come in all different widths. And as for the smallest number, it is infinitely small that it is kept in a box so small you can't see it, in a dresser so small you can't see it, in a house so small you can't see it... Milo tries to travel along a long line to the Land of Infinity, but is told that he probably won't like the land, and that \\"infinity is a dreadfully poor place. They can never manage to make ends meet.\\"With his two faithful companions - the watchdog Tock (who \\"ticks\\" instead of \\"tocks\\", and whose body is the face of a watch\\"), and the Humbug - Milo goes on a perilous journey to rescue the two lost princesses, Rhyme and Reason. As you would expect, without Rhyme and Reason the lands of words and numbers have become rather chaotic. There are a variety of obstacles and enemies on the way, including the Everpresent Wordsnatcher (who literally takes the words right out of their mouths). To rescue the princesses, Milo and his company need to travel to the Mountain of Ignorance. Logically, the creatures who live in Ignorance are rather dangerous, but Milo manages to outwit them, rescue Rhyme and Reason, and returns through the tollbooth back into his real land.Comparisons with Lewis Carroll's legendary \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" are inevitable and perfectly appropriate. \\"The Phantom Tollbooth\\" is an award winning classic that will please adults as well as children for generations to come. Juster demonstrates a superb ability to make the abstract concrete, and to produce an unending stream of puns and plays on words and concepts. Yet unlike Carroll's \\"Wonderland\\", Juster's world is not nonsensical, but makes a great deal of sense. Words and numbers are dealt with strictly, literally, and logically. Because he has created a world that is new and apparently nonsensical, and yet one that plainly makes perfect logical sense, Juster's world is exceedingly understandable and enjoyable. For instance the fact that a Spelling Bee is a buzzing bee that actually spells is a fantastic notion, and yet one that makes more sense than what we've always thought a spelling bee was. This is a nonsense world that makes perfect sense.Yet Milo returns from this world as a changed individual. He has gained a new insight and appetite for the joys of words and numbers. A few tantalizing quotes to whet your own appetite: About expectations: &quot;Expectations is the place you must always go to before you get to where you're going. Of course, some people never go beyond Expectations...&quot; About a box filled with words - &quot;Most of them you will never need, some you will use constantly, but with them you may ask all the questions which have never been answered and answer all the questions which have never been asked. All the great books of the past and all the ones yet to come are made with these words. With them there is no obstacle you cannot overcome. All you must learn to do is to use them well and in the right places.&quot; But Juster also shares insights about real life. From the Terrible Trivium - \\"demon of petty tasks and worthless jobs, ogre of wasted effort and monster of habit\\" - Milo learns that by doing enough unimportant things you'll never get to where you're going.So it is that when Milo exits the tollbooth, he has a renewed perspective on life, and is no longer the boy who didn't know what to do with himself. The tollbooth has changed him. When he says goodbye to the tollbooth, he says hello to the real world, a world awaiting discovery and exploration. But the phantom tollbooth has a very real capacity to have the same effect on you the reader. If you are a bored little boy like Milo, this book might just change your outlook on life! And if you already love puns, and plays on words and numbers, you'll love this book anyway. Be sure of one thing: a journey through the phantom tollbooth is thoroughly enjoyable!"},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"I love this book!

This book is a funny, laugh-out-loud, and over all great book. In this book, a boy named Milo finds a magic tollbooth that is kind of like a time machine packaged up in his room. He decides to go into it. So he drives up in his little toy car with his magic coin ready and explores the weird world beyond. Milo goes on a quest with his friends, Tock and the Humbug, to rescue the two princesses, Rhyme and Reason. This is a fantasy book because there are many wizards, beasts, a time-traveling tollbooth, and a lot of magic. This book is great because there's good character and setting description.

How about a magical land? These things are all talked about in Norton Juster's book The Phantom Tollbooth.The main character is Milo. Milo is a ten year old boy who lives in an apartment and does not find much point in life. He is driving along in his toy car when he starts daydreaming and goes to the doldrums. Then Tock, a dog, saves him from this trap of not thinking. Milo and Tock then go to a city called Dictionopolis. Here they get sent on a mission from King Azaz to save the princesses. The king then sends an interesting creature, the Humbug, to guide them on their journey, because he knew so much about it. In the end Milo learns that life is not so pointless.The Phantom Tollbooth is a good book. What I like about the book is that Norton Juster has a great sense of humor. I like it when he uses idioms.

Hall large print for young readers)","review":"The Phantom TollboothBy: Norton JusterSeptember 19, 2002The book that I read was called The Phantom Tollbooth. The author is Norton Juster. The Phantom Tollbooth is about a boy named Milo, who is the main character. Milo doesn't really do anything at all; he just sits around. Another main character is Tock, who is the watchdog. Milo thinks that life is boring until a box appears with a Tollbooth in it and a car. It says on the Tollbooth that you just have to drop a coin in the slot to play a game. Milo was having a boring afternoon like usual, so he decided to play the game and dropped the coin in. After Milo dropped the coin in, he sat in the car and pretended he was driving. Then all of a sudden, he drove to a place that he had never been to before. This is when Milo's adventure starts.The main theme of The Phantom Tollbooth is when Milo all of a sudden is driving in a place that he has never been to and he doesn't care, he just keeps on driving. While Milo is driving, he meets many different people and mostly all of the people that he meets tell him about the princesses and how they made the world a better place. The princesses' names are Rhyme and Reason. Now since Rhyme and Reason are in a castle and need to be rescued, people don't get along as well. Milo also meets somebody and becomes friends with him and he is a watchdog named Tock. Also, Milo meets another friend, which is the Humbug. Milo, Tock, and the Humbug go on a wild adventure because they want to save the princesses. Milo, Tock and the Humbug go to many different places and meet so many new people. By a surprise, Milo, Tock and the Humbug did rescue Rhyme and Reason. To find out what happens at the end of this book read it!The book The Phantom Tollbooth taught me many new facts and taught me to never give up even if you think the thing you are trying to do is impossible. An example is when Milo went on his journey with his friends. Even though the adventure was tough, Milo, the Humbug and Tock didn't give up. That is what I think that author was trying to say. The Phantom Tollbooth was an awesome book and I am sure that anybody who likes fantasy books and adventure books will like this book. This book was very descriptive with words and settings and when I first starting reading it, I couldn't put it down. I definitely recommend this book to other kids."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

Hall large print for young readers)","review":"I remember reading Alice in Wonderland as a child and being very disappointed with it. I really wanted to like the book, but try as I might I simply could not immerse myself in the story. It wasn't until years later on a rereading I was able to articulate why: To me, Alice seems more like a glorified logic puzzle than a story. The Phantom Tollbooth suffers from a similar problem. The plot and the characters are flimsy, half-formed creations - mere excuses for the author to deal out a megadose of puns, assorted cleverness, and lesson-driven allegory so unsubtle it is entirely impossible to ignore.Based on the many glowing reviews here, my opinions clearly place me in the minority, and even I found some parts of The Phantom Tollbooth likeable. Juster's message - to cure boredom and languor by taking an interest in learning about the world - is a good one. Some of the concepts, like a boy who grows down instead of up, are original and intriguing, and a scene where the main character directs a symphony to play the sunrise into being is beautiful. Parts of the wordplay are admittedly extremely impressive. For me, it's not nearly enough to make up for the absence of a real plot - and not all the wordplay is so inspired or original. Wow, a Spelling Bee who's an actual bumblebee who spells words! Who else could've thought of that? Well, Eleanor Estes, for one. (See The Witch Family, published a year before The Phantom Tollbooth.) And I have a hard time finding brilliance in the creation of five characters who repeat one another using various synonyms - something easily reproduced by anyone with a decent vocabulary and/or a thesaurus.After being bombarded with endless five-star reviews on Amazon, I searched elsewhere on the internet and found some readers who seemed to feel the same way I did about the book's heavy-handed use of allegory. One mentioned that Edgar Allan Poe - clearly a man with more literary credibility than I - had expressed a dislike for allegory, and while searching for the exact quote I found a summary of Poe's opinion in a journal article by Algis Valiunas which I think perfectly describes the problem with The Phantom Tollbooth. \\"Allegory is obtrusively didactic . . . and thus it disturbs the equilibrium, essential to well-made fiction, between the narrative surface and the thematic depths: meaning should be an undercurrent of subtle force, and allegory redirects it to the surface, where it overwhelms the life-giving illusion of the story.\\"Devoid of this life-giving illusion, the book is simply . . . Boring! Soporific! Bland! Uninteresting! Dull! At least, that's the way it is for me. It seems many more will be entranced or at least adequately entertained by 256 pages of puns, wittiness, and (at times very adroit) word juggling."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"Someone kindly was watching over Milo when he decried the boredom his life was sinking into, and guided him into a world where his imagination was allowed - indeed required - to soar. We could do with that same benevolent spirit today.Thankfully, Norton Juster's masterpiece holds up beautifully to the task. This really is a wonderful flight of fancy - if Willy Wonka had produced dictionaries rather than chocolates, this would be his factory. The twin worlds of Dictionopolis and Digitopolis (whose sibling kings have bickered for decades about the supremacy of words and numbers); the Island of Conclusions (which you jump to before you know it when you assume too quickly); the show-stopping scene where the conductor paints a sunrise with his baton (one of the most magical/grotesque scenes in any childrens' book ever); the \\"impossible\\" journey to rescue Rhyme and Reason from the fortress they've been banished to.Illiteracy and Innumeracy are rife in today's society. The Island of Conclusions must be jam-packed with all of our current cultural misunderstandings - and was there ever a time when Rhyme and Reason need to be rescued more than now? More than ever, Juster's allegory rings true, without losing a single shred of its charm and humour.Kids will love it, adults who have read it will recall its genius with deligt. Those discovering it for the first time will have Juster's world painted for them with all the colour, sound and movement as when it was first published in the 1960s.Cherish it."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

Hall large print for young readers)","review":"The Phantom Tollbooth is a fantasy. I think it is worth your time to read it.It is a book about a boy named Milo who has always been bored. Even though Milo is bored, it does not mean that this story is boring. In this exciting book, Milo travels to places of adventure. Throughout this book, you will experience Milo as he goes through many trials as he tries to save the two princesses Rhyme and Reason. He does this to stop a battle between Digitopolis and Dictionopolis. Milo meets a friend named Tock, who helps him out of many difficulties.There is always a small catch as the author leads you from one trial to another.Using a PACES Study Guide while reading this book helped me expand my imagination even more by asking me questions like: \\"What would it be like to have no sound?\\" and \\"What would it be like to have to talk in numbers?\\"You should read this book to find out what happens to Tock and Milo and the other friends that he makes along the way."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

I laughed out loud and found the whole book to be very entertaining, witty and intelligent. The combination of adventure and fantasy, all written, not with an eye on how it can be made into a movie or TV show, but how to be smart and challenging was like a breath of fresh air. If you are looking for a completely uncommericialzed adventure story that will have you thinking about which is better, letters or numbers, this is the book for you. I bought a hard copy for my 8 year old son and he thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

We'd sit on the floor, or in desks, or wherever; at an age when most of us were growing out of being read aloud to, Mr. Vogel gave us great memories. He'd read things that, at our age, we would have struggled with. (I think that is the only way being read to is fun. So ... maybe my mom will read me some Milton? Maybe? Maybe not?) - Any way, we might have been able to read The Phantom Tollbooth for ourselves, but Mr. Vogel's voices made it waaay better.

Hall large print for young readers)","review":"This is one of the most enjoyable books I have ever read. I never heard of it growing up, and my parents were diligent in providing us with the classics. Even today most of the customers in my bookstore don't know it exists. This is a crime, because it belongs right up there with Alice in Wonderland and The Wind in the Willows. It's a fantasy about a bored little boy who gets into a magic car and goes through the phantom tollbooth into a land of adventure. He must rescue the princesses Rhyme and Reason to restore order to the kingdom. It is chock full of extremely clever puns, because in this world things are really taken literally. You can eat your own words, visit the Island of Conclusions (which can only be reached by jumping to it) and so many more that I won't spoil it by telling you about them. I often found myself laughing out loud. Sure, it's considered a children's book and kids love it, but don't let that put you off if you're an adult. It's timeless, and everyone can enjoy it. A friend who's a librarian recommended it to me, and I'll be forever grateful!"},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"At first, I simply enjoyed it as a kid.Later on, as a teen, I looked for it when I was...bored.Now, I have this book on my shelf, waiting for me (and my nephew, when he's old enough). Except that I find its characters always popping up in the back of my mind.Those of you that didn't enjoy it: it's okay. Still, the whole point of the book is less about the \\"incorrect\\" math problems, lousy puns and nonsensical turns of phrase...and more about seeing life with new eyes.In any case, come back to it again later.As time grew on, Jules Feiffer's drawings seemed too sketchy; but when perusing these reviews, I realized that this was the point. For someone who enjoys seeing books as \\"brain movies\\" (like me), the last thing I want is a reading book with rich illustrations. (For that, I'll read a comic book.) Just simple, basic illustrations: boy, dog w/watch body, the Trivium. These are sketches. We, the readers, get to cast the kid actor; create the character design based LOOSELY on the story art.(Animation fan, too).I'll probably read it later tonight."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

Milo, a kid with nothing to do, discovers a strange cardboared tollbooth leading to a magnificient world. In this strange world, he encounters many queer allies. Milo can easily be related to because before he discovers the tollbooth, he is bored and has nothing to do. My favorite part of the book is the end, which I won't give away.

Milo finds a strange box inside his room that says \\"tollbooth\\". He soon ends up taking a ride through his wildest dreams. What I liked about this story was the mind sizzling vocabulary and the challenging to understand phrases they used in Dictionopolis,Digitopolis,Doldrums,and the many other places."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"\\"I didn't know that I was going to have to eat my words,\\" objected Milo. \\"Of course, of course, everyone here does,\\" the king grunted. \\"You should have made a tastier speech.\\" If you liked the fun wordplay above you will love the Phantom Tollbooth.Milo was always bored. Then a tollbooth mysteriously appeared in his bedroom. So he dusted off his car, paid the toll, and went through. Milo enters a fantasy world where the literal meaning of words is used, but the real meaning is confused, mangled, and lost, which makes for a very exciting, interesting, and humorous story. Milo meets a \\"watchdog\\" named Tock who goes \\"tickticktick\\" all day. Tock tells Milo all about time. After Milo meets Tock they enter Dictionopolis pick up the Humbug and together they go on a quest to rescue the two princesses, Rhyme and Reason. Milo finds he is not bored anymore. Milo's world is now exciting to him, full of adventure and unexpected surprises.The Phantom Tollbooth takes place mostly in the Lands Beyond, but also takes place in Milo's bedroom at the beginning and end of the book. The Lands Beyond is a fantasy world made up of kingdoms with problems. Dictionopolis and Digitopolis are kingdoms ruled by different kings who disagree so much that Milo says, \\"Then each of you agrees that he will disagree with whatever each of you agrees with . . . and if you both disagree with the same thing then aren't you really in agreement?\\" It's a nonsensical and confusing world where people eat half-baked ideas (such as \\"the moon is made of green\\") and get hungrier when they eat subtraction stew (you are full before you eat). There is even an island called Conclusions that you can only get to by jumping. I like the setting because it seems almost magical and yet very logical. It makes for an extremely silly and humorous story. The events seem real in the world of the book.There are three main characters; Milo, Tock, and The Humbug. Milo is a boy. He is bored in his room then he becomes adventurous once he starts his journey through the Lands Beyond. Milo is bravely curious because he rescues the princesses. Milo is a believable character. Tock is a watchdog and is a male. He is a watch with half a dog on either side and is loyal and brave. He stays with Milo and he growls at people when Milo is angry at them. The Humbug is a giant super over-sized dumb, illogical bug. He came out of the Sea of Knowledge dry. He says the wrong thing at the wrong time. His illogical reasoning provides humor.Norton Juster, the author of the Phantom Tollbooth, wrote the book in the early 1960s while living in Brooklyn, New York. He has written eight other books, but his main focus in life has been architecture. Juster dreamed of being an architect as a child. In 1970, Juster co-founded an architectural firm in Massachusetts. From 1970 until 1992 he was a professor of architecture and environmental design at Hampshire College. Juster currently lives in Amherst, Massachusetts.I think the Phantom Tollbooth is fantastic. I like this book because it's fun, funny, and interesting. People who like fun wordplay, are easily overcome by suspense, or who like exploring will love this book."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

Hall large print for young readers)","review":"\\"So many words and so many people! They were from every place imaginable and some places even beyond that, and they were all busy sorting, choosing, and stuffing things into cases.\\"That was from a book called The Phantom Tollbooth. It is about a boy named Milo and he was always bored. Until he finds a tollbooth in his house! Then he wanders into a place where all that the creatures do is lay down! In the story, there were two kingdoms and the two kings were brothers but they each thought that words or numbers were more important. The kings were mad at each other because one king thought that words were better and the other thought numbers were better than words. The king's sisters both named Rhyme and Reason thought that numbers and words were both equal, but the kings did not think so, so the sisters got banised to a castle in the air hovering over the demon mountains. Finally Milo attempts to go and save Rhyme and Reason high in the sky and run from the demons in the mountains so the kings will realize that their sisters are more important than disagreeing with each other.Most of the story is easy to understand but I don't get some parts of the story. Where is Milo's family? And how did the spectacular tollbooth appear? And why does Milo have white hair? I didn't really like the story because the author, Norton Juster, never explains these questions.This is recommened for people 8-12 years old because some words in the story are intermediate and some of the storys might get a little boring.The story is easy to get through with the pictures. All of the pictures help the reader with what happens in the story. This book is for people who like adventures.I think that this book is funny because of the mathemagician, the king of Digitopolis, because he served Milo subtraction soup. The more you drink, the hungrier you get. It was really funny when the Trivium (You will know who is he if you read the book) told the humbug to dig a tunnel with only a needle! It was really the funniest when Officer Shrift arrested Milo & his friends but when Milo told the officer only a jailer can put you to jail, the officer said he was also a jailer and a judge! I hate the part about the \\"Which's story\\" because it took too long. Most of the story resides in humor and some parts are depressing. It was confusing the first time I read it, but I found funny parts that amazed me. I also think that this book has a dull picture in the front but the story is exciting. The part that attracted me was the map in the front pages. It looked so nice that I decided to read this book. Even if the cover looks tiring, you should not ignore it!"},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"Very imaginative and fabulous book! The main character goes on an adventure in a fantasy land, where he learns the importance of learning vocabulary and math in school.

It's learning what to do with what you learn and learning why you learn things at all that matters.\\" Even though this book was intended for children, I think many adults would enjoy it too."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

I thought the puns were really cute and the storyline has just enough magic in it to make it lighthearted and fun. I do, however, feel that there were times in the story were groans were more appropriate than chuckles. Kinda like the guy who just can't help but make puns even if they're not really funny and maybe are even a bit too stretchy.I bet kids as young as fifth grade could get this, but it's probably better for high school kids or middle school kids good in English.When I asked friends for their, \\"Oh, you've just got to read your kids these stories\\" recommendations, this one came up numerous times.

I also learned that you should not jumb to conclusions before you know they are true.The main charters are one a little boy who is used to think that life was boring.

Why was this on a 9th grade reading list when it was obviously directed towards 3-5th graders. The age group is about 8-11. Not 13-15. Sure it was good, a nice break from the challenging books on our list. But it was simply childish and boring from the standpoint of a teen. So, if I was in 4th grade, I'd give it a five.

Hall large print for young readers)","review":"In writing this review, I can't help being reminded of a passage out of C. S. Lewis' \\"Prince Caspian\\" -- namely, the single combat. The Bulgy Bear sits at one corner, sucking its paws and looking silly; at the other corner, the centaur Glenstorm paws at the ground imposingly.Such a mixed reaction surely sums up my response to this book!It is galling to have to criticize a book which so many other people have so highly praised; but then, I must say what I think is true. And the truth, as I see it, is that \\"The Phantom Tollbooth\\" is a book which simply misses its potential.Frankly, I have some VERY mixed feelings about \\"The Phantom Tollbooth\\". It certainly BEGINS promisingly enough, starting off in true \\"Fairy-Tale\\" fashion -- a mundane setting (an ordinary boy living in an ordinary city and in an ordinary apartment building) which quickly turns to a fantastic setting -- a strange, Wonderland-type world filled with odd creatures and even odder experiences. A promising beginning, indeed!But although the book is very witty, it is also extremely silly. I must suppose that Norton Juster (the author) thought that he was being FUNNY. Maybe he was; but there IS such a thing as \\"too much\\", and this is, alas, a boundary which he crosses far too soon. This is tragic, because the book manages, in certain places, to be quite profound, and even downright allegorical.For example, when Milo et al. swim back from the Isle of Conclusions (to which they have inopportunely Jumped), they all emerge soaking wet, except for The Humbug. A quick glance at the map printed on the endpapers reveals that the body of water that they have just crossed is nothing more or less than a branch of the Sea of Knowledge -- allegorically, therefore, their \\"being soaked\\" (i.e., having \\"absorbed knowledge\\") simply means that they have learned from the experience. On the other hand, The Humbug (who, you will remember, comes out \\"perfectly dry\\") has learned nothing whatsoever!Unfortunately, such brilliance is horribly overshadowed.... The endless cliches and repeated wordplays soon descend, first to farce, and then to idiocy. (The Spelling Bee reminds me of those stupid \\"Lingo\\" commercials on The Game Show Network.) The book DOES have an important message to convey, but I found it VERY hard to take seriously, or to have much respect for, a book which clearly had so low an opinion of itself. The younger children, of course, won't notice this; and if you're an older child in a mood for farce, you'll find this a VERY entertaining tale; but if you are (like me) an older reader of a more thoughtful stripe, you'll soon find this book very wearisome reading.

Nor did Juster employ the wit needed to make the dialogue and the puns carry the story by themselves. Worst of all, it's allegory with no real point.

It contains what I believe to be the greatest sentence in American literature: \\"If you want sense, you'll have to make it yourself.\\" How much more truth do you want? Children will love the story, adults will enjoy that, but also appreciate the Jules Pfeiffer illustrations and great witticisms."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

One day, he glumly returns home and finds abox in his room labeled, \\"ONE GENUINE TURPIKE TOLLBOOOTH.\\" He decides to try it out in his red toy car, ans as he drives through the the booth he finds himself in a very interesting parrallel universe, with dolldrums, subtraction soup, edible words for sale, watchdogs, humbugs and countless onders. \\"Dictionopolis, a happy kingdom, advantageously located in the foothills of confusion and caresseed by gentlie breezes from the Sea of Knowledge. Today, by royal proclamation, is market day. Have you come to buy or sell?\\" says the guard at the gates. As Milo travels through Dictionopolis, the Valley of Sound, Expectations, and various lands, he meets interesting characters such as the Whether Man and the Dodecahedron. this book is a favorite of mine because of the clever puns and play on words that make you laugh. Also, it has exciting adventures and interesting ideas sure to satisfy the picky reader. In The Phantom Tollbooth, Norton plays on puns in his plot, and can make any unenthusiastic reader, like Milo, eat their words."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"It was funny because Milo didn't like to learn but at the end he learns something new."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"The book, The Phantom Tollbooth, is about a boy named Milo who finds a mysterious tollbooth and car that appears in his house. He gets into the car and drives into the tollbooth and has many adventures when he gets in. In the land that is in the tollbooth he meets many new friends like a dog named Tock and The Humbug. Once he has met them he has come across a problem. There are two princesses named Rhyme and Reason who are trapped. Milo must save them to help everyone in the land.I liked this book because it had a lot of stuff going on and it had very imaginative characters. I also like that the land had different areas that had strange and interesting things. There was really nothing that I didn't like about it. I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"Norton Juster's book is ostensibly a children's book. However, like much of children's literature, it contains hidden (and not so hidden) aspects that are of delight to adults as well. This, when you think of it, makes sense--the point of children's literature is to educate as well as entertain (one hopes!), therefore, it makes sense that some of the lessons will be more 'adult' than the actual storyline would seem to indicate.Milo and his various friends and enemies encountered along the way serve to illustrate many of the foibles and quirks of adult life. The Phantom Tollbooth serves as a gateway to a place that embodies the physical manifestations of metaphors.For instance, in Dictionopolis (a city of words) Milo is invited to a banquet at which one must eat one's words. Just as in our world, sometimes those words can be sour and very hard to swallow.Also, while you can jump to the Isle of Conclusions, you must reach the mainland again only by swimming through the sea of knowledge. And the water is cold. It is not easy to recover from having jumped to conclusions.The interplay between concepts, the tension between words and numbers, the divisions and alliances that are made, the enemies who seem to be friends, all of these serve to make a delightful play which will interest children and adults.Milo, of course, makes it home safely after a fascinating journey, and while he would like to take another trip, the phantom tollbooth is needed elsewhere for other children, too. However, Milo realises that he has his own tollbooth in his imagination, and thus the adventure need never end."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"Juster's \\"Tollbooth\\" is perched nearly at the top of my stack of classics. I don't bother placing it inthe \\"children's\\" category, simply because the word play is so delicious that no adult couldpossibly ignore it, whether they have children or not (perhaps a whether man is necessary to filethis book). Bored Milo discovers a tollbooth in his bedroom, and drives his toy car through it...and into a land of words and wordplay, digits and mathematics. The only thing better thanreading the book again was doing so with my daughters. Their reactions mirrored my own at their age,which was the biggest plus I could add to the grade above."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"Like many people, I first read this book when I was young, Perhaps 8-9 years old, and loved it. But now, I'm 18 and I sat down to give this book another try to see what I would think. While some of the jokes that I found great before had lost their luster, this was more than made up for with all the little jokes I got the 2nd time around. After aquiring a analytical eye in high school, I got so much more from this book. Juster is certainly a genius and to those reviewers who say this book is wasted potential, I'd like to see them write a book of this magnitude. Also, to the people who \\"didn't get it\\" and so gave it 0 or 1 stars, I would tell them to not blame it on the author when they are too ,*gasp*, slow to get jokes that are at the same time simple and sophisticated. But I digress, Milo's journeys are varied and always interesting and the lessons he learns can be applied to anyone's life. To the ninth grader who said this book was way to easy, I would caution him that he is only seeing the surface of the book and not understanding the deeper levels. To conclude, go out and read this book! if you have kids, go out and read it with them. If a child could understand everything presented within this novel, they would have a very good lease on life indeed."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

My father had the foresight to buy a copy of it as a Christmas gift for me. One of my most treasured childhood memories was having him read this astounding novel out loud. This is a remarkable story about an ordinary boy. He discovers the magic in the mundane world that surrounds him and he does so by getting involved with math, science, words, fractions, sound, humbugs, whiches (spelled correctly!) and some terrible demons. Now when I read the book I find the demons even more menacing because they are the demons that dwell in the world of being grownup. Juster wrote the almost impossible - a book for children that is just as good for adults. This intelligent book doesn't forego story for message, but the message is vital, a whole lot of fun and interesting from the start.

I know, it does sound like any other fantasy book (I mean, a boy going through a tollbooth into another world is almost synonamous with the girl who goes through a mirror and down a rabbit hole into another world) But the world he's in is unlike any other. There is a lesson to be learnt (but that dosen't make it boring) from every incident and place Milo goes, and the people he meet are really funny and foolish. The book only gets better as Milo decides to rescue Rhyme and Reason from the castle in the air in a marvelous journey that will prove to serve just as rewarding for Milo as it is for the people of the magical kingdom.

I wrote two book reports on it for my middle school reading classes. I even received a copy of it as a tenth birthday present. Ever since, I've read it from cover to cover at least once a year.As a child, I enjoyed reading the strange adventures of a bored Milo embarking on his legendary quest. As an adult, I enjoy the tome's play on words, such as the Whether man (&quot;It's more important to know whether there will be weather, rather than what the weather will be&quot;) and the Isle of Conclusions, a place you have to jump to to get there. I also love the book's personifying such abstract concepts as statistics, like the (literally) half a child that Milo meets who's the end result of the average family having 2.58 children. It also has neat takes on people's points of view, like the boy who grows down, rather than up. Needless to say, it's pretty apparent that even though I loved this book as a kid, I appreciate it much more as an adult.If you remember reading this as a child, I strongly recommend you give it a look again. You'll likely pick up on quite a few things in the story that you might not have gotten the gist of in your youth!'Late"},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

It was my first &quot;favorite book&quot; (for all those what-are-your-favorite-book questions), and it continues to be a treasured classic on my shelf.The story follows the journey of Milo, a boy bored of basically everything around him. One day he receives a mysterious package that turns out to be a tollbooth. For lack of anything better to do, he puts it together and begins to play, only to find himself driving in an entirely different world. There he meets all sort of curious creatures, from a giant watchdog (literally, a dog whose body is a watch) and a humbug the size of a person. Juster plays with words as if they were tangible objects to juggle, and continually surprises the reader by turning ordinary events into magical occurrences. This book very much exemplifies the quote (and I apologize for not naming the speaker, who slips my mind at this moment) &quot;The universe is full of magical things, patiently waiting for our wits to get sharper.&quot;Although Norton Juster's tale will probably never receive as much wild acclaim as the Harry Potter series, The Phantom Tollbooth nevertheless exhibits its own quiet charm. It is full of original characters and entertaining events, and I heartily recommend it for any child, or adult for that matter, who would like to be amused for a few hours on a rainy afternoon - especially if you think there's nothing to do! It is a wonderful book to read to a child, and the simple black and white drawings scattered throughout the text belie the vivid pictures that Juster paints with his words."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

The unforgettable adventures of Milo as he travels to the Land Beyond (in a car that \\"goes without saying\\") are being re-released in a beautiful hardback edition. The wonderful pen and ink sketches of Jules Feiffer still dot the landscape of the book, and a new foreword by the author tells the story of how this book came to be.Adults for whom this book transports them back to childhood will particularly appreciate the wonderful collection of \\"celebrations\\" of The Phantom Tollbooth that appear at the end of the book.

One day, while in his room he see a large box. He opens, and quickly realizes it is the contents for making a tollbooth. The only thing that came with it was a little map and a note saying,&quot;Easily assembled at home, and for use by those who have never traveled in the lands beyond.&quot; Milo decides that since has nothing better to do he might as well build the tollbooth and go through it. What follows is a epic adventure filled with strange characters, like the Watchdog, and the Humbug. There are also odd places like the Dictionopolis and the Doldrums. There aren't enough superlatives for this book. Although it is written in a fun way like a children's book, it is not, due to a lot of sophisticated terms. It is a very good book and I would recommend it to most people over ten years old."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"I remember reading Norton Juster's &quot;The Phantom Tollbooth&quot; when I was in third grade and liking it for its adventure, its characters, and its wordplay (though I missed most of it that time around). I've kept the same copy over the years - both covers have fallen off, but I have fond memories of it. About a week ago I took it off the shelf and read it again because I was bored (much like Milo, the book's main character, was when he first stepped into the Tollbooth). What I found was a splendid allegorical story that has a refreshing lookout on life quite different from that preached by most children's fantasy. The genre of escapist fantasy, fueled by claims that as long as one has imagination one doesn't have to do anything, is debunked by this book. Its last words are &quot;I would like to make another trip, but I really don't know when I'll have the time. There's just so much to do right here.&quot;The wordplay in this book approaches Carollian proportions in parts. The descriptions of the demons near the end (including such monstrosities as the Horrible Hopping Hindsight, a &quot;most unpleasant fellow whose eyes were in the rear and whose rear was out in front... he invariably leapt before he looked and never cared where he was going as long as he knew why he shouldn't have gone to where he'd been&quot;) are wonderfully clever and illustrate the worse sides of human nature very well. Other characters - Alec Bings (he sees through things); the fat/thin/tiny/giant man, Dr. Dischord and the Awful DYNNE; Chroma the color conductor; the Spelling Bee; and the .58 of a boy (he's one of the 2.58 children the average family has) are all so well done that one finds oneself reading their parts over and over again with a grin on one's face.Though the allegory becomes too simple as one grows older, it should be returned to over and over again just to see if you missed anything the last time around. It was only recently that I noticed the wonderful line &quot;Is everybody who lives in Ignorance as bad as you?&quot;"},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"What a wonderful book! Somewhere between Alice In Wonderland and a deluxe dictionary, this book is a wordy phenomena that will amuse kids and adults alike. Word jokes abound, alongside math jokes and the quintessential quest. (Did I just say that?)Milo is a young boy who is bored -- we know virtually nothing of his life other than that, but it's enough. One day a little purple tollbooth with accompanying car appear where he lives, and out of boredom takes a little trip through the tollbooth. But soon he finds himself in a place unlike any other.Mired in the doldrums, where the potatolike inhabitants laze around, Milo meets Tock the watchdog, who proceeds to take him to Dictionopolis. After a few run-ins with the bizarre local inhabitants (enormous insect the Spelling Bee, the dignified Humbug, the square cop) he is informed by the Which that Rhyme and Reason, two beautiful and wise princesses, are missing. Until they are returned, the kings of mathematics and words will continue to clash and there will be constant disharmony.So Milo, being the hero, is sent off with the Humbug and Tock to rescue Rhyme and Reason. Along the way he encounters a menagerie of strange creatures and situations, like the kingdom where speaking is impossible. Or the Horrible DYNNE, a smoky monster who loves horrible noises. Contradictory Canby. The &quot;shortest tall man,&quot; &quot;tallest short man,&quot; &quot;thinnest fat man,&quot; and so forth who are all the same man. The demons are truly chilling as Milo and his friends reach the end of their journey. And many, many more!This book's appeal is not limited to kids. Many of the sly word jokes may be caught mainly by adults, but even if you do not understand one they will still entertain. The book is written with a little too little detail, but the sweet illustrations make up for any lack of wordiness. The teachings near the end are carefully woven for young readers (though some adults could use the message) but don't become heavy-handed in their delivery.The characters are great. Cool-headed, rational Milo could be any one of us from the way he tries to deal with his sitations. Tock, the very patient watchdog, is a wonderful character full of pizzazz; yet you know he has something of a soppy heart underneath. The Humbug is simply a delightfully skewed character.Fans of Lewis Carroll, witty satire, and/or original fantasy should check this out immediately!"},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"It's nearly impossible to heap too much praise on The Phantom Tollbooth. I read it for the first time 30+ years ago and I never, ever forgot it. I still read it -- and I'm 41 years old!One of the biggest thrills of my life (okay, so maybe I lead a sheltered life) was actually meeting the author, Norton Juster, on a book signing tour in the Milwaukee area about four years ago. After raptly listening to him read his favorite passages from the book, I walked up to his table, shook his hand and said, &quot;I can't tell you how much I've enjoyed this book since I first read it three decades ago. It's still one of my favorite books. Thank you for writing it.&quot;I know that wasn't the most eloquent thing I could have said, but I was completely in awe. Norton Juster is an almost mythical author to me and his book The Phantom Tollbooth is legendary. The only thing that could have affected me more is if I'd met Crockett Johnson, author of Harold and the Purple Crayon. (That's the other kids' book that touched my soul and helped shape my soul.)Anyway, Mr. Juster signed the hardcover &quot;anniversary edition&quot; of The Phantom Tollbooth and I went on my way, smiling as broadly as if I'd just won the lottery.It's hard to describe the plot of The Phantom Tollbooth and do justice to its puns, literary style and mind-bending, imaginative scenarios. Basically, it's the story of a young boy named Milo who finds everything boring in life -- until he discovers a toy car that takes him on an incredible journey to a land sharply divided into the land of numbers and the land of words. The characters he meets along the way are among the most clever and memorable I've ever read. And the narrative is razor sharp, with plays on words flying fast and furious.Simply put, The Phantom Tollbooth is a feast for the imagination, a seven course meal for the mind, pure nourishment for the soul.Sure, this is considered a kids' book. Yet, there is still enough depth and complexity and entertainment to keep adults on their toes as well.If you're an adult who's never read The Phantom Tollbooth, go buy a copy. (Or order one from Amazon if you're shy about being seen buying one at your local bookstore.) If you have kids, do them a huge favor and give a copy to them (I'd tell you to read it to them, but some of the plays on words can only be discovered by seeing the words in print; they need to read it for themselves to fully appreciate it).There aren't many books around this intelligent and fun -- especially for kids. Do yourself a huge favor and order a copy of The Phantom Tollbooth today...and rediscover your imagination."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"I first encountered THE PHANTOM TOLLBOOTH when I was in second grade, and now, as a 27 year-old Ph.D. candidate, I cherish this book more and more. I read it at least once yearly to remind myself of the blessings of the imagination. THE PHANTOM TOLLBOOTH stresses the importance of education and applied critical thought in a charming manner. More importantly, it shows the dangers of blind, thoughtless existence and contrasts those to the fantastical beauty of the creatively engaged individual. This book tops my gift list for friends and family of all ages."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

Along with The 21 Balloons, Alice In Wonderland, Tom Sawyer, The Hobbitt, Roald Dahl's books, Dr. Seuss, Wind In The Willows and a few others, this book showed my young mind what imagination and whimsy are all about.I owe my happiness to my state of mind, and I owe that largely to learning what life and thinking about life are about from books like this."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

The vocabulary was beyond his level, but the lessons were not. He loved the story, he identfied with the little boy, and he learned right along with Milo. And as I read the book to him, I realized I enjoyed it just as much now as I did when I was young.Norton Juster has an amazing skill for writing a story that is very entertaining and captivating, while managing to educate. Milo is a character who is over-all nice but has flaws and he is very easy to relate to. I loved that Juster not only covered the importance of education, but behavior, and common sense as well.A wonderful book for any child to encourage creativity, interest in learning, and to help the child identify their own bad habits."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

For the students I have taught who claim to never have read a book or read a book that has interested them. This book has been a great lauching pad for an exciting career as a reader.

She adored that book, and it was read several times, just as I did. She called me, this afternoon, and asked if I could find a new copy for her, as she had lost the original. She wants to share it with some of her friends, as they have never read the story. Even though they are all in their early 20's now, she feels that it is a story that will be meaningful to them. At the same time, I'm going to get a copy for our nephew as he is 11, and has never heard of the story. It is amazing that it is a \\"hidden treasure\\" for so many."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"Confusion and Chaos overruns the land of Wisdom, and the only person that can save Rhyme and Reason and restore peace and order in the kingdom is young Milo, who has just been introduced to this new world. You will not be able to put down this amazing fantasy story by Norton Juster. Have your change ready for The Phantom Tollbooth!The story starts in a small town sometime in the 60's or 70's, but when Milo finds the tollbooth, he is transported to the magical land of Wisdom. Milo is a boy about 10 or 11 who goes through life uninterested and lazily, not learning anything that he will need to know later on. All this changes when he comes home to find a mysterious package in his bedroom.First, Milo finds the magical tollbooth in his bedroom which leads him in to Wisdom. Soon he meets Tock, the ticking watchdog and his journey begins. The first stop they make is in Dictionopolis where he learns that the wise and just princesses, Rhyme and Reason, were put into a prison for a good cause, but the plan backfired and now the kingdom is on the verge of destruction. But can he make it in time to save them? The story continues as he travels through the new, weird world of Wisdom and makes many profound discoveries, though all of them are only to prepare him for the journey through the Mountains of Ignorance to the Castle in the Air.I thought that this was a very good book. The thing I liked best about it was that I was learning the lessons along with Milo, so that I could really see his point of view. There were many funny characters, the riddles were a little hard to decipher, but in the end they always made you laugh. The thing I did not like was that sometimes, if Milo was facing some type of monster or demon, he would not get scared. Perhaps in the beginning he was just that ignorant. I think that many people would enjoy this book. It is appropriate for all ages, lots of illustrations, and will keep you wanting more. Go and pick up your copy today!~By Isaiah C.

There, he meets a ticking watchdog named Tock, visits the two rivaling kingdoms of Dictionopolis and Digitopolis, and even enters an impossible quest to rescue the princesses of Ryhme and Reason. Along the way, Milo learns a surprising secret: life is far from boring-it's more exciting than he ever imagined!The two main characters in the story are Milo and Tock. Milo is a sensible little fellow who is very courageous and intelligent. He gets any job done right. Tock is a crazy watchdog who will make you laugh over and over again. He is very helpful.The setting is something that changes a lot in the story. It takes place in present day. Milo and Tock visit places like Expectations, where they first started off, The Doldrums, where nothing ever changes and no one ever thinks, Dictionopolis, where words are the highlight of the city, the rivalring city, Digitopolis, where numbers are the highlight, Reality, where no sound is ever heard, The Island of Conclusions, where you go to if you jump to conclusions, and finally, the dreaded Mountains of Ignorance, where Milo and Tock rescue Ryhme and Reason.I think the theme that the author wants to tell you is that life is very unexpected and you shouldn't underestimate what it can do. Life isn't boring. If you think about it, it's more exciting then people think.I loved this book because it wasn't your average plot. The author is so descriptive and exact that the book seems to take you in and make you feel like you're there, watching the whole thing. The author went WAY past just painting a picture in your mind. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a good adventure or who loves to laugh!"},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"Is it a child's adventure tale, or a metaphor for education? Is it full of wry jokes for adults, or lovable characters for children? Well, the answer to both questions is; YES.Somehow Juster was able to combine all things in children's literature in this one book: adventure, learning, character, humor, and a fair bit of what sounds like free verse poetry if you read the right parts aloud, say to a child you know.The story is centered around Milo, the boy bored with everything, and his journey through the lands of letters, numbers, and wilds between. The island of Conclusions, easy to jump to, but hard to swim away from, is one such memorable place. Or the carraige in Dictionopolis where you must be silent, because it goes without saying....This voyage through learning has kept me entertained throught my childhood, teens, and adulthood. Up until three years ago, I read it at least one a year (and why did I stop?), and I still find new jokes I didn't get the last time as I read through. I own an old, hardcover copy, and I hope it never fades.And I hope my children discover a land that is more real then most of the books they have at their fingertips these days, and cherish it as much as I do for the sake of my future grandchildren."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"Tock (the watch dog on the cover illustration) is my new favorite literary character -- although I'm a fan of the Humbug, too. The description of how Tock was named and the trauma to his parents and their fate left me laughing out loud. (Really. I was laughing out loud -- it's a sparkling passage). While I was delighted with the book as an adult, for a bright, inquisitive, interested kid, the book should take him or her on a marvelous journey, providing plenty to think and talk about at the end. If you were to give this to a kid, please consider reading it ahead of time so you can talk with the child after he or she has finished it. There's a lot of angles to go with it.When I finished my copy, I sent it to my Godson. He's a little young for it now, but I hope the note I sent along with it will whet his appetite for it when the time is right.Enjoy."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

Author Norton Juster has a brilliant mastery of using idioms and language to mold a world that is fun and literary all at the same time. It's not a simple adventure tale, rather a book that should be savored for the intelligence it brings. Juster did not dumb it down from fear that kids might not understand it.

Hall large print for young readers)","review":"Someone in this stream said \\"The Phantom Tollbooth\\" was their first favorite book. Oh, how I wish I could make that claim [mine was \\"The Story of Babar\\"].I didn't start \\"really\\" reading until I was late into my teens; and so, with a few exceptions like E. B. White and Beverly Cleary, I didn't read children's literature - nothing in the independent readers or young adult genres. A few months ago I resolved to remedy that sad fact by reading those books I skipped while growing up.What a treasure I've discovered. Thus far I've read eight or nine books by Roald Dahl (now one of my very favorite authors), plus \\"Peter Pan,\\" \\"The Children of Green Knowe,\\" \\"Mary Poppins,\\" \\"The Borrowers,\\" \\"A Bear Called Paddington,\\" \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,\\" the lovely and bucolic \\"Wind in the Willows\\" and \\"The Invention of Hugo Cabret\\" (a true masterpiece on many levels).Of all I've read Norton Juster's \\"The Phantom Tollbooth\\" has had the most profound effect. Over the decades it has been favorably compared to \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.\\" However, the work it most closely resembles is L. Frank Baum's \\"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.\\" Like Dorothy, Milo in \\"Tollbooth\\" is a child removed from the boredom of everyday life and transported to a magical land full of wonders, mysteries and dangers. On his trek to find his way home he meets a score of memorable characters - most notably the clock dog Tock. Milo and Dorothy are cousins of a sort; they both discover that there's no place like home and that home is place filled with wonders and magic if only you open yourself up to experience them.Claims have been made that Norton's wordplay and puns are too advanced for younger readers. So what? George Bernard Shaw once said: \\"Make it a rule never to give a child a book you would not read yourself,\\" which is a tenant I hold with. This book's sophistication simply enhances its multigenerational appeal (not unlike all those Looney Tunes and Merry Melodies with classical and pop culture references only adults understood). \\"Tollbooth\\" was pure pleasure to read and had me grinning like the Cheshire Cat from beginning to end."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

He discovers on his fantastic adventure the importance of learning, consequences of our choices and actions, enjoying the present and all the world has to offer, and learning from one's mistakes. The vocabulary and word play are rich in this very imaginative and humorous story.Here are two of my favorite quotes from the book: &quot;...Whatever we learn has a purpose and whatever we do affects everything and everyone else, if even in the tiniest way...For whenever you learn something new, the whole world becomes that much richer.&quot; And, &quot;...You had the courage to try; and what you can do is often simply a matter of what you will do.&quot;This book sat on the shelf for years.

Now that I am a parent I have read many of the &quot;classics&quot; to my own children, and I cannot think of a finer book. Winnie-The-Pooh has some of the same observant elements pointing out common features of human nature, but they are more subtle and further apart in the story.

By exploring a wonder-filled world (that would make a fine movie!), he plays on words and phrases to make visual concepts that most of us, young and old alike, would normally ignore.

The story takes you from a bedroom to a strange world and back again.It is filled with play on words,explanations for things like day and night, and events dealing with perspective. I loved the play on words in the book. For example, Milo meets a whether man who, instead of predicting the weather, predicts WHETHER or not there will be weather. It may sound complicated, but Mr. Juster explains all events and places so that you can understand.

Hall large print for young readers)","review":"I remember back, many years ago when I was growing up, when my mother would read me chapters from this story. Over 20 years later I still have that very same book. It became one of my most prized posession, and not just because of the memories I have from it. The story itself was something that sparked my love of reading.I have gone through here and read many of the negetive remarks, mostly by children, that have stated the story has no depth. This book is not about creating a huge back story surrounding the character. It is more about doing something positive in the world around you. There are many great lessons to be learned from this book. Yes, it is fictional, but like a lot of the books written at that time, it incorporates many of the inconsistencies of real life.If you are an adult buying this book for your children. Don't just have them read it. As others have said, there are things that a child will not understand. Instead read it to them, let them ask their questions, and enjoy the time you spend with your children.If your a child reading this, always remember that you should always look beyond just what the words on the page say. Open your mind, and ask questions. Never close your mind off to the wealth of possibilties in this world. Think for yourself. When you get older you will enjoy a more broad depth of knowledge, and lastly never stop reading. Games and computers are great, lord knows I have played my share, and even code for them, but nothing can top a book. The TV and games give you everything, but a book you have to create the world. Allow yourself to be drawn into the world. Get lost and think deeply about the world that you created, with the guidance of the author."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"I didn't know what to expect when picking up The Phantom Tollbooth.Sure, I had read it and loved it when I was younger. And the names Milo and Tock seemed vaguely familiar to me. But reading it again begged the question: Would I love it again?The answer? Hell yes.The premise of The Phantom Tollbooth is that a young boy, Milo, is too busy going places and doing things to live life. When the Tollbooth mysteriously arrives in his bedroom, he hops in his car and soon finds himself on a deserted road in the Kingdom of Wisdom. He soon meets Tock, a watchdog who ticks, the Humbug who is usually mistaken, and a cast of characters that are like no other. When discovering the lands make no sense without Rhyme and Reason, the princesses who have been banished, he undertakes a mission to save the kingdom of Wisdom.Without being overtly educational, the book strives to highlight all the things we humans are too busy doing to acknowledge. Milo journeys through the lands of Digitopolis (ruled by the Mathemagician), Dictionopolis (ruled by the Mathemagician's brother, King Azaz), the Mountains of Ignorance, the Island of Conclusions, the Valley of Sound, and the Forest of Sight to save the Princesses. Each land has a corresponding character (or several) that emphasize the importance of appreciating the world around Milo, and indirectly, the reader.I was quite impressed with the cleverness of Norton Juster, as he managed to create so many characters that epitomized their individual lands and lessons. Chroma resides within the Forest of Sight where he conducts a colorful symphony daily that teach Milo just how amazing the world can be when displayed in technicolor. Chroma's rendition of the world is played out on a daily basis by his orchestra, which Milo soon finds out is much more complicated than it seems. Later, when Milo arrives in the Valley of Sound, he learns the Soundkeeper has forbidden any sort of noise, wanting to teach the residents the importance of silence. Yet a withheld \\"But\\" on the tip of Milo's tongue restores sound to the Valley, and reminds Milo of the beauty of noise. Likewise, Juster plays upon conventional wit by having Milo, Tock, and the Humbug absconded to the Island of Conclusions when they make an assumption that proves to be incorrect.What I loved most about The Phantom Tollbooth is that these were characters I wanted to befriend, to spend a day with, to learn from. Yet in a way, we all have. We've all dealt with the Terrible Trivium, \\"demon of petty tasks and worthless jobs, ogre of wasted effort, and monster of habit.\\" Similarly, we've all dealt with the Senses Taker - anyone who's ever worked in retail knows exactly what I mean. At the same time, we've been comforted by Rhyme and Reason, who in this book are anthropomorphized by the two banished Princesses. Juster's ability to take a fictional world and translate it so closely to a world that we all live in and sometimes forget to appreciate is what makes the Phantom Tollbooth such a successful modern fairy tale.Though it is meant to be a children's book, there are lessons every child and adult can learn and relearn, while enjoying the fabulous whimsy of The Phantom Tollbooth. Now, to figure out how to get my own Tollbooth, so I can go hang out with Tock..."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

It was very exciting and not boring at all.Emma-10 years old."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"My all time favorite book is the amazing, adventurous but fictional book called the Phantom Tollbooth. This awesome book was made by Norton Juster. He has made other books such as the Dot and the Line and the Hello Goodbye Window. I haven't read the other books yet but I plan on doing so soon. The back ground is a world beyond your wildest dreams that a boy has to travel through. The theme is to always look on the brighter side of things.I think that the author's writing style is very different from the normal writing you usually see in books. I also like how in this book he makes fun of things in the dictionary and that is why I thing he is probrobly the most creative writer in the world. The main characters in the story are the Humbug, Tock, and Milo, but my all time favorite is Tock.I couldn't think of only one favorite scene so I had to make it two. My two favorite scenes in the book are when he goes to Digitopilouse, and my other favorite scene is when he goes to save the princesses named Rime and Reason. I don't want to give the hiding away so you will have to read the book to see if he saves the princesses or if something really bad happens.I recommend this book to people ages 10 and up because they might not understand it and both boys and girls. The reason why I like this book is because it makes fun of the dictionary and it has a different type of humor. It also gives people a chance to use there wildest imagination, and that is why I have picked it to be my favorite book."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"The most influential book I read growing up was The Phantom Tollbooth, which I randomly picked off the library shelf in school. An exhilarating & humorous ride through a fantasy world of numbers, words, reasoning & logic. Weird choice I know, but what it taught me was ... imagination! And creativity! And how to write!I don't know why I liked The Phantom Tollbooth so much - but I did - it was truly enthralling to read at night under the covers - really mind-expanding & regarded now as one of the true classics of children's literature - using puns & word play to explore the concepts of rhyme & reason to achieve wisdom. I must say this one book may be THE reason I am a writer. And the amazing thing is that I picked it out by complete accident!From wikipedia: Critics have always acknowledged that the book is advanced for most children, who would not understand all the wordplay or the framing metaphor of how to achieve wisdom. Writers for sophisticated audiences, like the reviewer in The New York Times, have focused on the children and adults able to appreciate it; for them, it has \\"something wonderful for anybody old enough to relish the allegorical wisdom of \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" and the pointed whimsy of \\"The Wizard of Oz.\\"\\" It is now generally acknowledged to be a classic of children's literature."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"A classic children's fantasy tale that I'd never heard of til recently--written in 1961 and full of the sort of puns and wordplay I would have loved as a youngster--wish I'd known about it then.Milo is a young boy who is disillusioned with life--wherever he is and whatever he's doing, he wishes he were somewhere else doing something different. Thoroughly bored with life is our Milo. One day he comes home to find a tollbooth in his bedroom, something he's pretty sure wasn't there before. He climbs in his little car, pays his toll and finds himself suddenly somewhere else and certainly doing something different! Consulting the map, he decides to head for Dictionopolis, but first must travel through Expectations, the doldrums and the Foothills of Confusion.Wonderful story with a very basic life lesson (that I think some people never quite learn, actually)...hilarious characters, word streams and funky illustrations as well. Recommended for folks of any age!"},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"Last night I finished re-reading Norton Juster's young adult classic, The Phantom Tollbooth. This book is more delightful than a Pixar animated film, more engaging than a 1 carat diamond ring, and more thoughtful than your last Mother's Day gift (not that that's saying much). Words that come to mind: erudite, witty, exciting, clever, creative, and fun.The Phantom Tollbooth chronicles the adventures of Milo, a young boy with too much time on his hands and not enough imagination. One day, Milo discovers a mysterious (phantom?!) tollbooth in his room, and soon finds himself in the midst of a quest for Rhyme and Reason, \\"...without which Wisdom withers.\\"Juster's masterpiece is full of elegantly worded ideas about the best parts of life. It is far from a treatise about \\"how to live,\\" though - rather, Juster puts forth concepts that, for all their complexity, come across as simple truths. This is a perfect book to start and finish on a lazy afternoon. Read it and remember: \\"...the most important reason for going from one place to another is to see what's in between.\\""},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"I first read this book when I was about 11 years old, and I remember that I liked it at the time although it seemed a bit strange. As I've read it several times over the years, I find that it gets better and better.My favorite aspect of this book is the constant play on words. Every little detail has some significant meaning when taken literally, figuratively, or otherwise. Names of characters and locations in particular have this effect, but one example that stands out to me is when Milo (the main character) is in the city of Dictionopolis. Upon entering a horseless carriage, Milo asks how it will move, and the reply is \\"Quite, for it goes without saying\\". Sure enough, the carriage takes off as soon as everyone stops talking.I would recommend this book to anyone regardless of age - it's definitely a classic."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

After he visits the city of letters, he decides to rescue the two princesses called Rhyme and Reason. On his journey he meets the watchdog, the humbug, and many other people. Then he escapes the demons in the Mountains of Ignorance and rescues the princesses. He then goes home and finds so many interesting things to do life, that he does not even mind that the the Tollbooth has dissapeared."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"The Phantom Tollbooth is among the handful of books I remember clearly from childhood, and by clearly I mean that I have treasured crystalline mental images of various scenes through the decades. It is also one of the first books I bought for my son when he was just a baby. I got a hardback just for the heck of it and set it aside.When I did read it to him at age five, he loved it -- his first \\"chapter book.\\" And so we read it again by his demand. And again. And ... you can now guess why I regret liking it, as I've memorized it!I believe Norton Juster, an architect by trade (read an excellent interview in Salon), deserves the accolades this book draws. It is like an onion, Shrek might say: there are many layers to explore and many lessons subtle or not as Milo passes through subjects of varied difficulty. The wordplay and numberplay are actually quite good, and I normally don't digest punnery well. The drawings by Jules Feiffer are terrific, illustrative without being intrusive, without controlling those mental images we all construct for ourselves.The idealism that permeates the volume is simply beautiful.A classic, a must-read, though I concede and caution it may be dry and wordy for some. (I'm frankly surprised that my son enjoyed it so young.) But above all I look forward to when my son is old enough to read it by himself. :-)"},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K.

It makes you think a lot...I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!"},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"Regardless of your age, you have a treat in store if you have not read THE PHANTOM TOLLBOOTH by Norton Juster. Not only does Juster delight the reader with word play throughout the novel, he tells a wonderful story: Milo, a bored little boy, has a fantastic adventure after passing through a tollbooth that mysteriously appears in his room. Milo learns many valuable lessons as he attempts to rescue the Princesses of Rhyme and Reason, who have been banished from the land.Reading THE PHANTOM TOLLBOOTH aloud enhances students' appreciation of the novel's word play. It also makes the novel more accessible to students for whom decoding poses problems. Frequent pauses in reading can provide the opportunity for students to infer words' meanings from their context or to predict what will happen later in the story.THE PHANTOM TOLLBOOTH also presents a wealth of opportunities to integrate art and music with language study. Exploration of less familiar modalities can challenge students who normally excel at traditional school tasks and can enable &quot;right-brained&quot; students to exhibit their strengths. This departure from the routine is healthy for everyone."},{"Title":"The Phantom Tollbooth (G.K. Hall large print for young readers)","review":"Norton Juster uses his command of the English Language to poke fun at some of our idiomatic expressions while at the same time telling a wonderful fantasy story about a young boy named Milo.I have read this book to my students every year for the past 23 years and still have former students tell me that it was one of their favorite memories.This book is a greaat treasure for both children and adults alike.

The first time I picked it up, it amazed me with its creativity, and even now after having read it until the cover is falling off, its just as good if not better. Sure, it isn;t the deepest book ever, but Milo does change over the course of the book, and a lot of character development isn't always needed when you've got a book as fun as this 1 is.

I personally liked Tock because he is very happy and is very correct. He is very time loving. I would not recemmend the movie because it left some parts out, canged it and fliped things around.

The story starts out interesting enough but gets a little bogged down in the middle by the constant flashbacks and backstories. It just sort of stops moving forward for a bit and then when it does pick up it becomes way too far-fetched to the point of ridiculous. It becomes way too fantasy and unbelievable even for fiction. At the end of the story he almost seems to be in a hurry to finish up and the loose ends all become nice & tidy very convienently.I bought it at a discount ($6 for the hardcover) and read it on my Carribean cruise vacation. It was fun enough to read for a few nights at sea and a few days on the beach.

But it drags on and on and on. It should have just been a collection of short stories. And many people have mentioned, the \\"50 page letter\\" towards the end of the book was torture. The background stories were monotonous...even on a character that pops up in the last few chapters. Lot's of uselss info.The concept of the book is great and after getting back to NYC it was a great escape to the Caribbean while taking the subway to work. I just put so much effort into it that I had to finish it...and after being annoyed throughout I actually put the book down with a smile. Maybe because I finally finished it but also because it had a really touching ending.Basically, it's a mindless read, nothing super exciting ever happens. It's just a long tall tale."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"This is a fun book to read, nothing heavy or really serious. Parts of it can be kind of corny or unbelievable. Someone dreaming of a Caribbean escape would probably enjoy this book."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"Tully Mars continues his adventures in Jimmy Buffet's tale A Salty Piece of Land. First, I would like to say that I'm a pretty serious Parrot Head, so my expectations were high for this book. When we first met Tully in Tales From Margarittaville, he was heading for the beaches of Alabama to eventually set sail into the Gulf Stream Breeze.Buffet's writing style is one I enjoy, but this book didn't have the ebb and flow of a well thought out work. Tully finds himself getting high, reveling in sexual debachary and still running from his former employeer.Mar's friends and newest employeers are interesting characters, but there is a certain lack of depth to each that would have made the story better.If you are interested in just getting away for a while, then this book will allow you to grow a pencil thin mustache and offer a change in attitude.If you are looking for something that will keep you mildly intrigued, this may not be your read...."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"Most of the reivews here are probably from long time Jimmy Buffett fans. I'm pretty neutral on his music and haven't really followed his career in any way. We picked up this book at the airport, oddly enough on our way to key west. My wife selected it, after which I spent a good 5 minutes laughing at the idea of Jimmy Buffett writing a novel. She proceeded to politely ignore me during this time... Forgive me, but I never thought a guy who was known for carefree beach bumming and songs like 'why don't we get drunk and screw' would actually turn out something worth reading.Well, I'm happy to admit, I was wrong. This book hooked me pretty quickly and was a good read, especially while gazing out over the keys on vacation. The story is a bit out there at times, but that's part of what makes it an entertaining read. The writing was well done and it constantly painted a vivid image of distant tropical lands most of us will never see.The over the top story telling really draws a reader in, allowing you to suspend your disbelief and begin to imagine the idyllic life that one would have doing nothing more than bumming around the carribean with no posessions or plans. While on a practical level, we all know this lifestyle would not be nearly as pleasant as Buffett describes, the dream of doing it anyway captivates the reader and presents an enjoyable fantasy that any of us trapped in modern suburbia and 9-5 jobs can dive into."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"Wow, \\"Ninety Two in the Shade\\" meets \\"Sundog\\".

The story is told from the viewpoint of Tully Mars, a Wyoming cowboy turned sailor and then fishing guide off the Yucatan Peninsula. He has a conch shell, two paintings, and a horse that he takes with him everywhere, including on a boat. Tully is down to earth but he also has an Indian spirit friend, Johnny Red Dust who dispenses advice into Tully's ear at critical moments. Tully's life takes more twists than a swizzle stick in a rum cola as he runs from the law and a revengeful former lady boss, whom he done wrong, but nothing of the level to warrant her sending bounty hunters on his trail.You have to like this book that romps and runs from Wyoming to New Orleans, across the Caribbean to Belize, and then to points eastward and back to the States. Author Jimmy Buffet must have had his tongue in his cheek when he named some of his characters Clark Gable, Tex Sex, and the horse, Mr. Twain. Then there is the improbable but very agile and likeable tough lady he calls Cleopatra Highbourne. Cleopatra's a 101 and on her own Holy Grail. She's searching for a Fresnel light, something used in lighthouses from long ago. Cleopatra's on a final mission in life, to restore an old, 150-year-old lighthouse on Cayo Loco before she ends up on a funeral pyre.On a more serious note, but threaded skillfully in the story, is a bundle of research, history, and probably, thinly-veiled real life adventures of the author. The tales sometimes stand alone as vignettes in chapter lengths. Buffet also knows and tells a good story about the vagaries of human nature, and the story leaves the reading smiling, nodding, satisfied, and oh yes, humming some of the familiar lyrics he sprinkles throughout."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"In this book, Mr. B. takes us further down the road less travelled. That is to say, most people don't live the lives of his characters but wish they could. There are these possibilities that exist in all our lives that never seem to come to fruition. We want them to but we allow ourselves to be caught up in the day to day problems of existence and we never achieve our potentials. Somehow Mr. B. has been able to live his life on his own terms and it has paid off. I think that we are envious of his ability to do this. He appeals to the romantic in most of us. However, Margaritaville is mostly a state of mind and one can achieve that if one really wants to.Ted Shred"},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"Tully Mars, keeper of the light in the Caribbean mind of Jimmy Buffet, meets expatriates and adventurers in his light hearted quest to escape Wyoming.

The characters are mostly believable and the settings are so well descibed, they're actually visible--or at least they were to me. There was one part I thought was not necessary, but you can get past it and continue with the real story about restoring an old lighthouse to its original splendor. I have been a Buffett fan for 30 years and I am so glad he has shared some stories with us outside of his music. I think there is a bit of the beach bum in all of us and this book lets us live it out a little. Thanks, Jimmy--hope you find time to share more stories."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"A book for simple fun reading. The writing style moves along without getting tedious and boring and the subject matter is of great interest. Tully Mars, a displaced cowboy ends up banging around the caribbean and meeting a cast of very interesting characters. There is a lighthouse, a 101 year old woman, bounty hunters and medicine men keeping Tully from getting bored with the easy life.The characters are fully developed with very interesting and carefully detailed backstories, but its the way they all interact and twist together that makes the story unique. Each person plays an integral role in a jigsaw puzzle that flows effortlessly.Previous reviews have talked a lot about knowing the characters and/or music but I picked this up without any previous connection. I've never heard Jimmy Buffets music other than Margaritaville on the radio, never read any of his stories, but I had no problem following the plot and the various people. Each one is carefully fleshed out and no previous knowledge is necessary.The story is not a slam-bang action one, if your looking for explosions and guns and death-defying peril then look elsewhere. If your looking for some simple escapism and a gentle feel-good story about people who seem so real you want to go meet them - then pick this up.I listened to the audio-book and the narrator (there are 2 listed) did a servicable job. Not a lot of voice inflection even during the few exciting scenes but he conveyed the laid-back attitude of the book and handled minor voice changes to keep the various people apart."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"I am a huge Buffet fan, but somebody should tell Jimmy to stick to singing! This is a rambling tale that really has no plot no beginning and no end. The main purpose seems to be to take the reader on a cruise of the Caribbean with little or no purpose. He does try and develop a cast of memorable characters, but most fall flat with no soul -- which is hard to understand given his musical genius for creating great characters in his song. There really is nothing here, I finished the book 24 hours ago and I can't even remember what it was about. The only reason this book made it to print was because the author's name is Jimmy Buffett."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"A Salty Piece Of Land is the third fictional work by the multimedia artist Jimmy Buffett. The book centers around a cowboy from Wyoming, Tully Mars, who has fled to Caribbean to an escape a warrant for his arrest that was filed by his crazed employer Thelma Barston. The book follows Tully through several stops as a fishing guide, a mate on a large schooner, involved in a wild party and near capture in Belize and as the rebuilder of an old lighthouse which is the centerpiece of the story. The book is really a collection of vignettes that are told by Tully or through letters written to Tully by a country singer/adventure pilot Willie Singer who is Tully's idol. The book bounces around between telling Tully's story and that of his benefactor, the 101-year old captain of the schooner, Cleopatra Hightower. The stories are loosely connected together with a nice out of left-field ending. If you are looking for a fast, easy-paced read than you can't go wrong with this book. It is like the best of Mr. Buffett's music, bright, sunny and full of good cheer."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"I love Jimmy Buffett.

It's full of adventure, and every character has their own story. Plus, he throws in so many lyrics from his songs, and they fit right in with the character and the setting. I have seen a few bad reviews for this book, but I think those people are reading some other book or are just buttholes by nature. This is the most adventeurous book I've ever read, set in the most beautiful places on Earth. Jimmy is not a novelist by trade and I think that's why certain people aren't opening up to this book. Well, guess what: He's a novelist now, so get used to it. He's darn great at it, too. His great storytelling mixed with his vivid imagination make this book a bestseller on my list, and it should on your list, too!"},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"Ernest Hemmingway he is not, but nontheless the mayor of Margaritaville takes us literally under his seaplane wing as we co-travel once again on a first class laid back tour of the blue and green waters of the Caribbean.The characters in the story are a delightful mix of people the author has obviously met at one time or another during his adventures and he treats the reader to all their eccentricities.A product of the drug culture of the 1970s, Jimmy can't resist the occasional mention of a joint, and perhaps he feels it necessary to validate himself as a novelist with sexual forays that weren't mentioned nearly as often in his previous work. However he still weaves a charming tale of adventure and spins great yarn.A must read for the Parrothead legions who over the years have come to expect a seasonal escape to the lower lattitudes, and yet another reason for you poor big city souls to say good bye to ugly black snowdrifts of the north and hello to the palm tree laden sundrenched skies of the really DEEP south."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"I was happy to get the book as a gift but was disappointed soon into the story. It is a rambling tale filled with a solid load of cheap shots at Catholics, conservatives and anything remotely American. This probably plays well with his friends in Hollywood and Long Island but gets tedious to a reader trying to follow the plot. An example of the authors weak attempt at political commentary was to kill off the antagonist, who was a poodle rancher in Wyoming, in an avalanche after she unnsuccessfully ran for Congress as a born-again, conservative Republican but lost because she was found to be into S&M with some dude in Miami."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"Jimmy Buffett's unique outlook on life and Americana aren't missing anything in this novel that, like his music, paints a colorful picture of Carribbean fun.

Fruit Loop says five stars, and THANKS!"},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"I have been a Buffett fan my entire adult life and my iPod is filled with all of his music. If yours is too, you'll be sorely disappointed with this book. It has no plot, no real story, it's just a run-on series of rambling nonsense. I had to force myself to finish it. If you're looking for some of Jimmy's truly unique blend of tropical country escapism, read Where is Joe Merchant or Tales From Margaritaville--again. Think I will, perhaps just for some redemption. p.s. The song of the same title (CD comes with the hardcover) is equally disappointing...a throwaway."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"A Salty Piece Of Land is a must read.

There is no denying that he in an incredibly imaginitive storyteller. From the beginning of the book to the end, Tully Mars and his journey grab you and don't let go. And it's not just his story that grabs you, it's all of the characters. Each has their own unique story told in a way that only Jimmy Buffett can do. If you are looking for a book that will be a great read to just escape for a little while, this is the one."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"Not sure why I didn't enter my review of this immediately after reading it a year ago, but life got in the way.This effort by JB was delayed several times and now I can see why. The detail he painted was very deep and his writing style has defintely evolved into one I connect with. Interesting storylines, subtle references, clever situations and the imagined smell of salt air make this novel by America's coolest songwriter one I'll be reading over and over.Jimmy has grown through his writings and this book is a testament to his talents.

This book was a great read! With an ending only Jimmy would imagine."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"Being a big Buffett fan and having loved all of Jimmy's other books I raced out to get this one. However, it is not Jimmy's best work. I was hoping for something along the line of \\"Where is Joe Merchant\\" and this was not the case. Jimmy picks up with a character from his short story 'Take Another Road' from his book, \\"Tales From Magaritaville.\\" The book just about begins where the story left off (Tully Mars is on fictional Cayo Loco instead of Key West). The first part of the book drags on almost without a purpose. While the second half does improve and even keeps you turning the page at some points, it is not enough to make this a great read. I recommend this to all Parrot Heads, but to the average reader or someone who is looking to pick up a Jimmy Buffett book I would suggest you start elsewhere."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"His great storytelling mixed with his artistic imagination make this book one of the tops on my list.Jimmy Buffet is more than an artist, he's a great storyteller."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"This was a fun and relaxing read.

Having grown up on a boat myself, this book took me back to sweet memories of my childhood."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"I was skeptical since Jimmy is more of a songwriter than a storyteller in my mind, but just really enjoyed this book.

I plan to reread the book in a few more months, after my memory takes over, and I forget some of it. Please keep those books and songs coming, Jimmy!"},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"Overall, this is an entertaining light read. It is not all that believable, but it doesn't have to be to be a good tale. And what else would you expect from Jimmy Buffett? :)"},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"This was the ideal way to read about the mind of the man who has life figured out. Nothing outragous as far as fictional novels go, in fact this was more of a perfect scenario that most of us wish could happen to us. Tully Mars takes opn the courage needed to just \\"escape\\" and not look back and always ending up in the unlikely situations and always finding a way to get though it. JImmy speaks to you throught the whole book. You hear his voice and mood. Perfect book to read on the beach, before bed, in train...anywhere! Just like one of his songs, JImmy Buffett brings the tropics to wherever you are. You learn so much history and the value of friendship and self-preservation through this. Reality vanished for a short time while reading this, and could only wish to end up in a situation like this!"},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"A really enjoyable read; if ever you have experienced indecision or consternation regarding your life's path, discovering the follow-your-nose adventures of Tully Mars will be quite satisfying."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"SynopsisTully Mars is back as the alter-ego of our favorite son-of-a-son-of-a-sailor, Jimmy Buffett. Tully is a Wyoming cowboy turned fugitive who runs (along with his horse) to a remote Caribbean island where he settles in as a fishing guide for a small resort. His crime is of no consequence whatsoever, but it doesn't keep him from being the target of a couple of bounty hunters willing to chase him to the ends of the earth.Tully has a keen sense of adventure and is a hopeless romantic. While learning the local culture, he befriends just about everyone he meets with his laid-back nature and \\"I'll try anything once\\" attitude. It seems to be his destiny to meet a salty lady who, at 101 years old, is the owner and Captain of an incredible 142-foot schooner, and whose mission in life is to scour the Caribbean in search of a rare antique lens she needs to restore her personal lighthouse to its original, fully functional glory. Tully takes up her cause, \\"searching for that lost shaker of salt\\" to complement the margarita that is his life.A collection of tales of pirates, pilots, treasure hunters and rock stars, and a wild fling at a spring-break foam party, as told from a rum-soaked vision of a ganja enhanced mind. * * *My Two Cents WorthThis selection was recommended by my wife - one of those she refers to as \\"a good summer read.\\" I think this means she read it while A. in the pool or B. on the boat.You don't have to be a stoned, chilled-out beach bum with a margarita buzz to enjoy this light-hearted story, but it would probably help. If you are even slightly a fan of the parrot-head culture, you will probably enjoy this Buffett original. I did. My expectations were low and were accordingly exceeded.The story wanders from island to island, character to character, and from romance to adventure, just as you would expect from a singer/songwriter. I found this book to be a refreshing change of pace in the dog-days of our sweltering Texas summer. It makes you feel good, like watching \\"Ferris Beuhler's Day Off\\" for the tenth time and still finding it funny.Just as Buffett's music will never be appreciated by opera aficionados, A Salty Piece of Land will be frowned upon by the literary elite, but who cares? Come Monday it'll be all right.Hardcover460 pages4 1/2 hours"},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"I love Buffett's music, and I've loved all of Buffett's books. This book is my favourite of them all - well, Jolly Mon is a good story - but this goes beyond a good story to very good storytelling. The characters are fun, full, and, if you've ever lived in the tropics you'll know, scarily real. The story makes you reflect, on your life, on life in general, and on what Buffett calls the songlines that only dreamers see.I bought this copy for a friend. It's the second hard copy I've given away. I also have it on my Kindle. It's the kind of story you want to share."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"This is my favorite of all of Jimmy's Books. It is like a sailing dream. Wish it were twice as long. Felt like I had lost a friend when I finished."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"It is difficult for me to compare it against other fiction, as I rarely read it. It was a very good book though. It seemed to start off slower, but once I got about half way through it, I couldn't wait to see what happens next. I got the book to read while on a cruise in the Bahamas, and it did not disappoint."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"I was lucky to receive an advance copy of the book. As a serious parrothead I was able to see the true life adventures of Jimmy Buffett played out by various characters in the book (Tully Mars and Willie Singer). The book is a work of \\"fictional facts\\" and lightly disguised life experiences of Jimy Buffett and his vivid imagination.The story is fantabulous as the late Mel Fisher would say. The day Jimmy Buffett was at the discovery of the Atocha's mother load makes it into the story as well as many other true life adventures. For the Buffett fan this book is JB's best work and gives a true view into the passion, fears and the big question of Who is Jimmy Buffett. In this book you will find that JB is not a fisherman, pilot or surfer, those are just the things he does. You will see that the author is a passionate dreamer and romantic that makes a living as a musician.The work is a great story as well as an education in philosophy, geography, history and life.The book has 456 pages plus an afterword where Mr. Buffett tells us where the premise for the story came from as well as the fact he lost his parents and very close friends recently.This book is worth the price and you will learn something as well as having the pleasure of a great adventure. If you are a Buffett fan, this book is a must! If you need a vacation to the Caribbean this book is your ticket."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"This book is like one long song by Jimmy . He weaves a tale of Tully Mars, the cowboy who takes his pony to the sea and goes out to find his place in the sun. Quirky characters and escapades throughout the Caribbean and coastal Mexico make this a fun and fast read. Throw in some adventures on a Schooner , the art of Flats Fishing and references to the movie The Man Who Would Be King (1975) and you have a love letter from Buffett to the things he loves and lives. There is nothing heavy or intellectual about this book and that's what makes it so fun. If you love the tales Jimmy weaves in his songs and the freewheeling lifestyle he leads then this book will give you plenty to smile about.I give this book 5 out of 5 lost shakers of salt."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"I just finished Jimmy Buffett's meandering latest work, A Salty Piece of Land. I liked it, but I can see how others might be somewhat bored by it all.The main character, Tully Mars, is on an adventure trying to escape from an unfortunate incident in his past (along with bounty hunters and trumped up charges). For a cowboy, he has a strange affinity for the sea, and soon he and his horse end up on a slow boat to a Caribbean island. He starts off working as a fishing guide for a new retreat there, but soon ends up on board a masted sailing ship commanded by a 100+ year old lady. Her life goal is to restore a certain lighthouse to its former glory, and to do so she needs to track down a rare type of lens for the lighting mechanism. This becomes Tully's goal too, and the two set out to meet people, share experiences, and track down the elusive lens. Along the way, Tully has to watch out for the bounty hunters as well as figure out where his life is really going.The book is 462 pages, and I was being descriptive when I called it meandering. The plot line is extremely loose, and there's not any sense of build-up or pacing. It's one of those stories that could have been told in 200 pages (or less), but then it wouldn't have the flavor that it has. I think you have to be in a laid-back mood to read it, and just enjoy the characters and the twists of life for what they are. If you're looking for a tight, well-crafted story, this isn't it. Conversely, if you're looking to escape into the oceans, islands, and the off-beat characters found there, this could be what you're looking for. There's definitely plenty of Buffett to be found in the book, and I have no doubt that many of the scenes and incidents could be based on things that really happened to him.So, go in with an open mind and the right attitude, and just let things flow. It's probably the best way to enjoy this one..."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"I love this book. I have been waiting for Jimmy Buffet to write another book since \\"Where is Joe Merchant\\" and \\"A Pirate looks at Fifty\\". I do truly enjoy his writing style. Some peole have downgraded this book because it is written different then pretty much every book you were made to read in school, they down graded this book because the author probablly broke some sacred writting rule that authors and Lit teachers are suppose to always obsereve. Well, I didn't much care for the books we were made to read in high school. This book is different. It just flows along leading you into a different adventure each chapter, it is all the same story about the main character you just learn all about all the other characters. All of Buffets books have made me want to just get a boat and float away to see where the current will take me. Buffet's writing just has a way of getting you there for the adventure and you are sad when it is over. Jimmy, if you ever have to stop singing you certanily could write books full time and I would read every one of them."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"Jimmy Buffett has been a wonderful storyteller in his songs. He has also been a great author in his words. His latest opus, A Salty Piece of Land (eight CDs, abridged, Time Warner Audiobooks), is a fantasy with a humorous bend.This quirky audio story is for Buffett's Parrot heads and lovers of the news of the weird. Buffett's text sparkles with only characters that inhabit spring break on the sandy Florida beaches.You always get a certain island feel in any of Buffeet novels, and this one isnt an exception. When you get into the surreal world that is painted in his novels, you feel warm and comfortable-almost like an adultish Disney Movie with a south sea bend. And dont get me started with the way he describes chracters, all I will say is they are so real, you feel you can touch them.John David Souther, an actor and a singer in his own right take Buffett Land and makes it his own with his simple vocal inflections. And Buffett himself gets into the narrative act with his writer's notes and afterward which alone is worth the price of the audio book.its all good man!-Bennet Pomerantz, Audioworld"},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"Jimmy tells us another rambling tale that brings the laidback attitude of the islands as we follow Tully Mars through a chain of unplanned events. We meet a cast of strange characters and generally have a good time in a graceful place. When it all comes together in the end you might even shed a tear.Reviewers that complain about the need for editing are probably right. but this is a book to escape into and shorter would not be better. Relax and enjoy the ride."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"Jimmy Buffett is a true Renaissance man: singer, songwriter, businessman, pilot, world traveller, and probably other things that I haven't mentioned, including best-selling author. I love his music, and I really enjoy his writing! This new book is a pleasant piece of escapism, and something good to read during the gloomy days of winter here in Pennsylvania. When I read it, I feel that I'm on some tropical island cavorting with a mery benad of misfits and unusual folks. Jimmy's tale, like a lot of Thomas Hardy, depends upon coincidences that tend to stretch credibility quite a bit, but my theory is to just go where the author leads you, and hang on for a pleasant ride. The characters are fairly well-drawn, although a few tend to be \\"stick figures\\". The book kept me turning pages late into the night, and the CD packed with it was a very welcome bonus. Parrotheads of the world, rush to get this book!"},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"First of all, I am NOT a parrothead. I like Buffett's music, sure, who doesn't? But I've never seen him in concert or anything. So it can't be that.And I didn't know (from reading these other reviews) that the story is somehow loosely based on things that have happened to the singer/author.I just found the story, wacky, unstructured, goofy, implausibly coincidental as it was, to be somehow delightfully entertaining. A present-day cowboy on the run somehow finds himself as a fishing guide in a Caribbean resort. And THEN the weird stuff starts happening. The story ambles along at its own pace and invites you along on this serendipitous journey to - what? Salvation? Peace? Just call it a happy ending, no apologies and no excuses. You're invited to take it or leave it as you like.I found myself enchanted and read along with delight all the way to the end."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"When I read the lastest escapades of Tully Mars, first introduced in the Tales From Margaritaville story \\"Take Another Road,\\" it quickly swept me in, continuing where he left off. While it helps to have that background, it is quite possible to pick up this book without any other previous knowledge of the characters. For fans of Jimmy Buffett's music and books, A Salty Piece of Land fits in well in any parrothead's library.That said, in some ways, a non-fan with no previous background might have a problem putting 2 and 2 together with some of the character references. In a previous review, the reader said the book meanders... and it's meant to, I think... just as life sometimes meanders. However, Buffett ties up all loose ends by the end of the book, and all ends well in Tully Mars' world. If you already haven't, you might want to read Tales from Margaritaville first.On a personal note, I was a touch disappointed to find that the book was about Tully Mars, and not Frank Bama and Trevor Kane from Where Is Joe Merchant, also written by Buffett. Still, I liked it, and I'm confident many people will also enjoy it."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"I may be a longtime Parrothead, but I have always been able to admit when I think Buffett is coasting or not at the top of his game. That being said....this book is great!!! This is a thoroughly enjoyable read (and my favorite of all of his books).After I finished it (in one sitting on a long holiday flight to Florida)I was reminded all over again why I love Buffett. He is a true original with a great sense of humor, who loves to tell a good tale.In \\"Salty\\", he introduces a slew of interesting characters (and I mean characters!) throughout the book and delightfully weaves their stories together. If you are a Buffett fan, you will smile at periodic song references that he drops in.I loved Cleopatra, Tully and their friends. When the book ended, I still wanted to hear more of their tales. I got a little sick of the postcards from the singer (I forgot his name) towards the end of the book, but that is really a minor (and my only) criticism.If you are expecting Tolstoy, don't bother reading this book. If you want a fun $20 winter escape to the Islands you will never encounter on a Carnival Cruise vacation, this book is for you. Buy it and have a great trip!!!"},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"Reading this was a chore, but I did it just to learn about bad writing. The flashbacks within flashbacks, the contrived characters, the silly plot devices, the absolute failure to provide an ending ...A Salty Piece of Land just goes on and on and on. This really never would have been published without the celebrity name attached and please don't believe the parrotheads who give it five stars. Too many Margaritas! I absolutely love Jimmy Buffett but no more novels!! Please!!!!"},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"I bought this book to take on vacation with me, but I discovered that I can't read at the beach like other people. There is too much people watching and other things to do. I read the book on and off for a few weeks and finally finished it. It is an amazing story that has everything a Buffett fan would expect...boats, planes, fishing, girls, beaches, bars, music... This was instantly one of my favorites."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"I am a huge Buffet fan, but somebody should tell Jimmy to stick to singing! This is a rambling tale that really has no plot no begining and no end. The main purpose seems to be to take the reader on a cruise of the Caribean with little or no purpose. He does try and develop a cast of memerobale characters, but most fall flat with no soul -- which is hard to understand given his musical genuis for creating great characters in his song. There really is nothing here, I finished the book 24 hours ago and I can't even remmeber what it was about. The only reason this book made it to print was because the author's name is Jimmy Buffett."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"Interestingly enough someone sent me a copy of this book last week for Christmas, they assumed since I live in Florida and fish constantly I must love Jimmy Buffett, I don't. However as a fan of John D. MacDonald, Carl Hiassen, Randy wayne White, and Tim Dorsey oh and even Dave Barry I gave it a shot. It made as much sense as a forty year old dressing up in a neon pirate outfit and going to a Buffett concert. Where was any plot development and the refernces to his lyrics were beyond corny and into stupid. Some of his characters might have been interesting had they not been so obviously vehicles for him to interject a snippet of Buffett wisdom previously recorded in song.He needs to stick to playing in front of aging drunks in dayglopineapple headresses and serving frozen Alaskan seafood to clueless tourists and leave writing alone. Also the whole Manatee thing is a waste of resources and is hurting the recreational fishing industry in the state he \\"claims\\" to represent, which is why he fishes in the Bahamas now.Brent Chandler"},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"Unbelievable. I own hard copies of every book Jimmy ever wrote, and to be honest, I loved \\"A Salty Piece of Land\\" enough that I was willing to pay for a second, Kindle version of this book, but its \\"not available in Canada\\"...

WHEN was it ever good business sense to piss off your customer and tell them you are refusing to sell them something?Obviously Jimmy is not the carefree, fun loving guy he pretends to be in his books and musical career!"},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"This book is a melange of contrived characters and ridiculous situations that did not add up to entertaining reading for me.Sorry to \\"dis\\" a fellow Mobilian who is truly talented, but I cain't refrain. I am resentfull over having wasted my time.I doubt if anyone but a celebrity could have found a publisher for this mess.Jack Bryan"},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"Ladies, buy this book for your hubbie or boyfriend before going off on a vacation, but pass on it yourselves. This is very dull stuff. Tully Mars, an affable cowboy, who throws a table through a plate glass window on his lady bosses ranch, hi tails it down south of the border before the police catch up with him. There he encounters a series of supposedly interesting adventures piloting a boat, teaching fly fishing, helping the 102 year old Cleopatra steer a schooner and tend a lighthouse. Every encounter with another person along the way is an excuse for a meandering detour of a tall tale. There is in essence no plot, and no character development I couldn't wait to finish this book. No more Buffet for me."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"Oh man. Where do I start? I bought this book for two bucks at a moving sale. I'd like to get my money back but the homeowner has moved. I've got a team of private investigators trying to find him for me. Two bucks is two bucks. If you're looking for a way to kill some time, stare at your feet, go out and watch the grass grow or find somewhere to watch paint dry. Do anything but read this book. I love Buffet's music. Have for years. Can he write? Yes he can. Can he build a cohesive, believable story? Nuh uh. No way. I'm sorry to say this but I think that a special education ten-year-old on a margarita binge could do a better job of that. Before reading this book you don't just need to suspend your disbelief. You need to have it hacked right out of your brain with a scalpel. Or maybe a chain saw. At one point in the \\"story\\" one of the characters writes a letter. The letter, printed in its entirety, spans more than fifty pages. I don't know about you but I haven't received, or written, a lot of fifty-plus page letters. I have never come so close, so many times, to closing a book permanently before finishing it. A guy in the book sleeps with a girl in the book. Once. She departs. He immediately makes her the beneficiary of his estate and he dies within days. She builds a boat and becomes instantly proficient enough at sailing to sail around the world. Yeah, like that happens every other day. I could give examples like this until the cows came home but there's some fresh paint next door that I'd really like to go and watch dry. Sorry, Mr. Buffet. Love the music, hated the book. My time spent reading the book was wasted away (again in Margarittaville). It was a salty piece of something, all right, but it sure wasn't land."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"A rambling tale that fails to hold one's interest. It's seems highly improbable that our hero is on the run for throwing a piece of furniture through his employer's window.And unfortunately, the \\"adventures\\" that follow evoke little excitement. The characterization is lighter than puff pastry, the humour forced and bland.Stick to the music and pina coladas, Mr Buffet. Your place in the Hall of Fame is already assured!"},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"This is the first of Jimmy's books that I have purchased and tried to read. Either I don't get it or it is just a blah book. It is such a laid-back read that I was able to lay it down and walk away. I encourage you to borrow it before deciding to buy. For me it was a waste of time and money."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"I'm new to Jimmy Buffett. During the summer I just began collecting his music because I thought I could bear the heat more easily that way. Then, I borrowed A Pirate Looks at Fifty, Where's Joe Merchant? and A Salty Piece of Land from the library and read them in that order. I had them all on reserve and they just all showed up on the same day, so I really had little choice in the matter. I figured I'd get to know Jimmy better if I read them in this order.As it stands, A Salty Piece of Land seemed more over the top then the other two. Even Jimmy's life didn't seem this exciting anymore at fifty. I appreciate most of the characters, the abrupt transistions, the vivid descriptions of the locales, and food,fishing,planes and vessels. Since I read this over roughly three weeks, I got a little confused at times and also wondered if every character was absolutely necessary.In some ways all three of the books sort of merged in my head in a way that the music hasn't quite yet. I am starting to wonder roughly how many different melodies Jimmy has put lyrics to. Sometimes, I think maybe three.By the end of the tale, everyone seems to get their just desserts. It's all very New Age and yet classic. What's old is what's new and eternal, Jimmy's telling us. He has the gumbo recipe for the new millenium.He's saying you can save the environment, provide economic opportunity, preserve what's worthy about the past, teach the young, honor the dead, and still make a good buck yourself. And who would know better than Jimmy?"},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"Honestly \\"A Salty Piece of Land\\" is the best read of the year.

Thank You Jimmy.....You did it again!"},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"If this book doesn't make you want to hop a schooner to some southerly latitude, then you don't have a parrothead bone in your body! Jimmy Buffett's latest salt water novel is a tapestry of wonderfully told stories all coming together in the life of our man Tully Mars. Tully's adventures take him all over the Carribean as a fugitive, cowboy, adventurer, shrimp boat crewman, fishing guide, lover, lighthouse tender and unlikely participant in a spring break foam party! What a ride! Fire up the blender!!"},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"I love Jimmy's music and have enjoyed some of his books but I'll probably incur the wrath of the parrot heads for this........Tales from Margaritaville was a light but fun read. I thought A Pirate Looks at 50 was self serving with not much content. When I read about A Salty Piece of Land I was looking forward to reading more about the adventures of Tully Mars. It was just OK. The tales were not nearly as believable, all over the place and off the wall.A quick read barely better than watching network TV. If you're a Buffet fan try to borrow a copy, it's not worth the cover price or for collecting."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"Fans of Jimmy's music will love this one. He's always been more story teller than musician, and this book proves it. Pour yourself something cold to drink and prepare to cool your heels in Margaritaville."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"An entertaining story, but one that does not live up to the promise in Buffett's other books."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"Jimmy Buffett is a fantastic storyteller. That is the best, and the worst, thing about A SALTY PIECE OF LAND.This is the \\"Cowboy in the Jungle\\" expat story that Jimmy has been singing about for years. Tully Mars takes his pony to the Gulf of Mexico, meets various bizarre characters, and has a wacky adventure.Only there is no \\"adventure\\", per se, just a series of pretty funny stories strung together by random coincidence. I mean, I know this is JB, and that he really isn't required to have things like a plot and charactiization in his novel,but he's a good enough writer that he could have taken the time, or a decent enough editor could have made him (which may be the problem -- he's had #1 best-sellers on the fiction and non-fiction sides,so what editor can tell him anything anymore?)."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"The Buffett money machine keeps on printing......A Salty Piece of Land should have remained a short story. Tully Mars was a fun character for a chapter or two yet every occurrence leads to one tangental story or more. The book moves sideways more than it moves forward. If your looking to read this as an escape your better off closing your eyes and listening to his music"},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"True Parrot Heads will appreciate this storyteller's story. Ignore the bad reviews that whine about the plot and style of writing. Those reviewers probably need to stick to Dick-and-Jane type fiction that is full of one dimensional characters that get up to predictable hi-jinks and save the day in 120 pages. There IS a central plot to A Salty Piece of Land, but like any GOOD story, it has many other stories intertwined that need to be told. The character development is unreal - every character has a story and it is told. I think that is why some people consider the book to be \\"rambling\\". It definitely takes off in several different directions in the middle, but every story is interconnected and everything leads right back to the main plot, which is wrapped up perfectly in the end. The characters are a lot of fun and despite the whimsical names (which is a true Jimmy Buffett touch, and really only adds to the book's charm), they are very real and loveable. The best way for me to describe it is for you to picture Jimmy Buffett sitting in a bar with you and telling you a story, and getting sidetracked by telling you all the other stories that are part of the bigger story, but getting back around to the original plot. If you don't appreciate that sort of story, then you won't like this book, and probably don't appreciate people who have the gift of storytelling. The only loss there is YOURS! P.S. See you Houston Parrot Heads at the \\"Fin-Land\\" show tomorrow!"},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"An enjoyable book to read.Still wondering how much Jimmy actually spent writing the book.I'm fan of his music and a semi parrot head, so I might lean more toreading it because Jimmy's name is on it.But as said, enjoyable fun read."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"Meet Tully Mars, a 40-year-old cowboy on the run. An unfortunate incident with a wealthy, elderly employee has forced Tully to become a man on the run from the law. And the reader gets to travel with him as he starts his Carribean adventure, plopping us into the middle of beautiful boats, sandy beaches, lighthouses, and parties. We get to meet such strange-named characters as Willie Singer, Noel Christmas, Captain Kirk, Cleopatra, and his trusty horse, Mr. Twain.The adventure really begins with Cleopatra, a 100-year-old millionaire who wants Tully to find a Fresnel lens for her lighthouse. Once Tully takes on the challenge, we take a spin around the Carribean, trying to find it. And thus we begin to bump into some interesting and bizarre characters (Captain Kirk being my favorite). The adventure winds up as Tully, through the help of his friends, finds the lens, avoids capture by some hillbilly bounty hunters, and watches a dear old friend pass away.******************************************************************************Not being a \\"Parrothead\\", I approached this book simply from an entertainment standpoint, not as a Jimmy Buffett fan. And although I wasn't completely disappointed, there was very little action and many convenient happenings that made the book, at times, frustrating. But that isn't necessarily a horrible thing either. I could see why, however, some readers might not enjoy this style of writing. Whenever Tully got into trouble, there was always something or someone that bailed him easily out of it; very little angst in the story.But what the book DOES have is a very laid-back narrative that, if you're in the right frame of mind, allows you to drift through the story like a sailboat on calm seas. Like I said, it's entertaining enough, you just need to be sitting on a beach with a margarita (\\"Margaritaville\\") in your hand while the waves lap at your sun-soaked feet. If you're looking for an action/adventure novel, you'd best look elsewhere."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"This is not your typical book, having wrote that, I mean it in a good way. The story goes every direction, but somehow it seems right. Delightful, funny and above all Relaxing. I think we all want to be Tully Mars... following our dreams and meeting colorful and interesting people in a tropical paradise. I like the fact that the characters are not cons in this book, nobody is trying to screw people, like in a hollywood movie. He finds gratuity, generosity and friendship. Read this wonderful story and find your lucky conch shell... who knows? Just give it a try, don't listen to those other reviews... it is one of the best books I have read in 10 years!!! My hat is off to Jimmy Buffett."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"I got the book for Christmas, and once I started to read it I couldn't put it down. There's a great cast of characters, including Tully Mars, who all have interesting backgrounds. How they all intertwine, and how they come into, out of and back into Tully's life through out the story, made me keep reading to see what will happen next. I love \\"Where Is Joe Merchant\\", and this book is right up there with it. If you want to get away metally for a while, this is an inexpensive trip to paradise."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"A SALTY PIECE OF LAND reads like a literary version of dueling banjos: cowboys and fishermen vying for the title of the World's Greatest Storyteller. It's a tough call since everyone in this book has a story or two to tell, each one a little wilder than the next. It's about dreamers and survivors, dreamers who survive and survivors who dream. Tully Mars's adventures have a magical feel, from the Island of Lost Boys in Punta Margarita, Mexico, to the tree house bar high atop a giant Banyon tree.The story begins when Thelma Barston buys the ranch Tully has been working on and turns it into a doggie dude ranch. Tully responds by throwing a massage table through the window in a subtle gesture that says \\"up yours\\" and takes off on his horse, Mr. Twain. Soon bounty hunters hired by the evil Thelma, who saw no poetry in Tully's behavior, are pursuing him across the country. When he can ride no further, our hero signs on as a deckhand with Captain Kirk on his aging cargo boat.Cleopatra Highbourne rescues Tully from one of his misadventures. She sets before him a challenge that would put a grin on the face of any landlocked cowboy with a hankering for the sea. Nearing her 102nd birthday, and sensing that time may be running out for her, she wants him to restore an old lighthouse on a \\"salty piece of land\\" in the southern Bahamas known as Cayo Loco. The easy part will be rebuilding the dilapidated 150-year-old structure. The hard part will be finding the special lens needed to shine a beacon across the sea as it shone with the original Fresnel lens, known as a bulls-eye. That light could be seen for twenty miles and the source was a work of art and engineering that has never been duplicated. So begins the adventure to \\"rekindle the soul of light\\" in that one particular harbor.Each person that Tully meets has a story or two or three to tell. There's IxNay, Solomom, Johnny Red Dust, Sammy Raye Coconuts, Tex Sex, and Donna Kay Dunbar. Some of their tales are long, some are short, some are happy; all are fanciful and poignant. The detours will often sidetrack you until you realize that sidetracking is what this book is all about. It has more to do with process than with progress.As expected, this singer of songs, this adventurer extraordinaire, this hippie Peter Pan who we know as Jimmy Buffett, has a way with words. Like his ballads, his books will make you smile, sometimes quite loudly. We are not talking great literature here --- we are talking a little getaway with our favorite Parrothead.--- Reviewed by Maggie Harding"},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"I am a fan of what I call Florida Fiction, fiction which is replete with charming characters who range from the perfectly scientifically pragmatic to the lunatic, semi-deranged or wigged out. The plots are usually convoluted with strange twists and weird, even supernatural, coincidences. There is almost always a high degree of opportunism, since Florida itself is based on opportunism.Florida Fiction does not have to be set in Florida. The settings can vary, as long as there is at least one oddball but tightly-knit community, usually with one or more characters who are habitually drunk or stoned. Christopher Moore set his stories in northen climes. Terry Pratchett writes about Ankh-Morpork, a fantasy city on a fantasy world. Still, the best Florida Fiction is set in Florida or at least off the coast of Florida, and to read the best of the best, pick up any book by Carl Hiaason, Randy Wayne White, or Tim Dorsey, or read Where is Joe Merchant? by Jimmy Buffet.I had hoped that Buffet's A Salty Piece of Land would parallel Joe Merchant in style and development, since its jacket did promise colorful and bizarre adventures, but it fell somewhat short of my expectations. Had I not read Where is Joe Merchant?, I might not have been so disappointed; but in comparison to that earlier work, A Salty Piece of Land is flat, linear, and misses the unexpected and amusing situational complexity which I had hoped for. True, there are some iconoclastic characters, but I personally could not root for them (or perhaps identify with them) as hard as I did for the protagonists and supporting cast in Merchant. They seemed more limited in dimension. Perhaps A Salty Piece of Land might be considered to be a more mature, more reflective work than Merchant, but, to me, at least, it simply was not as much fun. A reasonably good book, mind you, but not up to Buffet's capabilities."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"I have been a Jimmy Buffet music fan for years and now will look forward to anything that he writes as well. I loved this book. Bring your sense of humor along and be ready to escape everyday life when you pick up this book. I feel like I have been on a tropical vacation after following Tully Mars on his adventure. Mr. Buffet's characters are colorful and inviting. His attention to detail on everything from sailing to flyfishing is vivid and informative. Keep writing, Jimmy. You are a born storyteller!"},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"I kept looking at this book in the bookstore, and passing it by, thinking that it was a \\"fluffy\\" piece of fiction written by an aging hippie. There is no fluff to this! It is a great adventure story, that makes me want to quit my job and move to the tropics on a whim. Don't discount this book because the cover was really pretty, or because you think Jimmy Buffet needs a new market; he is in reality a great storyteller."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"Have you ever disliked a song, then years later loved it?Have you ever met someone you didn't like, then eventualyliked them, and maybe even became freinds with them?I feel what these things mean, is that frame of mind is vitalin many things in life. Our frame of mind at a certain timedictates whether we like a song, a food, a color, a person oreven a spiritual connection or desire.This karma or vibe, or whatever one would call a like or dislike based on feelings i.e. state of mind is especialy true in reading.I for one, rarely enjoy reading when I am out on my boat on a sunny day. Why? well, the reasons are obvious. I am focused on the instant pleasures at hand, such as hot sunshine on face and cold beer in hand, and am not in need of stimulation for my mind, i.e. reading. However, on a miserable winter day, as theyalways are in northern Illinois, when I am holed up in my homeand longing for January and Februrary to go back to the hell they came from, I find it very gratifying to kick back with none other than a good book.The first time I attempted to read A SALTY PIECE OF LAND I gave up three quarters through. The book seemed at times to me likea car wreck. It just seemed to ramble on and on and on with little point and purpose, and I put it aside.I decided almost a year later to give it another shot, so in the midst of one of my most depressing mid winter blues state of mind,I made a visit to the local library, checked it out again, and I began reading, and plowed through the book in three sittings, only reluctantly putting it aside to pee or eat or answer the phone. And I plan to purchase this book and add it to my collection of Jimmy's other books, A PIRATE LOOKS AT 50, which I have read three times, and WHERE IS JOE MERCAHNT.I have read the good and bad reviews on here, and can totally understand both sides. Here is how I see it: If you are a quick results type, with little patience, then this book is not for you. Those who complain that it is long and seems to go nowhere, are in a way right, but that is the entire point and philosophy of this work and the man JIMMY BUFFETT. The hidden meaning in this book seems to say, \\"what's the hurry?\\"Jimmy has a way with vivid detail which may take a while to grow on some, but a story like this is harder to tell than some may think. How else does one describe the sights and smells and tastes and romantic feelings that this pirate's tale is laden with?This work contains stories within stories and is also a treasure chest of geographical and historical wealth, and is to be savoured and devoured like a platter of fried conch and a frosty tropical drink. I can understand how people, especially those who know nothing about Buffett, his music, or his art, will just not get this. This book really is written for the parrot head. It's sort of like LORD OF THE RINGS. You can't skip the first two books of the trilogy and read THE RETURN OF THE KING and expect to understand what's going on. One needs to devour and absorb the wonderful music that this brilliant and underated songwriter has blessed us with,(I feel JB is one of the greatest songwriters ever, and I will stand on Bob Dylans coffee table in my sandles and tell him that)and also to read A PIRATE LOOKS AT 50.It is obvious that this work is a bit of a catharsis for the man from Margaritaville. The main character in this spicy novel is JB himself, as he throws us song snippets and bits and pieces from the heros and crooks he has learned much from throughout his adventerous and colorful life. There is a nod to Herman Wouk's DON'T STOP THE CARNIVAL, and I feel this semi-true story from the man who mastered THE WINDS OF WAR is a must read for those who truly wish to understand Jimmy Buffett and his current novel. Jimmy was very much influenced by DON'T STOP THE CARNIVAL, and the influence shows in SALTY PIECE OF LAND.Just as certain jokes are 'inside jokes' this book is an inside book, and in this case the insiders are the parrott heads, and they are the ones who are likely to get it AND enjoy it while the rest are left scratching their heads.If the most you know of JIMMY BUFFETT is COME MONDAY and MARGARITTAVILLE, then chances are you will miss the point of this adventerous and haphazard romp.But if you know the words of I HAVE FOUND ME A HOME or TIN CUP CHALICE by heart, and at times find TRYING TO REASON WITH HURRICANE SEASON stuck in your brain, then you will soak up this juicy tale like an ice cold rum drink on a 100 degree day.--Pete Berwickpeteberwick@yahoo.competeberwick.com"},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"I just finished the audio version.

Alas, it suffers the same fate as his previous book(Pirate Looks at 50), endless rambling that does nothing to advance the plot. Also, like Pirate, I'll not finish this book either.Buffett is a master songwriter, no question. As far as novels, the man definitely needs an editor to focus, streamline, and bring cohesion to a maelstrom of imagery."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"I couldn't put the book down.

Well, the book found its way to me and I've read it and I have to recommend it to you.Jimmy Buffett is a talented performer, and a terrific song writer. Some doubt his talent as a novelist, but after reading a Salty Piece of Land I honestly don't know how they can doubt his storytelling ability. The characters in this book are wonderful and unforgettable. Perhaps the most interesting beside Tully himself is Cleopatra Highbourne. Okay, as a 103 ships captain she does stretch credibility, but why should she? The story line does get thin in places, but doesn't that happen in real life from time to time? I mean, we all have periods in our lives that are thin and un-interesting.You should find this book a worthwhile read. The story is believable, the characters interesting, the story grabbing enough to keep you turning the page. What else do you want?"},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"As far as plots go, this book is as disjointed as a day in the life of... well, Jimmy Buffett. From one adventure to another, the wonderful thing about this book is the large as life characters which pop up on the beach with every wave. They are all incredible people which the author makes us old and dear friends of at the first hello. I try to ignore the fact that even though most of them are stumbling through life enjoying the day to day, they all seem to fall into some situation which allows them to become millionaire beachcombers and fisherman. (Hmmmm, remind you of anyone?)As disjointed as it first appears, the story weaves in upon itself countless times in an incredible series of coincidences that leads the reader to believe that there are only a couple of hundred people on the planet. Since this is Jimmy Buffett's planet we are discribing, the characters are all (mostly all) the type of people who you would be glad to accept as lifelong friends, and Mr. Buffett does a wonderful job of actually allowing them to do that.I received the book as a Christmas present and was extremely disappointed to turn the last page and leave Tully Mars and his adventures behind on the evening of December 26th, but it is that kind of book. It's worth staying up late for and as a fan of his previous works of fiction, I found the book to be well worth waiting for.Mr. Buffett, I hope the writers bug bites again soon."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"The journey that Tully Mars takes from Wyoming to Key West, by way of Belize, the Bahamas and the open sea, is fun, exciting and full of joy.Along the way, there are many side stories - some fun, some exciting, and some a bit crazy. The people he meets (for the most part) are people you wish you could meet.Highly recommended for anyone who likes a fun adventure."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"I have to agree with Mr. Bob Crandle on this one. Jimmy Buffett's A Salty Piece of Land is all over the Carribean and it journeys without focus. Yes, there are some interesting moments here and there most notably describing 102 year old Cleopatra, the wild party with Noelle Christmas and Dawn and Tully's eventual meeting with Sophie and Montana. These detailed character descriptions do work well.However, a good novel has a story with rising action, a plot, and a final conclusion. A Salty Piece of Land is quite lacking in these critical areas. Buffett overloads his audience with never ending subplots and side stories that makes this piece of work uncomprehensible in way too many spots.Never has the saying less is more rang true. Jimmy Buffett writes about so many light hearted tales with some focus in his many musical recordings. Its a shame he could not stick more to that formula in writing this novel. Parrot Heads you need to realize that this book is truly for the birds."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"Being a huge parrothead, I picked this book up at the Key West store on it's day of publication.

Now I like Tully in Jimmy's short story about him but had a hard time caring for him for the entire novel.

If you want to read something by Jimmy I suggest Where Is Joe Merchant and skip this one its for die hard fans only."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"Jimmy's books are filled with humor, tropical tales and salty characters.

This book angered me, it was just crap."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"This is the first JB book I've read, or more like I attempted to read, it's PAINFUL. What drivel, nonsense, and a rambling endless book. I admit that I probably was at a disadvantage not having read the previous book, and had no background info on the lead character Tully Mars, not that it would have made a difference. The plot is so bad and unbelievable that reading the previous book would not have made any difference. Of course, the main plot of Tully being on the run from the law because he threw a massage table through a window in a Poodle-Farm in Wyoming (how does that grab you for believability) and the power of law is chasing him all over the world. The part of him trying to sneak into Belize because he is worried about the outstanding warrant. Last time I checked local non-federal minor offense warrants would not be sent to all immigration officers around the world looking for a cowboy who damaged some property. GIVE ME A BREAK! Then the parade of good-natured characters Tully meets throughout this journey, all of whom go out of their way to educate and grow Tully, not a scoundrel in sight, all are the real deal. He becomes a sailor overnight, and a flats fisherman in a few hours. Not to mention how gets \`lucky' with a college co-ed he meets for the first time. What a life. JB, stick to the songs, and restaurants, leave the writing to the people who know how."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"I was intrigued by the title and the jacket description of this story. The first chapter sucked me in, but by about chapter 10, I was wondering where in the world this story was going. If Mr. \\"B\\" had just stuck to the original premise and discarded about 200 pages in the middle of the book, it would have been a much more enjoyable read. I was bored and a bit disgusted with some of the \\"raunchy\\" parts that had no apparent connection to the actual storyline. Guess he must have slipped off the wagon during those parts and sobered up some where around chapter 36 or so. I would have enjoyed much more the story of Cleopatra and the lighthouse to have been the focal point of the book. Sounds like, from other reviews, that maybe Joe Merchant would be much more interesting and a better value for my money spent. Think I'll just stick to his music!"},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"Jimmy Buffett will never be the Hemingway of the 21st century, but his books are very very entertaining and always good to cut the edge off a cold winter day. However, lately Mr. Buffett -- it seems kind of silly to refer to him that way -- has begun to repeat himself. A Pirates look at 50 was somewhat repetitive but balanced with a degree of introspection that made it worth the time. However, A Salty Piece of Land is too repetitive with the first two stories from Buffett's masterpiece \\"Tales from Margarettaville.\\"Buffett has always appealed to those of us who would rather be warm than cold and young than old. And his other books are welcome and good reads. Given the life that Buffett sings and writes about, it has also been welcome that his works do not dwell on the drug and crime culture that is so often popularized on TV. Unfortunately in the middle of A Salty Piece of Land there are a few chapters that appear to be written more for a more \\"salty\\" publication than other Buffett books. He didn't need the flirtation and the foam party.It gets a three out of five because it repeats earlier books -- if you have not read \\"Tales from M-ville\\" then get that book and get ready to enjoy. It also gets a three out of ten because of the unnecessary dirty parts in the middle -- totally unnecessary to the story line, not the entertainment value of the book."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"I'm an avid reader AND a parrothead, so I had great expectations for A SALTY PIECE OF LAND.Bubba does a good job with the story's set up and he ties it up pretty well at the end, but the middle seemed to wander all over the place.I was much more interested in Cleopatra's story than Tully's. I wish Bubba had built the story around her, with Tully as an ancillary character.With that said, I did enjoy the sailing stories and I have an itch to make it to Belize before it becomes too commercialized.I look forward to more tall tales, but maybe they would be better served in short story form, not held together by anything other than the binding on the book's spine.I also think Cleopatra's life and adventures deserve another look."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"Sorry Jimmy, this Parrothead needs more than disjointed story bites. Characters flying in and out of the story without rhyme or reason didn't do it for me. Tales From margaritaville and Joe Merchant left me wanting more Buffett tales. This one left me wanting less. The CD single was an okay song, sort of a book trailer."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"Firstly, I should qualify this review by saying I'm a diehard Parrothead, so I was almost obligated to read this book. I just finished the book, and I did have a difficult time really getting hooked into the storyline. While I enjoyed a lot of the adventure, there's some slowness to some of the book. The book does give you some ideas into the adventures of Buffett though, and I did find myself in front of my computer last night looking up South Pacific islands that I had never heard of. Even found out some interesting facts about the \\"John Frum Cargo Cult\\" that seems to mirror the Keedos (if you've read the book, you know what I'm talking about, and if you haven't, well - might as well at this point). Lots of good quotes in the book, and a lot less allusions to lyrics than Buffett usually sprinkles his books with. This is not my favorite Buffett book though - I really enjoyed Joe Merchant, and have to say if you are looking for just one of his to read, go with Joe Merchant. PHins up!"},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"I read Jimmy Buffett's other books and thoroughly enjoyed them and was saving this one for a Summer read. Its not up to par with the others. Tully Mars, the main character, is on the run from a former boss who sends bounty hunters and, at one point, a prison plane and helicopter to Belize to bring him to justice... for breaking a plate glass window (come now!) What makes this book so bland is that all the main characters, Tully Mars, Captain Kirk, Buck Noonan, Willey Singer and Cleopatra Highbourne all have the same personality, think the same and even talk the same (Jimmy Buffett with different names?) Furthermore, the people that pop in and out of Tully's life at just the right time to save or guide him would keep a whole platoon of guardian angels busy. There's a long, pointless, distracting 52 page letter from Willey to Tully describing his \\"adventures\\" that has almost nothing to do with the plot and just serves to make a long book even longer. If this book had about 200 pages cut it could have made light Summer reading. As it is, its a long, meandering story that doesn't really go anywhere."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"If you're a \\"die-hard Parrothead\\" and must have everything he does, you'll proably love this book.

There is no real story line and few of the characters are very well developed. It's like a collection of book proposals strung together.You'd be better off to read Joe Merchant again.

Clearly he used a little bit of his entire catalog to weave together the story and all of it's characters, but I was VERY pleased with how much land he covered, how deeply the characters were developed, and how light-hearted and fanciful he was able to keep this story, even with dealing with some of life's low points and some quirky plot turns. All in all, this is probably towards the top of my list for favorite reads ever."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"Full Disclosure: I have been a long-time fan of Buffett's music.When I picked-up my first copy of \\"A Salty Piece of Land\\" - I read it several times over the course of a year or two. It was my piece of sunshine of the mind while patiently working on a project in the rainy and cloud-covered Pacific Northwest. When my luggage and personal belongings were stolen while traveling on a business trip - the thieving bastards took my copy of the book. By the end of that bad day, I had replaced my toothbrush and other essentials - to include a new copy of the book.There are treasures to be found in Buffett's words - for the person whose heart is open to the lessons that Buffett's characters have to teach.There is a Cayo Loco within the harbors of my mind - and I am very grateful to Buffett for showing me the way."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"Jimmy Burffett is always a good read.

I will definitely be reading more from Jimmy Buffett!"},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"How can you not love Jimmy Buffett? This book was a great glimpse into his world and is a great afternoon read."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"I recently stumbled on this book, and not being a Jimmy Buffet fan, I did not even know he also has written books. The book relates the adventures of Tully Mars and his exotic group of friends and how they eventually restore an old lighthouse on a remote bahamian island.The story is very funny, very Caribbean and very romantic.It is one of those books that you are sorry when you reach the end, you became friends with all off the characters inside and you know you will miss them and would like to meet them once again. Living in the Caribbean myself I can relate to the scenery and the colorful characters.I am truly glad i discovered this book and will look for more from Jimmy Buffet. I even listen differently to his music now"},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"This is the best book I have read. God sent it to me at the right time in my life. I found myself highlighting sections. Thank you Jimmy"},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"This book was phenomenal. A relaxing read with page turning excitement. Hits all points of life and you really connect with and feel for the characters."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"The price was right, and everything arrived quickly and in good condition. However, when I saw this book in stores it came with a free CD, this one didn't. If you click to enlarge the image of the cover on the Amazon site, it clearly shows the sticker that indicates the CD, but the one that was shipped arrived without it. So I was a little disapointed in that."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"I'll just start by saying I'm an unabashed parrothead who would buy anything Buffet writes or sings. There was a lot of hype surrounding the release of the book, including a simulcast concert/book kickoff from New Orleans. We saw it in a theater in California and thoroughly enjoyed it. The book started out OK, but began to drag and ramble with the whole foam party thing, lengthy letters from Willie Singer with more detail than needed and making you wish he'd get to the point. There was a the cast of crazies you expect in a Buffett book."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"I received this book as a gift. It is the first book I have read that Jimmy Buffett wrote. I think this book is about dreaming and having fun and not much else, not that there is anything wrong with that, it's just not for me. I like substance and meaning in the books I typically read. If you are looking for a book that is fun and throws in elements of Jimmy's songs and you're not looking for anything else from a book then this is what you are looking for."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"How does a cowboy from Wyoming wind up as a lighthouse keeper on the tropical island of Cayo Loco? When Tully Mars tosses a massage table through ranch boss Thelma Barston's giant plate-glass window, he is forced to embark on the adventure of a lifetime.He loads his two piece art collection, horse named Mr. Twain and lucky conch shell in his pick-up truck and heads south. Trouble with bounty hunters on the Gulf Coast sends him on a shrimp boat of mercy to Punta Margarita where he stumbles into a job as a guide for the Lost Boys fishing resort.A Salty Piece of Land tells Tully's story with humor and reflection. As we travel with him we meet medicine men, Joni Mitchell, Clark Gable, Captain Kirk, the Patron St. of Lightning, treasure hunters, pirates, Solomon, St. Peter and an indefatigable band of misfits who will do anything for a friend.When Tully lands himself in Spring Break trouble in San Pedro involving a couple of young blondes from his past, he is rescued by a unique and immensely lovable 101-year-old heroin. Cleopatra Highbourne assignes him a navigation position on her sailing vessel, the Lucretia, and, eventually, a restoration job in her lighthouse on Cayo Loco.As the keeper of the light he searches the globe for the soul of the light - a Fresnel bulls-eye lense. Along the way he learns that it's the darkness that brings out what is sacred.Jimmy Buffet's book begins as a series of interrelated, but out of sequence, stories from Tully's life and develops into a moving narrative. His description of people and places in the Caribbean shows a competency not found in most books.However, it disappoints with stereotypical characters, stilted dialogue and occasionally excessive profanity. There are several scenes that do not further the plot and a couple of instances of vulgarity. There are some jarring inconsistencies in the narrative when characters switch from one activity to another without any transition. The vast majority of these problems appear about three fourths of the way through the book.In spite of this lackluster midsection, the book manages a strong and emotionally fullfilling ending. It's worth reading if only to remind us that adventures don't come calling like unexpected cousins from out of town. You have to go looking for them."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"I found this book to be a fairy tale for ocean lovers, sunset lovers and boring escapades of the well-to-do.After one hundred pages I had to force myself to continue reading this book. I didn't want to waste the eight bucks. After 183 pages I finally gave it up. Not for me.Another reviewer mentioned Salty is a book for males. Maybe she's right. It sure didn't have any redeeming qualities for me.I would like to share my sorrow for the death of Ed Bradley with Mr. Buffett. There are many of us who loved him.M"},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"Compared to Randy Wayne White, James W Hall, Tom Corcoran, and Les Standiford this book was boring and long. If you are buying this because you are a parrot head like me don't wast your time. The other authors are excellant. FYI parrot heads the new Live Hawaii concert CD really sucked too. Off key, and too much talking. Don't waste your money. Sucess has spolied Jimmy Buffet"},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"Jimmy Buffett is no Bebe Moore Campbell when it comes to developing numerous characters to bring reality to a plot.While Buffett's premise of a lighthouse as a beacon for those who are lost in these bustling times - and how answers may ultimately be found after traveling a full circle - is solid, the lack of focus in the story makes for a choppy read.The travails of the main character - Tully Mars - are developed for 400-plus pages, but it takes only a few paragraphs to bring closure to things that took so many words to develop. A parallel plot told by letters is vastly more interesting, as is the life of a female centenarian sailor, who dominates every scene she shares with Mars.Where Moore Campbell has made it an art form to make her numerous characters real, Buffett stretches his writing to the point where the plot collapses under the weight of trying to do way too much with too many characters.It is a shame because the story could have been a classic, timeless search for meaning to one's life. But the reader unfortunately needs a compass and a good map to figure things out."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"If this manuscript was sent to Little Brown by anyone but Jimmy Buffet it would have generated a form letter rejection slip. It certainly is a work of fiction, or more so, fantasy. The casual coincidences that propel the protagonist, Tully Mars, through this Parrot Head Oz, are way too incredible to satisfy a discerning reader. Come on Buffet, you got it in ya, Joe Merchant was a pretty good start. I read an interview in Rolling Stone where you said you kept serious about your creative and personal discipline because you didn't want to be washed up at 60, singing in a Holiday Inn Lounge. Well brother, this is like being a one time Pulitzer Prize winner, reduced to writing for the National Enquirer. Are you just taking the money and running out to buy new big boy play toys? Get focused. The best part of the book is the intro talking about the passing of George Harrison."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"I loved this book. This book got me back into the joy of reading. I am a true Buffett fan, but anyone should love this book. He really knows how to tell a great story."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"\\"A Salty Piece of Land\\" is a sorry piece of work, easily one of the most boring books I've ever read. As far as I can tell -- I gave up after about 250 pages -- this \\"novel\\" has no plot, no conflict and half-dimensional characters. Jimmy Buffett's a charming raconteur, but this book badly needs narrative drive. I've worn out more Buffett albums than I can count, but I doubt I'll ever buy another of his books. I feel cheated."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"A really fun story. This is my all time favorite book and have read it many times. Ii has triggered a passion for all things Playa del Carmen/western Yucatan, I am even interested in fly fishing,,, scarey. I buy this book for anyone I date, so they will get me easily and we can have thingd to talk about."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"Fell in love with Tully Mars immediately. Such an adventure! Jimmy Buffett is an exceptional author and songwriter/singer. Just thinking of Tully Mars/Jimmy Buffett takes me 'sailing thru the islands' and fills me with peace and harmony."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"The third Buffett book I have read in the last 8 weeks. Very entertaining overall except as withanother Buffett book the author takes off in a tangent with an entirely different story about 80%into the book. This spur away from the story line had some relavence to the overall book but was too long.The book still remained a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"Yes, Fun escapism and a tropical trip. Jimmy Buffett is not going to win too many prizes, but he can entertain scores of people. His writing is like his music - a trip to the tropics on a warm summer day. It has off-beat characters and no one you'd meet in real life. Well, that is unless you live the off-beat life. Either way, you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"Jimmy Buffett, through his expatriate protagonist Tully Mars, paints word pictures worthy of Charles Dickens that vividly evoke the sights, smells, and sounds of exotic locales while a parade of wonderfully exaggerated characters with Dickensian names like Ix-Nay, Cleopatra Highbourne, Sammy Raye Coconuts, and Noel-Christmas come and go throughout the pages in the fashion of a theatrical farce. It's really too bad JB didn't name one of his characters Boz.But not unlike a connoisseur's Margarita, there's some underlying complexity here. You'll learn a little something about Mayan history and culture, fly fishing, flying boats, and lighthouses, among other things, and you might just discover, as I did, some clues worth pursuing to valuable treasures like Carlos Gardel, aka The King of Tango, or the rare and sublime vintage Romanee Trache 1985 or the enthralling film The Man Who Would be King. For us disreputable types, there's a mildly titillating gratuitous sex scene and some occasions involving drug use. And if you pay close attention, there's even a social comment or two and some unexpectedly mature reflection on a meaningful life.I guess you could say this book resembles the Sunday buffet (pun intended) at The Ritz-Carlton Cancun: delightfully varied, deliciously decadent, and enjoyed in a tropical setting. Jimmy Buffett's ability to relate to those with a sultry soul and a joie de vivre has never been better. Bon appetit, mon!"},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"It feels more like a collection of short stories, a few gems among pretty routine stuff.JB's writing is extremely harmless, but I expected more \\"teeth\\" from the guy who wrote all those great tunes.I know this book is written for a nice lazy day at the beach, but it never really goes anywhere: a lot of plot points are recycled from \\"Joe Merchant\\" and Tully was more \\"cool\\" as a short story guy.Easily the weakest of JBs three fiction ventures.Too bad, with Florida such an easy target (I live here now also) he really could have broken new ground.All three of his books feel like they were written a year apart !"},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"I am a Parrothead and have been one for over thirty years. I like almost everything that Jimmy Buffett has ever done. However, this book is not one of them. Has Jimmy Buffett finally become a victim of his own success? I genuinely like Tully Mars and a few of the situations that he gets involved in. I know that many Parrotheads may crucify me for this, but I have to admit that several other reviewers have hit the nail on the head: \\"It is a misfire.\\" \\"Jimmy phoned this one in.\\" \\"If this manuscript were submitted by anyone other than Jimmy Buffett, it would have been rejected.\\" 'A Salty Piece of Land' commits the sin of having a lack of sustained excitement. This book would have been better off as a series of short stories with the character of Tully Mars as the connection between all of them. Many of the characters are shallow and the situations involving Tully seem forced. People and situations seem to have been dumped into the novel simply to allow Jimmy Buffett the novelty of working in as many of his song titles as possible. He is a marvelous musical raconteur, but he is all over the map (literally and figuratively) with this novel and that is diappointing. If you must read this novel to decide for yourself, take it out from the library first."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"A lesser effort. A good story teller here lacks a good story. This one will put you to sleep on the beach."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"I love Jimmy Buffett, and I enjoyed reading this book, but it was rather cheesy and fairly shallow. You come across several lines from his songs while reading and just think, \\"Oh Jeez.\\" Jimmy does take you all over the Banana Republics tho and gives you some insight as to how things operate there. You have to be a parrot head to appreciate this one! I am, and I did."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"Fun book to read. While the book is a fiction novel, I felt like I was traveling with Jimmy. Good, poignant ending."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"This was one of the most pleasurable reads for me, and I read about a book per week, so that's saying a lot. Maybe it's because it combines my own loves of flying, sailing, and adventure. The character is pretty much Jimmy himself in a fictional tale. I'm reading it again (something I seldom do) right now and am enjoying it just as much."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"This book can be read on many levels: as a light humorous piece, as a passion play, as a piece with symbolism, or as a story in search of a philosophy. I like the first best.The core of the story is the renovation of a lighthouse, not an exciting topic. It only becomes exciting through the characters...or maybe the power of coincidence...or maybe the power of goodness.This book has something for everybody, from a doofus to an intellectual college professor. Take it as you like. It's a joy."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"This is a very entertaining book with a full cast of inspired characters. Besides the main protagonist, Tully Mars, who is hiding out in the tropics trying to elude bounty hunters, there is Cleopatra Highbourne, the 101 year old female ships captain and owner of a beautiful schooner, Sammy Raye a flamboyant finacier who is gay, and various other colorful characters including singers, para military rebels, fishing guides, island folk, a star cuban baseball pitcher and many others."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"I loved this book and have been on a quest to find something close to the Lost Boys lodge described in the book.After a lot of Internet searching, I'm just returning from the place that I think inspired Mr. Buffett to write the book.3 hours South of tourist infested Cancun lies a wildlife refuge (state park) called Sian Ka'an. Within this refuge lies a small town called Punta Allen on a peninsula surrounded by some of the most beautiful bonefish infested flats in the world in Ascension Bay.Pesca Maya lodge lies just North of Punta Allen on an unpaved road. Noe and the guides do a great job there. I recommend Darwin or his father who are both veterans.Not sure if this is the origins of the book but I remain convinced it was the state of mind induced by bonefishing in Ascension Bay that inspired it!Great read!"},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"I like Jimmy Buffet's music pretty well, though I'm no Parrothead (but I like him enough to know that his fans are called Parrotheads...). I hoped this book would reflect the attitude and humor in his songs, and for the most part, it did.To sum up briefly: we follow the adventures of one Tully Mars as he flees his former life as a cowboy when the ranch he works on changes hands and is turned into a poodle-breeding facility and spa. He throws a massage table through a window, which kind of seals his fate with his new boss. What follows is a wild journey to the tropics, with Tully just sort of riding along on a current of karma, kindness from strangers, and interconnectedness. He keeps running into people who are connected to other people he has run into before. He seems open to every opportunity offered him (deck hand on the ship he rode to the tropics on, guide on a new fishing-tour resort, lighthouse restorer), and this openness brings him fantastic experiences and not a little bit of trouble.What I liked: the way Tully shows how connected we all are, the almost magical realism of some of the adventures, the wry humor, and the sly references to Buffet song lyrics.What I wasn't so crazy about: some of the sermonizing. It seems every opportunity to get on a soapbox about the evils of European exploration and organized religion was taken. Not that I disagree or anything, but even to a sympathetic soul, it got a little old. Also, some of the situations, while I recognize that they were supposed to be abusrd, just seemed too over-the-top even for a fantasy novel.Still, it was light reading and entertaining enough to finish the whole thing. If you like JB, you should probably like this book. It's ideal for summer reading (especially beach reading)."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"After reading this book I wanted to write Jimmy Buffett a letter about my life, and let him know how much his book meant to me. A great book for anyone who loves to travel, sail, fish, and fly. It also touched on heavier topics such as love, death and how to deal with grief. I loved the metaphors on loss and ways to think and deal with it.Thanks Jimmy, your book meant a lot to me.JT"},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"This was a great read! I have read all Buffett's books and this one is definitely the best. This guy can really spin a wild tale! Don't miss it!"},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"Mr. Buffett has truly mastered the Art of Life and Really Livin' it! And he brings that adventure and fun on the beaches to us \\"Land Locked Mountain Folk\\". Jimmy is constantly amazing me!Ya gotta have a role model somewhere, and he's been mine since '79. Back when I was \\"Just tryin' to reason with hurricane season\\". I guess we all are. Keep up the greatness! Your my inspiration! Thanks!"},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"What an awesome book. If you have ever had a moment or point in time where you were just There, you would understand this book. WOW!"},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"As a long time 'parrothead' (yes, I know they all say that but I first became one in '76)I had seen Jimmy in concert many a time, had every CD, have and read \\"Tales From Margaritaville\\" and \\"A Pirate Looks At 50\\", \\"Where Is Joe Merchant\\" and enjoy what he offers. I wanted the book and was surprised to receive it as a birthday gift from my son and daughter last year. I was excited to get the book, but when I began to read it I was more than pleased.This book is almost like taking a vacation without ever leaving your home, office or wherever it is read. It is well written, combines fact and fiction and takes you on a tale that we all wish we could go on.Talk about enjoyable reading!! I almost didn't want to put the book down and found it so easy to read that chapters flew by. And when I got to the final chapter I didn't want it to end. To say I enjoyed this book is an understatement. There is a little bit in everyone of us that would like to be Tully Mars and go about life the way he did (whether we want to admit it or not). Jimmy has proven to be not only a talented songwriter & musician, but a very good writer as well!Want to get away mentally for a bit to an exotic location? Buy this book and read it! It is well worth every penny of its cost!"},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"Anyone looking to read this that hasn't read 'Tales from Margaritaville' or 'Joe Merchant' should do so first. Of those two probably \\"Tales\\" will give the best prep since it provides the back story on Tully and shows off the good and bad of Jimmy's writing style throughout the short stories included there.Also, anyone picking this up and expecting some deep meaning to be found within, Shakespeare or even John Grisham quality plot twists and character development should probably re-examine why they're considering reading the book :).It's meant to be fun, escapist and simply entertaining. I found it met the mark more times than not in these categories and was a quick read.Some of the plot is admittedly far too coincidental and fantasy, but...see the above re: escapism, fun, entertainment."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"To start off, Jimmy Buffet is only forty five years older than me, but he can still tell a timeless story that escapes age all together. Sure Buffet isn't Hemmingway, but he's also not claiming to be. As going far as giving this book one star and saying its boring is fairly close minded. This book was made to entertain and that is what it does. From beginning to end Buffet's storytelling abilities amazed me. The smile never left my face and the pages seemed to disappear. From the foam parties, tree house confessions, and religions based entirely on a missing pilot this book is one not to be missed by only parrot heads, but everyone."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"Curl up in your favorite chair, lean back, close your eyes, and take a trip to the sunny Caribbean led by singer, songwriter, novelist, and champion of the good life Jimmy Buffet. There isn't a great deal of excitement on this journey, but that matters not a whit as the scenery and the company are what counts.Actor songwriter John David Souther gives a pitch perfect reading of this escape from reality, laconic with an \\"I'll be durned\\" quality that perfectly fits as we meet again Tully Mars last seen in \\"Tales from Margaritaville.\\"Forty something Tully, once a cowpoke, turns to a warmer clime where he becomes a fishing guide. He sails around the islands bumping heads with an assortment of lovable characters, most notably a 103-year-old skipper of a 142-foot schooner. She, yes, I did say \\"she.\\" She's Cleopatra Highbourne who is able to convince Tully of the importance of renovating a Bahamian lighthouse.From ranch hand to king of the hill on his own island paradise. Quite a journey, and it's well worth the trip.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"I will have to disagree with all the nay-sayers who have reviewed this book. I am a die-hard fan and a lover of lighthouses. This book made me laugh, made me cry, and made me sad that it ended. Although some have said it had no plot, those are the people who have to have structure throughout thier entire life. Jimmy's attitude about life is laid back and fun and this book is proof. Please write more books Jimmy, and take me on another trip around the sun !!"},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"Lighten up, folks! The author is Jimmy Buffett, not John Steinbeck!

Nothing ever really happened, and I got the feeling it never would."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"This is a fun book to read in the winter (in cold regions) and dream about warmer climes. After a few chapters, I began looking for the references to songs. Recommend to any Buffett fans."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"I recieved this book as a Christmas gift last year. Since I never picked up a book for entertainment purposes, I never thought I would read it. Well, I now pick up books to read for enjoyment all the time; especially Jimmy Buffett books. A Salty Piece of Land is a tale that will have you never wanting to put the book down. There is adventure, love, and an all around good time in this book. By the time you are done reading it you will want to be Tully Mars (the main character). Buffett has certainly outdone himself this time. This is a must read book; if it can change my reading habits imagine what it can do for you."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"This is one of the most enjoyable books I think I have ever read. I notice some people don't like it because it doesn't follow typical story lines, etc. However, remember this is Jimmy, he writes like he would sing a song or how any \\"non-author\\" would tell a story. Great stories don't have \\"story-lines\\", you get side tracked and go on tangents and thats where it becomes fun. This book allowed me to escape to the places that he writes and sings about and made my day that much better. I never wanted to put the book down and get off the train."},{"Title":"A Salty Piece of Land","review":"I don't know how I missed A Salty Piece of Land when it came out last month but I did. Well, the book found its way to me and I've read it and I have to recommend it to you.Jimmy Buffett is a talented performer, and a terrific song writer. Some doubt his talent as a novelist, but after reading a Salty Piece of Land I honestly don't know how they can doubt his storytelling ability. The characters in this book are wonderful and unforgettable. Perhaps the most interesting beside Tully himself is Cleopatra Highbourne. Okay, as a 103 ships captain she does stretch credibility, but why should she? The story line does get thin in places, but doesn't that happen in real life from time to time? I mean, we all have periods in our lives that are thin and un-interesting.You should find this book a worthwhile read. The story is believable, the characters interesting, the story grabbing enough to keep you turning the page. What else do you want?"},{"Title":"A Last Look at Innocence: Middle School Kids Share Their Views of the World","review":"Important people pass through our lives on a daily basis and all too often they are ignored because they are children. Thankfully, this book reminds the reader that Children often teach us more about ourselves than we may think. We believe we are in their lives to be a mentor to them - but quite often we find a mentor in them as well.This book speaks volumes about the issues our children face as adolescents; the hopes, fears and vulnerabilities they don't always have the courage to share with their friends and family.This wonderful book serves as a reminder to everyone that while we all need to grow up and settle into the adult world - we must never forget the journey we have taken to get there and those who have helped inspire us along the way.Through experience, adults may become wise in the ways of the world - but children are naturally wise in the ways of the heart.___________Side Note: I believe everything happens for a reason and the way I found this book was no accident. I randomly walked into a Barnes and Noble not paying attention when I was approached by a local author doing a book signing. I stayed to chat with him for a while and Donna Perry approached him not long after. They were talking, and had she not mentioned being a junior high teacher I would have never asked her about her book. She mentioned seeing a copy of her book on the shelf at that particular store and sure enough, I found it. I managed to read most of it while walking home, unable to put it down. It's already changed my life and inspired me to keep going with the work I do involving teens. This book was exactly what I needed to read and I'm thankful for being put in the right place at the right time!"},{"Title":"Managing Mergers Acquisitions and Strategic Alliances, Second Edition: Integrating people and cultures","review":"I found this book to be tremendously useful due to its combination of scientific research as well as illustrative case studies. Too many books focus solely on subjective measures of the human side of mergers and acquisitions while ignoring recent studies in the field. This book is the only one that I have seen that truly is helpful for consultants or scientists who want to brush up on current trends on the subject, or develop a foundation for future research and projects. This book is highly recommended for HR personnel, I/O Psychologists, executives or anyone else involved in the merger process."},{"Title":"Managing Mergers Acquisitions and Strategic Alliances, Second Edition: Integrating people and cultures","review":"I have the view of the investor who would like to be better able to analyze announced public acquisitions and their odds of being completed.

Now if any one can suggest any other book regarding mergers in deeper and with more technical information, please email me. Thanks."},{"Title":"The Africans","review":"Journalism is sometimes called &quot;the first draft of history&quot;, and in David Lamb's &quot;The Africans&quot; we see that to be true. This is a very fine introduction to and overview of Sub-Saharan Africa. Lamb mixes first-hand reporting with an effective presentation of Africa's colonial and independence-era past. The entire book is well written, packed with information, and well worth the time it takes to read its 300-some pages. The original edition was published in 1983, before the AIDS crisis and Nelson Mandela's transformation from prisoner to president, and this is one small problem: what is written in the present tense in the book is nearly as historical as what is presented as prior history; its a bit difficult to keep straight when the various notes and epilogue were written. A quick look at a few websites (like the CIA World Factbook) should provide the most recent information. This sort of thing is sure to be a problem with any book that covers recent history. Nevertheless, this book's strengths far outweigh this small weakness. This is an outstanding and very fair look at Africa's cultures, history, politics, societies, and traditions.Lamb's book starts with an overview of African politics circa the early 1980's and a chapter about the difference between traditional and modern Africa. The next chapter covers some of Africa's &quot;big men&quot; bad and good: Mobutu, Bokassa, Moi, Nyerere, et al. Uganda's Idi Amin gets an entire chapter, as does the OAU. In the next chapter, African coups are discussed. Then the end of the colonial era, Portugal's African colonies, and African relations with the U.S. and U.S.S.R. The contrasts between the Ivory Coast (led by President Houphouet-Boigny) and Guinea (led President Sekou Toure) make an interesting chapter. Westerners' African Culture Shock is the next chapter's subject, followed by a chapter about journalism in Africa. Health and sickness is treated next, then some sense about African money and economies. Finally Nigeria and South Africa each get a chapter.Anyone looking for a relatively short and easy to read book about Africa would do well to read David Lamb's &quot;The Africans&quot;."},{"Title":"The Africans","review":"I read this book more than a decade ago and have to agree with the good reviews this book is still getting.I was at the time pleasantly surprised to find a foreign journalist writing such a balanced account on Africa. When I read the book (in the mid Eighties) South Africa was still very isolated from the rest of Africa. This book gave me a window on Africa north of us and fascinated me. I always judge any media (newspaper, books TV, whatever) on their coverage of that with which I am familiar. If I find that to be well balanced and true, I will trust the rest of the material covering things I might not be familiar with. This book passed with flying colours. For example it pointed out the lunacy of Apartheid, while not hiding the fact that it was the only African country with a well functioning infrastructure, civil service etcThe book is neither left nor right. It gives it as it is. Indeed a very rare talent for a journalist. Lamb for example pointed out the world's hypocrisy regarding South Africa. The country was internationally isolated because of statutory racial discrimination and a lack of democracy. Yet the ethnic cleansing going on all over Africa on a grand scale was (and still is) ignored. There was (and still is) virtually no democracy anywhere, massive corruption, very little human rights etc, etc while nobody batted an eye.That is tragically still the case. Africa is in bigger chaos than when David Lamb wrote his book, but still nobody seems to be willing to take a tougher stand and condemn African governments for what they are - useless.He pointed out this *real* racial discrimination. South Africa was not allowed to run an undemocratic outfit because \\"white people can't behave like that!\\" Everybody on the other hand seems to expect the rest of Africa to be in chaos - \\"after all they are only blacks.\\" I found this form of racism very relevant in the way the world interacts with Africa. Very few writers have this insight in where the political correct pseudo liberals lost the plot.This is why this book is a classic and I still remember most of it, though I read it nearly 15 years ago!"},{"Title":"The Africans","review":"I found &quot;The Africans&quot; at a local bookstore - the only book of its kind in the &quot;African/Third World&quot; section. As someone who has visited Africa and talked frequently with those who have I can only say &quot;Amen&quot; to the abominable conditions he describes.Yet, even as he describes the tribal slaughters, the tortures, the theft of entire nations, insane human engineering schemes that moved millions around like chess pieces - he remains not only concerned but profoundly sympathetic. He tries to make us understand how leader after leader chose the pathway of dictatorship and bankrupt economies while preaching freedom and self-determination. The chapter on the OAS is a much-needed humorous interlude. He keeps reminding us that the story of post-colonial Africa is NOT just politicis and raving madmen in control of millions of people. He keeps the story on the people of the continent.The book is dated but the observations are truer now than then. Since then apartheid was abolished but a million people have been slaughtered in Rwanda, 2 million have died in the interminable &quot;Congo&quot; war, hundreds of thousands have been killed in Sudan, Angola and Liberia and whole nations exists in name only. What the author stresses over and over is the potential for greatness on the continent, the mineral wealth, the food potential, the resourcefulness of the people, the determination of ordinary people to thrive in such conditions.Today this is a politically incorrect book in that he casts a wide net of blame - colonial powers, Americans, Soviets, Chinese and, in the end, Africans themselves."},{"Title":"The Africans","review":"A social, cultural and historical view of the issues facing our most diverse continent. This is not a dry history book - Lamb delivers even statistics with relevant stories and profiles of Africans - from the poorest to the most powerful.I read this book in preparation for a safari in Kenya. I had no background on &quot;black Africa&quot; from school - history classes seem to ignore any African country south of Egypt. Lamb's book provided me with insight and understanding of why things are the way the are in Africa - and helped temper my Western way of looking at the world.The book is organized into chapters which are easily read in one sitting. Lamb draws on lessons from history, personal observations (he lived there for four years) and the observences of Africans to weave a story of a continent on the verge of major change. The book emphasizes the beauty of the land while honeslty speaking of the tragedies of the past (and future).My only wish is that The Africans had been updated for the 90's.I am looking forward to reading The Arabs, also by Lamb"},{"Title":"The Africans","review":"I received this book and, flipping through it, thought it looked like a dull, university-text type slog that I would never read. When I actually started in on it, I was hooked. It is very well written with lots of detailed history and insights into the problems facing Africa. How accurate it may be I cannot really judge without reading some competing books. However, in my estimation, this book is sympathetic and sensitive to Africa's problems without pulling any punches. All in all, very readable and incredibly interesting. I wish I could find more books like this one."},{"Title":"The Africans","review":"As a European who first arrived in the continent five months ago I have found this book enthralling. The Africans provides one with a thorough grounding on African mentality, on the continents dark past and in some ways of its bright future. It is a must for anyone endeavouring to understand the present failures and successes of this fascinating and highly complex continent. Ideally this book should be complemented with an update...Africans II maybe Mr Lamb?!"},{"Title":"The Africans","review":"Well written and researched book. One wishes the writer did not use the American values to judge the wrongs and rights as if they are the world's absolute standards."},{"Title":"The Africans","review":"This book is full of information about The African. The writing is superb and the reader is brought into the everyday lives of these people. Africa is a vast wasteland. Maybe things will change, but this book allows one to see why it probably won't."},{"Title":"The Africans","review":"Like many others, I discovered this book while traveling in Africa. I was not very up on Sub-Saharan African history and the book was a huge wake up call. I have heard that this book is illegal to sell in Africa because it focuses on the harsh realities of corruption and all other unfortunate situations that have occured in the continent. I would hope that anyone interested in Africa or anyone at all would read this book."},{"Title":"The Africans","review":"For a 371 page book last published over ten years age about a continent made up of 50+ countries, The Africans is a good book. Because of all of those limitations just listed, it does have its short comings. This book should be taken for what it is - a journalist's account of what Lamb learned by travelling around Africa for four years. This is not an academic account of a complicated continent. What The Africans does provide is a good introduction to the geography and politics of a continent. Because it was written 15 years ago, some of the countries Lamb had high hopes for (Nigeria, Sudan, Zimbabwe) have not turned out as he predicted, and some of the countries that he dispaired (Uganda, Ghana) have turned out to be the shining stars of the 1990's in Africa. Of course, on such a dynamic continent, most predictions are bound to be proven inaccurate.All in all, it is a good read and offers up some good facts as well."},{"Title":"The Africans","review":"I first read 'The Africans' in 1992 and I've been promoting it ever since. Lamb provides social, political and economic insight into why a minerally and agriculturally rich continent struggles to survive. Exposing the crippling effects of tribalism on Africa, Lamb supports his observations with both detailed text, and emotional sensitivity. Lamb has managed to present a serious topic with a sometimes comical undertone which leaves the reader not knowing whether to laugh or cry - but certainly never bored!"},{"Title":"The Africans","review":"David Lamb provides a firsthand unbiased and critical examination of the continent from his own experiences which is both complimentary nad harsh it is critique of this continent. I could not put this book down and was surprised that it was such an easy-flowing read. I had anticipated a more text book style approach and was plesantly surprised."},{"Title":"The Africans","review":"I read a lot of history books and too many of them are extremely dry. This book is what a history book SHOULD be like. It covers the history of many African countries but reads like a novel and avoids the usual slant that other history books have: the blame for all the problems in Africa is shared among several camps, not just the colonialists OR the Africans."},{"Title":"The Africans","review":"Don't be put off by it's age. I spent over a year in Africa in 1993/4, and it was there I first heard of this book - it was worth the wait. A little heavy on the statistics (I've no idea where he got them all from and how accurate they are/were), but otherwise a painfully accurate observation of a complex continent. If you're going there - read it. It should be compulsory reading for all African heads of state and the military leaders who are about to depose them."},{"Title":"The Africans","review":"I picked this book up after finishing \\"The Arabs\\" by the same author. Like the prior book, Lamb gives a nice description of each African country, warts and all. I had read \\"The Scramble for Africa: White Man's Conquest of the Dark Continent from 1876-1912\\" in the past so this was a nice overview of what happened after the Europeans left. For the most part, Africa is a mess but it is nice to know why that is the case and Lamb explains this. The book is getting a little dated (last entry was 1984 and South Africa was still under aparthied) but it works great as a history of that time period."},{"Title":"The Africans","review":"Like most other journalists, in an honest attempt to be objective, David Lamb is still a foreigner with inevitable biases based on experiential differences. This is a fact that influences all such accounts.Written in the 1980's, the Los Angeles Times correspondent visits several African countries interviewing people top and bottom within an obvious hierarchy of power. Using political, economical and psychological vantage points, he writes about Africa's convoluted history, describing the distinctive pasts of several nations and revealing the particular details of each ones personal history and style. Many countries, though beautiful, seem almost fatalistic in their independence from one another. We see how different currencies and border-wars have affected trade and advancement. Though North cannot be compared to South, and neither can East to West, Lamb exposes several unfortunate commonalities that have tied the various nations to similar fates. I can't help but wonder how much of the destitution described is a hard reality and how much a lofty generalization that puts Africa down. More than anything, it made me wonder what can and will be done to change things - what the of wave of the future will be. I have to be optimistic for Kenya and the future of several other amazing countries that have the resources to sustain themselves and end the embarrassing reliance on international bail.There's a lot to take away from his account. Lamb's book takes a good look at tribalism, slavery, colonialism, one-product economies and independence. It also delves a little in to the influence and results of Marxist philosophies and Communist reign in a naturally capitalistic Africa. He says that many have wrongly used Western and Eastern paradigms to understand Africa and that, caught between yesterday, today and tomorrow, and with a people who appear somehow resilient to it all, ultimately \\"Africa can only be explained in terms of Africa.\\" Beauty, people, resources and otherwise, it is its own category, mysterious and unique, full of potential. The book probes us to look further. What's next? How do we move forward?"},{"Title":"The Africans","review":"This book was a sensation when it came out and was banned in several African countries, due to the no-nonsense approach and details of the political and social situations journalist Lamb deals with. Due to its age I can treat this as History, from Lamb's personal perspective.I recall in Kenya, where I was living when the book came out. It was initially on sale in shops, but then the government banned the book, because of the bad reflection of Kenya and neighbouring countries. It was thereafter sold under the counter in certain places to certain clientele.I found this volume in a used book stall in the famous Irene Market in South Africa, and thought it would be good to see just what the furor was all about, 26 years later! Because I never read the book. I recall some comments at the time that his views were biased due to his lack of experience in Africa. But he saw some things naive westerners might not have seen from afar, and what African leaders would like to hide from their western donors.One of the characteristics I have seen in my decades of living in Africa is that African leaders and governments are more concerned about the public attitudes toward them that to the actual uprightness and candor or care with which they actually conduct themselves and the business of their citizens. Sociologist Goren Hyden comments on this and outlines the cultural characteristics, complicated by the inherited colonial governmental machineries, of this syndrome [African Politics in Comparative Perspective (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006. 306p.)].A cultural concept further divides (or distinguishes) the cultures of Africa and other cultural blocks of the world. These gulfs are subtle and complicated, and deal with complex structures of relationships and obligations. This is hard for a western individualistic culture of formalism to grasp. In the west, public monies are clearly separated from personal money and special interest groups and their pressures.Further, there is a strong concern against the \\"abuse of power\\" for personal gain or suppression of one's political enemies. While these canons are broken, the principles remain quite different from the communal concepts dominating the highly-relational cultures of Africa.Lamb evaluates what he sees, admittedly from a base of inexperience and perhaps imposed prejudice of cultural assumptions not appropriate to the African setting. But these comments and perspectives point out problems and limitations to the African societies and their inherited systems from the western colonial powers, about which local leaders also have expressed concern."},{"Title":"The Africans","review":"Lamb writes about as well as anyone I know. No doubt, others write with greater understanding of Africa's complexity. It is, after all, a continent and not one single country, so there is an awful lot of Africa to cover. Quite apart from his knowledge of Africa, which I am no expert on, I like his marvelous style. His prose style is clear, smooth, unpretentious. He gets to the point, but is never dry. This is no text book. This is a classic of popular journalism on the order of Hendrick Smith's \\"The Russians\\", or David Halberstam's \\"The Best and the Brightest\\". I couldn't put the thing down, it was so exciting. It reads like a novel, and a very good one at that. Lamb has an eye for the telling detail, and is not shy to tell it like it is, which is not all that pretty. But in the end, he writes with compassion and understanding. No doubt, the 'insider' might feel that he has missed something, but that is the journalist's inevitable weakness,and his strength. He has no axes to grind. He writes as an outsider and sees things afresh."},{"Title":"The Africans","review":"It's amazing book for learning about contemporary African politics and economics with a nice touch on culture and history. Very well done!!!"},{"Title":"The Africans","review":"A fantastic book, that shows why Africa is a basket case that will only get worse for the foreseeable future. Debunks totally the notion of &quot;Afrocentrism&quot;, hell, the Africans of today cannot even keep the infrastructure of the colonial powers from going back to the bush. I feel sorry for those poor whites still trapped in S. Africa and the rest of Africa. I visited S. Africa in 1985 and I predict that within 10 years all the whites will either be gone or dead."},{"Title":"The Africans","review":"Like many others, I discovered this book while traveling in Africa.

While this is not a deep, scholarly work, it serves as an informative and entertaining primer for anybody intersted in the social, political, and economic condition of modern Africa. Overall, a great read."},{"Title":"The Africans","review":"Sigh, Lamb is a fine example of how you cannot understand Africa if you don't have at least some inkling of its history -- something journalists of his ilk don't often bother to garner. This book represents a shallow observation of African conditions in the mid-80's. Far better introductions to Africa exist. Try Davidson's _Black Man's Burden_ for example."},{"Title":"The Africans","review":"This book is terrible! Very superficial, comparable to Newsweek. I have lived, worked and studied in West Africa for years. There are many more positive, complex yet critical views of Africa out there."},{"Title":"Last Witnesses: Reflections on the Wartime Internment of Japanese Americans","review":"This collection of essays on the Japanese American internment during World War II was published in 2001, with youngest of the internees in their 60s and with many more dead. Not all of the essays contained in this volume are firsthand accounts of the camps. Rather, this collection focuses on the ongoing legacy of the internment in the subsequent generations, and on the ways that people remember traumatic events of the past.The internment, under President Roosevelt's Executive Order 9066, affected more than 110,000 Japanese immigrants, almost all of them legal residents of the United States and many of them US Citizens. Ten War Relocation Centers were established, camps surrounded by barbed wire and patrolled by armed guards. Internees were issued a controversial loyalty questionnaire, that resulted in the further segregating of many of them into a specially designated camp in northern California set aside for \\"disloyal\\" Japanese Americans, which was placed under martial law until the end of the war following protests against the poor living conditions there.A theme through many of the essays is silence. Many third and fourth generation Japanese Americans knew little of their direct connection to the internment experience due to the reluctance of their parents or grandparents to open up about the camps. This in turn could lead to its own lack of resolution and closure for those trying to come to grips with the events of their parents' or grandparents' generation.From sometimes tense and halting conversations came the stories of life in the camps, now passed down to younger generations. The essays cover a variety of perspectives, both firsthand and secondhand, and include accounts of those working in the camps as well as those who were detained. The effort to secure apology and redress and the process of getting camp sites designated with national monument status is also addressed.The book has a decidedly social-science tone to its language, and it is the accounts of actual events that stand out more than the analysis, but it does an excellent job of covering the wide range of social implications of the internment including issues of race relations and civil liberties. Those civil liberties implications take on a new relevance in a post-9/11 society, and it is worthwhile to explore the lengths that our own government has gone to in the midst of a past crisis when thinking about choices that our country may have to face in the future.Beyond the social science implications of the collection, this book contains some fascinating stories of people who survived the internment and of the generations that followed and sought to learn and remember."},{"Title":"The Scorpion's Gate","review":"I kept wanting to know what would happen next, but on the downside of things it was said best by publisher's weekly, \\"Unabridged, it poses the daunting aural task of trying to keep track of dozens of characters; a multiplicity of political agenda; constantly shifting locations, schemes and counterschemes.\\""},{"Title":"The Scorpion's Gate","review":"Richard Clark has written an insightful fiction thriller in 'The Scorpion's Gate' readers with a thirst for international intrigue will enjoy. The book is filled with historical data that allows Clark to create a premise while attempting to educate the reader on future issues that may likely occur in the Middle East, particularly due to China and Indian's increased consumption of oil. There is no question that the vast amount of knowledge of drives 'The Scorpion's Gate' as a fast and enjoyable read. However, the book appears to have been either cut down to remove further descriptive and story development. I wish I had an opportunity of getting to know the characters a little more - which would have made me a bit more connected to the story as a whole."},{"Title":"The Scorpion's Gate","review":"Richard Clarke, former White House counter-terrorism official, has produced an interesting novel. He has taken some of the sobering subtexts of current Middle Eastern politics, moved them a few geopolitical steps into the future, and stirred the mix to provide a chilling view of how we might find ourselves on the brink of world war a few years hence. Historical momentum aside, the course of Clarke's future is determined through individual acts of heroism, and for that his readers can breathe a sigh of relief.The monarchs have been deposed in Saudi Arabia, and it now is an unstable Islamic republic. American presence and influence in the region is limited to a few of the small Gulf states. China has emerged as a major purchaser of oil from the region, and a military ally of the new regime. Iran, with a nuclear arsenal, threatens to play the spoiler with imperial ambitions. American policy is determined by a Defense Secretary who wants to reestablish America's pipeline to Saudi oil by reinstalling the deposed regime. He is willing to go to extreme - and criminal -- lengths to accomplish this objective, supported by a President who thinks he's doing a heckuva job. So much for the bad guys. The heroes of the story are intelligence analysts, on-the-ground spies, military officers upholding the Constitution, journalists, and former terrorists who grasp the true potential of nation-building. The reader has much to think about and reflect upon as the story grinds forward.The mix is part LeCarre, part Tom Clancy, and part Ian Fleming. Unfortunately, the parts don't mesh. More unfortunately, Clarke is not a very good writer. As a consequence this ends up being a not very good book. It is disjointed and uneven in texture, which bespeaks the inexperience of its author and the rush to market of its editors. Much of Clarke's vision may well come true, but if it does the facts will no doubt make for a far more interesting tale than the fiction that presaged it."},{"Title":"The Scorpion's Gate","review":"Clarke mixes his vast knowledge of the region with a fascinating plot that is hard to describe in a few words. The result is a readable, interesting, even captivating book that entertains and enlightens at the same time. He manages to convey the future problems that the muddle east will face, from Chinese opportunism, an out of control civilian SecDef (why does that sound so familiar) and regional, religious and sectarian interests all based on - oil.The idea that warrantless spying would take place on Americans is no longer fantasy - the reality is too close to home. The idea that a group of war-mongering civilians in the US would create the circumstances for unnecessary war in the Muddle East also is no longer fantasy. This book forces you to view the public statements, vs. the private actions, of our own leadership in a different light.On one level, the story being told is thrilling at times. On another level, you begin to wonder why Congress refuses to use its impeachment, subpeona and investigation powers more often. Like all good tales, the happy ending is welcome, although I wonder how realistic that part of his book is."},{"Title":"The Scorpion's Gate","review":"Clarke has spun a great scenario for a story and, with his background, the reader is left with a lot to ponder. As his first work on fiction, it is actaully pretty darn good, but there is still room for him to grow as a writer. My main complaint was that the characters could have been fleshed out a bit and the ending seemed a bit rushed. Definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"The Scorpion's Gate","review":"Clarke, Richard, Scorpion's Gate. 2005This novel is part of a contemporary wave of fiction attempted to be written by real world public figures. Clarke was head of Counter-terrorism under Presidents Clinton and Bush II until he was fired for being pessimistic about the U.S. adventure in Iraq. His novel, cast ten years in the future, posits a post-revolutionary Saudi Arabia fencing with the mullahs of Iran and calling upon China for nuclear assistance. It's really all about oil. The point appears to be that a corrupt Secretary of Defense (Rumsfeld 10 years from now) tries to make the new Arabian state, Ismalya, the scapegoat for all the nefarious activities of this country and the other two. Unfortunately, Clarke is no fiction writer. His prose is laden with Code letters and symbols, unexplained, and his chapters all end with a bang--as though written by a student from a writers' program or a TV show pilot. His characters are Tom Cruise types--tough and one-dimensional. I got lost midway through the thick plotting but plodded through to the end, only to see if the Rumsfeld-type got his comeuppance. It wasn't worth the wait."},{"Title":"The Scorpion's Gate","review":"Politics aside, this is a competent but middle of the road techno-thriller with some interesting insights into the militaristic and technical capabilities of the major players in the region (Iran, Saudi, Bahrain, China, US). By and large, the meetings and combat scenarios have an authentic feel that could only come from an insider - quite informative and even enjoyable despite the all too obvious literary lapses.But this book is more than a simple techno-thriller. On one level, it gives us a possible scenario for the future which asks us to look beyond the current conflict in Iraq to what might really happen. On another level, it asks us to question to motives and methods of the current administration, in particular, the silencing of debate and tragic pursuit of possibly dishonest goals.If you think the particular scenario painted by Clarke is far fetched, well fine, it probably is. Yet I was grateful for this fresh and liberating rethinking of the possible futures we face. Even more, I thrilled to hear a voice that stands apart from the mind numbing patter and self-serving diatribe of the current leadership. It may be poor fiction, but its message is on target. God bless you Mr. Clarke."},{"Title":"The Scorpion's Gate","review":"This is a pure work of fiction. So for those who do not like to think about the possibilities, this book may not do much. But for the rest of us, suffice it to say that I took a day off just to finish the book. It is well written ( could be better, but so could everyting else ), and the technical knowledge of Richard Clarke comes through very well. He is free to let his imagination go places where we probably could never go ( ultra secret rooms ). The plot is very plausible, and the characters seem real. I can not wait to see it on the big screen. I finished the book in three days .. the only other time I could not put a book down was 20 years ago, when I first read the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy !."},{"Title":"The Scorpion's Gate","review":"If anyone has the credentials to write a novel concerning present day terrorism, political chicanery, and war, it is Richard A. Clarke. During the Reagan administration he was Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Intelligence. Clarke's responsibilities increased during the first Bush Administration when he served as Assistant Secretary of State for Politico-Military Affairs, and then as a member of the National Security Council staff. He served as special assistant to President Clinton for some eight years, and from 2001 to 2003 he was chairman of the president's Critical Infrastructure Protection Board.There is more but, obviously this is a man to be heard and as he has said \\"Fiction can often tell the truth better than nonfiction. And there is a lot of truth that needs to be told.\\"Setting his story five years in the future Clarke has woven a compelling, often frightening action drama that takes place over 30 days. Listeners are catapulted into a world gone awry with the terrorist bombing of a luxury hotel in Manama Bahrain. The question is exactly who was responsible and what do they want?There are elements at home and in the Middle East eager for war, not war as we have known but a nuclear war. All are in need of oil and Saudi sheiks have been ousted. We are in peril, and it's questionable whether or not anyone can save us.Film and television actor Robertson Dean provides an exciting yet serious reading of this mesmerizing tale. He's an experienced performer who knows there's no need for added vocal drama in the performance of such a stunning narrative.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"The Scorpion's Gate","review":"I borrowed a copy of the book (sorry Amazon) out of curiosity, fully expecting a tedious, formulaic muddle of a novel from a celebrity author. I was so wrong. This book is a hell of a good read. It's got a plausible, spooky plot, good characters, and convincing dialogue. It beats the hell out of Lewis Libby's creepy historical child porn (also available on Amazon!)"},{"Title":"The Scorpion's Gate","review":"As Richard Clarke did with a recent long essay in the Atlantic about a new hypothetical terrorist attack in America, Clarke uses his first novel to explore possible events that might happen in the world, and what it would mean for the U.S., and other countries.Clarke's focus is on the fall of the Saud family in Saudi Arabia and the struggle among the factions there to start a new stable government. Some want a democracy (but not a US imposed democracy), others want a theocracy based on the Koran.The Saud family's close ties to Washington come into play, as does China's growing desire for oil and their burgeoning navy (see another recent cover article of the Atlantic a few months ago for a frightening view of a possible war with China), and the continued stresses between factions of the US Government; Defense, CIA, State, etc.For those who hate Clarke because he didn't follow the party line after September 11, you might be surprised that he does not dwell on that event and the lack of proper response in its aftermath. It is a rather apolitical book, though not surprising because career intelligence and government workers have to stay apolitical to continue to work with whatever administration is in power. It could easily be imagined that either Republicans or Democrats are in power in Clarke's book - he makes no mention of parties.For Clarke it's the war that is the Iraq has been the crucial event in the Middle East, not really for the better, and his scenario for that country is basically that we left there in 2006; not exactly with all of our \\"goals\\" accomplished. It is a book I think either Republicans or Democrats would enjoy and gain insight from the book. And Clarke's obvious familiarity with internal power struggles and with real-life spying and intelligence gathering is well preseneted.The story can be a little muddled, and Clarke writes without a huge amount of detail, so the book goes by fast. But it's fairly clear by the end who had what to gain, and how they went about trying to do it.It's an interesting scenario that might be a little overly rosy at the end; though there's no guarantee of \\"happily ever after,\\" but there is a lot of hope there for stability and - gasp - a long term view of the future of oil, and what the end of that oil means. And that is something that in the US at least, remains pure fantasy.It saddens me knowing that the amount of money spent on the current war could have funded a new \\"Manhattan Project\\" with the goal of viable alternative sources of energy. It would have sparked all sorts of economic investment, ended our dependence on Middle East dictatorships like Saudi Arabia, and kept thousands of Americans and Iraqis from being blown to bits."},{"Title":"The Scorpion's Gate","review":"Richard Clarke's second book is a study in strengths and weaknesses, more the former than the latter. As Clarke's first foray into fiction, the book merits four stars. Within it's pages are the promise of a future five star novel, and I hope we see a faithfully rendered movie version of this work, as it seems like it could translate very well to the screen.As an expert on his subject matter, Clarke is (not surprisingly) very strong. The book is chock full of tidbits which could only come from an highly placed Washington insider, including some revealing \\"fictions\\" about actual events which are currently misunderstood. The novel takes the reader to places most will never see, such as the White House Situation Room and alleys in Tehran, and describes the sort of backchannels and meetings which are not publically discussed by media or elected officials, but which certainly do exist.Clarke's knowledge of the story's elements is unsurpassed, for example the hierarchy and dynamics between various Middle Eastern factions, and the capabilities of their intelligence operations and foreign policy goals. The book's scenario of the exile of the house of Saud, replaced on the Arabian peninsula by an nascent Islamic government trying to find it's way is far from improbable. The rise of Chinese economic and military power, it's increasing modernization and industrialization leading to higher demand for imported oil is a near certainty. So is the growing influence of Iran in the Middle East, their government's effective deviousness in foreign espionage (leaving their fingerprints off of their offenses while others take the blame), and the possibility of Tehran developing nuclear weapons.While the elements of intrigue in the story are excellent, some of Clarke's technical strengths become literary weaknesses at times. Play by play descriptions of naval and aerial battles can read like Jane's Information summaries, instead of snapping to life as the spine-tingling war stories they can and should be. Occassionally, the battle scenes can become muddled in describing who is doing what. Clarke's probable intent was to convey the fog and deception of warfare, but this instead falls short of it's potential, and some of the battles come off slightly confusing to the reader.The main characters are solid. Though the main protagonists could have used more development, the reader does ultimately care about their fates. The motivations of each of the main actors is straightforward enough, and probably doesn't stray far from real life in terms of the motivations of career intelligence officers, foreign assets, and officials from the various governments. In portraying US officials, Clarke walks a fine line (and on at least one occasion, a not-so-fine line!) between purely fictional characters and cutouts of real people, which is not unexpected -- the cover byline reads: \\"Sometimes you can tell more truth through fiction.\\" The well-informed reader will read between the lines to discover what knowledge Clarke is trying to convey about real events and people. You may even recognize some of the characters, though their names and loyalties are changed (not to protect the guilty -- more likely to protect the author from facing charges on national security violations, or worse!)On balance, the story is excellent, well conceived, fairly well executed and highly plausible. It's an entertaining and eye opening read which will leave the earnest reader wanting Clarke's next effort."},{"Title":"The Scorpion's Gate","review":"In 2010, Supported by the Chinese, a coup has taken out the despotic leaders of Saudi Arabia replacing it with the Republic of Islamyah. The zealots in charge begin to bring their anti-western fundamentalist Islamic fervor to nearby Bahrain by blowing up favorite haunts where the hated infidels reside. The area is quickly falling into chaos with the Chinese pushing for more discontent to further extricate the west out of the region.Secretary of Defense Henry Conrad pushes a military solution to the Middle East crisis as he wants to invade Islamyah so that the United States can regain control of the oil. Others want to take over the entire region by force while some believe we must use diplomacy to mute the growing influence of the Chinese. Though the middle of winter in DC, the heat is on in the capital and not just because the weather is spring-like as both sides escalate the hostilities with nuclear war between the United States and China imminent unless cooler heads prevail.THE SCORPION'S GATE is a fabulous thriller in which anti-terrorist expert Richard A. Clarke extrapolates what the future might hold based on what if consequences of decisions made by the current administration. The story line is frightening as the scenario seems plausible as Mr. Bush's legacy to the world (it will solve the long term solvency of the social security issue). Though Mr. Clarke makes the error of many first time novelists of trying to get everything into the plot, futurologists will appreciate this strong look at what might be forthcoming (who in the 1970s predicted we would still be fighting the war against drugs today?).Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Scorpion's Gate","review":"\\"The Scorpion's Gate\\" is a fast-paced geopolitical thriller set in the near future. PLOT SUMMARY: The Saudi Royal Family has fallen, replaced by the new Republic of Islamyah. Meanwhile, China, the U.S. and Iran are plotting to seize control of the oil resources in eastern Arabia. Can a new World War be averted? Will honesty and patriotism prevail, or will greedy politicians lead us into another pointless conflict?While the preface to this novel says that this is entirely \\"a work of fiction,\\" any astute observer will see that it's a thinly-veiled attack on the policies of Donald Rumsfeld and Paul Wolfowitz, with a few sharp jabs at Bush and Cheney. Clarke is using the vehicle of fiction to expose what he believes is a U.S. foreign policy dominated by unsophisticated warmongers who don't understand the true consequences of their decisions. What they do understand, he posits, is how to manipulate the media and public opinion.Clarke's writing is tepid, and Clarke's character development is shallow at best. What makes this short novel special is his insider knowledge of how the military and intelligence agencies actually work. I particularly enjoyed his insights on new forms of submarine warfare, electronic weapons jamming and spycraft.Whether or not you support the current Iraq War, I think you'll enjoy this little potboiler. In fact, it may actually prompt you to ask some unpleasant questions about our future:1. What will happen to us if the Saudi Royal Family is deposed?2. Do we have a plan to stand up to China in the competition for dwindling global oil resources?3. Who is really calling the shots in our military today?4. What can we believe in the media, and what is just sophisticated mainpulation by powerful people?5. Is there a different way to relate to Islamic governments?Sometimes the questions are more valuable than the answers."},{"Title":"The Scorpion's Gate","review":"Richard Clarke is an important figure in the debate about Iraq and US -- sorry, GWB's -- foreign policy. He seems to be a very decent and brave figure. That makes his thriller of more than casual interest, in that it is so clearly a roman a clef, with the Bad Guy highly Cheneyesque.Is it a good book? Not really, but it's still worth reading for its evocation of dangerously likely scenarios about the future of Saudi and Iran. The problem is that it is too workmanlike in its style and lacks verbal flair. It plods. It remind me of Tom Clancey, though without Clancey's megaword verbiage. The characters don't quite come to life and blur -- they have no individual voice. As so often in such thrillers, the ending is somewhat mechanistically orchestrated.Maybe our times are seeing a reversal of T.S. Eliot's claim that this is the way the world ends, not with a bang but a whimper. He lays out a worrisome and failry plausible it'll all go up in a bang possibility.I'm glad that I read it, though. It is disturbing and convincing and suitably alarming without being melodramatic."},{"Title":"The Scorpion's Gate","review":"This is a work of fiction, I wonder how people rated this book. I think based based upon their political leanings is how they rated the book. I found the book at best slightly interesting. The characters were weak and were not really developed, you could not relate to anyone. The book tried to play itself like an episode of the TV show \\"24\\" but lacking the real action. The book was almost lost as a spy novel or not a terrorist book. Look Clarke worked for both Republican and Democratic presidents, he knows alot and I'm sure the general public has no idea what goes on. So much is tried to be jammed into the last 20 pages, it's like doing cliff notes for WWII history. You can't believe how much he tries to jam into the last 20 pages. It's an OK read. Again depending on your political leanings is how you will like this book. None of my political leanings came into play here."},{"Title":"The Scorpion's Gate","review":"I confess that I starte to read this and put it aside for a long while. The problem was that I had gone through a long string of excellent fiction and first class non-fiction and this was a [...] child.What keeps this book from setting a proper pace is that Clarke has to stop to make his points about National Security. And whether you agree with him or not, his views are importantt. People who refuse to engage with people like him because he \\"turned against\\" Bush are the ones endangering national security.Clarke uses the fiction device to argue a number of points and presidents (not the plural) don't come off unscathed. Rumsfeld said, inappropriately but accurately, that you don't fight a war with the army you want, but the one you have. Had he understood his own axiom, the Iraq disaster would not have been a disaster.In the same way, Clarke makes the point that the White House, new or old president, must deal with the world we have, not the one we'd like to have. After the fact blaming Clinton doesn't fly. Bush and his crew were not children. What they needed to do was make a good, fairly quick assessment of the world as it actually was, not as the right wing ideologues claimed it was. Their obsessive focus blinded them. And no one can blame anyone but this Bush administration for its complete and utter incompetence. The country and our troopss deserved better. Katrina and the rest is just more evidence that Bush puts more faith in spin than anything.Clarke is as this book indicates to some degree one of the \\"wise men\\" that Americans inherit from previous years. I despise Henry Kissinger but he still must be hear. And Brent Scowcraft, another smart, very tough conservative is deservedly respected for his service to his country and the George H.W. Bush. These people do not tailor their views to fit the polls or with the next election in their starry eyes. What they seek to do is what's best for the United States.If you haven't read it, it's worth the time. Just don't expect great fiction."},{"Title":"The Scorpion's Gate","review":"Having studied Middle eastern history it was very obvious to me that Richard Clarke knows precisely what he's talking about when it comes to the mechanisms of power that rule both the west and the Middle East today. His vision of world politics only a few years into the future is plausible and chilling and doesn't seem very far fetched at all. I was sort of fearing that the Arabs would be the bad ones at the end and was pleasantly surprised that story was a little more subtle than that.Even though I thoroughly enjoyed the the thought provoking theories in this book, unfortunately I was equally annoyed by the poor writing and plotline. The characters are weak, the action scenes seem copied from some B-movie and fortunately there is only a hint at the mandatory sex scene.Five stars for the ideas, one for the writing."},{"Title":"The Scorpion's Gate","review":"Fast-forward ten years....what will the Middle East look like? Richard Clarke presents here a possible (likely?) scenario, albeit in fictional form. Upfront I'll admit that this reviewer considers Clarke a true American patriot and, yes, indeed, perhaps also a hero. (History will be the ultimate judge, of course.) But, even if you disagree, you must admit that Richard Clarke certainly has the street cred to write such a book, which, by the way, not only presents plausible scenarios, but also rewards the reader with an engrossing story. The story line is nimbly paced, yet sure in its footing, and it engaged this reader from page one continually until the end. Treat yourself to a gripping read, and maybe get a view of the future, as well."},{"Title":"The Scorpion's Gate","review":"As some reviewers of Scorpion's Gate have said, the story is too obvious - the characters are not deep, and many of the characters fill in roles that are clear from the first chapter of the book. Good guy. Bad guy.Nevertheless, I was surprised to find myself turning the pages and enjoying the book. Some of the conversations between the characters seemed quite plausible, and at times riveting and - actually, funny.The foundations of the plot seem to fall into place too easily - even for a novel. Hopefully Clarke's next novel will tackle another real world scenario, but not be as predictible as Scorpion's Gate."},{"Title":"The Scorpion's Gate","review":"Richard Clarke shows a bit of genius in this future history. Amazingly, he was able to tell the story using all believable characters. This is about the various multilateral powers maneuvering to control the remaining oil.The best part of the story is the realness of the players within the U.S. government. The President and Secretary of Defense are a formidable team and in some ways like the former one. I wonder if that was done deliberately. Together with their political allies, they move the U.S. to war and occupation of Islamia, which used to be called Saudi Arabia.But other important and more minor players on the American and British sides have connected the dots and put themselves at great risk to defeat the U.S. government's goal to start another war. In the background are subplots involving espionage and technical descriptions of weapon systems that actually get used. This is a very dangerous time.There are certain lessons from this highly entertaining and believable tale. One is that we better start finding alternative energy sources right away. Another is that we remain too vulnerable to being dragged into a losing war by a sitting president and his/her allies in government and banking.Clarke has a way of getting us to see the world energy crisis from the perspectives of all the players. This is truly an entertaining way to discover how others throughout the world are likely to react in such a crisis. One thing that bothered me was the total abdication by the media of the role as fourth estate to protect the democracy.I would certainly read/listen to any other books presented by Richard Clarke."},{"Title":"The Scorpion's Gate","review":"What can't be said as speculation is usually good fodder for fiction. No one wants to talk about just how volatile the middle east is or has become, except for Richard Clarke. He recognizes the inevitable changes to come and how they will affect middle eastern relations, the world oil market and will probably result in the fall of the Royal House of Saud. These nightmare scenarios are the outward expressions of a much more important internal battle for the heart of Islam. Will the moderate, rational, educated muslims win over the future of this fast growing religion or will the greedy and often irrational extremists prevail? The world is watching and we all have a stake in the outcome."},{"Title":"The Scorpion's Gate","review":"If you are big into Middle East troubles you will not be able to put this book down.

After reading \\"Against all Enemies\\", I wanted to have more insight into how Clarke sees our present international situation. This book, while fiction, offers a good window into one interpretation of the United States in the world. I agree with others who note that Clarke is not yet a well-developed fiction writer, but I think that limiting a review to the quality of the character development and dialogue is unfair and overly restrictive. The writing is not bad and the quality of the insight is excellent. I did not feel preached to by the politics; rather I thought the presentation of ideas was thoughtful and balanced. If you found \\"Against all Enemies\\" to be up your alley, I believe you would enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Scorpion's Gate","review":"In \\"The Scorpion's Gate,\\" Richard Clarke shows some limitations as a first-time novelist: his writing isn't exactly elegant, his dialogue mostly wooden and his characters are not well drawn. However, this is somewhat mitigated by the genre he tackles in this novel; techno-thrillers are not generally noted for their beautifully poetic language and deeply incise characterizations, after all. What Clarke does show off to great advantage in this book is his insider knowledge of global politics, terrorism risks and espionage tradecraft. Not exactly a must-read -- there are better non-fiction works on global politics, terrorism and espionage -- but this book presents some truly pressing issues in an easily read, if inelegantly written, package."},{"Title":"The Scorpion's Gate","review":"It seems by the other reviews, people either Love or Hate Mr Clarke and or Scorpion's Gate.I'm reviewing the AUDIO EDITION, \\"NOT\\" the book! So any short comings in writing style may have been over come by an excellent reading. Yes, there are both technical and writing errors but hell Clancy isn't the living in the real world either. Character development is weak but it's Mr. Clarke's ideas that are the heart of this book.This is truly a well thought out scenario!Although Clarke seems to show his age by drawing on the Cuban Missile Crisis as a model for his crisis. Most readers will only see comparisons to current events.My only complaint is it seems a little to \\"BEST CASE\\"!It's unrealist in that there is \\"NO REAL COST\\" to the \\"USA\\" or it's Allies for the \\"incompetency\\" of their actions.

Richard Clarke's latest book presents a series of contrived scenarios as the vehicle to convey his frustrations, fears, misgivings and opions about the way government works and does not on a global scale. While the plot lines are reasonably charted, the scenarios they describe are simply not believable. Ludlum and Carre\` need not lose any sleep worrying about Clarke as a competitor.After working in Nixon's White House, participating in Pentagon briefings and war gaming exercises, lobbying in Congress and writing speeches for Senators and Congressmen, I find the scenarios he depicts and dialogue he presents to be both contrived and stilted. None of the people I ever met while in government service conversed in the way he has suggested.The most disappointing thing about Clarke's book is that this golden opportunity to examine what is really likely has been squandered in exchange for a collection of scenarios that sacrifice credibility for hyperbole. While the action sequences are carefully crafted to comport with consumer expectations in the typical Hollywood action-adventure mode, the premises that spawn them are not believable. Had the novel been constructed around a series of more credible events, it would have both informed and entertained us in a far more satisfying way.As it is, all Clarke has accomplished by the writing and publing of this book is to perpetuate the didactic Neo-conservative warning that we should all \\"Be Afraid! Be Very Afraid!\\" It would have been useful to have been supplied with a clear understanding of what it is we are really supposed to be afraid of so we can take reasonable steps to do something meaningful about it.As an action-adventure book, this piece of work provides a kind of mindless entertainment that ought to appeal to those who are content to read such things without the need for critical analysis. I was disappointed that Clarke did not rise to the occasion by sharing what he really knows in a way that really talks. In my way of thinking, that's not just fiction, that's a fundamental failure of nerve."},{"Title":"The Scorpion's Gate","review":"Nobody can challenge Richard Clarke's terrorism and mid-East expertise - however, \\"The Scorpion's Gate\\" does him a disservice.

How bad can writing get? This book should be studied in writing programs to give even the most clubfooted fledgling writer a sense of accomplishment. The dialogue is excruciatingly funny. Howlers appear on nearly every page. Though it all makes you wonder.

I learned about the complex political, economic, and cultural interactions between small Gulf states like Bahrain and UAE as well as Saudi Arabia, Iran, China and the US. Clarke's believes that the true root of the Middle East conflict lie more in Iran's quest for power and US' insatiable desire for oil. Iran is a sophisticated player at the root of Islamic terrorism while the US undermines its long term interests by propping up exploitative dictorships and demonstrating a lack of understanding of the roots of Islam.

His dialogue is a little wooden and contrived, but still it's definitely a good start. I look forward to his future books"},{"Title":"The Scorpion's Gate","review":"Terrorism expert Richard A Clarke has written a very readable, albeit flawed, novel that attempts to, as the book jacket states \\"tell the truth\\" because sometimes it's easier to tell the truth in fiction. His message is loud and clear, including the scores he wanted to settle with this book.Clarke's book begins with the U.S. out of Afghanistan, Iraq and Saudi Arabia. The latter after a coup deposing the al Saud family and turning Saudi Arabia into an Islamic state, named, appropriately enough Islamayah. Because of an American economic embargo, the new government if Islamayah gets in league with the Chinese to provide them with weapons to defend themselves against both the U.S. and other Middle Eastern states. The Chinese want oil at better prices then they're currently paying on the open market. This part of the book is completely plausible and, frighteningly, I think probable at some point in the next 10-15 years. The U.S. finds out about these weapons and a race against time to stop them, and a planned U.S. invasion to put the al Sauds back on the throne, begins. Clarke's book demonstrates admirably the problems this idea would cause the U.S. and why we'd be better served letting the people in the Middle East solve their own problems with their own governments.The problem with Clarke's book isn't the premise, it's the character development, or lack of it. Two of the central characters of the book are a quasi-spook from a fictional U.S. intelligence agency, and a female newspaper reporter from a fictional U.S. newspaper who feeds him information and provides him with leads on individuals to talk to. We're never told exactly why these individuals trust each other though, they just do. This is completely implausible.Also, not surprisingly, I think Clarke pretty obviously is using this book, and fiction, to settle some scores with people in Washington he doesn't like (and I'm sure don't like him) namely former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and his deputy Paul Wolfiwitz. The SECDEF and his deputy in the book are not even veiled characters of Rumsefeld and Wolfiwitz, and Clarke doesn't portray either in a positive light. He basically attempts to make the not so veiled point that Rumsfeld and Wolfiwitz maneuvered to get the U.S. into Iraq and knew that the intelligence didn't show Iraq had WMD. It's not a subtle point I think, and one that, once documents are declassified in 20 years, may or may not back Clarke up on. But, I found it rather pointless that Clarke attempts to use a work of fiction to settle some political scores.The book is very readable even with the flaws in character development and it will make a reader think about events in the Middle East and the U.S. involvement in them, as well as our relationship with the al Sauds and their exportation of the Wahhabi brand of Islam, one that most Muslims reject. This book would be a fun, and somewhat thought provoking read, on a long trip. I got through the over three hundred pages in my copy in a matter of hours."},{"Title":"The Scorpion's Gate","review":"Clarke's novel is a sprawling story, with dozens of major characters and foreign intrigue between Iran, China, Iraq, the former Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, India, and the United States (but, curiously, not Israel). The crosses and double-crosses get hard to follow, and the assorted government representatives who take off in rogue directions make it even harder to follow the white hats.One wishes for a simplification along the lines of Michael Crichton, where good-is-good and bad-is-bad, and the plot resolves to a tidy finish.It is not to be. Clarke is well familiar with the messes made by inept civilian leadership, and his novel reflects the multi-faceted nuanced nature of real-world diplomacy. It is a chess game where the pieces have no rules, and the board is constantly shifting. Some of his speculations -- particularly about the fate of Saudi Arabia after a coup, or the destabilizing ambitions of the Iranian regime -- sound eerily plausible and frighteningly impactful. Let us hope they do not become prophetic.Like the movies Syriana or The Kingdom, this novel represents the forefront of a new era in American approach to the Middle East. Instead of a simple-minded black-and-white Rumsfeld-like approach, he embraces the profound complexities of the region: centuries-old antagonisms, the dwindling resources, a people increasingly marginalized by anachronism and religion, the diminishing opportunities to put in place permanent cultural advances with the remaining unearned wealth. His novel requires more than a modicum of attention, and it will cause the attentive reader to think deeply about the large and serious issues he raises."},{"Title":"The Scorpion's Gate","review":"I seldom, if ever, pick up a work of fiction written by someone who isn't a novelist.

Instead, I got \\"Scorpions at the Gate\\" (I ordered the audio version of Against All Enemies from Amazon -- thanks Amazon). Since I had it, I decided to listen to it anyway, and was pleasantly surprised. It reads (i.e., listens) rather well. Plus, it provides an interesting glimpse (albeit through fiction) of how things work \\"behind the scenes.\\""},{"Title":"The Scorpion's Gate","review":"As Patrick Clawson observed, no one has ever accused Clarke of being lacking in the ego department. He became a key player in both the Clinton and Bush White Houses precisely because he was so hard-charging--a real make-it-happen kind of guy. Since leaving office in 2003, he has hardly been shy about criticizing the Bush administration for not paying enough attention to the counterterrorism issues on which he worked. So when one picks up his novel about horrific setbacks for the United States in the Middle East, the natural assumption is that his barely hidden agenda will be to blast the Bush team for leaving America vulnerable to catastrophic terrorism.Perhaps that was his intention, but in fact when Clarke had to paint how things could go to hell for U.S. interests in the Middle East, he came up with a story in which shadowy Al-Qaeda-like terrorists play a distinctly faint second fiddle to the classic problems of evil states, especially to meddling outside powers. Indeed, at every twist in the plot, the new dangers that loom come from governments, not from networks of individuals. Ideological fanatics abound in The Scorpion's Gate, but they do not pose any great threat to U.S. interests until they have a state behind them. That is an intriguing development from someone who has criticized recent administrations for not understanding that in the new globalized world, with its instant communications and easy travel, loosely associated small groups can pose as deadly a threat as any great power.Clarke's story is a good read for those who enjoy the action genre with colorfully painted characters. He puts to good use his intimate knowledge of life inside the circles of power. Yet even in these details, he displays all the usual attitudes of recent U.S. governments. The Saudis, for all their dislike of America's ways, prove in the end to be strong geopolitical partners with the United States--and this despite the overthrow of the House of Saud by religious radicals. The Iranians are evil conspirators who weave intricate webs to trap America. Of course, the British are clever and brave, coming to America's rescue. Perhaps most surprisingly, the actors are defined by their visions of their respective national interests more than by trans-national ideology.In all, The Scorpion's Gate has more in common with Cold War suspense fiction than with religiously motivated adventure stories such as the rapture series or Muslim anti-Western thrillers. Perhaps his years in the corridors of power have made Clarke realize how much more dangerous are those with a state behind them."},{"Title":"The Scorpion's Gate","review":"Richard Clarke is an immensely intersting individual and I like his writing style.

Equal parts le Carre-quality-spy-novel, international thriller ala Tom Clancy, and prescient and intellectual article on future international scenarios.

Given Clarke's background, it should be no surprise that the story line is creative and gives a rich and real \\"insider's view\\" of the shady world of counterterrorism and the oil oligarchies. Fluid, stylish and engaging writing, deeply intelligent views on possible global futures, and a facinating and fast-paced story... what more is there to ask for?"},{"Title":"The Scorpion's Gate","review":"The premise is interesting, but if you care about a good \\"read\\" this book isn't for you. It is just BAD, BAD, BAD writing. This book got published ONLY because Mr. Clarke is a well-recognized figure and the publishers figured they could make a quick buck. It's just amazing so many basic writing problems and amateurish mistakes got by an editor. No self-respecting literary agent would have taken it on otherwise. There's lots of interesting and authentic \\"insider\\" government lingo, but almost no narrative tension and not a single memorable turn of phrase in the entire book. The characters are cardboard cutouts, and you won't care about any of them. At best, it is written at a sixth-grade level. A few examples: He frequently violates point of view, often switching from one character to another on the same page. The narrative POV often shifts to information a character couldn't see or know. There's also loads of sentences with \\"as\\" connectives (example: He got into the car as it started to rain.). Not that \\"as\\" connectives are bad, but when an author pens three sentences in a row with them . . . sheesh. That's just amateurish. The paragraphs need to be broken up. Some, amazingly enough, even contain dialog from more than one character! And with so many sentences that use a passive verb construction (was, were, is, are), is it any wonder that the prose sparkles like a rotting carcass? Either Mr. Clarke's editor fell asleep because the characters were just boring cardboard cutouts, or this book was never even read by an editor. This is a prime example of a publisher out to make a quick buck on someone's name. It needed a lot more work. Sadly, it didn't get it. This book proves that bad writing can ruin an otherwise great premise."},{"Title":"The Scorpion's Gate","review":"Having laid out his recollections and opinions about our nation's War on Terror in the bestseller, \\"Against All Enemies: Inside America's War on Terror,\\" Dick Clarke followed up by writing the fascinating novel, \\"The Scorpion's Gate.\\" In this work of fiction, Clarke uses the approach of reductio ad absurdum to speculate on the potential logical outcome of our failed policies in Iraq and the rest of the Middle East.The scenario is that it is 2010, and the Royal House of Saud has been toppled in a coup d'etat, and the former Saudi Arabia has been transformed into the fundamentalist, wahhabist Nation of Islamyah - the first foundation stone in building a Shia Caliphate that will eventually encompass the entire Muslim world. The plot of this book seems to be Clarke's worst nightmare of what would happen if the policies of the Neocon ideologues that Clarke railed against in \\"Against All Enemies\\" were to continue un-checked and un-abated. The Middle East becomes a fascinating chess board - with pieces being moved around the board in complex gambits by the Americans, Chinese, British, Iranians, Kuwaitis, Saudis. The action centers on complex plots and attempts to de-stabilize the region by attacking Bahrain and U.S. assets stationed there. Told in the style of Le Carre and Ludlum, the story is one that held my interest throughout the 300 pages. Clarke's deep knowledge of internecine intrigue and power struggles - both petty and global in scale - inform the characters in this novel and set up the tensions that drive the storyline. I often found myself musing: \\"So, this is the way it really works behind the scenes!\\"Former U.S. Senator, Gary Hart, made these comments about Clarke's novel:\\"On his book's jacket, the author says: \`Fiction can often tell the truth better than nonfiction. And there is a lot of truth that needs to be told.' As co-chair of the U.S. Commission on National Security for the 21st Century, I am often asked what caused us to predict terrorist attacks on the United States months before Sept. 11, 2001. More than any other factor, Clarke's chilling briefings of our commission persuaded us. Perhaps he is trying to persuade us of a truth yet again.\\"Clearly, Clarke's purposes in writing this book are both didactic and polemical. As a result, some of the dialogue can be wooden and contrived, and some of the characters seem to be stalking horses to put forward and give voice to Clarke's pet peeves and theories. That having been said, I enjoyed the book very much, and found it to be both instructive and enjoyable. It comes with my strong recommendation.Enjoy!Al Chase"},{"Title":"The Scorpion's Gate","review":"When the public muses about how intelligence is gathered; first as information which is then analyzed, then evaluated, and employed in making decisions; they think it's a simple matrix (if they grant so many steps are involved). Clarke shows how even among the best liaison procedures, the push and pull of influences can pervert the findings. Intelligence cannot be driven by policies. It's purpose is to provide suitable information which can be evaluated and analyzed, and vetted throughout each of the preceding steps, and then used as a guide to decision-makers who are either formulating or executing policy.You can't send out for the measurements of a basketball ball court and accept \\"slam-dunk\\" as an answer.

The settings are so swiftly established, the narrative so compelling, I was eager for each story to become a fullblown novel. Japan is presented through delicate touches, a pointillism of detail, so that what is foreign becomes intimate in a very easy way. As in the best ghost stories, the humans in this book are driven by passions as strong as any ghoul.

Propogation and growing tips (focusing on a natural, organic approach whenever possible) are included for all plants, all of which are specific and helpful. Like whether or not a specific plant grows well in containers; what type of soil and moisture an herb prefers; if the herb flowers beautifully for a week and then gets leggy, ugly and topples over; if it reseeds aggressively; or if it is plagued by one particular pest or another. There are also wonderful histories and descriptions of common uses - whether they be for culinary use, medicinal, fragrancing, or fabric dying - as well as any possible usage warnings. Also included are sections devoted to proper soil preparation - with several soil &quot;recipes&quot; for different plant needs, tips on pruning and starting from seed.

Luckily, however, he did leave us this invaluable diamond-in-the-rough peek into daily life in the Pacific Northwest on the eve of the Euro-American subjugation of this beautiful region.Modern historians have turned their backs upon Winthrop, largely because he refrained from exercising their politically correct terminology and sensitivities. Winthrop's work expresses all the grit and honestly one would expect from an adventure traveler's diary, where a man chose to travel alone amongst the native populations and immerse himself in their culture. Winthrop also had a tremendous vision of the fateful changes that were soon to befall the region, for better or for worse, and he expresses them with a magnificent range of vocabulary and fluidity of composition.Finally, and perhaps most importantly, Winthrop was awed by the incredible natural beauty of the Pacific Northwest. He was, not unlike the better known John Muir, an early convert to the worship of wild wilderness that is the origin of the modern environmental movement. Winthrop's descriptions of the Pacific Northwest volcanoes are without parallel in any other written source. The famous Mountaineers of hiking-book fame would have done better to follow his advice and respect the indigenous names of geographical features. Indeed, the greatest crime of those who ignore Winthrop is certainly the fact that they have buried his ardent pleas to respect those indigenous appellations."},{"Title":"Saddle and Canoe: An Early 19th Century Ride Through the Pacific North-West (Equestrian Travel Classics)","review":"I was reading Tim Egan's \\"A Good Rain\\" and he kept referring to \\"Canoe and Saddle\\" by Theodore Winthrop which was written in 1853.

The two books together give one a great look at the land and people of the northwest and how we have changed the course of nature.

Every corner of the globe bears some stamp of its once-mighty presence, yet only now are we beginning to understand its true impact and legacy. In this book, Christopher Bayly and Tim Harper focus on British rule in southern Asia - India, Burma, Malaya, and Singapore - during the Second World War, showing not just how that conflict accelerated the collapse of their empire in the region but how it set the parameters of the subsequent course it took in history.The authors chart this progress from events immediately prior to the Japanese invasions of 1941-2, depicting a region at the crossroads of change. On the surface, British rule continued in the routines of rule that had existed for decades, with colonists engaged in their intricate social rituals at the top of a racially stratified society. Yet beneath these placid assumptions, a growing nationalism was beginning to erode the sureties of the British presence. Bayly and Harper's coverage of this is one of the many strengths of the book, as they describe the numerous racial groups and the complicated politics of their interactions with impressive breadth and confidence.Japan sought to exploit this nationalist sentiment by posturing as liberators seeking to create an \\"Asia for the Asians.\\" Yet the success of their conquest was due more to British weakness than the success of any Japanese appeal. Stunned by the rapidity of the Japanese advance, British forces collapsed in a matter of weeks, irreparably damaging the imperial prestige upon which much of their rule rested. Racial attitudes only exacerbated tensions, as white colonials often \\"pulled rank\\" in their eagerness to escape the Japanese onslaught. The memory of this would color relations in the region for years after the war.Though the Japanese advanced as far as northern Burma, overstretched supply lines and the annual monsoons brought an end to their offensive in the region. Yet with their forces shattered and their resources strained, initially the British could do little to dislodge them. Here the authors turn their attention to the suffering brought about by war, particularly a devastating famine in India, the result of wartime disruption, a devastating cyclone, and British misgovernment. With tensions high and many leaders of the Indian National Congress in prison, the Japanese tried to take advantage of the situation by sponsoring an Indian independence movement under the leadership of Subhas Chandra Bose. Yet this effort, like those in Burma and Malaya, soon fell victim to the brutality and abuse of Japanese rule, which alienated the native populations and fueled resistance throughout the region.With the failure of their U-Go offensive in the spring of 1944, the end of Japanese rule was increasingly apparent to the peoples of the region. Yet even as the British prepared to reassert imperial rule, their former subjects were positioning themselves for independence. Here the authors illustrate both how much the experience of war had changed the region and how blind the British were to these changes. For all of the insincerity of Japanese motivations, the rhetoric of independence and the creation of local military forces had fanned nationalist hopes and accelerated what ultimately became an irreversible end to the British Empire in Asia.Bayly and Harper have provided an excellent history of the war in southeastern Asia and its role in decolonization. The breadth of their coverage is impressive, particularly in their examination of Asian perspectives towards both British and Japanese rule - something all too often absent in histories of the conflict. Though the narrative often suffers from stilted writing, the insightful analysis the authors offer more than compensates for the lack of polish in the prose. In fact, the abrupt termination of their account with the end of the fighting left me hoping for a follow-up volume that tracks these developments to their eventual conclusion - independence and the creation of a new Asia."},{"Title":"Forgotten Armies: The Fall of British Asia, 1941-1945","review":"This is an excellent book,from the standpoint of the authors doing a comprehensive job of detailing the history of the Japanese occupation of British Southeast Asia in WWII. The authors limit their narrative to the area of the \\"crescent\\" running from northeastern India down south to Singapore. This was a neglected theatre of the war in history, and the interplay of the Japanese conquest, the legacy of British colonialism, and the power plays of the various nationalistic and communist elements in the area are laid out with great detail. However, the emphasis is less on the actual battles and military manuvers of the allied and axis forces, with the greater detail being laid on the effects of the Japanese occupation on the economy, nationalistic attitudes, and political fortunes of the civilian populace. This is definitely a work of history, and it doesn't necessarily read like a novel, unlike some other historical works from the same era. If you are a student of WWII history and want expansion on the Pacific theatre that you weren't aware of before, then you will enjoy this. If you are a more military-minded reader of history and want to read about detailed battles and campaigns, then you will probably want to look at other books instead. Having said all of that, from an academic standpoint this is an important work on a neglected area of WWII history, which explains in great detail why this area of the world is what it is today."},{"Title":"Forgotten Armies: The Fall of British Asia, 1941-1945","review":"Imagine British Asia on the eve of World War Two. Singapore, Burma, India. The Japanest struck swiftly and desicively, capturing Singapore in record time and sinking two of Englands greatest warships. The war as it developed in the jungles of Southeast Asia employed many fascinating characters and peoples. The Japanest claimed they were creating a 'co-prosperity' sphere where Asians would work together towards the common future. However the truth of the matter is more complicated. Despite the Japanese claim that imperialism was 'racist' the Japanese turned out to be as imperialistic and as condescending as Europeans had been, as they stripped countries of natural resources to feed their ambitions.The British employed many Indian troops and other native troops to stem the Japanese tied. Recovering from the loss of Singapore, the defeats of the Dutch in Indonesia and the threat to both India and Australia the English waged an unending guerilla war in Burma, made famous not only by 'Bridge on the river Kwai' but also by the Chindits and Orde Wingates irregulars.This is an excellent panorama, employing whit, history and stories of the characters and cultures bisected by the war. Most of all we are given a snapshot of Asia in a time of change. The war changed everything, it brought ambitions to colonized peoples, and created the circumstances of Vietnam.Seth J. Frantzman"},{"Title":"Forgotten Armies: The Fall of British Asia, 1941-1945","review":"The Japanese rampage in the Pacific and the initial defeat of both the American and British forces in the region heralded the eventual death knell for all Empires involved in the Pacific war. The military political part of this story has been told many times. The cut and thrust of combat is not what this book is intended to do -- it rather covers those peoples and groups, whose absolute numbers were large, but whose history is often not factored into the momentous events in the region at this time.The Overseas Chinese and their suppport for China made them an obvious target for the Japanese, their suffering (massacres) and response -- from quiet resistance to active and robust guerilla efforts in Malaya -- are something often left out of normal narratives on Malaya, which usually end after the fall of Singapore. How did the Malays, indigenous Indians, and Chinese react to the Japanese triumphs? How did events play them off against each other?Ethnic Indians in Burma largely made up the civil service and trade industries before the war, they were mostly driven out by the Burmese who exacted a terrible toll for percieved injustice of this class foisted on them by the British. Their bones lined the escape routes out of Burma -- victims of Burmese pogroms. It is therefore ironic that Indian soldiers captured during the initial onslaught would forswear their alleigence to the King for one to the Emperor -- on the promise for eventual Indian independence. It is this devil's bargain that the authors detail very well: the training, demise, renewal, deployment and utter destruction of the Indian National Army. Ironically again, this Japanese-trained army was defeated by an overwhelmingly Indian denominated and increasing Indian-led army at the end of WWII. Indians gained their freedom not by fighting against the British, but precisely by fighting under and alongside the British. With the might of India unleashed by the British, Indian officers commanding white troops, it became apparent that even in allied triumph, the days of the Raj were limited.Britain destroyed more Japanese landforces than the entire American island-hopping campaign. Indeed these battles were the largest in Asia and the political machinations underlying the movement and supply of great armies are of a degree that it is difficult to understand. Allied cooperation in Europe looks absolutely lovie-dovie compared with the acidic and vain personalities of this theatre: the bigotted but absolutely incorrigible Stillwell, the vain and effete Mountbatten, the absolutely-bonkers Wingate, not to mention the strange warlord like Chinese generals -- laws unto themselves.The Japanese are another forgotten army. Their complete annihilation by military campaign and starvation, relegated them to the political sidelines in almost all countries. For the politicians the Japanese were defeated, what would follow -- every plan or strategem, even from early in the war seemed to be aimed at, as Churchill said \\"holding our own\\" -- ie, maintaining empire. All efforts that did not back that were to be discouraged, and the Americans were to be the either witting or unwitting supporters of such a strategy. This of course ran the British into trouble with both the Americans, who had other ideas, and the local independence movements. In all countries with the winds of war blowing against the Japanese, independence movements initially made alliances with the British based upon shifting needs. As the Japanese dissapeared as a threat full independence was really the only choice, Britain, huffing and puffing -- but it should be admitted, not largely shooting -- was preparing for the historical inevitable.Bayly also admirably describes Empire just before the war. The almost surreal sense of superiority the locals felt, how they sipped their Gin and Collins confident that everything would and should continue even when Europe was falling apart. Both colonial and indegenious race consciousness is described. One of the most tragic forgotten armies, the story of the Eurasians who also made up the civil service of Malaya and Singapore, being accepted by no one but relied upon by everyone. Eurasian women were seen as taboo and strictly off limits to any self-respecting white who wanted to go further and be accepted in polite society. Chinese knew they were superior to Malays and Burmese Indians got it in the neck because Burmese felt they had had it too good in a land that was not theirs.It does seem very strange indeed that our grandfathers and fathers were sometimes raised in this cultural environment that transitioned so swiftly into the post-war world of modern understanding and cultural acceptance of today. It is this consciousness of the age that Bayly reflects so well in his writing."},{"Title":"Forgotten Armies: The Fall of British Asia, 1941-1945","review":"I was hoping for a great deal more from this book, and at times it delivered very nicely, giving you an overview of british Asia, where you meet interesting characters, exotic locales, and bizarre customs.

Duc was protesting the repressive measures of the US-backed Thieu regime.

She is currently incarcerated in one of Burma's notorious political prisons.With international sanctions and the attention of the world's press focused on it, the former British colony and scene of one of the Second World War's most intense battles has once again come to the forefront of world politics.In their excellent history \\"Forgotten Armies: The Fall of British Asia 1941-1945,\\" Christopher Bayly and Tim Harper focus on the shameful British flight from Singapore and the political and human losses in Burma, Malaysia, India, and the rest of British Southeast Asia. Drawing on a wealth of sources including letters, diaries and records from the Japanese as well as British, they paint a discouraging picture of an empire on the brink of extinction.They provide a detailed narrative of the flood of humanity...some say 600,000 strong...that was propelled through Asia by the advancing Japanese (or, in some cases, merely the rumor of the enemy) The Fall of Singapore was the nadir of the British Empire. Racism, elitism, ignorance, incompetence and plain stubbornness contributed to its demise.\`From the moment the first bomb fell on Rangoon on 13 December 1941 there began an exodus from Burma of the Indian, Anglo-Indian and Anglo-Burmese population which was at the time the largest mass migration in history. By the autumn of 1942 in the region of 600,000 people had fled from Burma into India by land and sea. As many as 80,000 may have perished of disease, exhaustion, or malnutrition.\\" (Forgotten Armies: P. 167)\\"Gin-swilling Sahibs\\" decided to destroy the Singapore compound's supply of booze before the enemy could get to it, and drank themselves silly in the process.How often the mistakes of history are repeated when politicians ignore the past.

What he thinks of all figures whose politics he judges reactionary is captured best in this sentence: \\"Perhaps it came out of a subconscious personal spleen\\"; however, one can't help wondering whether the \\"spleen\\" in question isn't really Parrington's.Whether it is Parrington here or Judis on The American Adam theme, a common characteristic of American Studies seems to be a constitutional incapacity for equanimity."},{"Title":"Governing the Hearth: Law and the Family in Nineteenth-Century America","review":"Any attempt to assemble a detailed picture of society must take into consideration the legal structures that function within that culture. A court system works in two ways: judges influence society through its rulings as often as society at large influences the judicial system. Michael Grossberg's \\"Governing the Hearth: Law and the Family in Nineteenth-Century America\\" is a work that combines a comprehensive examination of early American law with aspects of social history in an attempt to arrive at an overarching theme of the development of family law--what would later become \\"domestic relations\\" law--and its influence on the larger society. Grossberg relies heavily on legal sources, including appellate court rulings and legal tracts, to construct a three-stage progression of American family law.According to the book, colonial family law was patriarchal in structure, tied closely to the state, and relegated women and children to the control of men. The American Revolution threw the colonial legal system, already under stress from a variety of factors including but not limited to the ability of settlers to leave for new lands, into chaos. What appeared in its place after a lengthy period of legal transformation involving an amalgamation of English legal principles and an emerging belief in American common law was a form Grossberg calls the republican family. The republican unit displaced the old patriarchal legal system in favor of laws that recognized individuals within the family. Too, this new form believed that state intervention in domestic matters was an evil best avoided. From the middle to the end of the nineteenth century, family laws across the board came under frequent assault from social reformers seeking to increase the role of the state in every aspect of the family. The end result was a hybrid of republican values and state intervention, of judicial discretion and legislative directives.The author examines courtship contracts, nuptials, the fitness of those seeking to marry, contraception and abortion, the legal rights of illegitimate offspring, and custody rights. Repeatedly, Grossberg contends that the courts took the initiative in constructing a body of laws and rulings that supported individual rights within the family. Nowhere is this support more apparent than in laws concerning the rights of women and children. Custody cases tossed out the old concepts of colonial patriarchy, in which fathers held the ultimate power over spouses and children, and replaced it with a new system that allowed mothers to keep their children in cases of family disintegration. As for children, judges began allowing illegitimate offspring to petition for shares of family estates, something that was never allowed under the male oriented English law. Moreover, magistrates considered the emotional and physical well being of children, arguing that the \\"best interests of the child\\" required a reassessment of the father's dominance in family life. In this way and many others, argues Grossberg, judges assumed a patriarchal function in the American family.\\"Governing the Hearth\\" is at its most fascinating describing the issues of birth control during the nineteenth century. The turmoil over this subject today tends to obscure how unimportant the issue was in the early part of the nineteenth century. American jurists subscribed to a belief stretching back into medieval times that claimed an abortion was not a sin or crime until the baby moved inside the womb. Called \\"quickening,\\" this belief stood as accepted law until social reformers began agitating for new rulings against abortions performed at any stage of impregnation. Likewise, contraceptives came under attack from figures such as Andrew Comstock, who convinced Congress to pass laws banning the use of medicines and devices sent through the mail. One reason these chapters intrigue is because they show the relationship between the states and the federal government. During the early to mid nineteenth century, state's rights carried more weight than the powers of the federal government. The issues surrounding abortions are so controversial today that it staggers the imagination to realize there was a time when individual states decided the issue. Grossberg unfortunately never mentions how state versus federal rights played a part in family law.The chapters on birth control laws succeed as well because they constitute one of the few areas in which the author links social history with his legal research. It is in these sections that the reader encounters the people involved in both sides of the issues, the unfortunate souls caught up in the tumult the courts experienced as the social reformers won their battles. Far too often the issues and court cases covered in this book seem like they float beyond the reach of any social, political, or economic realities. In some cases there can be little question as to why the courts dealt with certain issues. Even a cursory knowledge of American history explains why issues arose over the polygamy question in what is present day Utah. The same goes for miscegenation and the incorporation of freed slaves into preexisting marriage laws. But other parts of the book raise questions about what inspired legal changes during a particular time. On several occasions, Grossberg resorts to vague references about Victorian era perceptions regarding female behavior, specifically in the chapter on breach of marriage contracts. This explanation seems overly simplistic.\\"Governing the Hearth\\" ultimately does make a compelling case for its central thesis, namely that the American legal system went through three distinct phases as outlined above. The book also convincingly argues that the fortunes of women and children improved greatly during the nineteenth century, and does so without overestimating their gains. For example, while women could retain custody of their children in the event of family disintegration they still had to fit societal standards of good conduct as defined by a patriarchal mentality. But the fact that women began to emerge as individuals with definite rights was family law's most significant contribution during the nineteenth century, laying the groundwork for greater gains in the next 100 years."},{"Title":"Strange Eating Habits of Sea Creatures (Ocean World Library)","review":"Another great book by Jean Sibbald! This book is informative and flows well from one topic to the next. Like her other books, it is accesible to a wide audience, ranging from school children to adults. Her writing holds your attention from start to finish, and the book is set up in a very clear way, with chapters based on the different eating styles of a wide array of sea creatures (i.e. those who grind their food, scavengers, etc.) The animals she discusses are fascinating, but her writing and the accompanying pictures bring them to life and add a depth of understanding that I have never encountered in any other text of this type. I highly reccomend this book as an educational and fun alternative to many children's books, or even as a gift for an adult looking to learn more about the world of sea creatures."},{"Title":"From Egypt to Mesopotamia: A Study of Predynastic Trade Routes (Studies in Nautical Archaeology)","review":"For being a book in a series called &quot;Studies in Nautical Archaeology,&quot; this book has very little in it about boats or oceans. It reads like a master's thesis presumably because it was and primarily summarizes others' arguments. It presents nothing in the way of new archaeology and most of the arguments are nicely summed up for the average reader in Midant-Reyenes' &quot;Prehistory of Egypt.&quot;Should you want all of the details as to how the conclusions were arrived at along with some fairly illustrative diagrams and sketches, this book might be of some interest. It also has a good survey of the very un-nautical Narmer Palette.Contrary to the dustcover (on which, ahem, someone seems to base her reviews in lieu of actually reading the book), only one shipwreck is discussed and even that is mentioned only in the final chapter, the only part of the book that focuses specifically on seafaring."},{"Title":"From Egypt to Mesopotamia: A Study of Predynastic Trade Routes (Studies in Nautical Archaeology)","review":"In From Egypt to Mesopotamia Samuel Mark tries of to analyze the possible cultural and economic runs that between Vth and the IIIrd millennium a.C. tied predinastic Egypt to the mesopotamian cultures.

The close comparison of the varied cultures (Ubaid, Uruk, Naqada, Badari, Ghassul etc.) furnishes the key of reading to the author to reconstruct the commercial routs through which the relationships were untied between Egypt and Mesopotamia; tracing an exhaustive and fascinating panorama of the Near East.

His poems and stories were gritty and crazy, showing a side of rural life that people oftentimes aren't sober enough to write about. Reese's poems in \\"Wedding Cake and Funeral Ham\\" follow in that same tradition.Reese writes from a sure-footed point of view, taking the reader right into the heart of the scene or conversation without much unnecessary or cluttering set-up. That's the case with the title poem. The first-person narrator finds himself at a bar watching a woman drink a bloody beer. She says, \\"Wedding cake and funeral ham are my two favorite kinds of food . . . . I'm serious. Think about it.\\" He continues, \\"So I thought about it. / And she made all the sense in the world.\\" These bits of cryptic dialog are as inscrutable as epigrams, but also very cool in a Jack Kerouac kind of way. We square readers are given glimpses into a cool but desperate world; we wouldn't want to live there, but it's a nice place to visit.I jotted down some of the words that Reese repeats throughout the book: hardpan, torn, beer, man. His Nebraska is a rough place.Many of Reese's poems are about seeking something more. The farmhands and other toilers work hard, but it's clear to me that their goal is not just financial success. Reese's Westerners play fierce games of Euchre and jockey their tractors from dawn til dusk not just out of boredom or duty but because in a grim kind of way, they like their lives and the tasks set down before them. Reese is almost romantic in the way he shows them reveling in hard work and hard play. To borrow a line from \\"Backstage Pass: Interviewing Mustang Dick, Reese writes, \\"It's not just the money we're after anymore. / Just one more dance on a bright light shine.\\"It's not surprising that Jim has written a set of unconventional love poems to Nebraska. He grew up in Omaha and received his bachelor's in journalism from Wayne State College. After completing a master's in English from UNO, he began a Ph.D. in creative writing at UNL. His poetry and fiction has appeared in many publications, and he serves as \\"imagining editor\\" at Logan House Press.

I agree with the previous reviewer who said that this book's basic theme is pretty hokey - the idea that rock n' roll can inspire worldwide class conflict and revolution, and can save humanity through the power of music. Also, the supernatural elements of the story are poorly defined, there are some issues with plot holes and character relations, and the nuclear war backdrop is pure 1986 paranoia. But with those flaws aside, Bradley Denton created a rollicking story in a fun rock setting with great dialogue, along with (usually) well-crafted characters with complex personalities. I especially liked the Lieza character - the rockstar protagonist who knows she has the power to save the world but is held back both by her painful past and her celebrity persona; and the guy known as Pissant - a washed up professor who barely manages to claw his way up from an alcoholic abyss and make his contribution to rock n' roll salvation. And while the conclusion of the story fizzles out a little after an extensive build up, Lieza and her wild band really do teach the world to respect the rock.

Part cyberpunk, part alternate history and very humourous...I devoured this book. I particularly loved the antics of the cynical, alcoholic physicist who is a pawn for both sides: the Wrackers - the rebellious, anti-establishment types and the Straights - the established followers of order. There is plenty of conflict between the two sides even when the lines become blurred but the book becomes bogged down in it's idealistic view of the power of Rock and Roll."},{"Title":"Wrack and Roll","review":"Brighter than a thousand Butane Lighters - Or more than a nuclear SUN - Is the book \\"Wrack and Roll\\" by Bradley Denton.This is of an Alternate Future, where Patton was NOT ordered to stop at the Rhine, where he continued on into Berlin.

The cast of characters is nothing short of stellar and there are enough accurate historical references in here to delight anyone who prefers a little historical salt in their fiction. The story is set in Siberia and Manchuria during the Russian Civil War and two historical figures feature prominently: Ataman Semenov (whom Pratt seems to have modeled mistakenly on another Ataman, Ataman Kalmykov), and Baron von Ungern-Sternberg, the &quot;Mad Baron.&quot; The latter, amazingly, is depicted true to life. Pratt seemed to do his best work when the setting was Russia or Ethiopia, and along with &quot;Early years&quot; and &quot;The Golden House of Samarkand&quot;, this is one of the finest examples of his work, both in writing and artwork. An excellent place to start reading the Corto Maltese stories."},{"Title":"Corto Maltese in Siberia","review":"All of Pratt's work is wonderful but this has to be his masterpiece, an adroit interplay of history and fantasy, ranging across China and Siberia in the ruin of empires following the first world war. As usual Pratt creates compelling minor characters playing out tragic roles on a vast canvas of historical events. The villainous Cossack ataman Semenov is superb, although in fact Pratt was obviously unaware that the real man was more eastern-European than Oriental in appearance. Pratt as usual uses historical detail brilliantly and fascinates us with the details of history.

It proceeds to the development of electric lighting and tells how \\"Edison developed the central electricity station on the model of the gas-works just as seventy years earlier Winsor had conceived a central gas supply along the lines of the water supply.\\" (64)The second main section, The Street, is initially more about the sociological effects of the increasing illumination of the urban night, and the relation of street lighting to political power. With the advent of electric street lights, the author focuses again on the technological side, for example, the hopes to use arc lighting as an artificial sun to illuminate an entire city from a single lamp.The third main section, Night Life, is a brief look at the \\"lighting of festivity\\" in contrast to the previous section, which concerned the \\"lighting of order\\". (137) Night life \\"derives its own special atmosphere from the light that falls onto the pavements and streets from shops,... cafes and restaurants.... It is advertising light - commercialized festive illumination - in contrast to street light, the lighting of a police order. Commercial light is to police light what bourgeois society is to the state.\\" (142)The next main section, The Drawing Room, tells us this room, also called the parlor or living room, remained unlit by electric light in homes using electric light in other rooms. Gas light was diffused through lamp shades, just as sunlight was diffused through muslin window curtains. Later, when electric light entered the drawing room, lamp shades became darker or multi-colored in the manner, for example, of Tiffany, and window curtains became heavier, more opaque, to more severely filter sunlight, and at night to block the entrance of bright lighting from the street.The final main section, The Stage, tells us there were difficulties getting stage lighting to appear natural. The closer foot light lit brighter than the more distant side lights, giving, as one reviewer wrote, the appearance of light \\"coming straight from Hell.\\" Being lit from below, the actors looked unnatural, their faces \\"grotesque masks\\". Yet it was only within the light of the foot lights that subtle facial expressions could be discerned. Only within this band of light at the front of the stage were the actors most clearly seen. The introduction of electric light removed these difficulties, but this new brighter lighting washed away the illusions previously created by scenery designed to work under dimmer and less pervasive illumination. Color, too, was perceived differently under electric light."},{"Title":"Disenchanted Night: The Industrialization of Light in the Nineteenth Century","review":"An amazing book, \\"Disenchanted Night\\" begins with the physical constraints, the actual production of light and then takes it through the nature of public order, the idea of shpping and the creation of mass nightlife and off into the theater. Once one has read this book, the nineteenth century will never seem the same and the world before, lit only by fire, is revealed much more strongly.What is absolutely fascinating in which ideas of public order, commerce, art and even interior decorating are shown to be as much technical artifacts as ideological categories. In a way the sections on Street Lighting and Shops are almost a technological addendum to Bakhtin.In short: Read this book."},{"Title":"Disenchanted Night: The Industrialization of Light in the Nineteenth Century","review":"This book is quite different from your normal lamp collecting book. It goes deep into the psyche of the people who used or for that matter didn't use artificial light.

I got it from the libaray immediately after seeing the film with the wonderful Peter Ustinov (saidly not available on tape or CD). I enjoyed the book immensely and, over the years, searched for a copy of my own. I was never lucky enough to find one, that is, until now. The book is still funny and fun.

There are stories about the Beach Boys, Muddy Waters, The Doors, Frank Sinatra, Chubby Checker, lots of others. It's an amazing mix of music and eras, to use a term engineers might appreciate. Hearing the music while you read is a fresh way to hear the tunes. For me, knowing how some of my all-time favorite records were made, and finding out how the artists and engineers really worked behind-the-scenes is truly cool...Maybe that's why this book is called Temples of Sound.This book covers a lot of ground, a lot of sound, from the days of swing and early pop, Nat King Cole, Aretha, and Motown. The guys who wrote it-Jim Kogan and Bob Clark-talked to primary sources, the people who were really there, and got some great first hand stories. It covers lots of great studios, from Capitol to Stax. It is about and for people who love music. It is cool to hear Keith Richards say is appalled to see Muddy Waters working outside of music, painting a ceiling in the studio. This is a man he revered. It is cool to hear the engineer who did the best Doors records say he wouldn't want to remix their albums. They are what they are.

Cogan and Clark have revived the days of soul making music from music making souls, and their agents, and cohorts in this faithful rendering of what truly makes music continue to move us today."},{"Title":"Temples of Sound: Inside the Great Recording Studios","review":"The book's stated theme, \\"inside the great recording studios,\\" is a tantalizing one. Unfortunately the authors rarely deliver the reader inside the temples themselves. Instead, they spend an inordinate amount of text rehashing introductory material about artists, songs, labels, musical genres and scenes. It's not necessarily uninteresting, but it leaves readers in the lobby, rather than actually taking them into the studio.Worse, the writing is hugely uneven. The chapter on Atlantic is just that, a chapter on the Atlantic label, with tidbits about the studios they used. The chapter on Columbia, on the other hand, does a nice job of communicating the label's producers' emotional attachment to their studios. The text itself ranges from well-written to hyperbolic (\\"It is indisputable: there is no one label that had as much impact on the development of rock from the 1950s to the 1970s as Chess.\\") and overly clever (\\"Everyone wanted in, and the [Chess] brothers, refashioned as record men, kept adding more pawns to the Chess set.\\").What this book does accomplish is a grounding of hit songs at their physical points of creation. It untangles the juxtaposition of Top-40 radio and strips away the music industry's placelessness by re-contextualizing songs with the writers, producers, engineers and musicians who created them. Who knew that Eric Clapton's \\"Layla\\" was recorded in Florida, within the same studios that reverberated with Hank Ballard's \\"The Twist,\\" The Eagles' \\"Hotel California,\\" and The Bee Gees \\"How Deep is Your Love?\\"The book's photos provide intimate views of studios in use (not to mention, under construction), it's a shame that the accompanying text isn't as fully detailed on the technical and artistic inner-workings of these \\"temples of sound.\\""},{"Title":"Temples of Sound: Inside the Great Recording Studios","review":"Ths book was a real pleasure to read. I'm not a musician or recording engineer....I'm just a finance geek who likes good music. Nevertheless, this book was written in such an understandable way that even us non-musical types can follow along with the recording processes. I knew about the book from a friend. As I started to read it I expected that I would enjoy learning about how music was made in various recording studios around the country. What I did not expect (and was very pleased to experience) were the concise and very diverse stories of the people. Stories of the owners, artists and engineers that made the recording studio and the corresponding musical output a reality coming out of the radio or CD player. As I read each studio chapter and looked at the corresponding pictures (FABULOUS!) images were painted of some of the dynamic processes, individuals and cultural influences that culminated in songs that became the soundtrack to our American lives. This book truly captured the sweat, soul and drive that went into producing our American soundtrack. A pleasure from the first page to the last. A must read for anyone who plays music, who is in the music industry or who (like many of my fellow corporate souls) simply enjoys good music. From the Stones to Dean Martin to Patsy Cline...it all comes alive. Buy the book."},{"Title":"Temples of Sound: Inside the Great Recording Studios","review":"While I have enjoyed reading the book, I would nothave purcased it had I known how little it actuallycontains about the rooms. As someone interested inaudio engineering, I was hoping it would have a lot ofinformation about the rooms themselves, with dimensions,acoutic treatments, unusual equipment used, etc. Instead,the book tells the story of the studio mostly aroundwhich artists recorded there. I don't really need tosee a list of who recorded for Sun Records, I want toknow what Sam Phillips did to make the room sound the wayit did. I want details of the famous Capitol echo chambers.This book does not provide the sort of informationthe title implies."},{"Title":"Temples of Sound: Inside the Great Recording Studios","review":"I just can't muster the enthusiasm of other reviewers for this book. Perhaps most interesting and informative are the stories of how some of the best recordings of the golden days of analog were made on a shoe string, over garages on third hand equipment. There are some insights into what made some of the studios sound unique.The early chapters dwell lovingly on some details of the lives of the produces, engineers and some of the artists. But by the end the facts are marshaled and rushed past, leaving the reader with the distinct impression that they were included so as not to offend some egos or just to drop some names. In some cases the fact that the producers were flat out ignorant of music, rather unlikable individuals and driven by the Wall-Street motives of fear and greed are all too clear, but left between the lines.All in all the book it left me with more questions than answers about the recording process. A decent compendium of facts about who did what when and where with a smattering of favorite artists and a few pictures to keep pop audiences happy. The authors are weakest when the crass business of the music industry intrudes into their picture of the studio as a crucible of pop art. I'd rather have more detail (even if it hurts) about a few studios or a focus on just a few top engineers and specific recording sessions."},{"Title":"Temples of Sound: Inside the Great Recording Studios","review":"We'd like to sound off on \\"Temples of Sound.\\" And that's a good thing, for this \\"Temple\\" is as much a travelogue as a holy tome that trips through tuneful timelines. Authors JimCogan and William Clark remind us that the recording studios were as responsible for hit records (and, we assume, the flops) as the singers themselves. Here, they take us on afascinating tour of those hallowed halls, telling the stories behind the classic songs and albums. Each of the 15 chapters profiles a different studio, as well as the musicians,producers and engineers who worked there. Stax, Sun, Motown, Sun, Chess, Atlantic ... they are all here, along with the tales. Brian Wilson earning a reputation likening him toMozart for the meticulous attention he paid to the groundbreaking arrangements for The Beach Boys' \\"Pet Sounds\\" ... guitarist Steve Cropper using a Zippo lighter as a metal slideon \\"Soul Man\\" ... a bike chain whipped against a board giving \\"Dancing in the Streets\\" a pinch of percussive punch ... Ray Charles, learning that his beloved Mama has died, pourshis grief into \\"Sinner's Prayer.\\" Everyone is here --- from Aretha (was she ever really that thin?) to Nat, from Little Richard to big Otis, from Muddy to Marvin. Perhaps even morealluring than the informative text are the photographs --- mostly never-before-seen peeks into the sanctums of sound. Tune in!"},{"Title":"Temples of Sound: Inside the Great Recording Studios","review":"\\"Temples of Sound\\" is an interesting and inspiring look at some popular American recording studios, mostly from the late 1950s and early 60s, but with a few nods to the later sixties and early 70s. (Sorry, no British studios. Abbey Road, Olympic, and Trident spring to mind - anyone want to write one?) Each chapter picks a particular studio (Sun, Chess, Motown, Western, Columbia, etc.) and gives a brief overview of its history (down to the present day; alas many of the studios no longer exist), its features, and the people who made it special, both artists and engineers. Indeed, the authors have interviewed a number of studio owners and engineers, which adds much to the text. The book certainly succeeds in being evocative - these were the days when echo chambers could be someone's bathroom, when everything was recorded on glorious analog tape, when most basic tracks were done live all in the same room with sonic leakage, and cigarette smoking in the studio was glamorous. Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole, Ray Charles, Muddy Waters, Elvis Presley, Otis Redding, Aretha Franklin, John Coltrane, the Doors, and other greats make walk-on appearances, and there are good photographs of many of them at work. (Actually, I could have used even more photos.) The book also rescues from relative obscurity one Bill Putnam, who apparently designed many of the sweetest-sounding rooms in the country. Often there are anecdotes about the history of studio owners and their labels, which are interesting, though one might hope for even more anecdotes about the artists and recording sessions. I found myself wishing for a little bit more technical information too, about how each room was set up and what specific gear they had, though some of this is mentioned briefly. And, of course, they can't cram every studio in here - for instance, there is no chapter on Muscle Shoals. However, the book ends with a nice discography of tracks to hunt down and listen to, each associated with one of the studios, and all of which I want to listen to after reading about these places' heydays. I find this book fascinating for what it does tell us, and inspiring in its depiction of an era when artistic talent, engineering skill, and human warmth made sometimes low-tech rooms into hallowed cathedrals of sound. A good gift for anyone interested in recording, or in the 50s-60s period."},{"Title":"Temples of Sound: Inside the Great Recording Studios","review":"This book tells the behind the scenes stories of some of your favorite music from the 40s to the 70s.

Great stuff."},{"Title":"Temples of Sound: Inside the Great Recording Studios","review":"With all the documentaries out there today, it's sometimes easy to forget the expression \\"The Joy of Music\\". Thankfully, Mr. Clark stays away from trying to overanalyze every note and decision, and at times delights in the instantaneous, spur of the moment happenings that create great hits. (ie.,How the song Hold On, I'm Coming by Sam & Dave was written in about 30 minutes by Isaac Hayes! Will never hear that song the same way again.)Each chapter is devoted to one particular studio, and some of the giants who recorded there, what gave the studio that particular sound, but more often than not, what accidental happening's created the soundtrack to so many of our lives.With each studio covered in only a chapter, there are probably thousand's of untold stories that go along with each studio, however once again Mr. Clark hits on the highlights, and does a good job of figuring out what the reader really wants to know.After reading a chapter, found myself pulling out various cd's of the respective studio's and enjoying them all over again."},{"Title":"Temples of Sound: Inside the Great Recording Studios","review":"This ain't no temple, this ain't no disco, this ain't no foolin' around-it's just a rockin' good read, and one of the best books ever on the recording industry.If possible, put on one of your favorite records when you read Temples of Sound.

I insist on owning the latter kind of book because I'm such a collage freak, but I haven't been impressed with them, generally speaking. This is one of the best. There are TONS artists and styles represented, and the book is huge. It's all Russian art, of course - much new and some very old.The average \\"collage book\\" buyer is probably somebody who makes collages and is looking for inspiration. This book isn't for all such people. It's not for the kind of people who frequent scrapbooking stores or for makers of decorative collages such as adorn the walls of doctor's office waiting rooms. And there are probably better books for those who want to explore the \\"cleverly surreal\\" style of magazine photomontage. HOWEVER, if you love 20th century abstract art, Rauschenberg-style assemblages, or just DIY cultural crumbs of the sort that early mail artists created, then I think you'll be happy with this book. There are no works here that I like as much as my favorite Schwitters, Hoch, or Rauschenberg works, but there are lots of inspiring ideas.I'm sure I paid at least $120.00 for this when I saw it in Miami a few years ago. So, the price has dropped."},{"Title":"Muhammad Ali: Ringside","review":"If you're a boxing fan or just an Ali fan, this book will help you relive memories like no other photo book or biography will. If you're NOT, you will still marvel at the art and the wonderful writing on page after page. The text is not sappy, faceless writing like so many other photo or art books. Instead, these are well-written essays from people who know boxing and know Ali -- and their appreciation will make you appreciate Ali's achievements, charisma, and larger-than-life persona that has led so many to name him the athlete of the century. (If you're looking for more of a narrative, Davis Miller's new &quot;The Tao of Muhammad Ali&quot; is the perfect complement to this book.)"},{"Title":"Muhammad Ali: Ringside","review":"Overall, this strikes me as a somewhat lazy book. Rather than offer any original writing, the editors simply cobble together previously published writings by Alex Haley (actually a \\"Playboy\\" interview of the young Ali by Haley), Norman Mailer, Joyce Carol Oates, and Peter Richmond, along with a very short introduction by James Earl Jones. The book jacket also boasts of \\"contributions from\\" the likes of Malcolm X, Jackie Robinson, George Plimpton, Jim Brown, and numerous others, but this turns out to refer simply to brief quotations that pepper the book, mostly as photo captions.The quality of the text by the four featured writers is fine. Certainly you can't go wrong with Norman Mailer. His book \\"The Fight,\\" from which the chapter in this book is excerpted, was one of the first serious works about boxing and Muhammad Ali that I read back in the 70s, and the first thing I ever read by Mailer. I was a big fan of Ali going in, and a fan of Mailer as well coming out.One can always quibble with editing decisions in a book like this, but being familiar with Mailer's \\"The Fight,\\" I found some of the choices made here rather peculiar. For example, in Mailer's very lengthy account of the Ali-Foreman fight itself, he presents the fifth round as the most dramatic, action-filled, significant round of the entire fight. In this excerpt, the editors choose to include some of Mailer's set-up for that round (e.g., \\"[Foreman] came out in the fifth with the conviction that if force had not prevailed against Ali up to now, more force was the answer, considerably more force than Ali had ever seen.\\"), but then simply replace that entire climactic round with ellipsis.I don't believe I had previously read the other three selections, or at most I had read excerpts from them. But none of them are newly rediscovered gems that will come as revelations to serious Ali fans. They are not weak or uninteresting, but they are recycled material with which many readers will already be familiar.Similarly, there are many fine photos in the book, but little that has not appeared in one or more similar Ali books in the past. (In terms of both text and photos, I strongly prefer Wilfrid Sheed's superficially similar picture book \\"Muhammad Ali\\" to this one.) One exception is that this book includes many fight programs, posters, and tickets that I had not previously come across.The book is marred by many factual errors committed by the editors in their photo captions. There are many things that a proofreader even minimally familiar with Ali's career should have caught, so one must unfortunately infer considerable sloppiness or laziness on the part of those who put this book together.For example, contrary to what this book tells you, Ali did not defeat Joe Frazier by fifteen round decision in their third fight. Ali was awarded a technical knockout when Frazier's handlers conceded between the fourteenth and fifteenth rounds. Ali's 1972 fight against George Chuvalo was not a fifteen round decision, but a twelve round decision. (He had defeated Chuvalo by fifteen round decision in an earlier fight in 1966; that might be what confused the editors.) The book states flatly that Ken Norton broke Ali's jaw in the second round of their March 1973 fight. Maybe, but different parties have claimed anything from the first to the twelfth round, so the matter is not without uncertainty. The photo identified as being from Ali's 1971 fight against Jurgen Blin is in fact a photo from the 1974 fight against Foreman.Though flawed, this book still has worthwhile elements. With such a compelling central character, you would expect nothing less. It's not the best Ali book out there by a long shot, but insofar as it recruits a few more young newcomers into the legions of Ali fans, and gives the rest of us an excuse to reminisce about an extraordinary man and his extraordinary life, it cannot be all bad."},{"Title":"Muhammad Ali: Ringside","review":"I would consider this a coffeetable book more than anything. The boxing photography in this is great. The writing is a mixed bag. Its mainly overblown hero worship of Ali from various celebrities and liberal media establishment journalists/writers. The two things I found interesting was an excerpt from an interview with Ali shortly after the first Liston fight where he step by step, round by round goes through what he did and what was going through his head during his first encounter with Liston. Surprisingly (because I normally don't like Mailer) I also thought Norman Mailers descriptive round by round recount of the Ali-Foreman fight was good. Besides those two excerpts and the photography this books not worth your time."},{"Title":"Muhammad Ali: Ringside","review":"This briefly went out of print, but thankfully it's back. (No, wait, now it's out of print again. I seem to update this review on a monthly basis.) It's a fantastic book on a popular topic. Anyone who is a fan at all of Ali's career or just of boxing in general should read this. The articles by the likes of Norman Mailer, Alex Haley, and Joyce Carol Oates are priceless, and the photographic recap of his career is stunning. I especially enjoyed the wealth of images of his fight posters. These are an underappreciated little art form, and there have been some great ones for Ali fights. It's not a biography, per se; it's more selective, but it's still a valuable overview of a fascinating career."},{"Title":"Muhammad Ali: Ringside","review":"The pictures are exciting and the while the reading is difficult, older students could do it. Many students admire Muhammad Ali and the photos will please their eyes and the information will soothe their minds. Ali didn't have a sex scandal, and his arrest was inappropriate and overturned by the Supreme Court. He is an exciting person that kids can look up to."},{"Title":"Muhammad Ali: Ringside","review":"This book could not be called anything more than a brief introduction to the subject. Basically there are five essays by five different authors. First an introduction by James Earl Jones, then four more essays, one each for the 60's, 70's, 80's &amp; 90's. All are relatively brief but each has it's own focus and tone, which is nice. The book does not talk at all about the three Ali-Frazier fights, and is pretty thin about the things it does talk about, so in no way could it be considered comprehensive. In fact, a majority of the book's substance is in pictures and snappy quotes. This leads to a book that is \\"light and refreshing\\" - which is its strength. Finally, this is not a critical book; all the contributors are definitely fans of Ali.For someone very familiar with the subject, this is probably not the book for you. For me, I enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"Muhammad Ali: Ringside","review":"A great book for Ali fans and boxing fans alike.

Rhodan has Marshall contact the Venusian seals - semi-intelligent animals that live in the seas of Venus to help them get into the Venusian secret base. Meanwhile, Rhodan's enemies, the rebels against the new power, who have Thora (the Arkonide beauty) captive, are also nearing the Venusian base. Thora's captors are menaced by a Venusian Tyrex - a monster similar to the Terran Tyrannosaurus, but far larger and more voracious. There's also a cool scene with gigantic ants.Of course, everyone knows that Perry will resuce Thora and put down the rebellion. But it's how he does it that's interesting.The next short series begins with number 18 - \\"Menace of the Mutant Master\\", a trilogy about a man who can control mutants.I've never been this impressed by a series. I'm reminded of old cliffhangers like \\"Buck Rodgers\\" or \\"Flash Gordon\\" when reading these marvelous books. This series is still being published in Germany and is now well over 1,800 volumes. It's too bad American publishers stopped these after only about 120 books. I had to learn to speak, read, and write German in order to continue reading Perry Rhodan.This book also contains another editorial, another science fiction movie section, and another fan letters page. And there are three stories - one continuing adventure, similar to a serial, and two \\"Shock Shorts\\" - continuing a series of science fiction shorts at the end of each volume of Rhodan stories. Although these stories have nothing to do with Perry Rhodan, they are worth looking at. It's well worth reading the entire Rhodan series."},{"Title":"Irish Family Histories","review":"Nice book, quite detailed with three to five pages on each featured name.

Be forewarned, you must have a good background knowledge of introductory Physics to get the maximum benefit from this book. If you are in need of deep, thorough review of Physics (i.e. your Physics is weak), I wouldn't start here. I am using this book as a complement to Kaplan's review book that I received when I enrolled in Kaplan's MCAT course.The book is broken down into 8 chapters, or lectures, each with a new Physics topic. There are discrete problems within each lecture, as well as a 30 minute \\"mini-MCAT\\" to take after you've completed the reading for each lecture. Though I am very pleased by the abundance of MCAT-like questions (and satisfied with the explanations), I find the questions emphasize a conceptual understanding of the material, and don't require a lot of calcuation. That's great for aiding in your conceptual understanding, but I'd also recommend doing additional practice with MCAT problems from another source to get used to doing relatively complex compuatations quickly and without a calculator.Overall, however, I'm please with this book; it's the best Physics review book I've come across so far."},{"Title":"Examkrackers MCAT, Vol. 5: Physics","review":"This book was very helpful alongside the Physics 1001 questions book, I feel as though it helps provide a strong foundation towards what is to be considered neccessary knowledge for the MCAT, the 1001 book forces you to truly understand the material and it's application, so the two together are great."},{"Title":"Examkrackers MCAT, Vol. 5: Physics","review":"The book is great.

A small boy captured by space pirates is purchased by an old, legless beggar on a backwater planet. But as he grows, he is given more and more complex tasks by his loving &quot;father&quot; (who refuses to accept that he &quot;owns&quot; the boy). Bit by bit the boy becomes aware of the Great Game (to borrow Kipling's term) he's been playing without even knowing it. Soon, with the help of his &quot;father's&quot; friends, he is on his own until he is recalled to Earth to meet his long-lost family. This is great science fiction, a great tale. I read it as an early teenager and a number of times since. Highly recommended for any sci-fi, Heinlein, or good, space-adventure fans."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"Citizen of the Galaxy (1957) is the eleventh SF story in the Juvenile series, followingTime for the Stars. It is set in the mid future, centuries from now. Humanity has long ago spread to stars.The Hegemony stretches almost five hundred lightyears from Earth in every direction. At the periphery, the Hegemonic Guard fights piracy and slavery, but at the center few know of these social ills. The Exotic Corps spends lives in hope of abolishing slavery within the next two centuries.In this novel, Thorby is a slave newly shipped to Jubbal in the Nine Worlds. He doesn't know where he is and doesn't really care. He just wonders who his next master will be.Baslim the Cripple is a beggar in Jubbalpore, the capitol of Jubbal and the Nine Worlds. He has only one eye and one leg, but is reputed to be the wisest man in the city.In this story, Baslim is present when Thorby is put on the block. The previous item -- two young and pretty girls who might have been twins -- had stimulated a brisk bidding war. But Thorby is nothing special and the customers are encouraging the auctioneer to get on with it. He tries to get some bids, but nobody is interested in Thorby.The auctioneer finally asks for any bid and Baslim offers two minims. The auctioneer is offended at the very small bid, but other customers remind him of his words. Since the auction cannot proceed without at least three bids, a small spurt of offers runs the price up to nine minims. Tax on the sale is more than the final bid.Though Thorby tries to run away, Baslim keeps a hold on him until they reach Baslim's apartment under the old arena. Once there, Baslim dons a prosthetic leg and makes supper. Thorby tries to run again, but the door is securely locked.Baslim seats Thorby and serves supper, but the boy is too busy eyeing the door to eat. So Baslim opens the door and tells Thorby that he can leave if he desires. Thorby bolts out the door while Baslim is eating. After a while, Thorby reappears at the door; where else can he go in this strange and hostile environment?Baslim invites him back in and serves him a heaping plate of food. After Baslim cleans up the mess from the overfull boy, he gives him a more frugal meal appropriate for the half-starved youth. Baslim leaves the door unlocked when they lie down to sleep in the single bed.Baslim teaches Thorby many things about Jubbalpore. He also teaches the boy mathematics, history and other academic subjects. More important, he teaches Thorby how to observe and retain information.Thorby runs errands for Baslim all over the city. Later he sees Baslim dressed as a noble, with both eyes and legs. Thorby soon suspects that something is different about his master, but he also understands that others are not to be told about Baslim's affairs.This tale eventually takes Thorby away from Jubbal. He travels with Baslim's Free Trader friends and joins the Hegemonic Guard. Then he finds out whom he had been before becoming a slave.This story is much further down the timeline than the other Juvenile novels, which are usually set in the near future. Many of Earth's colony worlds are now independent polities and have been for centuries. Also, the Hegemony has established treaty relationships with many alien cultures.Highly recommended for Heinlein fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of future societies, exotic cultures, and the development of an innocent young male. For those who have not previously read this series, the initial volume isThe Rocketship Galileo.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"This novel is one of Heinlein's early works (one of the so-called juvenile novels) and presents a study of personal freedom. The main character, Thorby, begins the story as a slave on a distant world. As a boy, Thorby is sold to a crippled beggar, Baslim, who teaches him the ways of the street and also does his best to give Thorby a more formal education. Baslim is much more than he seems though as we slowly find out as the story develops. He (Baslim) has an unusual interest in the comings and goings of various spacecraft, and this interest ultimately gets him killed. He has setup an escape route for Thorby who uses it to get off planet, which is when his adventure really begins. Thorby travels through the galaxy ultimately returning to Earth to discover his true past.The main theme of this book (besides being an entertaining adventure story on its own) is freedom. Thorby starts as a slave, but throughout the story he spends time in various situations in which his economic position is greatly improved, but in which he is does not really have more freedom. After escaping from Sargon, he becomes a crewmember of a ship that travels form planet to planet buying and selling merchandise. Thorby's lot in life has certainly improved, but the laws and customs aboard the Sisu are very restrictive in his own right. It later turns out that Thorby is actually the heir to a vast fortune, but even this is not all that it is cracked up to be as now he must fight scheming relatives to retain control of it, and he is a practical slave again to the business to maintain it. Like most of Heinlein's juveniles, this story can be read on several levels. At its simplest level, this story is a decent adventure/sci-fi story about a young boy becoming a man and finding his place in the world. On a deeper level, my personal view is that Heinlein was trying to express that there are many forms of servitude, and great wealth doesn't necessarily make one free. Freedom to choose and taking responsibility for one's decisions are themes that run throughout Heinlein's work. Oftentimes we must choose to sacrifice our freedom for the greater good (i.e. in military service or providing for a family), but the individual has the right to choose when and how and under what conditions he will voluntarily sacrifice his/her freedom.This is one of Heinlein's better novels, but certainly not in the same category as \`Starship Troopers' or \`Tunnel in the Sky'. Given that this is a juvenile, the discussions of the basic theme of freedom in this book has been watered down (certainly in comparison to some of his later works). The story/plot itself is only just OK, the story is initially very compelling, but becomes unimaginative and falls apart at the end (maybe RAH got tired of this and wanted to work on something else?). Definitely worth a look though."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"\\"Citizen of the Galaxy\\" is another fine addition to Robert A. Heinlein's series of \`juveniles' he wrote for Charles Scribners Sons primarily in the 1950s.We never find out what motivated the beggar, Baslim the Cripple, to buy the slave boy Thorby. In this distant future, mankind has spread out among the stars. The Nine Worlds do not even acknowledge any relationship to Earth and are not members of the Terran Hegemony.Anyway on this frontier world, there exists the institution of slavery.One thing becomes immediately apparent, Baslim is a lot more than a beggar. As their father/son develops, it is obvious Baslim is highly educated with a wide range of skills. It is also obvious, he is some sort of spy. Thorby doesn't care. Pops business was Pops business. Baslim raises and home schools his son.Things come to a head years later when Baslim is found to be a spy. Thorby must flee for his life. However Baslim has foreseen this day and has prepared Thorby. Thorby is smuggled offworld and begins his quest for his true identity and completion of Baslim's mission.The central theme of this book is the variation in human culture and the adaptability of man. Each group Thorby finds himself has it's own rituals and customs. Our hero is constantly required change, adapt and in the process grow as a man."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"Heinlein was a master of the noncondescending juvenile SF novel, and this is, in my informed opinion, the very best of the dozen or so he wrote during the 1950s. In fact, it's one of his two or three best novels, period. Thorby starts out a slave, purchased on a distant world by an old beggar (who, of course, is more than he seems) and becomes intimate with the underworld -- then finds himself aboard a Free Trader vessel with an extremely complex social structure, where he's adopted in and makes a new life for himself -- then finds himself a very junior enlisted man on a \\"space patrol\\" ship, where he makes another new life -- then finds himself the long-lost heir to an enormous fortune back on Earth, where the various plotlines come together and (yes) he has to try to make a new life for himself. Thorby is nothing if not adaptable. The narrative is straightforward, moving along at a nice pace, and there's very little of the overwritten preachifying RAH was prone to in his later work. The characters are based on \`50s archetypes, so today's kids will undoubtedly be amused by the state of gender relations, and they've probably never seen a slide rule, but, hey -- read and enjoy."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"We are introduced to Thorby as a scruffy young boy, being auctioned off as a slave on the planet Jubbelpore. He is so unpromising-looking that he ends up as the property of a one-legged resident of the Plaza and licensed mendicant (read, beggar) Baslim the Wise. Baslim drags Thorby home to his dwelling in the maze under the Plaze arena and thus begin the surprises in this very well-drawn novel.Baslim feeds, then teaches the young boy, who is pig-ignorant, dirty and starving. He learns to read, then learns other surprising skills from Baslim the Wise, who is not only a beggar and wise man on the Plaza, but something more. Just how much more we don't find out til much later in the novel.Thorby soaks up the rich lessons of the street and Baslim's teachings until one day he must flee for his life. He is assisted by the Free Traders, a society of space-faring traders who live on their ships and pay allegiance to no planet. This is a huge adjustment for Thorby--he must become a member of this insular group and follow their rigid customs and laws. Thorby does adjust and is so well accepted he is about to be given (mostly without his knowledge) a bride, until....it's time for him again to move on.Where Thorby does end up, and who he really is and how he finds out is the underlying story, but the real enjoyment is reading each distinct section of the book and savoring the different societies that Heinlein creates for us. This is rather like a sci-fi version of a &quot;Bildungsroman&quot; --the genre of novel where a young man comes of age and finds himself, but in a really imaginative and touching way."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"Next to Tunnel in the Sky, this is probably my favorite among his &quot;juveniles.&quot; This is basically a Heinleinian, Sci-Fi version of the rags to riches tale, as you watch Thorby's rise from a poor beggar boy to one of the richest and most powerful men on earth. A good Heinlein tale and a great way to kill a Sat. afternoon."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"Why do I call Citizen of the Galaxy a cautionary tale? Because at its heart is the concept, often overlooked in sci-fi, that slavery--arguably the greatest evil of which mankind is capable--follows any fronteir. Anywhere human beings are free to oppress each other, it seems we generally will; yet the other side of that coin is that there are also people who will risk their lives to fight such oppression.Baslim the Beggar, a little more than what he seems, is a character who proves that some of us will fight for justice even at great cost to themselves. One of Heinlein's best mentor characters, he begins the story with a simple but great act of kindness and ends it as a legend. Thorby is no less special, maturing from a mere slave into the person best suited to thwarting slavers in the future.If we ever make it to the stars, we'd better keep this story in mind to remind us what's possible. When I started reading sci-fi this book was recommended to me; I recommend it to anyone else in turn."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"This is one of those books that stays with you, and bears re-reading 20 years later. Accessible to youth, and quite worth reading by adults who come across it for the first time - adventurous, enlightening and sometimes emotional."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"This book despite, being a juvenal, is probably one of the best reasons why science fiction isn't just kid stuff. It examines what it means to be free. I doubt that very many slice of life writters are of even have examine this issue. Heinlein also shows us future cultures that give us insight into the real world."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"One of the things I do like about Heinlein novels, especially the shorter ones is the apparent sprawl, a story can start out one way and then out of nowhere start going somewhere else entirely, so by the end you're nowhere near where you started. This would be one of those books. Thorby is a slave who doesn't know who is parents are and winds up getting sold to a one eyed, one legged beggar who isn't exactly what he seems. From there Thorby starts to begin rediscovering where he came from and who he is and by the time the story finishes you're going to have a hard time believing it's the same person. Actually, Heinlein does manage to convince you the Thorby you start with is the Thorby you end with but that's because he's a tad . . . boring. That's right, reading it reminded me of reading the adventures of an eager puppy, perhaps it's Heinlein's comment on what slavery does to you but Thorby for most of the story is basically looking for someone to tell him what to do it's pathetic. And even when he seems to be getting more initiative, it's only to go find someone else to give him better orders. So don't read it for the dazzling character study (the best character is probably Baslim the beggar, but he doesn't last long anyway . . .) read it for the plethora of ideas Heinlein splatters all over the page. From the slave trade and beggar existence to the Free Traders and beyond that, he crams in stuff that lesser writers would need entire series to tackle. He just tosses it off in a few pages and it feels like it has some actual depth to it. That's talent, folks. Here he has a knack for making the situations seem plausible and even likely, and the hard part about SF is making the reader believe. He convinced me here. The only other complaint with the book is that he falls in love with his ideas a bit too much and some parts of the book drag a bit, the fact that Thorby isn't all that interesting doesn't help and in parts the book has little drive whatsoever, it just sort of drifts. But if you've got the patience (and the book's not that long) and just keep plowing forward, it turns out to be fairly rewarding. Yeah, the ending is kind of &quot;eh&quot; but getting there is half the fun. Not his best, but still enjoyable."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"Of the 31 Heinlein books I own, I'd say this one ranks somewhere in the middle. Thorby (the main character) is not Heinlein's strongest hero but I think he's one of the most adaptable. Since he gains control of a major holding company before he's 25, he's not a doormat since he starts the book as a slave. Thorby was lucky since his last official master (&quot;Pop&quot; Baslim) treated him as his adopted son and educated him accordingly. His education served him well in the 3 other societies he encounters after &quot;Pop&quot; dies. Heinlein expresses some interesting ideas on freedom in this book in a fairly subtle way."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"Sorry I can't agree with the enthusiastic reviews of \\"Citizen of the Galaxy.\\" The protagonist, Thorby, is altogether too much of a \\"passive hero\\": he never actually seems to _do_ anything, he just bounces around the galaxy like a pinball. If the story goes anywhere at all, it's because others do things to him or for him.After the story first appeared, as a serial in Astounding Science Fiction, editor John W. Campbell admitted that, in hindsight, he considered the characterization a major flaw and wished he had discussed it with the author.Of course, if you're a Heinlein fan, you should definitely add \\"Citizen of the Galaxy\\" to your collection. Even if Heinlein's writing is uneven, his strong point is in developing fascinating ideas and situations."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"Inspired by Kipling's &quot;Kim,&quot; it's not Kim's equivalent as a literary masterpiece because Heinlein wasn't quite a wizard with language like Kipling, but it might be a more enjoyable read. Less technological than most of Heinlein's novels, it's set in a distant, vaguely medieval future of empires, aristocrats, and slaves. Yet, the last section of the book changes gears exhiliaratingly when the poor slave boy Thorby arrives on Earth and plunges into a proxy fight to take control of a major corporation"},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"I've enjoyed Citizen since I was a kid, and I ordered this because it's very rare to see Heinlein's works in hardback. In fact, I have about 30 Heinlein books, and only one in hardback (well, 2 now). BUT, this edition is essentially the normal paperback with a different cover; it's the same size as the paperback and the same pulpy paper (and the type goes too close to the binding). If you're buying this just to replace your paperback version, it's probably not worth it.Update: Amazon has now changed the description from \\"Hardcover\\" to \\"Library Binding\\""},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"There is none. Nice to read a book without the too-often obligatory profanity. Citizen Of The Galaxy is a bit slow to grab you (took me until around chapter 7) but then it has it's hold on you. A keeper in my collection. I actually have two copies and it is one of the few sci-fi novels I have read more than once. A truly galactic spanning epic."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"FIRST OFF: I LEAVE NO SPOILERS!!!. As of yet, what I've read of Heinlein has been more adventure Sci-Fi, and this is, but it is also a very dark story even for the 'juveniles' series. It has it's sorrow,hope,disgust,and the responsibility of a young man who is so determined to do what Pop says. 'Pop', is Baslim the cripple,our protagonists(Thorby)master, bought as a slave and taught the ways of the beggar lifestyle on planet Jubbul and that being a slave doesn't mean you can't be free. The most prominent trait I read in this book is the ability to become a 'man' so to speak and how far you will take that opportunity when given. Thorby,our main character is magnificently brought to life through Heinlein's writing, so much so that you really care for him and his adventures. From his change from caste to caste and his journey through the galaxy on the family ship 'Sisu',to outlandish planets which put him through many changes in social status and his desire to become a free man. A great journey and another classic for Heinlein. The reasoning behind my 3 and a half rating is that the younger fans of his work may find it to dark and somewhat lacking in its flow of other Heinlein 'juveniles'. Although it deserves a read as it it gives us a look into the mind of a slave,a outlaw and perhaps a citizen of the galaxy."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"The story starts as an alien with pointy ears becomes insulted as the slave auctioneer on a distant planet extolls the virtues of the slave boy's \\"round ears\\". In retaliation, alien helps a poor human beggar (Baslim the Cripple)buy the boy by keeping the auction going while dropping coins into beggar's bowl. Beggar takes boy home, cleans him up, gives him hypnotic suggestions not to have nightmares, and trains him to beg and learn things quickly through hypnosis. In addition to begging, boy sometimes delivers messages to crews of space ships. Beggar hypnotizes boy to recite message to one of five space ship captain should beggar die. When boy is sent to deliver message to certain spaceship crew member who is replaced by another man, beggar's cover is blown, he gets captured & bites poison tooth. Boy returns home to find empty lodgings, everything smashed, sees artificial leg left behind, realizes begger's in trouble. Boy then runs from authorities, over walls and roofs until he breaks into roof of acquaintance, who smuggles him onto a space ship where one of the five captains hears his message, which requests the boy be cared for until he can be joined with an Earth ship, which consequently does an identity search, identifying the boy, aka Rudbek, as the heir of a wealthy family. The captain of the ship also discovers Rudbek was sleep-trained by the beggar to memorize very important data, because the beggar was actually a spy against the slave traders. After joining his wealthy family on earth, Rudbek discovers his parents were attacked by pirates in a zone where the slave traders operated, and that his wealthy family owned interests connected to the slave trade, selling slavers ships, for one thing. Rudbek vows to take down the slave trade, using his wealth to help him.This is not the only book Heinlein's written about wealthy people traveling on space liners who get embroiled in political intrigue. Just wish it had been made into a movie-Disney could do wonders with this story. It is ripe for a sequel."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"One has to read Citizen of the Galaxy to understand the development of Heinlein's cultural themes and of his fascination with various forms of kinship and marriage as well as other aspects of social structure. Your first clue is that the anthropologist aboard the Sisu is named Margaret Mader.Heinlein also takes on slavery in this book. And white collar crime. Plus there is a rapscallionesque lawyer who describes himself as \\"middlin honest\\". Coupled with a charming protagonist, ethical mentors and the Space Navy, all the elements of a great Heinlein adventure come together in Citizen of the Galaxy.\\"Good Business\\"."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"The first RAH that I read was this book.It introduced me to the Grand Masters style and I have enjoyed RAH ever since. This book remains one of my favourites.The story of an orphan who grows up and finds his family & along the way finds his values in life is a timeless classic that has been given a great treatment by Heinlein."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"Robert A Heinlein was not called the \\"Dean of Science Fiction Writers\\" for nothing: like most (if not all) of his other books, in \\"Citizen of the Galaxy\\" he takes a concept - in this case slavery: deconstructs and analyzes it in many different ways, and presents his thoughts on each aspect of it to us in the context of a compelling and entertaining story.The story centers on Thorby: a boy perhaps in his early teens, and of unknown parentage, who enters the story as a rebellious and angry young slave on the auction block. We follow his life through several major transitions as he is bought, then educated and finally freed by \\"Baslim the Cripple\\", a beggar with mysterious and very un-beggar-like qualities; through his escape from Baslim's murderers to live with the galaxy-roving \\"Free Traders\\". Then, after a brief stint in the military, he returns to Earth where he learns of his own origins and heritage, and eventually how and perhaps why he was sold into slavery. He also learns who Baslim really was, and finally takes on what he learns was Baslim's true mission as his own.To me, like most of his books, one of the most interesting aspects of this story is how Heinlein illustrates and expands upon his central theme in so many different ways: At first we see Thorby in the role of a classic slave, with a master - Baslim, but with a twist, as Baslim is a man who bought Thorby purely because he detests slavery - and teaches Thorby that what makes a man free is his mind, not whether another claims to own and control his body in a physical sense.Then, when Thorby finds his way to the Free Traders, we see a society that claims to be freer than any other in history - which is true in that they roam the entire galaxy at will - going where they want, when they want, without constraint. But, their life-long and crowded existence onboard their spaceships has created a society where tradition, familial, and social constraints limit them in ways more profound and limiting then Thorby had ever experienced before.When he finally returns to Earth, Thorby finds that his place is at the pinnacle of power, wealth and fame - yet his wealth and power present new challenges: constraining his freedom in new and even more difficult to challenge ways.In each of these situations, we see how Thorby uses the talents, skills and freedom he finds within himself, which Baslim had nurtured and trained, to overcome the challenges he is faced with: we also see how those around him are enslaved in ways both more subtle and more profound than Thorby had been when he had been \\"owned\\" by Baslim.Heinlein presents slavery as a great evil that must be conquered and eliminated, and as a societal disease that can and will take root and flourish in many ways, in almost any society. He also shows us that slavery is less about the physical constraints and more about the enslavement of one's mind and spirit.Through the experiences of Thorby, Heinlein shows us that true freedom exists only when a person is able to free their mind and rise above the shackles and constraints their day to day existence places upon them. That slavery is not just about the physical enslavement and exploitation of one person by another, but about enslavement of the mind and spirit.As a teen, I did not find this particular book as appealing as I did most of the other works of young adult fiction written by Heinlein in the 1950's, such as \\"Between Planets\\", \\"The Moon is a Harsh Mistress\\", and \\"The Rolling Stones\\". Yet, now that I have re-read \\"Citizen of the Galaxy\\" as an adult, I find it to be a more mature, richer, thoughtful, subtle and thought-provoking work than many of his earlier work: I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"Citizen explores just what freedom really is as it follows a young man, Thorby, as he matures from boy to man. Starting as a slave sold to a most unusual beggar, Baslim, we see the first aspect that many equate with the absolute opposite of freedom, though we see that in fact 'slaves' sometimes have more freedom of choice than 'free men'. The society he paints here is vivid and believable (though the economics of slavery in a star-travelling culture has always seemed a little dubious to me). Baslim is far more than he appears to be, and puts Thorby through a rigorous education, both academic and practical. How do you become a really good beggar? Here Heinlein falls in with Ayn Rand - whatever you do, do it to the best of your ability, from begging to juggling. Also there are several comments included here about the integrity of the self - lies to others and misleading yourself both come in for some dictums. These are items that may pass over young readers' heads, but perhaps planting seeds that all assumptions should be examined, nothing should be accepted on 'faith', that personal integrity is more important than 'success', that consequences of actions should be examined carefully before committing to that action.Later, Baslim calls in some favors and sends Thorby to live with the Free Traders, a group of space merchants that keep to themselves with their own unique culture. Here Thorby discovers another aspect of freedom: a person's ability to do as he wishes is severely constrained by the culture in which he lives. The Free Trader society (which owes much to Margaret Mead's seminal ideas, and highlighted by an anthropologist character named Margaret Mader - Heinlein was not usually so obvious with his names) of rigid matriarchal domination and separation into moieties provides security, peace of mind, and the ability through rigid rules of formalism to allow a small group of people to live together for extended periods without breaking any heads, but has as its downside great limitations on freedom of choice. This section of the book may be the best part, as the society is so different from today's American culture that it becomes fascinating in its own right, apart from its effects on Thorby. Thorby himself grows and changes significantly in this part of the book, from first love to determining just how he must balance the demands of duty and personal desires.The last section deals with Thorby back on Earth, within a society not much different from our own, and shows a third aspect of freedom: the internal courageousness to make your own decisions and act upon them. Freedom is just as constrained by internal timidity and/or defining decisions as by external forces. As this last section offers little in terms of new or different views of society (though it is a good mirror of some of the flaws of a capitalistic/lawyer dominated one), it isn't as engrossing as the first two sections, but is highly important in terms of completing Heinlein's thematic investigation of all aspects of freedom.Characterization other than Thorby and Baslim is pretty thin, especially for the females that appear in supporting roles. This was fairly typical for his juveniles, as they were basically strong adventure novels with their primary focus on their central character. But the thematic line on slavery/freedom is much stronger here than most of his messages in other books, and as this particular position is also stated in some of those other works (most especially Farnham's Freehold), has to be seen as one of Heinlein's personal beliefs (unlike some other positions he proposes in his books that seem mainly designed to stir up debate).This book is not Heinlein's absolute best, nor even the best of his so-called 'juveniles' (which are typically better reading than most 'adult' mainstream bestsellers), but still provides an engrossing, fun, and illuminating read. Recommended for all readers willing to look at life styles different from their own.--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)"},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"This is a book that Hollywood has overlooked (or has failed to steal)... yet.With all of the craptacular movies out there, maybe someone in Hollywood will read Citizen and make a movie out of it.After a piece of garbage like Skyline was made, anything would be better and this classic is a story that deserves to be told."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"I've read \\"Citizen of the Galaxy\\" several times in the decades since I first discovered it as a boy, and despite my changing maturity and views of the world, it has never disappointed me.You get four stories in one here, starting with Thorby's childhood in a spy story. Then he further matures in a space based society of Free Traders, makes a brief segue thru time on a military ship, and finally tries to solve the mystery of his family and his parents' death or disappearance.All segments of the book are at times heart warming, and all are dramatic and exciting. A trademark of Heinlein's fine writing is that when you get to the end of most of his efforts, you are so in the story that you hate for it to end. And since Heinlein didn't get into sequels until late in life, most of his characters solve their problems, never to return.This is a must read book for every fan of Heinlein specifically, and science fiction in general."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"As Heinlein used to say, many great stories draw from others, with \\"the serial numbers filed off\\". At various conventions, he acknowledged his debt to Rudyard Kipling, but this, I believe, is Kim done better.It occurs to me that the protagonist's chief adoptive father believed in Robert E. Lee's observation \\"Duty is the sublimest word in the language. You can never do more than your duty. You should never wish to do less.\\" That character lived by his conception of duty to mankind (side reference: think of the final pages in Failsafe), and managed to convey it to his protege, even as he experienced the Japanese proverb \\"Duty is heavier than a mountain; death is lighter than a feather.\\"I don't mean to suggest this is oppressive and preachy. The protagonist, in the best tradition of Star Trek, explores new cultures, and learns from each. Some of those cultures, such as the Free Traders, cried out for Heinlein to write more about them.Absolutely the best Heinlein to start a juvenile reading him -- and I still get value reading it perhaps a half-century later."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"To be sold as a slave must be the most humiliating experience that a self-aware being can face, and Thorby is sold on the auction block to a beggar by the name of Baslim. Baslim has barely purchased Thorby when Thorby attempts to escape. Fortunately for Thorby, Thorby does not escape. Being purchased by Baslim turns out to be the best thing that could have happened to Thorby.Baslim is more than he appears to be. Though Thorby questions little about Baslim, whom he calls Pop, Thorby learns over time that Baslim has deep secrets that he has never revealed to Thorby, secrets that he will take to the grave.Thorby is forced to leave the home Baslim has made for him and journey into the galaxy, chased by people for reasons he does not fully understand. But Thorby will learn that there are many kinds of families in the galaxy, with varying degrees of sincerity and complexity. Thorby will ultimately try to claim the heritage that is rightfully his as a citizen of the galaxy.Heinlein was called the Dean of Science Fiction because he mastered the art of telling a story simply and easily, as though he were talking about a trip to the grocery store. Heinlein created this wonderful masterpiece in 1957, one of a string of books that drew many people into reading science fiction in the 50's and 60's, me included. Though this novel is slightly dated, it holds up reasonably well. Some portions may be more conceivable and believable today than when Heinlein first published the novel, as technology has made strides in some of the directions suggested in the novel.This book is a classic that will intrigue fans of hard science fiction that enjoy a solid and interesting story. The characters are well formed and believable, and Thorby is such a powerful individual that most readers will like him instantly, with all his faults. This book is a good read time and again, and one that many readers will want for their personal library.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"As the story opens a frightened young boy is on the auction block waiting to be sold again. He is on a planet that is unfamiliar to him, people are speaking a language he does not understand. He would be homesick but since he has no idea where 'home' is that would be rather pointless. All he knows is that he is called 'Thorby' and soon he will have another new owner. He is soon purchased by a crippled begger and taken to his new home, a lain in an abdandoned amphitheatre. Thorby learns the new family business - begging and comes to realize that his new owner is much more than just a begger. For one thing he insists that Thorby call him 'Pop' not 'Master', and requires Thorby to learn, learn to read, learn math, learn several languages and most importantly to learn how to learn. By the time the skinny little boy becomes a tall adolescent he also realizes that Pop has some decidedly nonbegger activities. Then one day Thorby's life ends and a new one, arranged by Pop, begins.Thorby's new life is abroad a Trader ship and he discovers that he must begin again to learn the rules of this new society and carve a place for himself within it. Just as he begins to find his place Thorby finds himself once again in a whole new world and once again must learn the rules from the bottom, this time in the army. That too does not last very long and Thorby, now a young man finds himself in the strangest and perhaps most dangerous situation in his life, wealthy heir to a vast business empire.This 1957 novel is one of Heinlein's 'juvenile' stories, but just as RAH did not underestimate his audience this book should not be dismissed as a 'children's story'. CITIZEN OF THE GALAXY can be read and enjoyed as an adventure story with a happy ending but in typical RAH fashion there is much more to be discovered. Thorby is forced to define himself and his role in his world several times in his short life. Each time he understands how things work and what his role is circumstances change and he must begin again. Those things that he 'knows' are true must be re-evaluated each time, perhaps causing the reader to do the same.This is definitely one of those books that will stay with the reader for sometime and think about the meaning of freedom, duty, family and just how a society is run to name a few. That is not to say that this book is without flaws. While Thorby and some of the other characters spring to life, others remain just cardboard figures that state their business and then move along."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"This was a very fast-moving, exciting book. It is well written, and it makes you think. I would definitely recommend this book to anybody who likes science fiction."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"As Thorby goes from slave to son to stranger in, then member of a trading society, to enlisted man in a space navy, to galactic magnate, he finds that each position brings him freedoms he barely dreamed of, yet each has obligations as strong as steel.Heinlein took risks in this juvenile--almost every juvenile hero is your average, bright, well-adjusted kid, sometimes with a special talent. Thorby is damaged goods, psychologically, and the anger within from unresolved and repeated traumas never far from the surface. Yet we can identify with this boy, because we see in him what we all know to be true--you can never go back. Thorby repeatedly finds acceptance in the four society he experiences--as beggar, crew member on a Trader, crew member on a military vessel, and as a playboy on Earth. Three times he is forced to move on by events beyond his control. The final time, he chooses to fight those who would control him and take on the job of corporate magnate. He is not satisfied with the result-- he wants to go back into the military, or follow in Baslim's footsteps--but we know (and, in his heart, he knows) he will never have that opportunity, and will have to find peace where he is. The ending makes it clear he is moving in that direction.Some have complained about Heinlein glorifying tribalism by making Sisu, a ship where if you are not of the people, you are filth, seem like such a nice place. I think he's using an extreme example to make kids think about their own tribe--nation, religion, whatever--and how they and their family members treat non-members of that tribe.A fine, fine book about the growth of a boy into manhood."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"It's hard to choose among the Heinlein juveniles, all of which should be required reading for adults, but I think this may be my favorite. While the relationship between Thorby and Baslim is only sketched in -- I wish Heinlein had had the time to explore it more fully -- it enlightens and informs the rest of the book.In the final analysis, it's about family. Not genetics, but the vastly more important question of who is that we have responsibilities to and for.And if the ending doesn't make you cry, you'd better see your priest, as your soul is vastly in need of repair."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"Citizen of the Galaxy is a very good classic science fiction work. It is the third Heinlein novel which I have finished. While it is in Heinlein's juvenile stories, the novel is a great adventure saga. I enjoyed following the main character Thorby through his life education and experiences. Unfortunately, the ending comes much too quickly and in too \\"neat\\" of a 1950's manner. It is suitable for readers spanning ages 11 to decades beyond."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"In yet another rags to riches tale, we follow the fortunes of Thorby, a young slave who is purchased by a beneficent beggar who calls himself Baslim, the Cripple. But as longtime Heinlein readers must already suspect, Baslim has capabilities that far outweigh his physical infirmities. While teaching Thorby his own profession, he sets a plan in motion to find Thorby's real family. After a thrilling escape from the slave planet, Thorby finds a new family in a merchant trader ship, where the duties and customs are unlike anything he has ever seen. Next he joins the Guards, where still further efforts are made to find Thorby's origins. When he is finally restored to his nearest relatives, Thorby finds himself facing still more challenges, as things are not what they seem at the Rudbek household. Will Thorby ever find happiness? And is it possible to ever be truly free?Heinlein's extensive firsthand knowledge of military science and shipboard routine serves him in good stead once again in this fascinating juvenile. He is somewhat less entertaining when trying to discuss big business dealings in the second half of the novel, but there is still a sufficiently subversive element to keep us interested in Thorby's fate. And while Thorby grows up quite a bit during the course of the story, this is still a boys' book. Numerous girls get thrown in Thorby's path at various stages, but he remains wholly oblivious, focused as he is own his own problems. And as is typical of Heinlein, these young women are not just hapless victims - some of them exercise real power within their respective realms. So young women interested in social sci-fi may find this book entertaining as well.Heinlein's heroes are often super-smart under-achievers who find themselves thrown into new environments where they doesn't understand the rules, and Thorby is no exception. Here the process is repeated several times, and we spend more pages adjusting to the next new social situation than we do studying scientific principles, so devotees of hard science may find this one rather light fare. But for those who love to look at alternate social structures, and try to understand the logic underlying each, this book is an entertaining exercise in cultural relativity, and easily ranks among the best of Heinlein's juveniles."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"Except for asomewhat slow middle section, this is an extremely fast-paced read and more emotional than perhaps any other Heinlein work. It's a touching story that will stay with you for a while. This is in contrast to much of Heinlein's work, which is often called preachy and heavy-handed. It is top-notch stuff: invigorating, touching, fast-paced, thought-provoking, and memorable. I recommend it to both youths and adults."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"This's one of the best sci-fi books I've ever read! It's incredibly fast-paced. I mean,don't YOU hate it when an author takes 50 pages to explain how said person grew up? And another thing...this is one of the most &quot;realistic&quot; sci-fi books I've ever read. Although I haven't read nearly half of it,I can see from all the other reviews that there're some interesting plot-twists. And isn't that what life is all about? People are always changing,moving,adapting to their &quot;new life.&quot; And I hear,next to the writers of books like &quot;Mists of Avalon,&quot; that this is one of the most hardcore sci-fi authors ever to have lived!"},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"I think this is agreat book for all ages.

It is by far, one of the best Sci-Fi books I've ever read."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"From the first word I loved this book. It was captavating and itruiging for the first 200 pages, and then it crashes. The lovable book I just knew a couple pages ago turned a slave boy learning to be free into a business man suing a relative over stocks! At the end, I wasn't sure if I was reading Heinlein or a bad Clancy book! The ending was pointless, uninteresting, and just plain bad. If you want to read this book, stop at page 200 (I liked it a lot until then), because the rest is pure garbage."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"I have a complex attitude towards Robert Heinlein. I absolutely love his juvenile novels while I generally find his adult, more serious novels offputting. Heinlein's politics became increasingly marginal as he aged, becoming more and more of a sexist and a crank. But his juvenile novels contained virtually none of his political preoccupations and the stories are consistently delightful. I recently reread HAVE SPACESUIT WILL TRAVEL and have now reread CITIZEN OF THE GALAXY and found both of them completely delightful experiences. While I find Heinlein's politics and gender attitudes (at least of the mature Heinlein) repulsive, when he isn't on a soapbox I often love him. But even then I never know for sure until I read him. STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND is simultaneously one of the popular and critically reviled SF novels ever written (it is laced with serious literary errors and marks of bad writing, yet in the sixties it struck a common chord with many in the counterculture). On the other hand, I love THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS and even yarns like GLORY ROAD, despite its leering attitude towards women, is fun.What I like about Heinlein in contrast with Asimov and Clarke, the other two members of the Big Three writers of the late pulp era, is his narrative tone and his excellently rendered characters. If you read a novel by Asimov, you encounter some of the most poorly concocted characters imaginable. Clarke's novels have some spectacular ideas and marvelous metaphysical moments, but even his best characters are as cardboardish as can be conceived. You read Asimov and Clarke for ideas and not for the people, but Heinlein you can read for the characters.CITIZEN OF THE GALAXY is a fairy tale disguised as a SF novel. The roots lie in the countless fairy tale in which a prince is raised by peasants without anyone knowing his identity, especially the prince himself. In this one a young child named Thorby is bought by a beggar at a slave auction. Only the beggar isn't really a beggar and the slave boy isn't really a slave boy. On the one hand it is all terribly formulaic, but on the other it is all so magnificently well done that part of the joy in the reading comes from seeing Heinlein breath new life into the story. Seeing Thorby progress through his various adventures is delightful form beginning to end.Although these were intended for kids, I have always thought that they were as easily enjoyed by adults. Heck, for adults with problems with Heinlein's politics, these are fun for adults in ways that many of the others are not."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"This Is no doubt one of Heinlein's best. I have read the book thouroughly 3 times through and loved every second. If you read this book you'll find your hands glues to the cover and your eyes rusted open. If you don't read this, you don't know what your missin. Not one of the worlds best literary novels but sure is a good book."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"This book was very good for many reasons, one being, that Thorby(slave boy), is a very insteresting character, you dont know much about him until the very end. Another reason, Balsim(beggar), was also very interseting and very misterious, you also didnt know much about him until the end. There is just one thing that i dont like about this book, it was one of Heinleins childrens series books but i felt that when i read it(first time-17 years ago), that it was just too technical for a young kid to understand. But, all and all, it was a very good book and deserves a sequel."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"Without a doubt, this book helped shape my life as an adult. I first read this book as a young teen, and imagined myself in the roll of Thorby. As I grew I realized just how important a roll model and father Baslim was to Thorby. While taking Thorby into his life, by purchasing him as a slave, Baslim always treated him as a son. Teaching him right from wrong and impressing his values upon him. Baslim gave his life for his son and in doing so, set him free.Thorby was again adopted by the Captain of a free trader ship, the Sisu. While there he grew and matured, becoming part of another larger family. But a message that Thorby carried from his father, delivered to the Captain required that Thorby be delivered to the Hegemonic Guard. Baslim's hope is that they could identify Thorby and deliver him to his real family. Little known to anyone that Thorby is really the only survivor of one of Earth's richest most powerful families.When identified he is returned to Earth, only to find that he is more a slave there than he was as a child living with Baslim... Thor(by) now realizes that his own company is deeply involved in the slave trade and works undercover with the Guard to help distroy the slave trade, all the while becoming a slave to his company, power and wealth."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"RAH is grandmaster - no doubt for that. And Citizen of the Galaxy is one of his best (close circle - JOB, Number of the Beast, Strangeer in a Strange Land - hard to position those)...SF, espionage, adventure, sociology essay, thriller - you name it, it's everything."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"One of my favorite Heinlein books, Citizen of the Galaxy shows how Thorby searches for his place in society. The big problem is, the society he lives in keeps changing as he's uprooted from his mysterious apartment under the old ruins, through billets on two very different star ships, coming full circle to Rudbek on earth.Brings a tear to my eye every time I read about Thorby's search for his identity, his growth from boyhood to man's responsibilities.Perhaps Heinlein's best boy's book."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"If you have never read a Book by Robert A. Heinlein and have heard about him and want to try him out. Then this is the book I recommend you start with. IMHO this is his greatest book.I say this knowing that other people think that Starship Troopers is his best. But I do not think this is a great book to discover Heinlein by. In Starship Troopers he was making some blantant political statements, so people might be put off because of this. In Citizen of the Galaxy his messages are more subtle, without being obtuse.I first read it as a young teenager and the worlds it transported me to, still in thrall me.The main characters are typical Heinlein strong individualists, this is typical for both the males and females.I have reread this book many times and the rich texture of the prose always transports me from the smell at the slave markets. To the sizzling power in the board rooms on Earth.A must read, page turner."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"This is one of my favorite RAH books. It is the story of a young boy who looses everything, finds himself, rediscovers himself, and reinvents himself. A story of responsibility to self, family, community, and ultimately of responsibility to humanity. RAH tackles many of the big ones here - freedom, slavery, stewardship, and citizenship. I believe that everyone should read this book - especially 7th - 8th grade children. This story is a good counterpoint to much of the information and conditioning that our sponge-like children are getting from teachers, hollywood, and video games.Lloyd James, the narrator, does an excellent job of keeping the characters alive and the listener involved. The pacing is just right.I also agree with other reviewers in believing that this book would make an excellent movie - if it was left true to RAH's message."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"This is my favorite book of all time.

This book is never returned when I lend it out."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"Heinlein is an amazing writer, he literally changed my life. I learned to read because of him and now I teach reading! This story is one of my all time favorites, along with Glory Road, Farmer in the Sky, Farnham's Freehold and Red Planet.I've read the other reviews and the most important topics and story lines have been well covered. This was an AMAZING book when I read it as a child. I could place myself there with Baslim and Thorby in the plaza as beggars. I was with Thorby as a Free Trader on the ship as a member of the Family. I had a hard time being there when Thor took over the family business BUT still the story was wonderful, a place to escape to, where someone's life was so different. Heinlein makes it real, he covers details, he builds his characters so realistically they are living entities who become your friends and family.If you've read RAH you understand, if you haven't then take time and start reading his novels. You won't be sorry. The story is as much fantasy as science fiction, but the message it contains and the moral lessons it teaches make it one of Heinlein's most important and enjoyable novels."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"I love Heinlein's juvenile books (I call them his juvies). This is one of my top three favorites (along with \\"Podkayne of Mars\\" and \\"Tunnel in the Sky\\"). When I saw the larger paperback recently I was very excited, till I read into it a few pages. This edition has not only horrible typographic errors, but whole paragraphs are placed where they do not belong. If you are reading this for the first time, I would suggest you find an older edition on Amazon, via an independent seller. I've been reading this book for many years, since a young teen, and I don't recall ever seeing a single typo let alone one in almost every paragraph. I'm a grammar and spelling geek, I notice these things. The story itself is wonderful and well thought-out, moves along quickly and has some great surprises toward the end."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"One of the master's best work. I highly recommend it. It is a great 2-3 hour book with many commentaries on social evils as well as social &quot;norms.&quot"},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"This is Heinlein at his best: a science fiction novel that explores the meaning of freedom and responsibility both for individuals and for cultures. Many of Heinlein's best novels were written for a young audience, but with levels of subtlety for all ages. &quot;Citizen of the Galaxy&quot; does this through the story of Thorby, a young boy found in a slave market on a human planet that had long since split off from Earth.Without giving away too much of the plot, Thorby moves through four different cultures, in each case playing a very different role in society and becoming part of a different &quot;family.&quot; Thorby's dilemmas and decisions make this a proper text for any college ethics class. &quot;Citizen of the Galaxy&quot; was certainly an important influence in my adolescence."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"I've read this at least four times over the course of thepast 15 years. Every time, I think I see something new,understand a little more, and it gets better."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"Although less straightforwardly political as Starship Troopers, still Heinlein insinuates his ideology into every page. As his view is not one I take in many instances, his over-the-top rhetoric can get tiresome quickly.That being said, the book was a quick, fun read, and certainly transported me away from upstate New York for a little while. The author research and thoroughness shine throughout the novel, and his extrapolations (i.e. the Sargonese from Sanskrit transformation) are simply wonderful.One other complaint, however, Heinlein tries to do too much in such a short book. It's almost as if they are 3 novels in 1; which is fine for anthologies, but a little difficult to swallow in this setting.Overall, it was fun, but I doubt I'll re-read it."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"I've read an awful lot of science fiction over the years, including my share of Robert Heinlein. This book, which follows the life of a former child slave from the tutelage of a kindly \\"beggar\\" to the pinnacle of society, is pretty standard fare. Nothing really to distinguish it from hundreds of others. It is relatively short and moderately entertaining. You can buy it at an airport bookstore and consume it over the course of 4-5 hours in flight."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"This story starts really good. A slave-panhandler grows up on the streets on a very distant from earth world with his adopted-father-owner. The boy ends up on a spaceship where everyone is family. Both times, heinlein is exploring these different cultures. But, the book finishes with this attmpt to make the happy ending. Even, heinlein in the end, makes the ending messy. If you're a fan, include this book. If you're just starting pick up another story."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"I read a lot of books, about 2 a week and thsts just because I'm going to school right now and I have to spend conciderable amounts of time reading text books. But after starting to read this book I was so engrossed that I sat down and read it all in a day. It has a great story about a boy and his place in the universe."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"It was fun to read everything that happens to Thorby because he's seeing everything for the first time. There are basically 3 segments to the story. I think the best story was his time on Sisu, but you learn about the culture of the Family. But the ending was not so great. Believe it or not, the last 50 pages were about .... bureaucracy! That ruined a sense of mystique about the book, but it had a point since Thorby experienced life in different cultures. It was still weird, though."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"Heinlein wrote a number of juvenile novels, meant to appeal to the barely-teenager set. Citizen of the Galaxy is often listed as a juvenile by his fans (as is Starship Troopers occasionally), but I would not consider it so. The book's interest is not in its one-dimensional characters. The interest is sustained in the number of new social and political entities that Heinlein invents, all of which are plausible. The hero, Thorby, starts the book on a planet with three &quot;castes&quot; - the nobility, the poor but free non-nobles, and slaves (which is how Thorby starts out). He then moves into the Free Trader society where all members of a trade ship are related (in name, at least) and have both a military rank and a familial hierarchy that is painfully exclusive. Finally, Thorby ends up on Earth (&quot;Terra&quot;), which is not as well developed fictionally; it is revered as the birthplace of mankind with where day-to-day life similar to our own.Naturally, these societies are painted with Heinlein's broad brush. There are a number of things that make you scratch your head, especially since it was written in 1957. While there are strong female characters, including the leader of the Free Trader ship, there's still that underlying Heinlein chauvenism (&quot;You know women - they have no head for business&quot;). Perhaps these statements are tongue-in-cheek, but it doesn't sound like it. More disturbing is his pessimism about slavery - numerous times he mentions the &quot;inevitability&quot; of slavery - and his apparent glorification of tribalism (the Traders call themselves &quot;people&quot; and everyone else are untermenschen). His condemnation of slavery and glorification of racism are incompatible to a modern ear, but it is thought-provoking and brings the story out of its potential mundacity.Flashes of Heinlein's future are included as well - Thorby's lawyer on Terra is eerily similar to Jubal Harshaw of &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;. So, overall, I enjoyed the book. It was thought-provoking, interesting for its depiction of possible future civilisations, and you didn't know what was going to happen next so wanted to keep reading."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"Heinlein is one of my favourite authors, and I would certainly recommend this book to any one first reading him. It was a book I read as a teen-ager, re-read as a young adult and read again as I got older. It does what many of Heinlein's books do for you - they tansfer you to another place full of rich tapestries, worlds and people. You root for the character, feel sad for him and wish the best for him. After you read enough of his works, you see and hear many things that come from other books. Can be read alone, but serves as treats for loyal readers. Gret book by a great author."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"How many times have we heard this story? Boy is bought as slave, boy becomes beggar, boy loses mentor, boy honors mentors final wish and seeks out the people who will give him the skills to survive in a harsh uncaring galaxy a rather peculiar and heavily armed bunch called \\"the people\\".From that point on the book gets very interesting basically its about freedom and the choices we have in life, no one can decide your destiny you have to arrive at the conclusion on your own.While it is not Heinlein's absolute best it is not his absolute worst either. Te only thing that killed the book for me was the last 40 pages totally took away from the sprit of the book."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"I enjoy sci-fi books.

Here in &quot;Citizen of the Galaxy&quot; though there was enough interesting and plausible interaction that you could work your way through in the hopes that his preaching wouldn't get too loud. Not many female characters but I can't see that those there are particularly negative either. I read the first half, then stop when the slave gets his freedom, that is when the preaching begins in earnst."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"Heinlein's &quot;Citizen of the Galaxy&quot; made me consistetly uncomfortable because I could never quite rid myself of the impression that the author was advancing the idea of the government as a benevolent, motherly institution. The main character's time about the Sisu, a veritable space city of the clannish Free Traders, is an excellent chance for the author to preach: he justifies excessive nationalism by trying to differentiate narrow-mindedness from ignorance; Heinlein depicts personal conflict in terms of a machine component in need of an oiling; and tradition (&quot;no matter how pig-headed&quot;) is just the casing necessary to keep the parts from spilling; in several places Heinlein ridicules pacifism and admonishes that youth are best suited for war. The rest of the book provides further continual discourse on balancing the individual and the community. The Losians are a clear parody of communism. The character's time on the Hegemonic vessel is a spoof on bureaucracy. Heinlein's Engineers are in actuality lucid scientists - but try as they might arguing with Grandmother Sam, no one will pay attention to them.The under(over?)lying plot didn't really interest me except at the outset, where we find the child protagonist, Thorby, bought at a slaver's auction by an unseemly beggar, Buslim the Wise. Baslim happens to be more than he seems - he teaches Thorby various feats of memory, and how to be a proper, humane person. Baslim is also puzzled by Thorby's enigmatic parentage. The rest of the book details Thorby's journey to find his kin, picking up whatever lessons life teaches him on the way. Nevertheless, as a main character Thorby just isn't interesting. Despite having slaved for many different masters on several planets, he lacks an exotic psychological flavor. He also says &quot;uh...&quot; a great deal, and overall he is an archetypal teenager of the fifties.Similarly, despite being short on the science, the fictional aspect of this book hasn't aged gracefully: Heinlein's spaceships are just big battle cruisers, and his computers are simply big calculators.I'm not one to judge, but heed my words: this just doesn't seem the inspiring classic it is said to be. The lessons it offers are heavy-handed and questionable at best."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"I was very disappointed with this novel; my first foray into Heinlein. Heinlein's prose in Citizen of the Galaxy is atrocious. Massive uses of semicolons; just like I am doing in this review. Very annoying; I had to stop on page 55; also lots and lots of cliches; and the dialogue is sophomoric and clumsy, for someone used to reading Malamud and Updike. (For comparison purposes, though:Asimov's fiction prose: I like; Alan Edward Nourse's fiction prose for both juveniles and adults: I love)I am currently reading and immensely enjoying Grumbles from the Grave; so I know that Heinlein can write well.I will now try my hand at Starship Troopers; which according to Grumbles, Heinlein considered an adult novel in the guise of a juvenile fiction."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"I'm a HUGE fan of Heinlein. Despite my love for the author's writing, this book was not anything special. There are SO many clich&eacute;s that made me cringe and say &quot;Oh, GOD... I can't believe he's writing THAT!&quot; that it makes the book difficult to take seriously. He covers many, many topics in much, much better ways in his other books.If you're into Heinlein (or not), choose another book."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"If you have Kids or Grandkids, who think about politics & like \\"SF\\"; give them this book!It was One of the many Heinlein Works that helped ME grow up.It is the BEST & MOST IMPORTANT of his \\"for KIDS novels\\".I ment to give it 5 Stars!!!!!"},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"Citizen of the Galaxy is probably Heinlein's most mature juvenile novel and is certainly one of his most inspirational. It contains a sweeping indictment of slavery and provides a stirring message about citizenship and civic responsibility. Thorby is a slave; the only memories he has are a tangled morass of mistreatment spread among faceless men on nameless worlds; all he brings with him to Sargon are a filthy piece of clothing and an ugly assortment of scars and sores. On the block, no one values him enough to even bid on him, all except for the beggar Baslim. He takes him home (a hole beneath the abandoned amphitheatre) and raises him as a son rather than a slave. Thorby learns the art of begging from his new Pop and enjoys the happiest years of his life with him. Then Baslim, whom Thorby eventually learned was much more than a simple beggar, is arrested as a spy. Thorby satisfies his Pop's wishes by evading capture himself and taking a message to a certain ship's captain. Captain Krausa adopts Thorby as his own son and makes him a member of the Free Trader family on the ship Sisu. Here Thorby learns the complexities of Free Trader family life, makes real friends, and assumes a pivotal job protecting the huge spacecraft from raiders. Then Thorby is displaced once again, as Krausa takes him to the first ship of the Hegemonic Empire he comes in contact with. While Thorby hates to leave his new family, he does it to satisfy Baslim's ultimate wish for him to find his true family. Thorby soon learns that wealth does not make you rich as he strives to fight slavery in the galaxy and become the son his birth parents wanted him to beHeinlein gives us three strikingly different looks at family life. While Thorby is happy as a part of the immensely complicated Free Trader family on Sisu, he looks back at his days with the beggar Baslim as the happiest of his life. On the ship, one is barely acknowledged as existing if he/she is not a part of the family. The only person who talks to Thorby at first is an anthropologist, and she gives a poignant explanation of this type of society. The family is free, yet each individual in that family is in some way a slave; Thorby is told what to do and when and where to do it. The ultimate lesson is learned on Terra, where the prescripts of Baslim continue to guide Thorby's actions. He is determined to fight against the slave trade, which is something most Terrans don't even believe exists because it is taking place far, far away. For Thorby, it is personal and he devotes his life to fighting against it. The ultimate responsibility he learns is to fully devote himself to the noble cause, to be willing to give us his own freedom, even to become a beggar as Baslim did, in order to work for the freedom of others. The story is as much fantasy as science fiction, but the message it contains and the moral lessons it teaches make it one of Heinlein's most important and enjoyable novels."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"I've only read a few books by Heinlein, but the more of his stories I read the more I see two trends. First, he likes to take an idea, and then run with it through every possible effect and ramification it could have. Secondly, he seems to (unless I miss my guess) be writing his adventure stories from the dual perspective of himself as a youth, and himself as an older world-weary traveler (in his own eyes anyway). Reading this book I got the same feeling from Starship Troopers and Tunnel in the sky, that our protagonist is struggling to learn the essential life lessons that he will one day be in a position to hand down. But that's just Heinlein...In this story, our master of sci-fi take the idea of freedom to it's absolute philosophical limits. First, he shows us the world of a person who is an actual slave and has no rights whatsoever. Then, he takes that individual, and shoves them into situation after situation that leave us wondering what exactly freedom is. When Thorby is taught by his adoptive father how to think, he is freed mentally. When he is adopted by space-traders he is almost totally free in a physical sense (the traders travel all of space), but he finds himself enslaved to a way of life, a series of traditions, and many many rules. As part of the intergalactic space police force (or its equivalent), he finds himself fighting for freedom, yet again a slave to the ideals and way of life (and organization) behind it. The real kicker though, is when Thorby finds himself in a position of super-powerful financial might, with literally the world at his fingertips, yet enslaved to that power and all the responsibilities that it implies.Perhaps the real message of the story though, (to me anyway), is that freedom really is in the mind of the beholder, and helping others to overcome enslavements of a hateful, evil sort (like literal slavery) is a very good thing indeed. And no matter where you go, you will always be enslaved to something. So you'd better learn to survive, to be happy, and to make the most of what you have. And forget about the limits others try to impose upon you. A person with a mind that is free...is a Citizen of the Galaxy.Besides all the great philosophy and ideas that Heinlein is famous for is of course a great adventure that really captures the imagination. I love every Heinlein story I've read so far, for the characters, the slick dialog (especially for it's time), and the amazing universes he always manages to have up his sleeve. This book is DEFINITELY an enjoyable read for sci-fi fans."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"Personally, I believe this is the type of book we should have on the required reading lists at our schools - a book that is fun and fascinating to read, that introduces creative concepts about society, technology, and people...and a book that makes you think. It makes you think about the importance of freedom, about the slipperiness of the concept of freedom...about the choices that we make, and the choices that are made for us...about how people may have more to them than we suspect based on first impressions or based on their chosen profession. The first time I read the book, I was disappointed in the ending. In rereading it, I realized that Heinlein was showing one more aspect of freedom - and, in having his character give up what many people would consider an almost ideal life, in being rich with no responsibilities --- and choosing to take on the burden of those responsibilities...Heinlein was showing even more about the importance of values, of character, over superficial fun."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"Capsule Description: A young orphan with no memory of his past is sold as a slave, and becomes embroiled in more and more complex situations while travelling from world to world. One of Heinlein's &quot;Juveniles&quot;, possibly the best of that category, and a fun read.Review: Often described as a space-age version of &quot;Kim&quot;, Citizen of the Galaxy introduces us to the already world-weary and cynical, animalistically-paranoid Thorby, a boy of maybe ten years of age, who is being put on the auction block and sold. Through an odd sequence of events, the boy ends up being purchased by a beggar... who may be more than he appears. Subsequent events end up propelling him through the Galaxy as a number of things -- refugee, trader, military man -- while searching for the truth behind his unknown past.Heinlein wrote several &quot;juvenile&quot; books, ones targeted at what today would be called the Young Adult market (mostly teenagers), but despite the label his stories were always written in a mature manner that assumed his readers were as intelligent as he was. This is one of the very best of the juveniles, all of which were good SF reads. An excellent &quot;starter&quot; book for a young person who'd like to try some classic SF but is daunted by the prospect of either larger books or ones so old that the language itself becomes a barrier."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"This book rates as one of my favorite Heinlein books to be read and re-read. In it, a child made a slave is bought by an old beggar in the slave market. However, neither the child who has so far survived a harsh childhood nor the old beggar are what they seem to be to the other dwellers in the poverty area adjoining the space port. After Pop is executed, Thorby must get to a certain stranger with a message from Pop, plus a headful of messages he doesn't know he's carrying. This dumps him into a Free Trader culture totally different from what he knows and in another language on a starship. Eventually Thorby is sent off to go with the equivalent of space cops. Who Thorby really is and the &quot;warm&quot; reception from relatives he never dreamed of lead up to the climax of the book. Like other Heinlein books, the Grand Master sneaks in his view of humans, moral behavior, and doing the right thing for the right reason. Makes me wish that dear Mr. Heinlein were still alive and well enough for visitors. One learns something on a gut level in all of his books."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"I first read this book when I was 15, and ever since I have remembered it as one of the best books I had ever read. I recently moved and unpacked my copy. Curious, I reread it and found that the passing time has not dimmed it at all. I still believe it is one of the best books I have ever read. This breaks from the stereotypical pattern of Robert Heinlein and all science fiction. It covers such borad topics as racism, slavery, corporate corruption, and the people who are willing to sacrifice everything they have to change the world.The book opens at a slave auction,in a far away galaxy, where a young boy is up for sale. It doesn't take long for the reader to get caught up in the many twists and turns this story takes. Not one of the characters in this book is who he first appears to be. Thorby (the boy for sale) is bought by an old, crippled beggar man and ends up travelling throughout the universe. His observations on life are truly insightful. This may just change the way you see the world around you."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"Between 1947 and 1959 Robert Heinlein wrote a series of outstanding juvenile science fiction novels, including Rocket Ship Galileo (filmed as Destination Moon in 1950), Space Cadet (which spawned the Tom Corbett TV series), Starship Troopers (basis for the 1997 movie), Starman Jones, and several others. They were all written with respect for real science, in a style that appealed to adult readers as much as teens, with reasonably advanced vocabulary and character development.One of Heinlein's classic \\"juvenile\\" novels in the tradition of Kipling, Dickens, and Stevenson, Citizen of the Galaxy traces the adventures of an apparently orphaned earth boy, Thorby, enslaved on an alien world; his upbringing by Baslim the crippled beggar; his young adult life among the space traders in their unique culture.To some extent the character relationships, and to a lesser extent the plot, parallel Kipling's KIM. When I first saw Anakin Skywalker in Star Wars Episode One: The Phantom Menace, I was immediately reminded of Thorby and his predicaments."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"This book is the epitome of Heinlein's adventure novels. It reminds we humans that we are not truly civilized beings. He points out clearly that slavery is one of the most awful things we can entrap our fellow beings in, and also points out that there are more types of slavery than actual enslavement. Humans can be trapped by family, friends, work, and, as Heinlein shows near the end of this novel, by money. Humans do not have never known any true freedom, even though we tend to feel that capitalism or socialism are ways for us to achieve freedom. Heinlein points out that none of these systems will make us free. I also really enjoy the fact that Thorby never really cares about his past; he only wants to live in the now, the way humans should. This is an easy book to read even though its plot is like some sort of roller-coaster. Even though somewhat deep ideas are expressed in this book, I think it would be best suited for teenage readers."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"This is undoubtedly one of Heinlein's finest 'juvenile' novels (and anyone who thinks there were no female characters in it must not have read more than 10% of it).I usually list _Tunnel in the Sky_ as my favorite of Heinlein's young-adult novels of the 1950s, and I still think it belongs at the top of the list. But this one is very close.As I'm sure you know already, it's the tale of a young fellow named Thorby, a slave on the planet Sargon who comes under the protection of one Baslim the Cripple. A sort of outer-space version of Kipling's _Kim_, the novel traces Thorby's life and development through several changes of venue -- and ends on Earth, where Thorby finds out who he really is and takes on some heavy, adult-sized responsibilities.It's a very well handled coming-of-age novel, and it expresses Heinlein's own remarkable take on maturity very nearly as well as _Tunnel_ (in some ways arguably better). And like _Tunnel_, it devotes _just a little_ space, toward the end, to preaching against straw men. (Here, it's a couple of custard-headed pacifists whose sole literary function is to mouth inane slogans that Heinlein wants to show up as irresponsible nonsense. There was _loads_ of such stuff in _Starship Troopers_ but in this one it's kept to a minimum.)It also shares part of its 'skeleton' with _Stranger in a Strange Land_ (on which Heinlein was also working at about the same time, still under its provisional title 'A Martian Named Smith'). Why, there's even a climactic courtroom battle, with Thorby represented by a crusty lawyer not terribly unlike Jubal Harshaw. (In general lawyers don't come off well in Heinlein's novels; in the final analysis the sharklike Garsch is no exception, although Harshaw fares somewhat better.)At any rate, the anthropological insights come fast and furious here (aided in part by a character who may remind you of Margaret Mead). One nice touch is revealed in Thorby's time with the Traders; like every other people in history, they call themselves 'the People' and everybody else subhuman ('fraki').No s-e-x, though. At this time Heinlein was still publishing under the watchful eye of Alice Dalgliesh and Thorby's interactions with the opposite camp are as chaste as melting snow.I credit Heinlein with three absolutely magisterial works -- _The Moon is a Harsh Mistress_, _Double Star_, and _The Door into Summer_. This one belongs to the second tier of near-magisterial material, well worth reading and rereading despite a few warts."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"Thorby's beginings are shrouded in mystery, lost somewhere on the long road seared into him by many masters, and many lashes. He knows only that he is about to be brought to yet another problem in a long road of problems, as he is on the slavers selling block once again. An old beggar takes notice of him, and since no one else wants to bid on the beaten and bedraggled youth, the price is [reasonable] enough that even a beggar can purchace him.This is a change in his fourtune which will take him on a long road of knowledge and a raise in status. His new master adopts him as a son, and does his best to care for him. Thorby learns the trade of a beggar, and runs errands for 'pop' who isn't quite like other beggars.....teaching Thorby to speak and read in several languages, advanced mathmetics, basic history, and what morals can be passed on while living as a poor beggar.Until pop's death, at which time he delivers a message to a ship in port which Baslim the Cripple has instructed him to do in case of his death. He is adopted by this ship's family, and becomes on of them...a tribe of people, proud of thier heritage and elitist freedom. But, once again he must loose all which has become dear to him and move on to another fate, to find his true heritage.Many lessons are contained within Citizen of the Galaxy. Learning to become one with the culture you are in, what 'family' can mean, learning to fight for what is right, and finally, learning that fighting for what is right may not nessicarily be on the front lines in the battle against slavery, but can be far away, buried in legal mazes of businesses who's leaders may not be aware of what evils are burried in the depths of thier empire.Now, in our current age of a battle against terrorism, this lesson is espically apparent. The evils which lurk across the globe can have connections to us at home, through finantial ties, and levels upon hiden levels of business fronts and drug cartels. All levels, from executive office to the streets to forign lands must have those who are vigilant against a threat."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"This is my favorite Heinlein juvenile novel. Through the experiences of Thorby's life Heinlein defines slavery. Another reviewer complained that Thorby was too passive as a character, but after all, a slave would be more likely to be passive than someone who had never lost his freedom.Reading this as a Christian, I noticed how it started with a strong redemptive theme with Thorby's purchase by a good master who treats him as a son, but the story has a very ironic ending making the reader question the whole nature of slavery. This thought provoking novel is one of Heinlein's best. (From what I've read Heinlein's juvenile fiction has fewer objectionable elements and tighter plots than his adult fiction.) For another sci-fi story on the nature of freedom read The Giver by Lois Lowry."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"It has been many years since I last read this book, but I am still reminded of it from time to time. Heinlein writes in such a way that you can really immerse yourself in the story and count the journey as one of your own. I loved it. The only complaint that I have is that it could have gone into more depth about each stage of Thorby's life."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"I read this book because an ancient, hardback copy was in my local library.What's to love about this book? The possibility that there might actually be people in the world like the character Baslim the Cripple, people who care that much about the freedom of others, when the others would consider it no disgrace if he just walked (or limped) away. A vision of humankind's successful entrance into the Galaxy. A recognition that with said entrance, there are bad guys out there who would take your freedom, and that being good just isn't enough to be free, you have to be strong and agile. Being good isn't enough to be free, you have to do the job handed to you if you really want to be free. Paradoxical, ain't it?What's not to love about this book? I found it to be like four little stories, as opposed to one story. Thorby's time on Jubblepore would be one story, his time with the Sisu would be another, etc. I wanted to hear more about why the Sisu were in such a debt to Baslim. I wanted Thorby and Leda to marry at the end, but that was a minor detail. I want there to be a sequel called Project Porcupine.But all in all, I was still highly entertained and encouraged, and would consider it a worthy investment of the time I spent reading it. This is Heinlein that kids could and should read. Children readily grasp the evil of slavery, and this presents the issue from another angle."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"I have enjoyed this book quite a bit. Specially the relationship between the boy and the beggar. I absolutely love the feel of old science fiction. The ending was not what I expected but it has to end at some point.I have no problems recommending this book."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"This is not only the best sci-fi novel written for \\"juveniles\\", but one of the best in the entire genre. The hero, Thorby, is a social outcast who has to stay on the move; Heinlein uses this is an opportunity to portray 4 different societies ( a decadent monarchy, a clan of migrants in space, an ideal military unit, and Earth). Thorby is able to judge each from outside. He has a mentor in each case (Baslim the Beggar, a sociologist, the military commander, an heiress) but they are of decreasing importance as Thorby matures and is able to make decisions for himself.The book has Heinlein's usual obsessions about weapons and vigilantism, but here they are put in a context where they fit, a war against slave-traders. You even cheer for Thorby when he shocks some sheltered millionaires by saying that \\"The proudest thing I ever did was kill a slaver\\".My main complaint is that the last of the four sections is rather anti-climactic. All this stuff going on in the galaxy, yet Earth is basically twentieth-century Earth. The plot involves a corrupt CEO, heroic lawyer, an heiress who develops a social conscience -- it's dramatic enough in itself, but wouldn't society have changed somehow over the centuries? There's not even noticable changes in technology. But by that time you already know that you have read a sci-fi masterpiece."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"In a distant galaxy where slavery is still alive and well young Thorby, just another orphaned boy, is sold at auction. But his new owner, Baslim, is not the disabled beggar he appears to be. Adopting Thorby as his son, Baslim fights relentlessly as an abolitionist spy. When the authorities shorten Baslim, Thorby must ride with galatic Free Traders, a league of merchant princes, throughout the worlds of a hostile galaxy. But Thorby's destiny changes forever when he discovers the truth about his own identity.Citizen of the Galaxy is a great book. I enjoyed the different phases of Thorby's journey has he discovers his origins. Heinlein is an excellent writer. He really draws you into the story with amazing imagery and character development."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"The ending of this book is so different from the beginning! You couldn't even begin to imagine what might await at the end of the book when you're reading the first chapter about Basilim the Cripple's acquisition of a slave. This book talks a lot about slavery, community, and freedom. The conversations that Thorby has with his various mentors - Basilim and the People - are thought-provoking and interesting. While not quite as good as the World as Myth series, this book is still a definite solid read, and is a must for any Heinlein enthusiast."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"In a slavery auction a young boy is offered for sale. He has no manners, he has been slave for all of his life and has whip scars to remind him of his previous masters. At first possible chance, the boy has already decided, he will escape. None of the nobility caste is willing to make offers for this rugged boy. At outskirts, an old beggar makes ridiculously small offer and the boy gets finally sold. The beggar takes the boy under his wings and educates him little by little. But the boy starts to see that the beggar is not quite what meets the eye. But he doesn't yet comprehend the connections and the complexity of events involved.Meet Thorby (the slave boy), Balsim (the beggar who adopted the boy), the Space Traders clan empire which will be the boy's next escape route after Balsim's violent death and the Space Guard where he learn military code and Terra, where his roots are finally revealed.It is said that this book is one of the Heinlein's early (1957) juvenile books. The story is a conventional adventure in space where boy has no control of his destiny. Things happen, he is forced to follow path shown in front of him; escape from one situation to another (one 3-star reviewer didn't like him depicted as pinball bouncing in the Galaxy). We follow how young boy becomes a man, we follow how he clashes from one culture to another. He needs to unlearn old ways and replace them with another system. The Space Traders depict wonderful example of matriarchal domination, where each space ship is its own clan: clans', the ships', heads are all woman. At the same time Heinlein binds the adventure to bigger issues like debating slavery; is it inevitable, is strict trader code form of slavery in disguise, is it possible to decide yourself to break into freedom and take control of your own life? There also topics like individuality, community, role models and their strong influence at early age.Five (5) stars. No doubt this book is for juveniles, language is no master literature, women are fairly typical and in supporting roles. Characters are what you would expect for juvenile novel (thin), space ships are big atom kilns and weapon systems simply big calculators; but it all works. The story flows, the anthropologist societies are varied, the rightness of the mission feels good, the growth pain of this young man is present. The ending in a little flat but it hits the coming-of-age cycle just at right moment. Anyone would have loved to read the sequel (which never appeared)."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"I've loaned my copy to a number of people who don't normally read much science fiction and every one of them has loved this book. There is so much going on it is really just an incredible work of fiction, timeless due to the great writing and issues explored. This is one solid and extremely accessible example of why RAH is one of the best ever."},{"Title":"Citizen of the Galaxy","review":"\\"Citizen of the Galaxy\\" is a good to very good read, but the plot twists are sharp. As the book starts, Thorby is a slave. Heinlein does a very good job of giving us a world that appears to be Arabic. Baslim the Beggar is a particularly interesting character. However, when the time comes to move on in Thorby's story, the author uses a couple of very sharp changes in the plot. If the reader is a total stranger to Heinlein's writing, this is disturbing.In turn, the Free Trader part of the story is another fascinating depiction of a different culture, with some interesting characters. Next comes the Hegemonic Guard portion of the story, which always seems, to me, to need more padding. However, the author wants to move along quickly.Finally, Thorby reaches Earth and finds an interesting way of becoming an adult as Thor, the name with which he was born. Again, Heinlein writes an interesting, adventurous, story with details of a sort of confidence game played on Thor. For me, the ending is satisfactory enough. However, after reading it, I always find myself wondering what a sequel might have been like.On the whole, the book is very good reading. However, the sharp turns and twists of the plot and a slightly week third part are regretable.I recommend this book."},{"Title":"How to win a Pullet Surprise: The pleasures and pitfalls of our language","review":"Lovers of humor and of the English language will love this book by the late Los Angeles Times columnist Jack Clifford Smith.

This translation was used by the Royal National Theatre in London for the recent &quot;revival&quot; of the play, which eventually came to New York and starred Kathleen Turner and British newcomer Jude Law. Cocteau adapted this play for a french film version several years after it closed. Not for those looking for &quot;light entertainment;&quot; some may be disturbed by the oedipal themes which Cocteau explored in this work, but definitely satisfying for those looking for &quot;different&quot; or &quot;thought-provoking&quot; theatre (or the &quot;just strange&quot; style for that matter)."},{"Title":"In The Box Called Pleasure","review":"Kim Addonizio is known for her poetry, which is raw in emotion, sensual, and sexual. This collection of 22 stories, her first collection, very much fits in her literary world. None of the stories are very long, in fact a few would be termed 'flash-fiction', but all are well-written and deal with sex to some degree or another, though none are graphic enough to call these stories pornographic. The stories that stick out the most are those that deal with troubled women and their self-destructiveness (which I suppose is just about every story). But before you assume that all is grim, there are stories (such as \\"A Brief History of Condoms\\") that successfully use humor. Might even make you laugh out loud. I am a huge fan of Addonizio's poetry, so it makes me happy to say that as a fiction writer she is pretty good. I look forward to reading more stories (and novels if she chooses to write them) from her."},{"Title":"In The Box Called Pleasure","review":"Edgy, sexy, imaginative, sometimes fun, her fiction is difficult to put down.I was familiar with her poetry.

That's a while I have read a lot.

A good read"},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"This has long been one of my favorite Clarke books. Actually, I think it may have been his last great book.

Clarke did a good job keeping my attention even through the technical parts. The imagery was vivid and the story compelling."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"Arthur C Clarke is, with Isaac Asimov and a couple of others, a fatherly figure for Science Fiction enthusiasts. Although I had already read some of his short stories, each of which had left me in awe, I had amazingly never read any of his novels. This omission is now repaired and boy, did it make me regret having waited for so long. Because Rendezvous with Rama is a masterpiece. It deserves every award it earned, the most prestigious ones being the Hugo and the Nebula in 1973 and 1974, respectively.The setting is simple: A cylindrical vessel, coming from the depth of space is entering the solar system and an expedition party is mounted to make contact with what clearly constitutes the first proof of an alien civilisation's existence. The book follows the exploration of the ship and the discoveries of the party. At several times in the book, Clarke draws a parallel between the events and the archaeological exploration of Tutankhamen's tomb. Nothing could more adequately describe the nature and tone of the story than this parallel. As such, the book may be a bit slow and uneventful for some. Well, maybe not uneventful because a lot is actually happening. But the events are mostly not of a thrilling, adventurous type. This is essentially a \\"quiet\\" story. However, when it comes to describing an alien world, I know of no other author that can mesmerize like Clarke. His talent for unravelling clue after hint is unsurpassed.Rendezvous with Rama is not a linear monolithic bloc either. Clarke gives a lot of attention to the diplomatic consequences of the exploration, providing a welcome change of perspective on a regular basis.While there is a no denying that this novel is extraordinary, it may not be for everyone. I've already written about the scarcity of action. It's also important to know that this is one of the \\"hardest\\" science-fiction books ever published. Clarke is a great science populariser, so the concepts he uses are never hard to grasp, but one must be willing to ponder the subtleties of gravity, meteorology and other scientific subjects to truly enjoy it. Also, Clarke has often been criticized for his shallow characterization and it is not an entirely unfair judgement.Nevertheless, I've never felt that the book needed more action, deeper characterization and/or less science. Rama itself is the main character and it is complex and interesting enough to not necessitate such things.One last word of warning about the ending (don't worry; I'm not going to spoil it for you). Many readers have expressed their disappointment with it, but once you get there, ask yourself if there would have been a more logical conclusion, one that would have better fitted all the developments that preceded it as well as Mr Clarke's dedication to plausibility. It is my belief that there isn't."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"This is not a character driven story so if that's what you're into, look elsewhere. It mostly explores ideas about what would be required for long-term space exploration.

This book is so beautifully descriptive that you feel as if you're actually on the ship with the astronauts. While the later 3 books were just as much focused on characters as scene description, this one sets out simply to describe the marvellous spectacle of the Rama spacecraft. It really does end up seeming like an introduction to the next three books though, which is odd considering that Clarke had never planned to write a sequal at all! Anyway, I reccomend this highly, along with the rest of the series."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"This is the first Clarke's book I've ever read,but I'm sure that I will read all the other ones because I've found the most pregnant example of what SF should be.Great,involving,absolutely to read"},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"This first book in the Rama series was a great page turner, From first to last chapter, Arthur C.

And, coming from a writer like Arthur.C. Clarke, of such distinction and maybe even legend, with his intelligence and adventurous imagination, I expected an edge-of-my-seat story to live up to the promise of the general plot. But it didn't...yes, he successfully concieved of a WONDERFUL and unusual premise..of a deserted multidirectional, jigsaw puzzle world on a spacecraft, and humans making contact with it. It sounds like something you can't put down...but to my disappointment, this book turned out to be not only NOT a page turner, but a tedious read, and by the end, I frankly couldn't care less as to the fate of Rama or the space faring characters, and that can't be a good sign. I feel too much time was spent going into fictional technicalities, like how the doctor investigating the world conducted experiments. The best of his work in this story, I think, is his believable space committee that all work..or fight..together to come to grips with the unexpected visitor of Rama. I prefer stories with a broader sweep, that have more..suspense involved, whereas, here, the more I read, the more mundanely did the autor seem to treat his world. Not enough drama! I allowed also for another disappointment..I hope that certain narrow minded or outdated views of women and society expressed in the book were simply the author's attempt to show a plausibly ignorant human society that did not change with the technology,..and not a reflection of the author's own views. Thus, if I had the option, I would rate this book with 1 1/2 stars, to account for a few grea moments in the story - mainly, the very beginning. I'm sorry to say that, if you want to read and enjoy Arthur C Clarke, I would NOT start with this book, as it is the most tedious sci fi read I've had yet,and one shouldn't have to TRY to like the story.. and I have quite a library. I'd say Arthur.C. Clarke presents himself with more 'oomph' in the '2001' Space Odyssey series. Rendezvous with Rama..I will be haunted, not by the story itself, but the lack of fertile philisophical areas that could have been explored, a plot allowing for amazing and unusual fictitious territory..that didn't make the most of his premise. A great writer..a not so great book. God love him, but - Thumbs Down."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"In the immortal words of Shania Twain- \\"that don't impress me much\\". I first read Clarke's \\"2001\\" when I was maybe 12 years old and it just blew me away. I read that book many times. However, I never was motivated to read any other Clarke books. Recently I stumbled upon an Amazon \\"end of the world\\" book list and saw \\"Childhood's End\\" (CE) on the list (along with classics like \\"Earth Abides\\", \\"Alas, Babylon\\", etc.). Anyhoo, I read CE and was quite moved. It was pretty awesome- the scope and the ideas. So then I moved on to \\"Rendezvous with Rama\\". All I can say about this one is that I felt none of the emotions that I experienced with CE. This is just a nuts and bolts story. There's really not anything in here that awes/terrifies/humbles me.If you like this kind of stuff, I suggest you read Frank Tipler's \\"The Physics of Immortality\\". That book has some ideas that will REALLY boggle your mind."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"Perhaps it's because I never did care much for sci-fi but I found this book rather confusing and boring. I gave up reading this about one-quarter into the book as I felt the plot took much too long to unfold and it barely retained my interest. Perhaps it might appeal to sci-fi lovers... I'm not too sure..."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"How this book won the Hugo and Nebula is beyond me. The story itself is a little over 250 pages. I read roughly half of the book before giving up and closing it. Simply put, a bunch of astronauts reach Rama, an alien ship. They penetrate the haul, go up and down a steep ladder, and gradually get deeper into the ship. Only, there are no Ramans. The ship is abandoned, it would seem. Why this book fails is due to Clark's overt use of natural sciences to describe the ship. This story lacks any involvement with the characters, with the exception of the captain and the Rama Committee. By sacrificing narration and character development for technical description, Clark has essentially created an uninteresting story, void of any sympathy for the characters, and severely lacking in any riveting scenes.If this minimalistic technical science fiction is for you, by all means, read it. For the rest of us, this is a timewaster. The author has a job to do, and that's to keep the reader entertained. Not the case here.What happened to my copy? I left it sitting on a bookshelf somewhere at a hotel in the Carrabean, waiting for another victim.

What do they find out about the aliens? NOTHING! They go gliding and come face to face with a gigantic electric engine that zapps their gliders from the sky! Then they run off realizing that the cylinder is leaving the solar system! Oh no it's now a race to get off the space ship! AHHHHHH ! LAME! LAME! LAME! And on top of that the characters are one dimensional and boring. If you want a great sci fi book read A mote in gods eye. I really wanted to read this book and was disappointed at clark's lame attempt at writing. I guess a lot of readers like reading boring stuff. I pity people who gave this book 4 or 5 stars.

More tiring than &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; by Emily Bronte, and more long-winded than Hawthorne's &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot;, this book had little to please. The characters were shallow and undeveloped, and the storyline jumped erratically from one situation to another, without giving any explanation. Futhermore, the actual settings were undeveloped and lacking.If you are looking for entertaining, well-written or profound literature, look elsewhere. This material simply does not live up to timeless Sci-Fi classics such as Orwell's &quot;1984&quot;, or Heinlein's &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;... stay away from this unless you are some kind of boredom masochist."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"I must say I was excited to read this book seeing all the awards and praise it has received. However, I found this to be the most boring, uneventful book I have read in years. I kept thinking it HAS to get better, something HAS to happen, but it just doesn't... It's like a 300 page description of paint drying - only \\"in threes.\\" Even the ending was basically another big non-event. NOTHING!! I can't possibly recommend this book.

It's not worth the trouble."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"You would expect that a science fiction writer writing about future would spend time to know some of the basic technology of today. Mr. Clarke seems to write about future as if technology of the first half of the 20th century is yet to happen in the future. Furthermore he displays a profound lack of understanding of general principles of science. Blend that with general lack of imagination and you make for an utter waste of time which is how rate the time I spent reading the Rama series.

There's no option to request this be done in kindle form, either..as though Kindle isn't good enough.I'd like to comment on the actual story, but I suppose I'll have to wait till the powers to be decide to allow it. Yes, I'll rate it...with one star.. to bring this shameful oversight to the attention of the publishers."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"I like most of Clark's other work and gave this a try. It was a solid choice and I finished it pretty quickly which indicates that I really liked it. The characters are not the most interesting people in the universe, but the Rama object and mystery surrounding it were very gripping and had me anticipating each new adventure with plenty of enthusiasm. Clark describes Rama perfectly and I could actually see the images he was describing. Very well done and highly recommended!"},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"I was hesitant at first to read a book written by someone as intelligent as Arthur C. Clarke. I heard about this book because it is being developed into a movie. I thought it would be filled with boring technical information, but was pleasantly suprised by it. It was written in very &quot;down to earth&quot; language. If you have any interest in astronomy you will be fascinated by the interesting facts he drops left and right throughout the book. Enough of my babbling, bottom line: this is a very imaginative book about another world designed by aliens, fantastic reading, truly visionary!"},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"I love A.C. Clarke's work. This book is one of the main reasons I like him so much. &quot;A Meeting with Medusa&quot; is my favorite work of SF and it is written by Clarke, as well. I see the same great mind shining in the pages of &quot;Rama&quot;.It is an artificial world(a cylinder, actually) so full of mysteries that when you finish the book you have more questions than answers. However, you realize that this makes this book even more attractive. (Unfortunately A.C. Clarke didn't agree and went on to write three more Rama books which I bought out of respect for him and was very very disappointed)Rama, as in many other Clarke works, questions the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence, its form and the first contact with it. The nicest thing it does is put the question in your mind, as well: What would happen if an alien artifact came out of nowhere today? How would we react?This book offers an answer. It also opens (as all great SF works do) a new horizon to feast your eyes on. A world shrouded in mystery full of mechanical and other types of creatures. Yes, the characters are lost a bit among all those descriptions, but who cares? As another reviewer observed correctly, the astronauts are just side players here. Rama gets the starring role as it should. (In the later novels, unfortunately human and other characters step in front and Clarke makes a futile attempt to clarify the mysteries of Rama and he fails miserably, very unlike him)I really wouldn't recommend any of the other 3 books in this series, but &quot;Rendezvous with Rama&quot; is one of the best books A.C. Clarke has written."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"While I love this book on its own, I don't like it as part of the supposedly four-book series (Rendevous with Rama, Rama II, Garden of Rama, Rama Revealed). This one has almost nothing to do with the next three -- they are their own trilogy.Personally, after reading them all one time, from that point on I have only re-read the last three. I don't like this one as much as the trilogy, might be the characters or simply the wider subject area.IMHO, If you are looking for a quick, hard core sf read, try this one on its own and ignore the sequels for the moment. If you want to read hard core sf for the long haul (three large books), read only the sequel trilogy -- they stand on their own just fine."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"Michael Crichton could have written this novel.... Relative to most of Clarke's other works, the charaters are 1-dimensional. However, this does not detract from the overall enjoyment. This is the most plausible version of a first contact that I've ever read. It keeps you on the edge of your seat: Are there natives aboard? Is this a robot ship? Is it going to stop in the solar system or keep going? These questions lead to others, and the book keeps its hooks in you until about 2000 pages later you've finished the 4th book in the series. This is by far the best because it's the simplest. It's a great story of discovery. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"Superior intelligence and imagination in creating a fiction which relates to human curiosity! In depth and alive characteristics, and a vague scent of mysticism devours our sensation, expectation and reliefe in the sense of experience when reading. If one lets the imagination travel along, a possible future in co-existence with E.T. lifeforms sends chills down ones back! Purely enchilling reading! The plot is timeless, and suggests a possible prophetic truth! Indeed and enchilling reading!"},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"Astronomers detect a large object entering the Solar system from deep space. At first it is thought to be just another large rock, but scientists soon discover that it is actually a colossal space ship called Rama. A team of scientists blast off from Earth to investigate in a ship called the Endeavor. What follows is a story of exploration, and one of the best conceived hard sci-fi tales ever written. Who built Rama? What is it's purpose? Why did it come to our solar system? The story follows the progress of the astronauts/scientists in the not too distant future as they methodically explore the unknown space ship. Each new discovery brings new surprises as well. This is also a political tale as well as factions on the ship and on Earth have very different ideas about what Rama is, what is represents, and what should be done.This book is, in my opinion, one of the most intelligent and well thought-out hard sci-fi novels ever written. First published in 1973, it remains as fresh as if it were written today. There are several things that I really like about this novel. First, the exploration of Rama by the crew of the Endeavor proceeds in an organized and intelligent manner by men and women who are not superhuman. Discoveries are assimilated, risks are weighed, and the plan evolves. One common problem with this sub-genre of sci-fi (particularly when transfered to TV) is that individuals of superhuman stature (e.g. the main character has a Ph.D. in astrophysics, was in the Special Forces, a fighter pilot, and in their spare time a classically trained French chef, a lyric poet, and fluent in ten languages) go off on their own to make brilliant discoveries while narrowly avoiding death. This may add drama to the plot, but this cheapens the story and moves the entire story from believable to fantastic. The characters, while perhaps representing some of the best and brightest of humanity, are not absurdly talented beyond reason. Second, Rama itself is fascinating. Clarke constructed a rich world for his intrepid adventures to explore. Finally, there is a sense of wonder or awe associated with the exploration of Rama that many have tried to duplicate, but none have even come remotely close to succeeding. This book has \`atmosphere'. Early in the novel Clarke analogizes the exploration of Rama with the opening of Tutankhamen's tomb. There is something wonderful and mysterious about Rama that goes far beyond current human understanding, but understandable by humans nonetheless by scientific analysis and reflection. It is this last aspect that really makes this novel better than 2001. In the latter novel, the aliens are so advanced that they are utterly incomprehensible. In Rama, the alien technology can be understood by homo sapiens.If I had any complaint at all, the novel is a bit short by modern standards. It really seems light at about 240 pages, and it would have been nice if Clarke had further developed several of the story lines. In any case, this is a book that can be read over and over again. There are VERY few books that I read a second time, but this has been one of them. In the end, there are more questions than answers, and many of the questions are not resolved. I have not read any of the sequels because I heard they are really bad and I don't want to spoil this novel. This is one of the novels that put Clarke into the great three of sci-fi (with Heinlein and Asimov), and it won both the Hugo and the Nebula award. This novel really defines and/or sets the standard for the sci-fi sub-genre of exploration/interstellar archaeology."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"I chose \\"Rendezvous With Rama\\" as one of the novels for my first Science Fiction class, specifically as an example of the \\"hard science\\" sub-genre of the field even though it is admittedly atypical. The story begins in the early 22nd century with the commonplace of Science Fiction literature where a celestial object enters our solar system and the people of Earth react with great excitement. But Arthur C. Clarke has already done a novel where aliens come to earth with \\"Childhood's End,\\" and this novel takes a decidedly different turn. The alien vessel, dubbed Rama because the pantheon of Greek and Roman mythological figures has been exhausted, is not coming to Earth. It is just wandering through our neck of the galaxy and the scientists of Earth are going to have one crack at visiting Rama and finding out what they can about the gigantic object before it leaves.Of course such a mission is hastily mounted and succeeds in not only reaching Rama but actually entering the immense interstellar spacecraft. However, \\"Rendezvous With Rama\\" keeps to its track of being an unconventional novel as humanity has its first encounter with alien intelligence. Perhaps the best measure of this novel would be the fact that I enjoyed it although I never took a high school science course above Life Through the Microscope, which effectively puts the realms of biology, chemistry, and physics beyond the scope of my understanding. Clarke succeeds in getting through a series of brief and basic science lessons that allow me to keep up with what is happening. Of course this is helped by the fact that the Earth scientists aboard Rama are constantly talking about the possible meanings and implications of everything they are encountering or see off in the distance inside Rama.Actually, I like this 1973 novel more when it stands by itself rather than as the opening volume in the four-part Rama series. The other three books were co-written by Clarke with Gentry Lee and essentially they answer the questions raised by \\"Rendezvous With Rama.\\" However, I liked the way this novel ended, with the explorers convinced the glass was half empty at best because of their inability to understand everything they found inside Rama. Part of that appeal is the reality of it, that unlike the vast majority of Science Fiction novels and movies there was not a point where someone conveniently popped up and explained everything to our collective satisfaction. This novel is about trying to look at an alien world through alien eyes, and the effort is as important as the achievements. Granted, this type of Science Fiction will not appeal to everyone, but as an introduction to the use of \\"hard science\\" in the genre this is an excellent choice."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"When I first read Rama many years ago, what stunned me was the sheer scale of imagination that it represented. In fact, Clarke's strength has always been his imagination. Even today, reading the book for the umpteenth time, I have the same feeling. The degree to which Clarke describes Rama and at the same time explains just how complex interstellar travel could be is truly amazing. His description of Rama's interior (the Cylindrical Sea, the layout, the stairways, the biots) are so vivid and clear that one can picture the craft. The sheer scale of the project fills the reader with a sense of awe and wonder that remains all through the book. The story is simple : in short, an asteroid watch spots Rama, an object hurtling towards the solar system and then realizes it is no rocky planetoid but an artificial object made by intelligent beings. A ship is launched to intercept and possibly explore Rama. Their experience and interaction with Rama is the heart of the book. The context is one frequently favored by Clarke - that of humanity as near-children, stumbling (almost by error and perhaps a bit of extra-terrestrial design) on matters far greater than they can comprehend (2001 A Space Odyssey, Childhood's End). Humanity comes in \\"contact\\" (so to speak) with an advanced alien intelligence which it can barely begin to comprehend. And while humanity fears that it may be subject to domination, even tyranny, the sublime ending designed by Clarke is if anything even more telling. Without giving away the plot, I can only say that the final realization of our sheer insignificance in the scale of the Universe is pretty humbling. As always, Clarke's writing style is top drawer, filled with subtle humor and sly digs at ourselves. A must-read."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"I'll start by saying I KNOW there are additional books in this series, but I still think EVERY good book needs a solid ending whether or not it is part of a trilogy. This ending was just like... \\"that's it?!\\" The baseline story was quite interesting, but I found there was almost no conflict or climax in the whole book. At every page I kept expecting something exciting to happen... some hidden danger or a plot twist. Nope, not really. It was more like reading a scientific report on the crew's exploration of this alien world (fascinating but ultimately boring). The book taunts you with a few things that make you long for some dramatic culmination (like if Rama is there to take over earth or some other sinister agenda), yet it just fails to deliver. I think back to H.G. Wells stories like, \\"First Men in the Moon\\" and I couldn't put them down, as there was tension and frustration and danger and you really weren't sure how the story would end. Rama... not so much. Just page after page of data followed by a completely lackluster ending.Gotta say, I was pretty disappointed and won't both bother reading the other books in the series."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"Arthur C Clarke is generally considered to be one of the greatest Science Fiction writers, with several works defining what is called hard science-fiction. Unlike mainstream, or soft, sci-fi, this genre eschews the wildly fantastic (Star Wars, Star Trek, Warhammer 40K) for a more practical view of the future based on scientific concepts available to us. It deals more with possibility and probability than overwhelming imagination.Clarke's most famous works are probably 2001 and 2010, thanks in large part to the movie adaptations, which is why I didn't want to read them. The movies struck me as psychedelic freak outs, which wasn't what I was looking for. Rendezvous with Rama is still a well received, highly acclaimed work that I thought would be a good place for me to start reading Clarke's works.The basic concepts behind the plot are what you would expect: solid, practical and based on real astrophysical science. Having never read this style of sci-fi before, I found it a little refreshing. The technology used by humans in Clarke's future world of a 150 years from when he wrote it, or 100 from now, doesn't seem far fetched. The characters are cautious, methodical and very real instead of being over dramatic archetypes. Through out the narrative the author sticks to the prevailing rules of astrophysics of the time, which then doesn't require the reader to suspend their disbelieve too much, but doesn't make for a lot of excitement either.Beyond the fact based style, I also enjoyed the sense of mysterious adventure that the characters were going through. The craft Rama is completely alien to them, and isn't quick to give up its secrets. The crew of the spacecraft Endeavor are literally just along for the ride as the cylindrical ship/world of Rama goes about its business, completely unaware or uncaring of their presence. Because I think the author never intended to have the characters really know what was going on, I didn't expect a decisive moment when everything would be made clear. What Rama's purpose or function was remains a mystery for the reader to chew over.Pros:1.) Believable characters, believable backdrop, with some actual science to hold on to.2.) I felt a sense of wonder as the characters tried to piece together the secrets of Rama. Trying to instill a sense of discovery isn't easy to do and is sorely lacking in a lot of sci-fi writing. There are usually too many familiar knowns, while this book is all about the unknown.3.) Even though I usually hate open ended stories, I actually liked how the author left it up to the reader to try to piece together what Rama really is. I think I've come up with my own theory, but I bet there are a lot of very different ones.Cons:1.) As some reviews have pointed out, this book is a little nerdy. If you don't understand the basics of a few different scientific disciplines a lot of what is going on will either make no sense or will be static.2.) There aren't an big explosions, plots to destroy the universe or crazy mind-bending aliens in Rendezvous with Rama. Some people will find it boring or old fashion.3.) If you are a stickler for nice tidy endings, which I usually am, this book will make you nuts.Conclusion:I was really fascinated by how this book was so different from so many of the other Sci-Fi books I've read. On one hand its very simple, but on the other it is very complex. I enjoyed this quick read thoroughly but would warn the casual reader that it may not be the kind of mindless fluff they are used to."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"I decided to review a book I had just read that was one of the worst I have ever read from one of my favorite authors Poul Anderson. So I decided to rate the best I have ever read and the book that got me hooked on sify and reading in general. Rendevous with Rama. Then I saw the review in the five star column and was blown away. It was as if some one had took my thoughts. I almost felt raped. Here is what he wrote.\\"\\"\\"\\"In my youth, when I started reading SF, I was never a major devotee of Arthur C. Clarke; I was mostly into Heinlein and Asimov. But I read this one when it was first published (1973) and I liked it so well I kept the hardback for years and years.I'm not sure what finally happened to it, but at any rate I've just recently gotten around to replacing it. And the story is still as great a read as it was when it was new. I can't claim to have read everything Clarke ever wrote, but this is certainly the best of his works that I _have_ read.Other reviewers have pointed out, entirely correctly, that this isn't a book to read for character development. That's true of Clarke's books in general, I think, but it's especially apt here, where the 'star' of the book is an artifact of an alien civilization. In fact, even the 'star' doesn't get a lot of development, since in the end it remains deeply mysterious. (I don't know what happens in the sequels; I haven't read them and I haven't heard good things about them. I'm treating this as a standalone work.)But man, if you want to read a gripping, haunting story about the first human exploration of a space probe (or something) from an extraterrestrial civilization -- and if you want to watch the exploration process unfold and feel as though you're participating in the discovery yourself -- then this is a book for you. This is what Clarke does best: when you read a story through his eyes, you're looking outward at the objects of scientific investigation, and helping yourself to a chunk of the intellectual wonder and joy that goes with such investigation.The excitement here is the excitement of hard science, not of character development. If that's what you want, you'll probably love this book. \\"\\"\\"\\"Unlike that reviewer I continue to reread my replacement copy and other Clarke books over and over and the sequel to Rendezvous with Rama. It is easy to see why it won the Hugo award for best novel. It is every bit as good as Fountains of Paradise, Dune and a Mote in Gods Eye. But this is not Clarke's best work. That was \\"Nine Billion Names of God\\". A short story that was the first winner of the Hugo award in 1954."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"I believe it to be Clarke's best work to date, which tells a lot! There's a catch though. There's only one single real character in this book: Rama itself. Don't read it if you want to connect with the human characters, this is not a book about people, this is a book about the unknown."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"I Thoroughly enjoyed this novel. It is a little dated now, but Clarke's vision still shines through on every page."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"This is short, pitch perfect science fiction. Arthur C. Clarke's books are often concise and short on character development but based around a few innovative ideas. This book is a perfect manifestation of his writing style and a great example of what science fiction should be. The curiosity and suspense the reader will feel while the characters explore Rama is palpable. The visual and lucid description of a hemispheric world is astutely described in a way that absorbs the reader. The author has clearly researched all the repercussions of a cylindrical world that spins to provide gravity. What would oceans look like on this planet, how would one travel...down...in this cylindrical world? The descriptions of the explorers navigation in this 'planet' are so vivid, that they will make you dizzy. The curiosity that he instills in the reader at what purpose the spaceship 'Rama' is for will pique your interest and you won't be able to put this book down. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"Excellent book that really catered to my imagination. I enjoyed the detailed descriptions of the inside of the ship. Clarke described it so well that I had a very concrete picture in my head that never changed throughout the reading. This is one of the few books that I sat down and read all the way through in one sitting because it was so gripping. Not gripping in a suspenseful sense but more gripping in the fact that it was very interesting and I had to know more about the ship.I definitely recommend this book but stay away from Gentry Lees coauthored massacres. This is a standalone book and the the sequels only do it harm."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"A wonderful story about mankind's first encounter with proof of alien life, in the form of a dead/uninhabited ship. It pulled me in and kept me entertained until the end. This is the story that 2001 should have been, and if Hollywood really wants something fresh they should get off their duffs and film this!"},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"After Arthur C. Clarke's obit came out, I decided to give his most famous work a try, and I'm so glad that I did. The world of Sci Fi is so lucky to have had an author like Clarke, with vivid descriptions, suspensefully written, setting the standard for SF. I've read Rendezvous twice, and loved it both times, then bought Rama II to continue to enjoy the series. Thank you, Arthur Clarke."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"Unfortunately, one of the Amazon reviewers somewhat spoilt Rendezvous with Rama for me by revealing the ending in his / her review, but I still enjoyed it hugely. This is because it starts from a premise with universal appeal: an alien spaceship suddenly appears in the Solar System, and takes a realistic and credible approach to it.Clarke, before being a science fiction author, served in the Royal Air Force as a radar technician (1941-1946). He also devised a satellite communication system that was a precursor to what is in use today. Perhaps because he was a scientist by background, Clarke paid more attention to verisimilitude than other authors of the genre. Rendezvous with Rama, first of all, takes place in a realistically distant future, the twenty-second century; it does not assume man was already on Mars and reaching for the outer Galaxies twenty years after the first Moon landing, as do some SF books written around the time. The novel focuses in what is inside the alien spaceship (or probe, or ark: its nature is not given away, but is the book's very point), and it gives a believable story of its exploration and the surrounding politics. This is not a tale of swashbuckling spacemen and alien bugs, or some supernatural fantasy: it is a logical and at the same time, or even because it is logical, exciting story of discovery. The human mission to Rama explores the alien craft step by step, and the reader with it. It is a fascinating story and a tale full of dangers even though it fails to veer into space opera. Rama itself is full of surprises, though they are surprises to which we are inclined to nod in understanding. But I don't want to spoil it for you..."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"Arthur C. Clarke paints an impressive picture in the narration of \\"Rendezvous with Rama.\\" The story takes place hundreds of years into the future and follows a group of astronauts, led by Commander Norton, who explore this mysterious spacecraft that entered the solar system and appears to be headed right toward the sun. They dubbed the ship \\"Rama\\" and only have a short period of time to explore it before it gets too close to the sun. There's no telling what will happen to Rama or to the sun and the solar system when the ship reaches the sun. Inside Rama is a giant room that appears to contain its own small world with no creatures living in it. The more Norton and his team explore this place the more questions arise as to what the ship's purpose is and how the different objects in this world are used.This book is filled with quiet suspense as the characters explore the vast world not knowing what to expect. It can be riveting and make you anxious to see what'll happen next, but there were wasn't nearly as much action as it sounded like there was going to be. There were times when it sounded like there was going to be a lot of action in ways that would've really enhanced the suspense of this book, but instead Clarke teases the readers by giving his characters plenty of time and room to escape it. I found this to be rather disappointing. One other thing that bothered me is that the character development is pretty shallow, but I think part of the reason is because this book's focus is on Rama itself, not the characters.Overall though \\"Rendezvous With Rama\\" is a very engaging novel that I didn't want to stop reading. I wanted to see what would happen next, how the story would end, and what the answers were to all the mysteries surrounding Rama. Most of the questions are answered toward the end, but not fully. This will keep you thinking about Rama for a long time after you've finished reading the book. It kind of reminds me of \\"2001 Space Odyssey,\\" which Clarke also wrote, in the sense that it doesn't give you any clear answers to most of the mysteries surrounding the story, but you at least get some kind of idea (more so in this book).This is a short but fun novel to read. It's filled with mystery and suspense, and the ending is completely unpredictable. The story will keep you guessing until the very end. After that, you'll still keep guessing about some of the mysteries that Clark leaves open."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"An excellent book from an excellent author.

I've read reviews of Rama II,etc, and most of them (okay,almost all of them) were negative.No wonder, since Clarke edited Rama II then had no involvement whatsoever in the rest. Read this one alone, unless you want to read three more books with the same exact premise.What good is first contact when it happens three times?While some say Clarke's writing is &quot;too dry&quot;, (someone just today commented on that to me) like the odyssey series (2001,2010,2061 etc.),I actually enjoy near future sf involving actual space programs.

The usual bombardment that we recieve from movies and TV showcasing aliens with all-too-human emotions has become tiresome. I encourage any book to show aliens as what they are - aliens. Why would they be pre-disposed to have emotions such as anger, hate, love, fear, etc...?

I also found out recently that this book is going to be made into a movie starring Morgan Freeman and directed by David Fincher. If it is anything close to the book, its gonna be one awesome film!!

Now, while I didn't think that it was as good a space sci-fi story as some other series (i.e. Honor Harrington, Ender, &amp; Robotech) it was perhaps more scientifically accurate, and was also very enjoyable.

For anyone who doesn't understand that and reads Sci-Fi for the amazing places and 'better' characters, try reading a tropical romance novels or something..."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"The thrill, exhilaration, suspense, and goosebump-creating magic of an ancient, lost civilization sending a huge spaceship through the galaxy for some unknown reason was just about as much as I could take. I've read this book a number of times since it first came out. Tragically, the sequels fell flat on their face and were nothing more than parts of a poorly conceived soap opera. I've seen enough tragedy in real life. SF should be an escape from that, not a slide into the depths of it. Besides, I find it inconceivable that the creator of the universe would have to infest his creation with nodes and prime monitors in order to keep track of what is going on. If God can create the universe, he surely knows how to create one that is in Harmony with itself, if he/she so chose to."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"This is a great book !

The characters are rather two dimensional, and not once during the entire story could I bring myself to care about what happened to any of the characters. I've heard a lot of praise for books written by Arthur C. Clarke, so I tried to like \\"Rendezvous With Rama\\". Unfortunately, I really cannot recommend this book to anyone, and I'm not sure if I would even pick up another book by this author."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"I ask the question because many of the elements usually found in a novel involve characters and plot, neither of which are present in this book. Sure, there are characters who visit Rama, and they interact on some levels, but none of them are developed, few have any sort of moral or physical dilemma, and all they seem to do is provide a vehicle for Mr. Clarke to describe the ship. Plot usually hinges on conflict, something which rarely materializes in this book. There is the initial fear the &quot;characters&quot; experience at each new discovery on the ship, including the robots, or the missiles launched at their approaching ship, but none of it lasts long enough to have any kind of emotional effect on the reader. Part of this problem lies with the characters, and their two-dimensionality -- if you can't relate to or feel for the characters, how can you care about what happens to them?As a result, the book reads less like a novel and more like a scientific report. It's interesting to imagine a ship like Rama, where the laws of physics play with our perspective, which in turn challenges our ethnocentricity. This issue, paired with the (sadly understated) issue of the different planetarian representatives battling over superiority, reflects the human race at pretty much any time in the past or present, but it's never developed into a plot, or discussed on any philosophical level. This could have been the driving force of a story, but instead it's only briefly touched, and then left to wander off on its own. To me, it felt like it was a missed opportunity.I'm not an avid reader of science fiction, so I suppose it's possible that I'm missing the point of this and other &quot;hard&quot; science fiction, but as an avid reader of fiction, period, I don't understand why this book is considered a classic. It's interesting, yes, but only because the ideas are stimulating. As a story, it lacks characterization, drama, or any sort of conclusion, and any good creative writing teacher will tell you that those are the three necessary elements for good storytelling."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"Es una obra maestra de la ciencia ficci&oacute;n, que se continua de manera muy atractiva con otros 3 volumenes.

Those criticisms are perfectly accurate. Clarke does not follow the rules.And I'm glad. I read plenty of fiction that conforms to what a novel is \\"supposed\\" to be, but sometimes it's good to be different. This book is a great example of Clarke's gigantic imagination at work. I love the way he speculates. It's a given that his human characters will be thin, even two-dimensional. And the plot manipulation is sometimes too obvious and contrived. His stories read like abstractions, like something between fiction and straight-up science. So they can be jarring. But I find this book, like 2001, to be fascinating. Clarke always imagined that, whatever we might expect alien contact to be, it will be far stranger. And that's what I find interesting.Note: There are three SINOs to this book--Sequels In Name Only. They were \\"co-written\\" (which means, I think, entirely written) by someone other than Clarke, and they are trashy melodrama. The caliber of storytelling is far lower than in this book."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"This book was really weird for me. I kept on waiting for something to happen, some alien to jump out and say : \\"Surprise!\\" but no... nothing. I still enjoyed turning and reading every page and therefore, it gets a four star rating."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"I am a fan of Arthur C. Clarke. Have been since reading a collection of his short stories in the '70's.I first read Rendevous With Rama then, while I was in high school. I loved it. I got to the last page, turned back to the first and started over.When I recently decided to re-read Rama again I was delighted to find this used version on Amazon. It arrived within a week of my purchase. The book was in it's original dust jacket. The dust jacket is in almost perfect shape. The book itself looked like it was barely opened.it was a pleasure reading this old friend again.A five star purchasing experience."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"I remember reading this novel once as a teen in the 70's. I still remember the main thrust of the story. It has stuck with me for 30 years! I agree with another reviewer -- I'm surprised it hasn't been made into a movie yet, for it would make an excellent story. Perhaps with the new computer-driven movie-making technology, its possible to do such an imaginative story justice."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"Rendez vous with Rama is one of the best , if not the best of Arthur Clarke's books. Sure to please Science Fiction fans everywhere. Written in the Nineties , that book is as fresh and suspenseful today , as it was then. A classic of the genre , by an unequaled visionary."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"Sci Fi, very nice book for those who like adventure and thrill with an outer space touch."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"This is one of my favorite books and I highly recommend it. Be warned though that it doesn't really follow the typically three act structure of most stories with introduction, conflict, then resolution. There is also little in the way of character development. What the book does do is something only science fiction and fantasy can in that it makes the environment and situation so compelling that traditional storytelling really isn't needed and would actually be distracting. In that way, it's kind of like the recent Ridley Scott film \\"Prometheus\\" where the situation and events are so fascinating that it just sucks you in. Unlike Prometheus though, Rama doesn't have characters that behave nonsensically or leave you confused and frustrated at the ending. Instead, Rama leaves you craving more....and you can get more as there are several additional books in the series that are more character driven but still keep the mystery and majesty of Rama alive."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"Good hard science fiction for the physics and math junkiesIt is the year 2153. Humans now inhabit the moon, Mars, Mercury, and the moons of Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune. Suddenly, from the depths of deep space, comes an artifact called \\"Rama\\". Commander Norton and his team of space men and women (and chimps) head out on the spaceship, Endeavor, to explore this world before it heads back out into space.I'm familiar with Arthur C. Clarke, not just from the movie, 2001: A Space Odessy, but also his book series of the same name (2001, 2010, 2065, and 3001). Clarke has made himself a formidable presence in the science fiction genre, and when a friend of mine recommended this series, I jumped on it.The characters are as you would expect from a hard science fiction novel/70's scifi novel. They are pretty much interchangeable and bland. However, I did find a few interesting exceptions.Commander Norton does have a polygamous relationship (which somewhat hints at some possible tension between his Earth and Mars families???), but men aren't the only ones in this society to be engaged in polyamory. Two of his crew (I think Mercer and Carter) share a wife. I bring this up because so much of science fiction (well, any fiction written by males) seems to focus on male fantasies: one guy having many wives. I thought the attempt at equality was admirable.Also, there is a female doctor aboard the spaceship, Endeavor, along with a female doctor in the CNC board meetings, both of whom are highly respected in their fields. Sure, the medical doctor does have a history with Commander Norton, but in no way is she only defined by her sexual relations to him (past or present). And for that, kudos to Clarke for making female characters beyond the boinkable babes (see Niven's Ringworld for how to do this badly).But this story is NOT about the characters; it is about Rama. And this is where it catapults itself head and shoulders above Ringworld, another novel about a mysterious object that some space farers are trying to explore. Commander Norton and his team do a lot of exploring of this world and TONS of science is tossed at the reader. We get the mechanics of descending onto a rapidly rotating cylinder, the gravity on such a surface, the awkwardness that humans have in dealing with strange surroundings, the examination of the surroundings (testing the water for contaminants), and MUCH MUCH MORE. This is truly a hard core science fiction novel; there are no fluffy \\"Faster than light\\" drives, no artificial gravity machines, nothing that isn't 100% explained by science. Even the alien species are described as very alien (no almost human races here!).I have very little in the way of complaints. The book is VERY science dense, so if astronomy, geology, physics, math, and/or any other science bugged you in high school or college, you will probably want to avoid. The characters are also very transparent, interchangeable, and only present to show off Rama. Also, I found how utopic the United Planets were (there is ONLY one threat, though it is admirable to see even that, to the mission) somewhat strange.When I first cracked open Ringworld, I was expecting this: an in-depth look at an alien world, with real world physics, and attention to detail. In fact, that book almost turned me off hard science fiction. Clarke has restored my faith in this subgenre. I'm definitely more interested in his works and in exploring more scifi (both hard and soft). Recommended to my fellow nerds and geeks.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*"},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"Arthur C. Clarke is one of science fiction's most noticed writers. After \\"2001: A Space Odyssey,\\" by Stanley Kubrick, Clarke's impact upon the scifi universe was tremendous. \\"Rendezvous With Rama\\" was a Clarkian blockbuster of another sort. An interstellar species comes into our solar system in a cylindrical space ship-city 30 miles long. Do they intend to use the Sun to slingshot their way on a new course by using gravitational force? But as an Earth ship of explorers board Rama, where are the passengers? A good hard-fiction work by a master of his craft."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"Within the last couple of years I have really started to love science fiction books, be it a space opera (I hate that term) or something thought provoking and fun like this. What I love about books like this, along with say, Isaac Asimov books, is that they don't feel dated or aged; It doesn't feel like I'm reading about Commander Cody. The ideas and questions are still very relevant and the ideas of technology are still marvels for our current age, without naivete.The book is short and a pretty quick read, around 140pgs (the last 1/5th of the book is excerpts from Clarke's other books), but the story is very grand, and after finishing it I sat and thought about some of the analogies from our day to day life from the life that the main character is left with. It is honestly a shame that there has been no movie made for this novel.Without spoiling the book for you, I would like to add that I believe the last sentence should be removed, because it tarnishes the aftertaste in my opinion, though does not pull away from the overall story. I believe that the book would have had a perfect ending; leaving you to think about the wonder that is Rama, but instead it sheepishly leads to two more sequels. I plan on avoiding those at all costs, because I am a believer that sequels ruin things.... but I digress...This is a great story, a quick fulfilling read, something that is good to own, I plan on revisiting this book later in life. You do not need to be a sci-fi person to appreciate or enjoy this."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"You know going in to a Hugo or Nebula Award winner that you will find a story that is big on plot and uses science fiction sporadically. The plot and character development is the important element of the story and what makes it such a great book and the science fiction element is but a little flavor. Rendezvous With Rama definitely focuses on the story, but it also has a surprisingly decent amount of science fiction as well, but not necessarily in the way today's modern reader expects.The plot is one built around a near future, one where humans have colonized some of the planets and moons in our solar system. We've grown enough intellectually, scientifically and technologically to learn how to live on planets and moons with extreme climates, learned how to travel fast enough and communicate well enough to function as a group or entity. But when Rama comes along everything is thrown into jeopardy. Here is this immense space ship that defies everything that humans believe in space travel, technology and, most of all, whether there are alien life forms out there. Rama threatens the very existence of everything human, and yet also gives hope to what could be learned and achieved in the future.Using this as the background to the story Clarke is able to build a realistic world that is entirely believable as our near future. The characters are believable as they explore Rama, or debate what should be done to the Raman ship from multiple planetary headquarters. Some are threatened, some are hopeful and some are intrigued and curious. The reader becomes all of these as you journey with the crew among the Endeavor as they explore the intricate and alien landscape of the interior of Rama. We are teased by the possibility of life, both real, that is spontaneous, and of designed. Either way the alien presence is certainly felt throughout the book.I would definitely recommend this one. Although the science fiction and plot is more of a near future feel and less of a hard sci fi book, I found this one ot be altogether believable and thought provoking.4.5 stars."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"This is a great book, I have probably read it 4 times in my life.Arthur Clarke belongs to a class of no-nonsence writers that all writing should emulate.The story is simple, yet profound. What if an alien spaceship comes, but we don't know what to do with it and the aliens don't acknowlege us.I am amazed this has never been a movie."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"Many others have mentioned that in the whole Rama series only this book, book one, is a worthwhile read. I must agree. I originally read 'Rendezvous\\" in high school and loved it. A few years later I haltingly made my way through the other two and was really disappointed. They're ponderous, base, and little more than the soap opera tripe that everyone else makes them out to be.About a month ago, I picked up a copy of book one and read it again and remembered why I endured those other two travesties in the first place: \\"Rendezvous with Rama\\" is classic Sci-Fi. It's broad and sweeping and the humans, while believable, merely function as the reader's eyes and ears. They're realistic without getting in the way. The concept is so massive and original that of course it would take several books to get to the bottom of the strange goings on around Mercury. And even if the other two are a let down this one book is more than enough to fire the imagination of any reasonable fan of Clarke's or the genre. Happily, one need not subject one's self to the other two books since the contemplation of the possibilities put forth in this book is plenty to chew on. Who needs to see the story resolved? Spare yourself the mess and buy this book alone for what it puts in your head."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"Without giving too much away, &quot;Rendezvous with Rama&quot; is hands down one of the most magnificent novels I've ever read. As a fan of Arthur C. Clarke's style (very scientific, very detached from emotions, etc.), I found the suspense to be surprising (although for true suspense, &quot;Rama II&quot; surpasses it on all levels if you read the series in order). More importantly, the awe and spectacle is still stunning, with remarkable attention given to true world physics. No space shuttles flying at warp speed, no photon torpedos... no matter our current scientific progression, it is doubtful we will ever achieve warp speed or any sort of equivalent. &quot;Rendezvous with Rama&quot; presents the story in a creepily scientific way, letting the mysterious happenings on board the ship speak for themselves. And I have to give Clarke kudos for his brilliant ending--simply one of the greatest endings to a novel ever. Reaffirming my personal belief that humans are too xenophobic and geocentric to care about anything else, Clarke ends the story on a subtle note--seemingly anti-climactic at first glance. But upon reflection, the ending works beautifully, making a sad but wholeheartedly true statement of life on this planet. Most depressing is the fact that later in the series, Clarke abandons his notions for a more standard sci-fi fare. Sad, but this novel still ranks as one of my all-time favorites."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"The fact that we Humans are absolutely insignificant in the Universe is what few people realize, and even fewer keep in mind. The four \\"Rama\\"-books give a very detailed picture of how we people would behave if an Alien Intelligence contacted us. Built around the life story of Nicole des Jardins, a young doctor, who is participating in establishing communication with the Extra-Terrestrials, \\"Rendezvous with Rama\\" merely is the prequel to the events taking place during these years in the four books. Absolutely fascinating, logical down to the last description, and yes, we will definitely behave like that.If you're sceptical about Space, the Universe, us being not alone and all that, read this book and its sequels, and you'll at least have got an insight into the other side of the argument. If you're one of us believers, don't waste your time reading this review, go read the books! (...and look for the hint that points to Douglas Adams' \\"Hitchhiker\\"!)"},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"For those of you who are going to be picking up this book for the first time, there are some things you need to know regarding this book. To begin with, do not expect any of your questions to be aswered. This novel serves one purpose: to keep you guessing and interested in the next novels. Bear in mind that this novel is well written and easy to read. But you WILL NOT find any answers to your questions about what is going on. The main focus is that there is an alien vehicle in our solar system, and we go to visit it to see what it is all about. Now, don't ask who, what, when, where, and why it was sent, because you will not find out in this novel.Overall, this novel is very good. It is simple to read, and Clarke seems to be a master of keeping you in suspense. I should know, because when I was done with this novel I turned and started the sequel. Therefore, you can say that Clarke's writing ability is masterful since he had me guessing the whole time. It is not overly complex, and really, this book is simply just setting the table for the future novels. But, it is highly enjoyable, and should be picked up to really appreciate the wealth and richness that can be found in the rest of the Rama series."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"In my youth, when I started reading SF, I was never a major devotee of Arthur C. Clarke; I was mostly into Heinlein and Asimov. But I read this one when it was first published (1973) and I liked it so well I kept the hardback for years and years.I'm not sure what finally happened to it, but at any rate I've just recently gotten around to replacing it. And the story is still as great a read as it was when it was new. I can't claim to have read everything Clarke ever wrote, but this is certainly the best of his works that I _have_ read.Other reviewers have pointed out, entirely correctly, that this isn't a book to read for character development. That's true of Clarke's books in general, I think, but it's especially apt here, where the 'star' of the book is an artifact of an alien civilization. In fact, even the 'star' doesn't get a lot of development, since in the end it remains deeply mysterious. (I don't know what happens in the sequels; I haven't read them and I haven't heard good things about them. I'm treating this as a standalone work.)But man, if you want to read a gripping, haunting story about the first human exploration of a space probe (or something) from an extraterrestrial civilization -- and if you want to watch the exploration process unfold and feel as though you're participating in the discovery yourself -- then this is a book for you. This is what Clarke does best: when you read a story through his eyes, you're looking outward at the objects of scientific investigation, and helping yourself to a chunk of the intellectual wonder and joy that goes with such investigation.The excitement here is the excitement of hard science, not of character development. If that's what you want, you'll probably love this book."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"Briefly; a very large cylinder appears in our solar system and an expedition is sent out to investigate what obviously is an extraterrestrial object. They are able to enter the cylinder and watch it slowly \\"wake up\\" from the inside. The alien technology they encounter is highly advanced and awe inspiring but still possible to understand.The story develops in a fairly slow pace, but it is full of suspense and mystery. The discoveries that the astronauts make are so fantastic and described with such lucid imagination that all I could feel while reading this book was anticipation and awe. Furthermore, the more the astronauts explore and discover the deeper the mysteries seem to grow. One thing I really like about Arthur C. Clarke is that his descriptions are scientifically plausible and still very imaginative. I highly recommend this Sci-Fi novel.Arthur C. Clarke is my favorite Science Fiction author and Rendezvous with Rama is one of my favorites. It was a collection of short stories that included my all time favorite short story \\"The wall of darkness\\" that originally got me hooked on Arthur C. Clarke (review coming). Arthur C. Clarke will never be forgotten."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"First of all: thanks to the Scandinavian parts of Texas for pointing me to A.Clarke, whom I had previously known only on a 'no name basis' as the writer of 2001 Space Odyssey. I have high respect and liking for the SF genre, but not much knowledge of it, apart from one or the other Verne, Wells, Samjatin, Huxley, Orwell, Bradbury, Asimov, Lem... Of course not counting Douglas Adams, who played another ball game, didn't he?Rama is a worth while experience. Good Science Fiction is usually also about 'science', but if it is good, it is much about society, about history, usually in the future. The evil cliche term of the paradigm comes to practical use when you read good SF. (The word was invented by evil consultants who needed excuses for the havoc they caused.) SF is about changing paradigms. There is lots of that going on here.In the 22nd century, the United Planets, which seem to be essentially Earth, Mercury and Mars (which are Earthling colonies) plus some moons are confronted with a scary phenomenon: a huge artificial space body travelling with high speed near the Earth. Luckily the initially silly Star Wars technology had later been developed to the advantage of peaceful purposes and helps arranging a 'rendezvous' with the alien craft, named Rama because the Roman and Greek mythologies have been exhausted in the process of naming space. The process of exploring the strange space body and of thinking through its implications is the actual plot.Go for it!"},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"A mysterious object dubbed Rama is found entering the Solar System. A team of cosmonauts set out to intercept the craft, only to discover an environment so alien yet strangely human that debates over the purpose the craft become wildly out of control. Perhaps one of Clarke's best writings, he focuses on mankind's eventual transcendence, a second coming, a return to the garden of Eden, and human nature. He believes that human nature is fundamentally good, yet as humans, we have to overcome prejudices to survive. Not only does this book make one think about mankind's role in the universe and if there are intelligent speices out there, it also evokes fantastic imagery. Imagine gigantic bio-metallic crab creatures, a sea that curves overhead, and a waterfall that moves in a spiral. This book is a great read."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"While I agree with some of the other reviewers' criticisms here that characterizations here tend to be a bit flat, the human characters simply were not the point of this great novel - RAMA itself was the main character. ACC does a great job of fleshing out Rama so we can really envision it and believe it is real. A great novel (or movie) takes you somewhere you have never been before (that is, its not just a retread of familiar plots and characters). Rendezvous with Rama did that for me. I don't simply mean that it's a novel about contact with an extraterrestrial force - that's been done zillions of times. But rather, this one does it in an extremely compelling and believable manner. I found this to be one of those novels that I had to read virtually all at once because I couldn't wait to see what happened next. Except for the fact that NASA doesn't have the financial resources that the earth folks in this novel do, this book could happen today. No ACC has not tied everything up in a nice neat package - real life seldom does. I don't want to give away the ending - but I love the ending of this book. It puts our civilization in proper perspective, again seems very credible, and was a rather new idea back in the early 70's when this was written. In fact, my least favorite thing about the sequels, particularly the final one in the series, is that they trounce upon the spirit of the original ending. [For those readers who do want more character depth, the first sequel (Rama II) is perhaps the best in retaining the spirit of the original while providing truly fleshed out characters. I presume the latter was attributable to Gentry Lee, rather than ACC.]"},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"First, I completely agree with the other review, they should make a movie out of these books. They could have a lot of fun with the special effects for the characters in RAMA Revealed.I have read all the 2001 &amp; the RAMA books and I must say the RAMA Series really grabbed me. The books are all written with amazing attention to detail. In addition, the story line is extreamly interesting and a little easier to follow than the 2001 series. There were times when reading these books that I just could not put them down. I would tell myself, &quot;One more chapter, I want to find out what is going to happen next&quot;. In fact, I did that so much on Garden of RAMA, I stayed up 24 hours and read the entire book in 1 day!Even though this is science fiction, it is not hard to imagine that the technology introduced here could be a reality some day in the far future. I think that is what I love about Clarke the most.In the first book, Rendezvous With RAMA, you are introduced to the strange spacecraft called RAMA and the crew sent to investigate. In the second book, RAMA II, the RAMA spacecraft has returned to the solar system and another crew sent out to investigate. In the third book, Garden of RAMA, you follow RAMA II back to its origins and learn more about the inhabitants aboard the craft. In the final book (my favorite), RAMA Revealed, you are overcome by emotions as you follow the war on RAMA and eventually learn more about who sent that gigantic craft into our solar system.I can not say enough good things about these books. The first one may seem a little slow at times but, when you finish the last book, you will have a great appreciation for the whole collection.***"},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"What first hit me when I read this series (actually, I played the game first), was the great effort put into making the story match with most great astronomers thoughts. There is no encounter with humanoid aliens, no Tie Fighters, no evil alien earth-destroyers. Yet, the story is so fetching and entertaining. Picture humans, not even able to maintain peace within its own race, still judging by sex and the color of an individuals skin, meeting other races, perhaps not as technologically advanced, or technologically advanced in other directions, but with a totally different lifestyle, values and, most important of all, appearance. What would happen? I think you can guess the outcome. Rama is not for those yearning for action, though it is quite thrilling at times. Constant thoughts and comparisons to what happened in our century, as well as small stories from the main character's childhood (in the three last books) is a bit boring at times, which is why I don't give it a solid 10. Still - a good buy, both this and the other books in the series."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"As someone who considers herself a fan of &quot;soft&quot; science fiction (you know, the stuff you don't have to have an engineering degree or a clue about math to follow)I could only shake my head in wonderment when I was finished with Rendezvous with Rama. How does Clarke do it?Here is a tale of mankind's first encounter with an alien spacecraft coming into our own solar system -- set in the not too distant future when we could conceivably have colonized our own local planets, but not yet explored the galaxy. The sense of awe, of discovery both delightful and terrifying comes across sharply as we follow a team that sets out to enter and explore the seemingly uninhabited interior of this gigantic environment. All the while events are unfolding in response to Rama's nearing the sun, the author manages to explain the scientific logistics of Rama in terms a lay person like me can clearly understand without being patronizing and without detracting from the characters and their story (which are, true to Clarke's tradition, interesting without being melodramatic).I was reluctant to undertake this book at first, having received the impression that it was too technical and therefore, boring. It was neither. Now I can't wait to continue the series."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"In this book, Arthur Clarke set the bar for the unknown alien probe story very high. The setting is that humans have settled Mercury, Luna, Mars, some asteroids, and some Jovian and Saturnian moons. Each group sends an Ambassador to the United Planets, which meets on Earth's moon. Suddenly, an enormous cylindrical space ship enters the solar system and appears completely passive; it is named Rama as that is the next name in the nomenclature sequence.Commander Norton commands the only space ship capable of docking with Rama, so he is ordered to investigate. What he finds is amazing, yet puzzling. He encounters an alien technology that is baffling, yet they find it fairly easy to understand some of what it does. The crewmembers explore Rama, finding their greatest problem to be coping with the sheer size of the vessel.While the description of the alien probe is fascinating, nobody does the scientific details better than Clarke, the best aspects of the book are the descriptions of the interplanetary political situation and the general human reaction to the appearance of an alien artifact. While Clarke's descriptions of the political tensions between the various human political groups are disquieting, they are also clearly realistic. Humans find significant differences developing when groups live in different areas of Earth, it is clear that those differences will be even greater when groups live on different planets. Furthermore, conclusive proof that extraterrestrial intelligence exists will have a dramatic effect on how humans view the universe.Like many of Clarke's other stories, the ending is ambiguous, which is why I consider him the thinking person's science fiction writer. This is clearly one of the ten best science fiction novels of all time."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"An unidentified space vessel (\\"Rama\\") enters the solar system. The human species has no other option than to try and figure out what it means. That is the basic datum around which Arthur C. Clarke's celebrated novel has been constructed. Clarke opens four windows on this process of sense making: an aesthetic, a scientific, a political and a religious.The aesthetic dimension of the encounter with Rama is, for me, the most compelling. Rama exhibits a minimalistic but refined architecture based on a threefold symmetry. It is truly a thing of beauty and a pleasure to behold for one's mind's eye. On top of that comes the awe-inspiring vastness of this contraption and the author is very skillful in evoking the frisson that goes with the feeling of desorientation when navigating through this enormous space (a very good example of what in Kantian aesthetics would be called an experience of the negative sublime).Rama presents us also with a scientific puzzle. As the story progresses, we understand that it is a kind of ark, or repository of an alien culture's artefacts and life forms. It does this by relying on a clever combination of thermodynamical and biological principles - the elegance of which reinforces the beauty of the ship's architecture. However, as there is much which remains unfathomable to its human explorers, the story strikes a good balance between the anthropically accessible and the fundamentally mysterious. At the end of the book, just before the human visitors leave Rama, their desire to know overcomes their infatuation with the ship's tantalising beauty and they puncture its smooth inner skin to inspect some of the cargo. The ship doesn't seem to mind but to the reader the moment has a weight similar to Eve eating the apple in the Garden of Eden.The cleverness and elegance of the scientific and aesthetic perspectives contrast heavily with the one-dimensionality of the political and religious outlook on Rama. For the religiously minded, the arrival of the space ship constitutes an act of grace. It has come to rescue mankind from its fallen state. For politicians, Rama constitutes a threat to the power equilibrium in the solar system. Hence, it needs to be destroyed. Clearly, this constitutes a dilemma which is, however, neatly resolved by Rama leaving the solar system for some unknown destination. One wonders how deep the wedge would have entered into human civilisation if the dilemma would have persisted for a longer while.What is missing from Clarke's narrative is a deeply philosophical perspective. The questions and tensions remain at the level of the self-centerdly functional and never transcend the \\"us\\" versus \\"it\\" perspective as exemplified by questions such as: what does Rama mean? How might we make use of it? What could it do to us? Nowhere this leads us to question the deeper purpose of mankind, to re-appreciate our position in a universe which brings forth incomprehensible felicities (and threats) and sustains life in a most surprising way. Clarke could have asked those questions without letting the story slide into new agey utopianism (Crichton did it in a most refreshing way, in his \\"Sphere\\", very comparable in setting and atmosphere). Without this deeper perspective, the rendezvous with Rama is a compelling but ultimately a rather trivial anecdote in the history of mankind."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"I was gripped from page 1 of this book, but the time i got to the end, i was shaking it, hoping more pages would fall out as the ending is such a let down. I know it's a series of books, but the ending to this book is so wholly unsatisfying that I feel like I'm buying into a marketing ploy if I buy the next book. So I'll pass. Hope it turns out all dandy for whomever is controlling Rama! Childhood's End is a much better Clarke book."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"While I did eventually read the entire book, it took me a long while to get to the end. The story itself was a good premise, but I found that the writing was rather dull and uninspiring. The story of mankind's first encounter with extra-terrestrials should be an exciting and gripping story. Unfortunately... this book falls short of that. \`Rendezvous With Rama' does start with some promise, but it ends with a barely audible whimper. I wish there was something positive I could say about this book, but to be honest, I cannot think of any positive points. Many people seem to like Arthur C. Clarke's writing, but based on this book, I doubt if I will pick up another one of his books."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"Rendezvous With Rama by Arthur Clarke is one of the greatest pieces of creative fiction I've had the privilege to read in the last couple of years. I see why it is considered a classic.The story begins with the discovery that an interstellar object is approaching Earth at a great rate of speed. The rest of the book is centered on the exploration of this object; which is given the name Rama.Clarke demonstrates why he earned the reputation of being a grandmaster of science-fiction storytelling as he uses both suspense and *gasp* thoughtfulness to unfold this tale of discovery and exploration.I found the book to be very compellingly structured and told. Clarke's imaginative powers are in full force here. The Raman environment is spellbindingly fascinating.The background of Clarke's humans is equally intriguing. There are only hints of a dystopian human civilization that has apparently colonized other parts of the solar system while retaining adolescent political (the council on Rama, the inhabitants of Mercury) and sexual (The captain of the exploration team) views.One last thing before I give this book the recommendation it so richly deserves... I found the Raman &quot;sea&quot; to be one of the greatest ideas I have ever encountered in a science fiction book.And, as promised above--I give this book a ringing recommendation.

I had high hopes from the reviews I'd read, but in the end, meh, it was just OK.I didn't mind the lack of character development, and felt the writing style was very good. What got to me is how much time and detail Clarke put into utterly tertiary topics. E.g., the mathematical degrees of a slope of a wall, or an explanation of the effects of heat on various weather or landscape elements, or the meteorology behind wind and ions. I don't mind hard science fiction, but after reading this book I'm not convinced that a book needs to prioritize discussions about physics at the expense of the plot in order to be hard sci-fi. I would have enjoyed more plot, less physics lessons.I hung on for the payoff, because the book unfolded slowly and didn't reveal a whole lot about Rama along the way. In the end, the payoff was meager and I am writing this 3-star review as closure.Strange that this is one of the most awarded sci-fi books of all time. Maybe I'm not a hard sci-fi fan. Will stick with books like \\"Ender's Game,\\" and the \\"Foundation\\" series, I guess."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"If you enjoy Arthur C. Clarke's style of writng, then this is another interesting book. But compared against contemporary sci-fi, it is slow and lean."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA showcases a lot of things that must fascinate Arthur C. Clarke, or at least a lot of concepts that he likes revisiting in his fiction. Once again, we have mankind's first contact with extraterrestrials, human colonies on the moon and on other solar planets, academic and political in-fighting, and, of course, a healthy dose of science. But the ingredients do well together here. This is, as you surely already know, one of the so-called classic science fiction novels, yet I only just got around to reading it recently. I'm happy to say that it matched my expectations, both compared to other Clarke novels and to its own lofty reputation.An unknown object has entered Earth's solar system in the year 2130, and a rocket ship is dispatched to study this alien artifact (dubbed Rama) and report back on its findings. That sentence is a summary of almost the entire plot. But RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA is not a story that is wholly concerned with plot. It's more a series of set pieces: the decision to explore, the examination of the immediate inside, the voyage across the interior's sea, etc. Each one is interesting on its own, but not all of them contribute much to the overall story.The purpose these set pieces serve is to invoke a sense of wonder at this unknowable alien object. I'm reminded of Jules Verne's voyage-type stories, where his protagonist(s) would become engaged in a multitude of individual adventures. But instead of exploring (and inventing) Earth's wonders, Clarke is showing us a completely fictional environment. It's quite fun. Clarke put most of his effort into creating this landscape, and it becomes the focus and centerpiece of the whole novel. This entire endeavor would flop completely if Clarke had been unable to sustain the suspense for the full length of the novel. But he does it.Character development is not one of this book's priorities. Too much time is spent developing the setting to provide us with people of any great depth. Clarke gets away with it here (while other science fiction novels have crashed and burned on this point) because he has set the book up as a mystery, with the setting as its question. Squandering time on the human characters would merely be a distraction, when all the reader is really interested in is Rama itself.RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA is now over thirty years old, but this science fiction novel isn't showing its age (although some of the aside mentions of polygamous relationships are attempting to sound modern and forward-thinking, yet instead end up seeming rather quaint). I've heard mixed things about the sequels which follow on from the end of this book. Given how much I enjoyed the first in the series, I think I'll probably at least try one or two of them. Maybe I won't like them as much as I did RENDEZVOUS, but that's a high standard to reach."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"Suddenly, from deep space, a mysterious object has appeared in the solar system. It is symetrical, it spins around a central axis, it is... not natural. SOMEONE built it. Mankind's first contact with life from beyond our world has begun.Arthur C. Clarke has done a great job, in this book, of combining his speculations about future sociology, future religions, and future genetic engineering, with the wonder of First Contact. And beyond that -- practically every page bristles with hardcore science. Look as hard as you want, you will not find a more expertly crafted dramatization of the forces of physics in action. You will find here useful paradigms to help yourself visualize, and understand, forces such as inertia, momentum, gravity, centripetal force... I have been told that this book is often given as assigned reading in M.I.T. physics classes, to help students get a grip on some of these forces.If you like this book, and want your science fiction with a strong dose of genuine science (not swords and sorcery), let me recommend to you &quot;Mission of Gravity&quot; by Hal Clement. I think it's out of print right now, but ask your friendly local librarian to help you find a copy. It will really help you understand all kinds of important scientific ideas, both from physics and chemistry. The author is a real, respected and beloved science teacher, who used his classroom experience to give shape to his exposition of scientific matters. Also, for hardcore science in your science fiction, you should be aware of the name Gregory Benford. Read anything by him, you can't possibly go wrong.To sum up -- I love this book. If you have any appreciation for good science fiction, don't be a fool, and buy this book right now."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"Rondezvous with RAMA is a good book. It's about a group of people who live in 2100. They discover a spacecraft coming into view. They set out a team of perfesdsional crew to explore the cylindrical craft. They find weird creatures and interesting things. If you read this you will defenetly want to read the rest of the series."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"I remember buying this audio-book many years ago.

People who say bad things about this book just don't get it. They should stay in their fantasy realms because hard science is just not for them. This book is written as if it could really happen while still being extremely entertaining. I couldn't put it down. The characters are developed just the right amount. They are professional astronauts, emotionally stable, and doing the job they were trained to do."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"This book, even today, is as fresh and fascinating as it was when it was first published several years ago. And it masterfully handles the characterization of the astronauts sent out to enter and investigate the mysterious &quot;Rama&quot; with is interior bodies of water and a metallic island. The first in a great series! Definitely a must-have along with: &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;, &quot;Puppet Masters&quot;, &quot;2001&quot;, &quot;2010&quot;, &quot;Ringworld&quot;, all the &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot; books, as well as books as new to the genre as &quot;Advent of the Corps&quot; and others."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"I have always loved Clarke's writings, and that's mostly because what he writes can and probably will become a reality. He is an astronomer and has written several scientific papers as well as SF (see &quot;Report on Planet Three&quot;). Not only just an astronomer, but a well recognized one at that (the geosynchronos orbit; you know, the ones that hold your favorite cable TV providers in place; was first invisioned by him and is also called the Clarke Orbit for crying out loud!)

This book is fantastic, it has many technical stuff that make the story a good one. The Ramans are never shown, which gives the story a mistical twist that only the master of science fiction knows how to handle . This story draws also many philosophical questions, such as: Who are we?, Why are we here?, How many others are out there? , etc. I only can recommend one thing: Don't read the sequels, they will only spoil the original concept."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"An astonishing begining for the epic history of RAMA.

I liked it, its a small read, doesn't seem very long, so no great time investment.For the length it certainly brings up a lot of ideas, and will make you think.There's a lot of mystery in it, and a real sense of wanting to know more. I think this book will probably play on my mind a lot over the next few years. As far as it goes, I don't find the concept of an 'Ark' somewhere out in space hard to believe, and could easily imagine, something similiar happening.For its age it doesn't seem overly dated, but there's the odd minor thing to do with character, but very minor.I definitly recomend this book. Its a quick read so you've got nothing to lose, its entertaining and it does open your mind.I think the old fella died in the last couple of days. Its the only book by him that I've read, I doubt in would be the last.Cheers"},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"Arthur C. Clarke will drive you hard though this book, all the while bombarding you with exotic ideas and profound imagination. It's dizzying and dazzling curious... but wholly lacks juicy details that'll satisfy a sci-fi geeks lust for specifics. That'll sum it up.A few ideas about the Rama ship were difficult to grasp from his writing. For example, I never pictured the descending stairs very well, and what I did picture didn't seem right. Perhaps another idea should have been explored here. Anothet item I had a hard time dealing with were the squares closer to the south-side pole. Why were radically different squares there and what purpose did they serve? They certainly didn't serve a purpose in the story... it just led me to confusion. More things whihc needed explaining: the deep wells, the entombed \\"library\\" and the dismantling of the \\"sabotage.\\" Most of the above items were mearly grazed upon and left behind in the authors duststorm, which was kicked up by his rapid fire speed of ideas and intelligence. Just wish all of it was conveyed more easily."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"Perhaps I had a case of high expectations, but I was only mildly thrilled with this book.I set out to look for the best reviewed SF books by Arthur C. Clarke. Clarke has the uncanny ability to lay out and advance a plot like no other Sci-Fi author I've ever read - there is no extraneous character development. While some people dislike Clarke's lack of character development, I find it to be one of his greatest strengths.Clarke delivers on this particular point in this book. He gets to the point and advances the story quite well. The story is an interesting one, though not the blockbuster I would have expected from the reviews.For starters, the book was fairly light on the social and technological constructs which are universally associated with Clarke (think HAL from 2001). The book is also a little bit more \\"soft\\" Sci-Fi than I would normally expect from Clarke in that he does not delve very deeply into the scientific aspects of the story he is presenting (think sunspots from Sunstorm). Finally, and perhaps most importantly... the ending (semi-spoiler to follow). Without getting into specifics, he leaves us hanging... this is presumably solved in the other books in the Rama series. However, after reading reviews for the other books, I'm a bit skeptical of their quality or readability.With all this being said, it was still a pretty decent book and would probably make a better movie than book. The concept is a pretty novel one despite its faults, the writing is fairly crisp, and the story is developed well.Though this is a good effort by Clarke, I do not think it's his best."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"The world of \\"Rama\\" is not necessarily a wholly new concept (see Dyson Spheres, circa 1959), but it is a nice take on it. Note that, yes, I called this book \\"nice\\". Because that's basically what it is. A loosely detailed description of men discovering a new world, encapsuled inside of a 20 by 50 kilometer cylinder. The short chapters makes the reading easy, and Clarke's style is fairly simple, making this a very quick read. Though the story doesn't come to a very firm conclusion, it is worth the atmospheric emjoyment of imagining yourself there with the characters exploring this new world. The minor discussion of the political implications of this first contact is overshadowed by the greatness of Rama, and though detailed in description, it is a fairly light story, with no definite earthshattering epiphany. I give it a 4 of 5 for it's take on a first contact (of a sort) and delving into the archeology of an unknown alien culture, though it seemed as if Clarke really didn't have an idea of how to end the book, and it was a bit rushed."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"For those who enjoyed Childhood's End by A.C. Clarke, Rendevous with Rama promises more of the same qualities. Space exploration, alien encounters and political infighting all make an appearance here. Though I thought that the characters were a bit flat and contrived, the plot and scenery have enough clever nuances to make that flaw an afterthought.Considering that there is not much 'Hollywood' action in this book, I was impressed at how well the story moves by its own subdued style. Discovery, insight and science are peppered expertly throughout the book, making it so there are no stretches of dry reading.All in all, Rendevous with Rama is worth your time. If you consider yourself a science fiction aficionado, it should have a place on your bookshelf. I personally preferred Childhood's End over this one, but I wasn't disappointed. For those Rama junkies out there, check out the PC video game 'Rama' that came out in the mid-90s. Obsolete by today's standards, but the hard core fan base would enjoy the visual realization of this book."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"Recently I read this book again (after three years) and I felt as fascinated as the first time. When you read a Clark's book you always find a nice plot, a complete story merging people and facts in a credible &quot;possible situation&quot;.What would happen if suddenly our solar system (not the human race) is &quot;visited&quot; by some kind of alien ship (an enormous one) for the first time?.In this book you won't find an advanced human technology with Universal translators and unthinkable space ships, but you will be introduced in a story where a group of space men (just a few decades more advanced than us) have to deal with the answer of one of the most ancient questions: Are we alone?. Of course that this answer has a deep implications in our lives and that's the main theme explored in the book: What we would think?, and, What we would do?Again you will find supositions and explanations according to actual scientific knowledge without exaggerations about aliens languages, comunications, intentions, etc. A few examples:* How could this enormous space ship travel so far and so fast (maybe since eons before we were born) without visible propulsion system? well, you'll enjoy a very nice discussion about space drives, newton's laws (action-reaction), gravity pulls and propulsion generated by an enormous sea inside the ship, etc. For me this is more interesting than some incredible warp drives and man-made wornholes (it's another theme).* If the ship rotate a very high speed, how could be the gravity along all the ship. You will find seriuos explanations and suppositions about that.* Mr. Clark takes you by the hand to explain the way that you would perceive the world inside a cylinder with a several kilometers radius.* etc.This book is plenty of wonderful situations, discussion and facts with people like us, without super powers, without superior weapons, only a limited but growing knowledge that push them to the limits in a hypothetical situation in which the Earth is not the main interest for our visitors.You must read it. Definitely!"},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"This was my first experience with the work of Arthur C. Clarke. I was not disappointed. This book is simple, straightforward science fiction. The prose is clear and engaging, but not especially artistic. The pace of the novel is excellent; the book pulls a reader along effortlessly. The characters, as noted elsewhere, are fairly one-dimensional. The strength of this novel is its fascinating premise, and the skill with which Clarke brings you into the world of Rama. Clarke is especially adept at describing this world. He does it so well that one could draw a map of it after reading the book. Still, attempting to visualize its wonders strains the imagination to its limit.All in all, an extremely interesting take on first contact, and a novel that can be easily understood by a middle schooler, but enjoyed by a reader of any age. I'm glad I read it, and would recommend it without hesitation to anyone."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"I too, don't quite understand why Rama got the Hugo.Let me first admit that I haven't read any Clarke in years,so this is based on impressions formed in the 70's and 80's.I recall that Rama was a good read. Few authors manage toplod along and get away with it, like Clarke does, and Rama did plod a bit.Clarke has never crafted great characters, so that, anyway is no great criticism.His strength has generally been in plausibly extrapolating the futurefrom what is known now (Hard SF) and with engaging plots.First time readers of Clark would do well to read Childhood's End, which also won a Hugoand deservedly so. I read it nearly 30 years ago and still remember how blown away I waswith the vision of that tale - especially at the &quot;End&quot;.Appropriate title I would say."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"This novel, along with 2001 and Childhood's End, forms the best of Arthur's work. A derelict alien spaceship enters the solar system and only one spacecraft is in close-enough range to investigate. They get inside, but that is just the beginning of the mystery. What I love about this book is the realistic way in which Clarke describes a solar system that has been heavily colonized by humans. It is scientifically plausible and he doesn't try to fudge over little problems like gravity and the speed of light.There is currently an all-CGI movie version of this in developement by David Fincher. I look forward to seeing it, but one would do well to read the book first."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"This is definately a sci fi novel that encourages one to think &quot;outside of the box&quot;. The usual bombardment that we recieve from movies and TV showcasing aliens with all-too-human emotions has become tiresome. I encourage any book to show aliens as what they are - aliens. Why would they be pre-disposed to have emotions such as anger, hate, love, fear, etc...? Would it not be possible for a race to evolve with a different set of emotions?Anyhow, this book is just one more step towards really understanding the random possibilities that alien life would offer."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"I cannot tell a lie, Rendezvous with Rama disappointed me somewhat after reading many of it's fabulous reviews on this web site. I have read 2001 A Space Odyssey (see my review) and rank it as one of my all time favourite books of the Sci Fi genre. Perhaps I was expecting too much with the books exellent reviews and the authors fine reputation.So what's wrong with the book? Nothing really, it's just not a very exciting story, and the characters are rather bland and under developed. There is an air of mystery, as we find out more and more about the purpose of the object they call Rama but not enough to excite.The book hangs purposefully for a sequel, but I don't think I want to find out any more really.My advice, read 2001, and if you really like that then give Rama a go. If you only thought 2001 was average, then you will not enjoy this book."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"This book will keep you guessing until the end. It is exciting and adventurous. Clarkeis the greatest at giving the reader something to truly envision. i cant wait to see howthe movie will be, and how much similar my ideas were to Morgan Freeman's."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"A review by SteveThe aftermath of the meteor impact in the near future results in the creation of Spaceguard, an advanced search-and-destroy system to prevent any further meteors and asteroids to hit Earth. In the 23rd century, Spaceguard finds a large, cylindrical object flying towards the sun at a thousand kilometers a second. This object, dubbed \\"Rama,\\" becomes a possible threat to the human race. As it closes in on an orbit around the Sun near Mercury, Earth sends the Endeavor to investigate its origins and purpose.The characters are well developed in this story. I especially like Norton, the commander of the expedition. His character, as a commander, is pretty realistic, and often \\"refers\\" to the old James Cook for advice. The subject of this story very well appeals to me. It's science fiction, and about finding out origins and solving mysteries about unknown beings; these kinds of stories I enjoy. The story's language is understandable to me, but sometimes it's difficult to understand the \\"flashbacks\\" that appear here and there, such as Spaceguard's creation. The plot tends to accelerate strongly in the end, with plenty of details to tell what is going on. The conflict never changes, always trying to figure out how the Rama works. The story's ending is satisfying though. The ending, though, goes from a final search of New York, running away, then leaving Rama within a few pages, which is kind of dull, but still exciting in some way. Even so, the story is too long. It could have been shorter, because there was so much detail to read through that were just excess. I was relieved, though, when the story ended, because Rama had made its last, climatic move, and Dr. Rebera's realization of Raman's tendency to do everything in threes.I would recommend this book to other readers. It's an easy read, and the details about Rama are astounding. I'm pretty sure only Science Fiction readers will appeal to this, because of the book's details about spaceships, Spaceguard, the Ramans, and the \\"biots.\\" Overall, please read this book. You'll probably like it."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"Clarke wrote truly great concept scifi novels, in which the science is as important as the characters, if not more so.Is this novel, the science is Rama, a massive space ship that is discovered hurtling towards the solar system. The adventure is a crew that goes on board, not knowing what they will find. What distinguishes this novel, in addition to the slowly unfolding exploration inside the massive space craft, is that the purpose of the craft remains a tantalizing mystery. This whet the appetite of my imagination as few scifi novels have ever done, leaving a puzzle that the reader can fit together and manipulate in countless ways. Indeed, for a while in my insomnia, I imagined things about the creators to help me drift off to sleep.Because Clarke strives for such realism, he refrains from making his books into comic-book silly swashbucklers. I believe that this is why some readers find them unsatisfying. But if you are into hardscifi, this is the truly, truly best that you can find. It places a seed in the imagination that can last a lifetime, the mark of a classic."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"In 2130 an asteroid-tracking system discovered a titanic extrasolar object approaching the sun. Soon it was discovered that the object - dubbed &quot;Rama&quot; - was hollow. The dispatched expedition confirmed its artificial origins and discovered something far more startling - after its million-year sleep, Rama was awakening...As readers of science fiction, we expect a string of easy answers to follow every question. &quot;Rama&quot; does the reverse - it answers none of the questions it poses. It is intentionally unfulfilling. Clarke almost flaunts his cardboard characters, and the quixotic portrayal of humanity (the squabbling, the polygamy, the &quot;orbital orgies&quot;), and in doing so he expertly draws a stark contrast between Man and Rama. The book is very nearly a dystopia.However, on the surface &quot;Rama&quot; is flat and dispassionate, continually anticlimactic, essentially lacking in tension, reader engagement, plot and character development. The science has turned sour since the book was written in the seventies - there is an obvious disparity between cause and effect (colonies on Mercury and Triton, but astronomers still have to apply for &quot;computer time&quot;?). Any reader who isn't &quot;in&quot; on Clarke's ruse will hardly find any portion of the book interesting, possibly excepting Rama's intricate structure (I found it to be a mental exercise equalling the Battle Room in &quot;Ender's Game&quot;). On a purely visual level, there is quite a number of things to see inside Rama: several cities, enormous spires, and organic sea - especially fun since Rama's inhabitable surface is the inside, so the sea is overhead as well as underfoot (prepare for an upside-down tidal wave!). However, if that were the book's sole appeal, Clarke would've surely gone with an impersonal &quot;journal&quot; format - or not have written it at all. The contrast between the stock characters and the alien hulk increases enjoyment, even if the characters are a nuisance."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"Good book, interesting ideas, very science orientated, but as such dry for general reading. The exploration part and theory in the book is great, truely thought provoking, like tornadoes in a huge rotating cylinder in space and the use of SIMPs, super chimps for household maintainence, but the drama of the book, like space, is void. Character development is not the purpose of this book and is treated as such. Also the plot is not the book's basis and is....lacking. They find an alien ship, they go in, they explore, they leave. Not a Stienbeck by any means. But in fairness, it isn't meant to be either. An OK read."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"This book is and always will be the best of the forst three. (I have not yet been able to get to Rama Revealed [7-1-97])This is the best of them all because of Clarke's pure, untouched authorship of it. It is not interfered with by the ideas of Gentry Lee.I also like the way the whole concept is introduced to the reader of a Moon-sized spaceship sailing into the Solar System without explanation.When I was in the middle of the book I said to myself, &quot;C'mon just read the last sentence. It won't give it away!&quot; I then discovered that I shouldn't have done that. If you are reading this book now, wait for the ending to come to you. It will be much better that way. I would also suggest reading these things in order. Backward suspense just doesn't work for me. You will probably be able to guess the ending sentence or idea if you know the whole plot, or noticed anything odd about Raman culture. I will say no more about that.What got this one a 9 was that the characters aren't as 3-dimensional as they are in the other novels. That was the purpose for Gentry in the next books. RamaII is splendid, but Garden of Rama is just plain UGLY in some places. This sone takes the cake as far as story goes.

It sparked a life-long interest in sci-fi that has never gone away.Recently in a used bookstore I found a copy, bought it, and reread it. I was just as good, if not better than I remembered. It's interesting how some of Clarke's literary predictions of where technology might evolve over the next 200 years have already been surpassed by our own advances. I found the passage which referred to &quot;failure of a 50 cent capacitor&quot; amusing. 50 cents will buy you a lot of capacitance today. In the 22nd century...? I can't imagine.Great book. Buy it.

If you like true sci-fi this is an essential title. An advice,when I read the other tree books in the series I feel got really BORED.

I was disappointed by the remainder of the Rama series, due mainly I am sure to the collboration with Gentry Lee.

Whether introducing to us a new world or taking us into the heart of an alien culture, Clarke is without a doubt the grand master of witty imaginings.Rendezvous with Rama moves at such a steady rate that before you know it it is already the end. At that point, many readers (those who are without possession of the other books in the series) find themselves plunging down the dark corridors of thought, seeking, desperately, to understand the mysterious introduction of the Raman ship, and the Raman civilization altogether!The book is written with such beauty, such artistic effort, that it couldn't help but be an instant classic. Readers of all ages find something spectacular about the book. It is the trademark of who Clarke was, and anyone reading it will find immediate favor in the author.Rendezvous with Rama deserves the highest regards from every generation. It contains very few curse words (it would be better if it contained no curse words) and all the scenes are relatively clean; making it a rare jewel among the classics. And the primary intention is not horror or sex (like most other books of this genre) but pure exploration. Adventure is at the heart of its meaning.Good job, Clarke!---C.S. Harmon, author of \\"To the Ends of the Earth\\" coming out September 2006."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"Of all his works, this is my favourite. The story of Rama is told with something that Clarke rarely displays in even his best work: that ineffable quality that the French call &eacute;lan.Some of his novels are given to large themes, like the fate of humanity in Childhood's End. Other works excel in the small, like the technological miracles making up everyday life in The City and the Stars. But in this work, both large and small matters are treated equally: with an imaginative scope that defies comparison.This is the story about a first alien encounter that Steven Spielberg could only wish he had created. Unlike Close Encounters, this story does not feign significance through flashing lights or latex prosthetics. The aliens are so much more interesting for remaining mysterious. It is an exquisite balancing act of startling revelations and teasing mystery.The story is constructed like an onion. An alien ship is detected entering our solar system and an opportune survey ship is dispatched to investigate. The crew enter the starship and uncover its secrets layer after splendid layer. Every chapter springs a surprise; but they are not the cheap surprises of a dime novel. They are, instead, dazzling surprises; like the first time you learned that your uncle was a Nobel laureate; that he was one of a set of twins; that the other won a Pulitzer; that to this day, dad keeps it in the same drawer as his socks.Some reviewers will disparage this work for its shallow characters and its insipid prose. Such criticism is accurate, but it is also silly and beside the point. Expecting deep characters and Shakespearean phrasing from Clarke is like expecting a symphonic work from the Rolling Stones. Clarke isn't setting out to write literature. He is writing speculative fiction, the essence of which remains the one overriding commandment: \\"above all else, the imagination must shine\\". In this work, Clarke's imagination shines as never before.The most striking thing about this book is how consistently creative it is. Most authors find a single creative vein, stake a claim to it, then spend the remainder of the novel working it for all it is worth. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with this. After all, creativity is precious and rare, and when one hits upon an especially rich vein, one cannot be blamed for mining it. Nonetheless, in Rama, Clarke opens up new veins in practically every chapter. As readers, we are not dependent on one theme to carry the novel, but are privy to a wealth of material that continually overwhelms us with awe.Nor is anything left unresolved. All elements are directed at bringing the whole novel to fruition, but in a way that is not neat, not tidy, not contrived. The ending leaves endless scope for our own speculations and is all the more satisfying for doing so.Like his other great work, 2001, Clarke creates a brilliant stand-alone masterpiece. However, the sequels are simply brutal. This is one of those books that should be treated with finality. It won the Hugo, Nebula and Campbell awards and deserves every one of them. If you own a copy of this book, don't make the mistake of lending it. You'll never see it again."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"Published in 1973, Arthur C. Clarke's RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA was something of a surprise: a science fiction novel that easily transcended its own genre. Winning a multitude of awards, the novel was widely read even by those who professed a dislike of science fiction, and more than thirty years later it remains a favorite.In some respects the novel is difficult to describe, for to do so will damage the experience of a first-time reader. By the year 2130 mankind has spread throughout the solar system--and scientists identify an object thought to be a large asteroid just outside the orbit of Jupiter. As the sun's gravity draws it nearer, however, it becomes apparent that the object now named Rama is not a natural one. It is man's first visitor from the stars, and the spacecraft Endeavor is scrambled to intercept. What they find is completely unexpected.The single most powerful element of the novel is its complete plausibility. The various scientific advances described by Clarke do not seem in the least contrived; they instead arise logically from the science of our day. The story itself is unique, dismissing both \\"alien invasion\\" cliches and the tired fantasy of the so-called \\"space opera\\" style; there is not the faintest whiff of fantasy, and everything is grounded by Clarke's simple and direct writing style.For several years the film industry has been awash in rumors of a movie version--and at this time it does seem that one is in the offing. But it will have to go quite a way to equal the novel, which remains one of the most completely original in all of science fiction literature. Fun, tantalizing, memorable--all the overworked adjectives really do apply to RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA. I strongly recommend it.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"Arthur C Clarke was a great writer with a very economical style.

I was held in rept wonder at the scale of the authors vision. I highly recommend."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"I've read many of Arthur C. Clarke's books and this one is very unique. The plot is great, and the environment is spectacular. Not only could I envision Rama in my head, I felt like I could smell, and taste the environment as well. I often see people complaining that Arthur C. Clarke doesn't care about characterization. Well, I think that his characters are great the way they are. He gives a bit of background information on each character, then he focuses on what he or she is doing and feeling in the current situation. That method works well in the complex science fiction writings of Clarke's books. Who cares about their past when they are experiencing something that will drastically alter their future? Rendezvous with Rama is incredible and suspenseful. I must warn you though, that you will not find all the answers you are looking for in the book. You get a good sense of what is really going on, then you have to use your imagination to fill in the blanks. I would recommend this book to just about anyone with a good imagination, who is looking for a unique experience."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"Now this is what I've been looking for in sci-fi. The book is filled with imaginative, atmospheric imagery. The characters are barely developed, but I didn't really care. When the world they inhabit is this rich, who cares about the characters? I felt as if I were there with them, and the last thing I want to know is their life story. The book ends a little anticlimatically, but I enjoyed the ride and may check out the reviled sequels for myself."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"Among Arthur Clarke's books, some are not as well received as others. \\"Rendezvous with Rama\\" is among Clarke's more highly regarded works. Much of the plot reveals elements in science fiction that have not yet been explored. For this reason alone, fans of science fiction should not skip this book.An object moving toward Earth was thought to have several different origins. But upon closer inspection, it was revealed to be geometrically perfect cylinder. Of course, this discovery does not end with the outside of the cylinder that came to be known as Rama. As humans enter Rama, it creates conflict on a number of levels. First, the explorers must face conflict with the elements inside Rama. The revelations of the world inside the cylinder are all the more interesting because they seem to agree with laws of science. In addition, humans cannot find a new resource without creating a massive disagreement about it. Conflict between the people on Earth, Mars, and Mercury muddies the waters in attaining the ultimate goals in Rama's exploration.Aside from the book in purely scientific perspective, I thought the social situations developed in the book were well balanced. For the future, the conflicts and their reasons were logical. Because the other books in the Rama series have received a storm of negative reviews, I am not keen to read them. I am led to believe the ending of this novel completes the story well."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"First published in 1972 this is one of the major SF classics - and it aged well, even if the description of human civilization in the Year of Grace 2130 is... well, quite weird.In 2130 the \\"Spaceguard\\" early warning system, designed to protect Earth and other colonized planets in Solar System from wandering asteroids, detects an object of quite respectable size (about 55 kilometres long and 20 kilometres large), coming from interstellar space. This newcomer is named Rama and observed by astronomers with considerable interest, as it is the first asteroid from outer space ever to be identified in Solar System. But as Rama comes closer to the heart of the Solar system, scientists start to discover discrepancies in its movement and aspect. And finally there is no more doubt: Rama is not an asteroid but a giant artefact, made by intelligent creatures. Is it a giant scientific probe? Is it an interstellar missile send to destroy human race? Is it a starship? Or maybe only the dead wreck of a starship? Is there something inside Rama? Is there SOMEBODY inside Rama?Because of Rama's peculiar orbit and late discovery of its artificial character, only one human ship can catch up with it and explore, before this giant \\"artefact\\" leaves our Solar System forever. Spaceship \\"Endeavour\\", on a routine \\"solar meteorology\\" survey mission, will manage to land on Rama... All the rest is for you to discover.There are two reasons for which this book MUST be rated five stars. First, there is the great quality of writing. The suspense is permanent and almost insufferable - I didn't sleep most of the night to finish this book, because I simply COULDN'T wait to discover what will happen on the next page, and then on the next one, etc. etc. The second reason is the scientific quality of this book. Arthur C. Clarke did his best to stick to the \\"hard science\\" and it gave this book a very unique flavour, rarely seen in recent SF (by recent I mean post 1990). Author also managed to convey the scientific points in a very accessible way. I humbly admit that I am not very good at mathematics, physics and astronomy, but even me I managed to understand most of the scientific aspects of \\"Mission Rama\\" (or at least I believe I did). To say things shortly - \\"Rendez vous with Rama\\" is a great story, told in a great way!Now, this book also has some weaker points, the same which (in my personal opinion), always hurt a little Arthur C. Clarke books. His visions of possible future societies were always somehow blurred by a mixture of three factors: his misanthropy, his detestation of religions (all of them) and his troubled sexual life, of which the homosexuality was possibly the LESS unorthodox aspect.In this book Clarke's misanthropy runs rampant when he describes, with an evident pleasure, the forced reduction of human population of Earth to one billion - and extremely draconian laws preventing it to ever go over this limit... The very idea that any centralized, planet wide bureacracy could so completely control human's reproductive rights only 120 years from now is a really depressing thought... Clarke's deep dislike of religions is well illustrated by the joke placed in this book about the last Christians surviving still amongst more \\"enlightened\\" people - but in this reality those \\"Christians\\" actually believe that Jesus was an alien and they expect Him returning in a spaceship...Another weird Clarke's prejudice was his pathological, visceral contempt towards farming and farmers. In his reflexion on \\"Raman\\" civilization he makes one of the explorers say \\"there is no way that a civilization so advanced could still tolerate the existence of an activity so low as farming\\". That is in my opinion one of the most irrationally stupid statements in all the \\"hard\\" SF... (but, to be fair, being myself a descendant of peasants, I am probably particularly touchy on this point...).But it is the future societies attitude towards sexuality that is possibly the most troubling element of this book. Clarke clearly hoped that all sexual rules of our current Western societies would disappear in XXII century, to leave place to \\"anything goes\\" - an almost total absence of any rules and traditions. In this book both polygamy and polyandry are a perfectly normal thing and are legally recognized - and we are expected to believe that two or more wives of the same man are good friends... Marriages are also open - nobody even expects men and women to remain faithful to their partners. Sex is considered to be such a completely casual thing, that a polygamous married man can still bed openly a third woman without hesitation and everybody thinks it is just fine. Which is more, for Clarke there was clearly nothing wrong when in a hierarchical structure the commander of a ship called one of his female subordinates to lay with him. Homosexual relations and marriages are in this society accepted by everybody without exception - and even more, homosexual relations between crew members of a spaceship are ENCOURAGED, especially if they work together in the same field! Even more curious was his invention of bisexual-triangular marriage, in which two men first marry before taking together a common wife (or the contrary, two lesbians marry first and then add a man)...Well, 120 years may be a lot of time, but I really do not see general acceptance and legal consecration of such practices coming easily... And religions are also not going anywhere - if anything they now play an even stronger role in world affairs that 40 years ago.But other than those somehow extravagant elements, reflecting author's personal obsessions, this is an absolutely splendid book! I had great time reading it!

The only book that compares to it is 'Childhood's End', also written by Arthur C. Clark. I won't discuss the plot as Amazon has already provided a beautiful description of the book.There was only one problem with the book - It's too short and static.

I'm currently making an effort to read some of the older sci-fi classics that I probably should have read when I was much younger. RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA is one of those novels, and I must admit some disappointment with this book.As another reviewer pointed out, Clarke is not particularly interested in plot or characterization. Instead, he is interested in describing (in a rather detailed, grandiose manner) an alien world that humanity has recently discovered. Much of this is certainly interesting, but doesn't get really compelling until perhaps the final thirty pages or so. None of the characters are particularly memorable, which makes it hard to care about them during the novel's repetitive action scenes. The ending is deliberately anti-climactic, which I found something of a letdown.Still, RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA is an intelligent novel filled with big ideas, and is widely considered a classic (it has also spawned multiple sequels). It's a short read, and I don't regret spending the time on it. As with a lot of science fiction, however, it lacks an emotional element that made my reading experience a somewhat sterile one."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"After reading many different genres of fiction it seems my target zone is sci-fi/horror, but there are very few novels which fit both categories. 'Rendezvous with Rama' doesn't have many traces of horror, but for the characters involved it would be horrifying. Exploring an extremely high-tech spaceship the size of Earth's moon (but inside out) in complete darkness at first would be an awesomely terrifying endeavor.This is just the first 50 pages of course, as the rest of the book tells of how the characters explore the ship in what limited time they have before it's trajectory takes it too close to the sun. The subsequent events are so amazing that there's no room for cheesy romantic sub-plots and other unnecessary additions... which is what I love so much about it. I'd almost say it was written somewhat 'dry' which to me is a good thing. In order to achieve the eerie ambiance there couldn't have been any unnecessary flare.The only negative comments I've heard about the book is that there \\"isn't enough character development\\". If you put yourself in any of the characters shoes (at least the ones exploring the ship) you wouldn't be chatting with the rest of the group, asking about their sex lives back on Mars..."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"Arthur C. ClarkeRendezvous with RamaBantam, Paperback, 1990.12mo. 243 pp.First published, 1973.================================================='I guess I might be a victim of FBS (First Book Syndrome). Just like some people have read \\"Of Human Bondage\\" at a very impressionable age and no other book of Somerset Maugham was quite comparable to it later, so it is with me, Arthur Clarke and his \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" (1968). However, this is not to say that \\"Rendezvous with Rama\\" is not a great book. Even though it doesn't quite have the sweeping grandeur of the first \\"Odyssey\\", reading \\"Rama\\" is linked with a mental explosion of similar magnitude - a typically Clarkian phenomenon indeed.Yet again, among many other things while reading Clarke, I wish I had at least a tiny part of his boundless imagination and sheer literary genius. The latter is particularly amazing. Clarke's writing style is simplicity itself: short chapters, short paragraphs, short sentences; no obscure vocabulary, no pretentious descriptions, no nonsense; no muddled passages and unfailing lucidity from cover to cover. And he says so much. Clarke's descriptions of Rama are as visionary and haunting as few I have ever encountered on paper. The stairways of Himalayan dimensions (and changing gravity), the ever-changing Cylindrical Sea with its half-kilometer high Southern \\"shore\\", the immense and mysterious \\"cities\\", the \\"South pole\\" with its gigantic spears, the whole world of Rama - a cylinder 50 km long, 16 km in diameter, hollow but full wonders - is so evocatively described that once experienced it is never forgotten. Nor is Clarke's insight into his characters less spectacular. A short quote would make this clear:\\"As he came closer to the South Pole, he began to feel more and more like a sparrow flying beneath the vaulted roof of some great cathedral - though no cathedral ever built had been even one-hundredth the size of this place. He wondered if it was indeed a religious shrine, or something remotely analogous, but quickly dismissed the idea. Nowhere in Rama had there been any trace of artistic expression; everything was purely functional. Perhaps the Ramans felt that they already knew the ultimate secrets of the universe, and were no longer haunted by the yearnings and aspirations that drove mankind.\\"\\"That was a chilling thought, quite alien to Jimmy's usually not very profound philosophy. He felt an urgent to resume human contact, and reported the situation back to his distant friends.\\"The general accusation of shallow characterisation in Clarke's books doesn't hold good as far as \\"Rama\\" is concerned. To be sure, this is no character-driven book - indeed, I would be greatly surprised if there is any such book, among Clarke's oeuvre or in the sci-fi genre as a whole. But, as I have said before, what Clarke's characters may lack in terms of complexity and development, they more than compensate for in vividness and variety. Among the crew of Endeavour there are a religious devotee, an old movie buff and an amateur sportsman of considerable accomplishment, as evident from his participation in the Lunar Olympics. All these fellows are remarkably alive and true to life, the only minor exception being that the Olympics are still very much Earth-bound. Besides, Clarke's economy should not be mistaken with superficiality. His characters - from Captain Norton, who is something of a protagonist, to the most minor ones - have delightful complexity. They are brave and courageous, proud and vain, clever and naive, self-possessed and hysterical. They are human. They are real.Another often repeated accusation, this time against Rama in particular, is that nothing happens in the end. Well, this may be true in some very restricted sense. But the value of \\"Rama\\" does not lie in the end. It is the quest itself. It is remarkable, to say the least, how adroitly Clarke manages to give his limited action a great deal of suspense. The novel is largely told from two major view points which constantly alternate and keep the reader on the edge between the known and unknown, supplying enough hypothesis and speculations to keep his imagination at work. On the one side, there are Captain Norton and his crew investigating the enormous interior of Rama, which is full of surprises and dangers, one more wondrous than the other. On the other side, there is the so called \\"Rama Committee\\" in which the finest brains of the Solar Systems are collected together in order to give all the help they could to the Skipper and his men. Both parties discuss very much the same but the number of repetitions is negligible and the fecundity of different points of view is compelling. Both groups of characters are centered around a \\"protagonist\\" - Captain Norton and Professor Perera, respectively - but their thoughts and opinions are neither dogmatic nor the only ones stated, directly or not. Again a short quote, from the very last chapter, may show better than anything else Clarke's ability to delve into his characters and to inspire his readers with visions of unimaginably advanced alien civilisations:[Possible spoiler ahead.]\\"He had succeeded on this mission beyond all reasonable expectation. What his men had discovered in Rama would keep scientists busy for decades. And, above all, he had done without a single casualty.\\"\\"But he had also failed. One might speculate endlessly, but the nature and the purpose of the Ramans was still utterly unknown. They had used the Solar system a refueling stop, a booster station - call it what you will; and had then spurned it completely, on their way to more important business. They would probably never even know that the human race existed. Such monumental indifference was worse than any deliberate insult.\\"Imagine a culture that builds spaceships bigger than a large city and uses our beloved Sun merely as a \\"refueling stop\\"!I think it was Stanislav Lem, another giant of the sci-fi genre, who once said that he writes about his own contemporaries, even though he dresses them in space garments. The same is very much true of Arthur Clarke as well. I don't know if this was a deliberate stratagem of him, but it is certainly significant that the main conflict in Rama, far from being between different civilisations, ultimately boils down to the madness so typical of the human race; it is a small consolation that the major players are the Hermians, that is natives of Mercury. (After all, this is the 22nd century, man has colonized three planets and four satellites in the Solar System, and the nightmare of 172 members in the United Nations has been replaced by the \\"sometimes bad enough\\" seven members of the United Planets.) Perhaps the finest thing about science fiction in general and Arthur Clarke in particular is that it does put the mankind on a truly universal scale. Our cosmic vanity (how dare they ignore us like that!) and our essential immaturity (well, if it comes to that, we can always use lasers to open the thing!), to say nothing of our infinite foolishness, are mercilessly exposed. Despite counterbalancing virtues like spirituality and morality that we do also have, the overall effect of the encounter with Rama is, for me, one of genuine and awe-inspiring humility. And comfort, because we are not alone.All that and a great deal more that no review can ever hope to express is brilliantly conveyed by Arthur Clarke, constantly spiced up with perfectly controlled short digressions and his absolutely inimitable sense of humour. As regards the former, my personal favourite is the touching tribute to James Cook (you didn't think the name \\"Endeavour\\" was incidental, did you?) that gives a beautifully concise portrait of the famous captain in but a few paragraphs. As for Clarke's brilliant wit, it has a dose of flippancy as precisely calculated as any celestial orbit. Whether with an imaginative use of ordinary words, a charming metaphor or a delicious historical associations, Clarke always amuses me immensely. Here is one example that made me laugh aloud:\\"I think we were extremely lucky, considering that he was the only man available at such short notice. We might have had the usual run-of-the-mill captain.'' He sounded as if he was referring to the typical peg-legged scourge of the spaceways, pistol in one hand and cutlass in the other.\\"I very much doubt there is a fan of Arthur Clarke, or a sci-fi buff, who hasn't read \\"Rendezvous with Rama\\". To all others who happen to be interested in thought-provoking books that stretch human imagination to its limits and explore profoundly one of the most important matters of eternal speculation, this novel cannot be recommended highly enough. Sure it delivers more questions than answers, more hypothesis and theories than facts and figures. Then again, this is the case with every thinking creature. That's what makes Arthur Clarke a great writer and \\"Rendezvous with Rama\\" one of his finest books: a strong appeal which is both emotional and intellectual. For my part, I know that I am never quite the same after each (re-)reading. And I never again look with the same eyes at the starry night sky."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"Rendezvous with Rama is about humanity's first contact with an alien spacecraft. A large unknown cylindrical object (which is dubbed 'Rama') has entered the solar system and it's the job of a small crew on a ship called the Endeavour to land on the object and investigate. At first Rama doesn't seem like much more then just a big empty cylinder but as the crew investigates further they find that Rama is much more than that. Soon more questions are raised than answered and the crew on the Endeavour goes on mind-bending investigations to learn more about this odd space craft.Rendezvous with Rama is a very fast-paced read that never really gets boring. Some of the scenes Clark describes are truly mind-bending. Clark's prose is simple but effective enough to make these scenes pop right out of the pages. The character development is a bit lacking but I don't think Clark was aiming for deep characters anyways; this book is all about the scenery.I highly recommend this book! If you are unfamiliar with Clarks work then this is a great place to start!"},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"I've been on a sci-fi literature kick lately and picked up this great hardcover the other week. Never read the story before, and I'm playing catch-up with the classics of sci-fi right now. I liked this story a lot, it's quick and easy read, but refreshing. I don't read much as I'm more of a movie watcher myself, but it was nice to read a sci-fi story like this. The characters acted logical, and weren't treated viciously by the story. For anyone who hasn't read it, I'm I was one of the last, read it!"},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"Aside from 2001, the masterpiece of the late Arthur C. Clarke is generally considered to be \\"Rendezvous with Rama,\\" winner of the Hugo Award. \\"Rama\\" is unique in the science fiction genre, since it doesn't opt for flashy action scenes with space aliens, or far-flung notions such as a time travel machine. Rather, Clarke writes about what civilization might look like in a couple hundred years, and what an encounter with extra-terrestrial intelligence might be like.The plot's simple enough. An asteroid-like object is observed, only to be discovered that the size and orbit preclude it from being an asteroid- it must be a spaceship, and is named after the Hindu god Rama, since the Greek and Roman gods have been exhausted. The Federation of Planets sends a team to make a rendezvous with Rama. Rama is basically a gigantic cylindrical object, with no observable space launch mechanism, and absolutely no sign of life inside, not even microbes. The only thing of note is some frozen organic mix of water at the bottom. Suddenly, lights come on in Rama, and the planet seems to come alive. The explorers realize they may need to deal with hurricanes, among other things, as the mixture of the now-melted water with closer proximity to the Sun could cause some problems. In addition, there may be some intelligence on Rama after all. What is it? Read and find out.Clarke took a simple idea, and it expands all by itself. If we ever have an encounter with extra-terrestrial intelligence, I think it will be unlike anything depicted in the science fiction genre, as Rama is. Finally, Clarke's novel reminds us that the universe is much bigger than out planet, and if we want to be a part of it, we must learn to think bigger."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"Okay, so after a long affair with fantasy lit, I decided to branch out into SF. Since I'd read the Foundation series and Starship Troopers back in the day, I decided to introduce myself to the one member of the holy trinity of Science Fiction I hadn't read yet, Clarke. Based on reviews here I thought Rama might be my speed so I ordered the cheapest used copy and prepared myself for.... I don't know.... a genius who would overwhelm me with his vastly superior intelligence? I guess I'd read so much about how Great the man was that I had this expectation that he'd be, well, Impressive and Deep.Silly me. I guess I really didn't expect it to be fun. Short, bite-sized chapters that were easy to rip thru and a story that quietly drew me in and kept me fascinated from one discovery to the next. I guess I owe one to Mr. Clarke. A genius who's fun too. I'd almost forgotten those two could go together."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"I picked this book up after reading the reviews on Greg Bear's \\"Eon\\" on Amazon. I have not read that title, but was going to, until I saw the aforementioned review. It basically said that if you wanted a much better version of \\"Eon\\", read Clarke's Rama.Very glad I took that advice. This book was a page turner from the get go. I finished it in two sittings. I was captivated by the story, the writing and the ideas. Clarke is a fantastic author that I am a bit embarrassed to say I had never read before (no, not even 2001).The book spoke to humanity's isolation and lack of understanding of the universe to me. We are so occupied by our own little world that we fail to completely fathom what possibilities lay beyond our view and understanding. Rama was and remained a mystery, even though the explorers in the story made contact and explored the vessel (I assume the later books go deeper). The extreme size, both in physical attributes and the length of time this artifact existed were just incomprehensible to the explorers (and the reader gets that sense as well), who spent much of the time simply trying to cope with the grand scale of it all, for they were just human.And that is the point of this story to me: What we think we know can become a blinder to the totality of what is out there to be known. The vastness of the universe boggles my mind, and to think that we have all the answers is absurd. We must continue to search in the darkness with an open mind and realize that we are but small matters in such a grand expanse of possibilities.I recently picked up the next two books in the series, \\"Rama II\\" and \\"Garden of Rama\\". I cannot wait to read these, but I anticipate that the best book of the bunch is the original, as it goes in just about any series.Highly recommended.Mr. P."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"I just reread my old copy of this novel.

Science, both technical and social, is demonstrated to a degree that will inevitably draw you into this elaborate and intriguing story. Every aspect of the book seems to have been honed to perfection. You constantly find yourself looking back and saying, &quot;Yeah, that does seem like the logical way that would happen...why didn't I see that?&quot; It's all here. The plot is engrossing, the technical details about a very real future are fascinating, and the characters are as real as those you would read about in the paper or see on the evening news. Clarke writes a &quot;dry&quot; style, as some say, but that's what life is like: you never actually see the whole picture. Rama is a wonderful book, written in an irresistable style, that no reader should overlook. And you won't be reading a book for long...it becomes all too real."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"I recently read the classic science-fiction novel, \\"Rendezvous with Rama.\\" The actual plot revolves around a mysterious alien spacecraft (nicknamed Rama) that enters the Solar System, and the expedition sent to intercept and explore the ship. I must say that, from a technical standpoint, the novel is incredible. Rama is described in detail with a lot of interesting and intricate structures to explore and discover. If someone wanted to imagine what it would be like to stand on a generation ship (i.e. a spaceship designed to support generations of life during centuries-long travel from one solar system to another), this novel is the best I've ever seen.Unfortunately, I didn't come to this book to see what it was like to walk around on a generation ship. I came to read an actual story. In that sense, the novel fails miserably. There's no real plot, other than \\"astronauts dock with Rama, astronauts explore Rama, astronauts leave Rama with data.\\" Sure, there are some minor moments of tension when they first board Rama, a crew member seems to be lost, and a human government tries to destroy Rama. But those moments are few and far between, and are really just gimmicks that are resolved far too quickly.I'm going to spoil a major part of this novel because it's critical to my point; there are no living alien beings on Rama. It's a dead ship. That's established fairly early on in the novel, taking away a major portion of interest and tension for me. Besides losing out on the classic \\"human meets alien\\" moment, the novel then becomes a frustrating mystery that is never resolved. We never do find out who built Rama or why, because there's no one to answer the question. This leaves the novel showing astronauts wandering around a dead ship. There are some creatures that they encounter, but all of them are \\"biological robots\\" that literally have no brains, and do not interfere or interact with the astronauts in any significant way. Another missed opportunity - the robots could have added some tension if they attacked the astronauts as intruders or even accidentally injured them in the course of their duties.I didn't even think Rama was that realistic as an alien spacecraft. It's constructed perfectly and logically from a human standpoint, but it's an alien ship. Everything on Rama seems designed and constructed for human life forms. Even the handles on hatches were designed for human-like hands. For a moment in the novel, it looked like there was an explanation for why that might be...but that turned out not to be the case. So we have to believe that Rama's alien creators function in exactly the same way as humans. That stretches credibility for me, especially given the extremely realistic approach the rest of the novel had. The idea that extraterrestrials beings would be physically similar to humans seems, to me, an idea that's more convenient for sci-fi writers than realistic.\\"Rendezvous With Rama\\" is considered a classic in science-fiction and has won both the Hugo and Nebula Awards, the highest awards in science-fiction. Some would argue that proves that this is a solid novel. I would argue the opposite. I think the fact that such a dull novel is so popular proves that sci-fi is headed in the wrong direction. This book is Exhibit A on what's wrong with science-fiction today. I would argue that everyone who praises this novel is praising the realistic and detailed portrayal of the spaceship, not the actual novel. \\"Rendezvous with Rama\\" is not really a science-fiction novel. It's a dramatization of a schematic for a generation spaceship. This could have been an essay published in a science magazine and would have achieved the same effect. Scientists writing novels and short stories that are focused more on proving or describing their scientific theories than telling an actual story are taking the fun out of science-fiction."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"Well I'm sure all the Clarke fan boys and girls are going to hate this review but hey, I'm telling it like how I experienced ok?Mr. Clarke paints a fantastic world with Rama. It's very vivid and alive. He does very well in transporting you there. You just feel the awesomeness of it by the words he lays down.The problem I had with this book were two fold.1. There is almost zero character development to speak of. You don't really get to know the characters. How can you care for or relate to them if you don't really know who they are??? Granted they weren't the focus of the story but hey, you are exploring Rama through them so it would have been appropriate.Suffice it to say that Mr. Clarke instead predominantly focused on Rama at the sacrifice of the characters. I personally needed more development than what he provided. I mean if something bad happened to one of them I could have really cared less.2. The actions of the characters were very unbelieveable...*SPOILER ALERT!*||||||||||||||So lets see, there's a massive sea that defrosts, and they are cool with that...There is a hurricane, and they are cool with that....There is a massive electrical discharge from the horns, and they are good with that....Biots start crawling around, no problem...A missle is shot at them, no biggy...There's a tremor that sets off a massive wave, what ever. But then the lights start to go out and they all act like chicken little and run for it? HUH?!?!

For me? NO...I give it 3 stars for the great job Mr. Clarke does in bringing me into Rama and how his writing is so smooooooth. But thats about it. Nothing about Rama was disclosed, zero, zip, nada. Everything was speculation and assumptions, you as a reader \\"see\\" a lot of stuff but still know nothing about any of it at the end. As reading is an investment, I feel I got nothing in return as far as answers to questions the book raises in the beginning, tempts you with through out, and fails to deliver in the end.

The concept itself is fabulous, the images are breathtaking, the end is a cliff-hanger. However, I find it strange that Mr. Clarke's imagination was very limited and traditional when it came to certain aspects of technology and to gender-roles. Example: one hundred years in the future, in a time of exploding population, an astronaut can be found eating &quot;concentrated meat&quot; and one man may have more than one wife though nothing is said about polyandry. Also, the surveying and telecommunications technology seemed to be not as sophisticated as one might imagine will develop in the next 100 years. It felt like it was set 25 years in the future instead.

The characters become more perplexed with every event that takes place within it.We, the reader, are given enough information to make an assumption of what the purpose of this alien vessel may be - but there is also a lot of things going on inside Rama that could turn our guesses upside-down. Is it a transport ship of some kind? An ark? A probe? Or is it's purpose something that humans cant really comprehend?

Clarke. The Rama series is one of my favourite ever!"},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"Of the \\"Big Three\\" writers to come out of the pulp era of SF -- the other two being Asimov and Heinlein -- Clarke has suffered less in a fall in reputation. During the forties and fifties, SF was considered incompatible with good writing. This was not the opinion of those outside SF, but those inside it, like famed editor John W. Campbell, who felt that strong character studies and a deftly honed prose style detracted from what SF should be about: the imaginative depiction of scientific ideas, preferably in a futuristic and heroic setting. Campbell and others felt that it was worst than a waste of time to write well; it was, by his lights, wrong-headed. Times have changed. SF has become more and more a part of literature, both with mainstream writers like Marge Piercy and Margaret Atwood writing SF novels and with SF writers like Stanislaw Lem, Philip K. Dick, J. G. Ballard, and Ursula K. LeGuin. Especially after literary critics like Darko Suvin and Fredric Jameson began discussing SF seriously from within the academy, books that were of superior literary quality began to eclipse the older writers. Asimov and Heinlein have suffered enormously in the wake of these changes. Their character development is amateurish at best and their prose styles sloppy. Neither was, to put it bluntly, a good writer.So why has Clarke fared better than Asimov and Heinlein? I think there are two reasons, one good and one not so good. The not so good reason is the success of the great Stanly Kubrick film 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, based on the Clarke short story \\"The Sentinel.\\" Asimov and Heinlein were never associated with any projects anywhere near this excellent. The success of the film has, I think, made many people imagine that Clarke was a more skill writer (in the mainstream sense) than he was in fact. The second and better reason is that Clarke possessed a powerful scientific imagination. As other reviewers here have noted, he was quite terrible with character. To call his characters cardboardish is an insult to good cardboard. Nor is Clarke good with dialogue or writing memorable prose. But Clarke does excel at imagining some truly astonishing things and then embellishing them with brilliant ideas. His ideas are simply brilliant and some have already been adopted by scientists, like his imagining of the geostationary satellite. And in FOUNTAINS OF PARADISE he envisioned a space elevator, an idea that some scientists believe has definite potential and could become the primary way we reach outer space at some point in the future (his idea has been used in many other SF novels, probably never better than in Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars Trilogy). Many of the things that Clarke imagines are truly exciting and his imagination was never finer than in RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA.The notion is superficially outrageous. What observers in our solar system imagine at first to be a comet or meteor turns out to be an artificial object of inconceivably huge proportions. Measuring fifty kilometers long, it was more a self-propelled planet than a spaceship. There is very little plot. There is some political intrigue that serves to complicate matters a bit, but essentially it is the story of humans rendezvousing with what they have dubbed Rama and exploring it. What makes the book so brilliant is the sheer outrageousness of the description of Rama with the plausibility that he introduces in describing the extraordinary creation. Rama is such an amazing invention that any effort to introduce plot would have detracted from it. The book was less successful when he delved into future cultural and social developments. He unconvincingly imagines men taking more than one wife or women giving birth by more than one man (though interestingly, no relationships between men and men or between women and women). And the notion of genetically creating super intelligent chimps to perform routine tasks on the spaceships of the future was not very compelling. Still, the gigantic spaceship Rama, easily the largest ship ever imagined in SF, towers over everything else in the book. Clarke could have erred for more than he did and still have the novel be a highly memorable one. It is not Clarke's best book -- CHILDHOOD'S END is not merely his best book but one of the finest SF novels ever written -- but it is his most audacious one. No matter how SF literary trends evolve in the future, this book will survive, and deserves to do so."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"Rama fascinated me as a young child, and it still fascinates me today.

I have always thought that if you didn't have the time to read an entire book, or if for whatever reason you were determined not to, then it would be a really bad idea to start reading \\"Rendezvous with Rama.\\" I think it is impossible to start the book without finishing it! It's like every chapter is a new adventure; from the discovery of the mysterious space craft named \\"Rama\\", to the highly-anticipated scene of the explorers opening the hatch on the surface of the craft, to each level of exploration on the inside of the craft. I think of the giant \\"spiders\\", and the frozen sea. I remember reading the book for the first time and wondering what the mystery around the number \\"3\\" was. My mind goes wild just thinking about this extraordinary book! If you haven't read it, you definately should!Casey Sean HarmonThe Thousand Year Voyage"},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"This is how all sci-fi novels ought to be! It takes a sci-fi concept (alien space habitat) and extrapolates from it a fun and interesting story about first contact. It's better than a short novel; it's a long short story! No fluff, not even excessive character development to get in the way."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"Just before reading Rendezvous With Rama, I read Clarke's novel The City And The Stars. Like that book, Rama is all about imagination, but also unlike it, it's more about mechanically describing a scientifically plausible situation in the somewhat near future, rather than exploring grander themes, such as our ultimate destiny in the universe. The City And The Stars tells you everything and goes everywhere. It sees the universe as an unlimited playing field for exploration. Not so with Rama.The book is impressive in its single-mindedness. A giant (50 km long, 16 km wide) cylindrical alien space ship has entered the Solar System, and our astronauts have just a few weeks during which they can dock to it and explore the inside. That's it. Their exploration is detailed so meticulously, it's as if you're there. Things they can see and touch and explore, you can see and almost touch and explore. Things they can't really get to, or of which they can only get fleeting glimpses, will have to remain the same way for the reader.It's a page-turner. Every chapter is fascinating. There's zero human drama; it's just professionals doing their job and doing it well. If you love hard sci fi, this should be right up your alley. However, because of the book's unflinching realism and dedication to its premise, namely \\"human explorers examine an unknowable alien ship merely passing through the System,\\" you're almost guaranteed to be disappointed with the ending.Perhaps it's the years of indoctrination by Star Wars and Hollywood -- or perhaps I was just spoiled by Clarke's own City And The Stars -- but I can't help but want to know more, to get some kind of explanation or closure. I know, it's silly, but I can't lie. That's just the way it is."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"I used to be a huge sci-fi fan year ago and now I've almost forgotten how much fun these books were. Luckily, a reading challenge encouraged me to revisit this genre.\\"Rendezvous with Rama\\" is one of the most well known and critically acclaimed Clarke's novels, and rightfully so. The story takes place in a not so distant future, when a strange cylindrical object, later christened Rama, enters the solar system and travels directly towards our sun. Very soon it is discovered that this object is definitely artificial and a space craft is sent to investigate what exactly it is: is it a weapon sent to destroy the sun or inhabitants of the solar system, is it a modern day Noah's Ark, is it a miniature alien micro-planet? Clarke takes us on a journey to explore the mysteries of this fascinating object of alien intelligence.While the story lacks a little in character development (all of players are created only to help explore Rama's secrets), the story itself is an intriguing one. The alien world is richly developed and scientifically believable. I am actually quite amazed how real this creation of Clarke's seems. I am not up to date with developments in sci-fi genre and don't know how good or bad \\"Rendezvous\\" is compared to the latest books, but I have to say I am pleasantly surprised by this book. After finishing this novel, I am definitely inspired to check out more books written by Clarke."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"A classic SF novel that was well ahead of its time.

By the end of the book, I felt like a Simp. Perhaps that's the point! Read it, and don't bother with the sequels!PS - I felt the same way after first seeing the Matrix.

Rama has traveled the intergalactic spaces, making its way into Earth's solar system. What is it? Where has it come from? And to what purpose?Giving no signs of life, what should the United Planetary committee do? SSS Endeavor is dispatched to intercept and investigate. What will they find? Life? Or merely death?In the end, after all the scientific research has been completed, after all the drama of unilateral Hermian intervention, after Rama and its hidden secrets is gone Commander Norton is left questioning - no, ruing intergalactic indifference as he is forced to realize that whomever the Ramans are, whatever their purpose is, they more than likely never even knew of the existence of humanity, which bears to mind: just how significant are we as a species anyway. What sets us apart? What is our purpose?This is a truly well thought out masterpieces, full of technical, scientific fact. One criticism that I have is the role of the Superchimpanzees. Clarke takes the time to introduce them and make a case for their existence, but never employees them. Was it simply to breach the topic of genetic manipulation and the ethics of inherent to the issue?I give this book a solid four stars out of five on the following scale:+ poor read++ so-so read+++ good read++++ excellent read+++++ life changing read"},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"This book was a pleasant surprise.

It's revered as a classic, and I purposefully sought it out after reading all the glowing reviews for it. It's very imaginative and the world building on the spacecraft Rama is astounding. But it left me feeling a little flat... we go through all of the exploration and discovery of an object that's entered the Earth's solar system only to have it leave again in short order. I'm guessing that the idea of other beings, of having other life confirmed and being exposed to that confirmation is supposed to be enough, and maybe 40 years ago, when it was first published, throwing the idea out there was enough. But for me, it wasn't. I felt like there was all this buildup and then... nothing. Perhaps this was intended to whet my appetite for the sequel, but I think I'll pass."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"This story is pretty much well-known so reviewing this based on the story alone would be a simple rehashing. No, the book itself came very quickly and in perfect condition. Having had this in hard back was great and the loss of it in a house fire was devastating (I had quite a science fiction library.) Regaining \\"Rendezvous with Rama\\" is like shaking hands with an old pal. The story is a great one and just as I remember it, this time around, though, I don't feel guilty about opening up an old book and getting it mussy. I recommend the seller, reading, and reading Arthur C. Clarke in general."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"About a year ago I heard a BBC Radio 4 adaptation of RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA. The two-part serial, which was actually produced in 2009, was gripping. So I decided to read the novel. I knew I had serious reservations about Clarke's work, but I couldn't remember exactly why. Well, I can now. Sadly, he wasn't much of a writer. Although first published in the early 1970s, I was reminded of SF from the 30s and 40s. The book is populated by boy's own adventure heroes who speak in primly succinct exposition, even in the most stressful of situations. And Clarke's prose is entirely bereft of either style or nuance. But I don't deny the influence he had on the SF genre, and I think where he excelled was in his scientific insight, rather than his writing prowess. And that's what works here: the daunting world that is Rama. In essence then, although much of the strangeness and awe present in the radio drama is diminished in the book by poor characterisation and bland prose, what we're left with still packs a sense of wonder and is worth reading for that alone."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"I needed to escape and enjoy a respite so I looked back to an old favorite, Rendezvous with Rama! A classic from the mind of Arthur C, Clark and Gentry Lee, if you ever wondered if Sir Arthur deserved the accolades heaped upon him than this is an excellent example of his work.Imagine if you will a gigantic spacecraft entering into our Solar System! The first evidence that we are not alone and that evidence is inescapable! The speed of the incursion demands immediate action and the everyday man and woman tasked with uncovering the secrets must step up to the challenge, for the sake of mankind.There are three more books in the series and each book just gets better."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"This is one of my favorite books and I highly recommend it. Be warned though that it doesn't really follow the typically three act structure of most stories with introduction, conflict, then resolution. There is also little in the way of character development. What the book does do is something only science fiction and fantasy can in that it makes the environment and situation so compelling that traditional storytelling really isn't needed and would actually be distracting. In that way, it's kind of like the recent Ridley Scott film \\"Prometheus\\" where the situation and events are so fascinating that it just sucks you in. Unlike Prometheus though, Rama doesn't have characters that behave nonsensically or leave you confused and frustrated at the ending. Instead, Rama leaves you craving more....and you can get more as there are several additional books in the series that are more character driven but still keep the mystery and majesty of Rama alive."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"Rendezvous with Rama - This book is one of the many sci-fi classics that we have in our day. Written in 1972 by Arthur C. Clarke, this book is one of the first that addresses the concept of the stellar ark way of space travel. Earth is in a time of the exploration and exploitation of our solar system. With small ships that travel all around our solar system mining materials. An asteroid is spotted entering our system and though first mostly ignored, later turns out to be an alien cylinder like ship. The only people who can get there in time to study it before it leaves our solar system is a group of miners on their way home to earth. When they get to \\"Rama\\" which was the name given the asteroid before it was found to be a ship, they discover that what appeared to be a dead ship with no life at all inside, is waking up. It's something of a great mystery of what is going on with this ship. Why is it here? Is it hostile? What does it want with earth?As a avid science fiction reader I really enjoyed this book. Usually I read more modern takes on science fiction but lately I have been starting to take quite an interest in the works of early writers such as Orsen Scott Card, Isaac Asimov, and Arthur C. Clarke. I do like the style this book is written in. It is written in a time when technical mumbo jumbo lingo, made up just to sound like advanced technology, wasn't prevalent in writing. You get nothing sounding like star treks, trans warp plasma phase relay drive, or anything like that. You just get pure story written in terms that anyone can understand. It makes me think of how science fiction movies from the 50's and 60's era were and I like it. It's a refreshing read for someone who didn't grow up in those eras.The only complaint that I would have about the book is that sometimes it does seem to drag a bit. Just not enough is going on. Mostly at the very beginning with important background information and then a bit towards the middle after a while of exploring the ship only to find it dead. But after this it gets interesting. I really enjoyed the ending though but I won't spoil it for those who have not read the novel. Overall I thought this was a good turn of pace from new Sci-Fi books and think it's always a good idea to re visit some classics."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"Rendezvous With Rama... DO NOT spoil this book's double twist ending by reading the end first.It's debatable whether this or 2oo1 A Space Odyssey is Doctor Clark's best work. And it would be fun to see them both together as cinematic releases. There are at least a half dozen scenes in this book that wold be stunning, in modern 3D... As in 2oo1, the characters do lack development. But Clark has never been one for character driven stories. And his few attempts at such stories frequently ended up slowing to a crawl, as in the case of Imperial Earth. In this book however, Clark focuses on the thing he did so well, the thrill of the investigation and discovery.It's unfortunate that Dr. Clark created this story as he did... Demanding a sequel... without knowing where to take the next story. His co-author of the subsequent books, Gentry Lee, didn't bother to \\"reverse-engineer\\" the \\"behavior/facts\\" of Rama before sitting down to the word-processor.In MY opinion... this book is TOP drawer, hard science, science fiction... Mr. Lee's sequels are... not.We get our chance to put this book down and walk away during the first chapter. As Dr. Clark sets up the discovery of Rama. However by the time we all understand what has been discovered and how ill-prepared humanity is for such a discovery... it's to late. We are HOOKED.The story centers on the exploration of a 25-kilometer deep \\"LaGrange world\\" spaceship costing into the solar system from deep, interstellar, space. The thing's been in space for at least several thousands of years and... seems... to be a derelict.

Suddenly the whole the Solar System is abuzz with speculation on the nature of this spacecraft dubbed \\"Rama.\\" Only one ship, called \\"Endeavour,\\" is available to rendezvous with it. Headed by Commander Norton, the Endeavour's crew seeks to discover the mysteries of Rama.That is all I will say about the plot in this review as anything more would be spoilers. But suffice it to say that I found this to be exciting novel and it is no wonder why this is considered one of Arthur C. Clarke's greatest works. He utilizes hard science fiction to create a story that sounds reasonably plausible. As the mysteries of Rama continue to unfold, you will not want to stop reading just to find out what it will lead to next. This book is a real page turner.In conclusion, I would recommend this book to those who like science fiction."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"This is one of the classics I missed when I was younger.

Well worth the read in any case."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"I am a sucker for hard science and frivolous space antics and while I am really late to the party I still felt a childish sense of excitement when I read this.That being said this is not a frivolous book. The sense of realism and detail really caught my attention. Mr. Clarke went all out with hard facts without taking anything away from an enjoyable read. If anything the ability to immerse myself without needing to suspend reality made me enjoy it so much more.There is no need to tread on all the other reviews here so I will just say that this is a must read if for no other reason than the realization of how small and insignificant we really are."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"\\"Rendezvous with Rama\\" was one of my favorite Author C. Clarke books when I first started reading Sci-Fi, and it still holds up years later. While not a lot of character development and deep plot, this is written more as a \\"what if?\\" story for dealing with a monumental event that would have profound implications for mankind.No plot spoilers from me: The story tracks the events that occur when a huge craft (dubbed \\"RAMA\\"), obviously extraterrestrial in origin, enters our solar system. I like the pace and \\"hard science\\" feel that Clarke used to keep the plot believable, but understand why readers Clarke's of later Sci-Fi might not be accustomed to so little character development or edge of the seat excitement.This is a good one to pick up and read or reread!Highly Recommended!CFH"},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"The idea for this book is very original and teeming with potential. However, Clarke ultimately fails to deliver all that this book could have been. The characters are rather flat and there is not much at all in the way of plot until near the end. This book relies on the grandiose descriptions of Rama as its bread and butter. While these descriptions are good in and of themselves, they just aren't enough to form a masterpiece. I give Clarke credit for an incredibly creative idea here, but the book isn't strong enough in other areas for me to recommend it. If you're curious to read Clarke, I would point you to \\"Childhood's End\\" instead."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"We've all read scifi by brilliant minds with great technical ideas that somehow fell short in the storytelling department. And we've all read page-turners that gripped us, but didn't engage our minds.But if we're lucky, we've also read Arthur C. Clarke.&quot;Rendezvous with Rama&quot; is Clarke in peak form, combining great science with the kind of mysterious story that really sticks with you. The blend is perfect, and the pace of the revelations -- both scientific and dramatic -- is flawless.In fact, the science and fiction in this science-fiction story are so amazingly good that the shallowness of the characters doesn't hurt the story. A cornerstone of scifi is looking at how people behave in situations that are out of the ordinary. Normally, that means that we need compelling characters with lots of development, layers, internal conflicts and bad hair days. The first time I read this novel, I was put off by the anonymity of the characters. Not only don't they have first names (perfectly reasonable, given that it's a military expedition), but there's very little about them that helps me identify with them. It wasn't until my second or third reading that I realized why that doesn't matter here: becuase the story and the science are so deep, I was *already* involved in the novel, and didn't need to get into a character's head to find my place in the story.Sequels would do wonders for character development (though they were further examples of the dirty-old-man method of writing female characters), but wouldn't touch the sense of mystery, drama and even suspense that &quot;Rendezvous&quot; gave me. This isn't a library book; it's one you'll want to keep coming back to."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"Author Arthur Charles Clarke is one of the most revered names in the history of science-fiction writing. Clarke was the writing force behind Stanley Kubrick's seminal movie, \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\". Clark continued that series with \\"2010\\", \\"2061\\", and \\"3001\\". The \\"Space Odyssey\\" series may be his most commercially well known, but he also wrote highly acclaimed sci-fi novels such as \\"Childhood's End\\", \\"Songs of Distant Earth\\", and \\"The Hammer of God\\". In short, Clarke is one the most prolific and proficient science-fiction authors of our time. In addition to the novels mentioned above, Clarke was responsible for authoring the wildly successful \\"Rama\\" series (four books, the last three he co-authored with Gentry Lee). The first in that series, \\"Rendezvous with Rama\\" was awarded every conceivable honor for this genre of writing; the Hugo, Nebula, and Jupiter awards among others. Having recently read \\"Rendezvous...\\", it's clear to see that those accolades were well-deserved.Clarke has always been viewed as a purveyor of \`pure' science-fiction. By that, I mean that he applies real science and real situations to the dealings people have extraterrestrial events and species. This is almost a polar-opposite of the type of science-fiction available in novels like \\"Star Wars\\", where the space opera and human drama are the prime elements while real science takes a back seat. A particular area of interest for Clarke has been the subject of \`first contact' where humanity first comes in contact with an alien species. \\"Rendezvous with Rama\\" is one of the subject's best examples. Instead of the aliens of similar construction and environment as in \\"Star Trek\\", \\"Rendezvous...\\" presents a species that is vastly different from anything the humans can conceive of. It is so different that they may not even recognize the humans at all, while humans can merely hope to grasp at the purpose and function of these extraterrestrials.In the early 22nd century, the Spaceguard System designed to protect all the inhabited worlds of the United Planets from threatening comets and asteroids has picked an object barreling through the Solar System at an incredible speed and uncomfortably close to the inhabited worlds. Upon realizing that this object shows none of the characteristics of a naturally occurring phenomena (in fact, it is a perfectly designed cylinder approximately 150 kilometers by 30), the United Planets commissions the space ship, Endeavour (the only ship close enough and fast enough to catch this object) to rendezvous with this new entity that is being called \`Rama'. Upon the arrival to Rama, the astronauts of Endeavour find ready-made access ways to the inside of this massive structure and, once inside, discover a scene that nearly defies human comprehension. Although vision is initially hampered by the darkened environment, it becomes clear that the inside of Rama is actually a self-contained biosphere, complete with a frozen sea, naturally occurring landforms, and what appears to be constructed cities. There does not seem to be any signs of life, but, given the enormity of the structure, there are plenty of places to explore and hopes run high at discovering the mystery of Rama. Unfortunately, the crew Endeavour only has a few weeks to conduct its explorations. The Sunward trajectory of Rama is rapidly bringing it to the point of perihelion from which Endeavour could not survive the extreme temperatures. Back on the Moon (the home of the United Planets headquarters) a committee has been established to observe the developments on, and with regard to, Rama and make the best recommendations about how to proceed. In addition, there is also unpleasant internal strife courtesy of the colonists of Mercury, the Hermians, who fear what Rama's existence means for there place in the Solar System.What makes \\"Rendezvous with Rama\\" such an impressive novel is how genuine the human reactions to Rama are. They are initially fearful and then very curious. When the astronauts enter the main of Rama, they are first awed by the shear enormity of the environment they have entered and later, when a sudden light source has illuminated Rama's interior, they are astounded by the beauty and complexity of this self-contained world. Clarke's special literary skills convey this emotion to the readers so that they feel like they are a member of the Endeavour's crew, stumbling upon a new world and new existence that had never been conceived of before. Clarke is honest in his portrayal of the human desire know all the answers to a puzzle whose answers are impossible to obtain. \\"Rendezvous with Rama\\" leaves many more questions than answers. Yet, that is the point. Humanity is not on the same level of evolution, technologically or physically, with an alien species that has the capability traverse interstellar distances. It cannot possibly hope to understand the mysteries of a species that can do this. It is the questions that humanity is left to ponder that make this encounter so much more fulfilling than any answers that there may be."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"In the year 2130, a spacecraft of unknown origin - dubbed Rama - passes through our solar system, inaugurating a new era in the history of humankind - for the first time there is undeniable evidence that we are not alone. But rather than focus on the consequences and historical ramifications of so extraordinary an event, Clarke (with typical British reserve) chooses to keep our attention strictly on the event itself. The Space Advisory Committee (including representatives of all the populated planets) provides scientific insight, trying to advise across astronomical distances while Commander Norton of the space ship Endeavor (which is the only vessel close enough to intercept) has to worry about the safety of his crew. Perhaps the most interesting facet of the book is Clarke's decision to leave most of the critical questions unanswered (begging sequels). This very realistic approach to a first contact with another intelligence sends a strong message to a science fiction audience that had perhaps become too used to sensationalism: alien artifacts may be far more likely to reach us than actual aliens, and in either event, communications between the two may not be nearly as simple as it is in the movies.Otherwise Clarke's 22nd century doesn't seem all that advanced. There are intelligent primates called simps that handle much of the drudgery on board ship, and the commander has two wives on two different planets, but otherwise neither the technology nor the society seems much different from the world of today. The ship's commanding surgeon is a woman, but that couldn't have seemed all that forward thinking even in 1973, when this book was written, and surely means nothing today. Wholly lacking is Clarke's mischievous sense of humor; there's nary a hint of human romance, and the plot is not heavy on surprises, either. Instead, what we have is a very dry, albeit perhaps very realistic prediction of what mankind's first contact with another intelligence might be like, and how circumstances could limit our ability to investigate it. Overall, it's a good, fast, easy read, with plenty of realism; little that's outrageously surprising, and nothing too absurdly far out. Recommended for younger readers and those who take their science fiction very seriously."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"Wonderful book, great concept. Shame I was so disappointed with the other books in the series - my advice would be to read this one and leave it at that!"},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"I read 2001: Space Odyssey and Childhood's End and what attracted me to Arthur C. Clarke style was the brilliant and amazing descriptions of space and the psychology of the human mind. In most of his descriptions he indulges on detail and his delivery is poetic to the last word. I did not find myself in sense of wonder or awe like I expected in Rendezvous with Rama. Much like in 2010: Odyssey Two, he creates a crew of astronomers that represent every social condition of the human mind that exists in a non-clever way and uses dialogue that makes the character two-dimensional and unbelievable. This book is slow-paced and if you are a reader that is looking for mind-blowing science fiction with a new outlook on the beauty that is our universe, you will not find it here."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"I classify Clarke as one of the best 'realistic' sci-fi writers. What I mean is that his stories are not of the 'pure fantasy' variety (like say Asimov's Foundation series is) because they are founded on PLAUSIBLE scientific premises. 'Rama' is like 2001 in that they are about encounters with extraterrestrial intelligences that are by no means inconceivable in their settings.For getting a feel of such an encounter this book is beautifully vivid. The description of the human crew exploring the Rama space habitat is excellently written - the moment when the vast lights come on inside the massive craft and the human explorers are left trying to make sense of the scale and the wild lack of gravity while hanging onto stairways they can't figure out are on the ceiling or on the floor or are going up or going down is truly mind-boggling and leaves you breathless. Your own brain feels like it is struggling just like theirs. The mid-ship 'ocean' and the bizarre 'cities' are every bit as mind-boggling. Where did Clarke get his ideas? It is all genuinely unique and is a brilliant vision on paper. If you like 2001, this is a must-read!"},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"Rendezvous with Rama is a wonderful book about an exploration into the unknown and the possibilities it brings. It's not so big on closure as it is the experience of the quest. But that does hamper the story a bit. Hopefully this is one that won't get the film treatment, because it probably wouldn't translate well."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"I read this in my early teens, and it's been read many times since then. It's the best kind of science fiction - full of wonder and imagination. There is not much tension or conflict: it's simply the story of an alien vessel and the explorers who go there. They find a lot, but a lot more questions. 20 years later, I'll still pick it up a few times a year just to go back to that wonderful place. It's a book worth giving to a teenager."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"This was a novel that I had high expectations for, due to its being a \\"classic\\" in sci-fi, but ultimately felt letdown by. Great concept. Could be thought-provoking, if you're the type to get deep into an idea. But about what it lacked, let me quote another review:\\"The characters are a little bland I guess but it's such a short read and there's so much information to digest there was really no room for hardcore character development. Who cares anyway...\\"Well, I guess maybe I'm one of the few who do. There's really NO development at all. As the above-quoted reviewer states, Rama is the main character and the focus of the book. But I don't think it would have been impossible to sustain that same mood, while also making the human characters interesting. The United Planets council scenes were tiresome -- due to too many names and not enough page-time -- but were kept thankfully short. Commander Norton is boring. He's made to seem real simply by the fact that he has a role model in a historical figure -- Captain James Cook. Other people are given hobbies to bring them to life; sailing and participating in the Lunar Olympics are two.The other reviewer is right, this is not a character-driven novel. The fact that the most disappointing aspect of this book was never meant as its focus and that it was a fluid, quick read earned it three stars from me."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"Every science fiction aficionado must read it! It's impossible to stop reading it until you reach the last page of exploration through the mysterious lumbering derelict spaceship. The fact that few of its mysteries are solved by the end of the book makes it even more irresistible. Those who criticize about the shallowness of Clarke's characters should forget sci-fi and read romance or drama, because Rama itself is the best possible character a sci-fi fan can expect. Clarke is the best sci-fi writer ever and Rendezvous with Rama is his best book(along with 2001 and 2010)."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"This is the most original alien encounter story.A group of astronauts are diverted to investigate a huge spaceship passing through the solar system, they discover it contains a minute ecological system inside. Every chapter has a unique and totally new concept, the author has a surprise in every page. it is a must read for anyone interested in space travel. This concept of a &quot;worldlet&quot; ship is probably the only way to cross the vast void between stars"},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"In Rendezvous with Rama Arthur C. Clarke provides a new, inventive twist on the \\"we are not alone\\" vein of science fiction.In 2130, a new celestial body is discovered heading toward the Sun. Earthlings name this object &quot;Rama&quot;. Satellites reveal this to be a \\"man made\\" object, if you will-a hollow cylinder of vast proportions. An manned expedition is mounted and the team eventually does Rendezvous with-and enter-Rama.The twist Clarke provides is two fold. The first is, we never meet the Raman's. presumably there are in there somewhere, but other than some \\"maintenance\\" type biots, no sentient creatures ever make the scene in the story.The second twist is that earthlings aren't a factor in this story-that is, it develops the Raman's are simply using our sun as a turning point/acceleration mechanism. We are beneath their notice.The actual driving force behind the novel is the exploration of the ship. This aspect Clarke develops with the aplomb and savvy you would expect from such an accomplished sci-fi veteran. This stands as a remarkably suspenseful novel, quite an achievement given there are no alien confrontations to spice things up.There are a couple of problems with the book. The technology aspects of the earth ship and the explorer's tools are pathetic-you'd think there's been no technological advancement in either space travel or hand tools in 130 years-not too likely. And this book has \\"sequel\\" written all over it. I dislike books that seek to be deliberately commercially manipulative. This is a particularly egregious example of that phenomenon.Neither of these factors appreciably detracts from the story, however, but I am deducting a star because of the manipulation factor.So take a trip to Rama-you'll enjoy it!"},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"This book is very cool. It has such a realistic approach to how we'd react if we came across such an immense alien artifact. This is, in my opinion, by far the best book in this series. It is Arthur C Clarke from front to back and all of the ideas are clearly worthy of him. This book showed such an amazing idea and I think that a great series could have been created from it, if its original ideas had been adhered to. Despite the shortcomings of the rest of the series however, you should definitely give this book a shot!"},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"close but it is hard to compare two classics. I think that ACC descriptions of the ever changing insides of Rama blew me away. This is a book that took my imagination to a new level. Same as 2001 did a couple years ago when I read that. I haven't heard anything good about any of the sequels to Rama, so I'll probably just skip them, but Rendezvous is not something for any SF fan to miss.The movie is coming out in 2003 or 2004 director David Fincher is attached and the budget is over 100 million. Do yourself a favor and read the book before the movie."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"I read this book way-back whenever. I loved it. It moved fast. I love to have my mind put to its greatest potential of imagination and this book did that.

It's in my collection along with Issac Asimov and Edgar Rice Burroughs."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"Arthur C Clarke is my favorite author, and the Rama series is my favorite from him. I won't write another synopsis of the plot, but I will say that this universe is probably his most ambitious, and there is a lot of fantastic brain candy and adventure to enjoy. I loaned the first book (Rendezvous with Rama is the first of 4) to a friend who talked me into reading Tolkein and Chung Kuo years ago, and he bought the rest himself. He loved it. Even better, Morgan Freeman has the movie rights to the books and has brought in David Fincher to direct it properly. While this is great news, do yourself a favor: read the books before you see the movie. There's no way they'll be able to cover all the details. I can only hope mainstream audiences will appreciate it."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"I think this is just about my favourite science fiction novel. I don't read much in this genre, but this is exceptional. Not because of its &quot;literary&quot; qualities, or its characters - both are unremarkable. Clarke instead reaches into your imagination and implants one of the most alien worlds I can remember reading about. What's clever is how he keeps the sheer size of the giant spacecraft in your mind and uses that to make you constantly marvel. This is a novel full of suspense and pace. The &quot;what's going to happen next&quot; factor is very high, and keeps you flipping the pages. In fact, it probably won't take you long to finish it (because it's not very long), but you'll be very sorry that it ended. So sorry in fact, that you'll be very tempted to go out and buy the sequel, which is, unfortunately, dire."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"Rendezvous with Rama is a hard sci-fi novel that all devotees of the genre must read. The setting is intricate and amazing, the characters believable, and the plot mysterious. The ending is perfect, and I truly wish Clarke had left well-enough alone instead of writing a sequel to this excellent book."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"4 1/2 stars is closer to the mark but why quibble. This is top notch Hard SF entertainment. Clark demonstrates why he is the master of real SF with this story of an alien artifact (maybe its a spaceship, maybe its a probe, the heroes don't figure out what it really is until the end and they can't be sure even then.) Believeable charcters in a believable adventure with believable science make this an engrossing story that has the reader thinking, &quot;something like this could really happen!&quot; Highly recommend to everyone but especial to those that think SF has to filled with implausible contraptions and grotesque aliens to be entertaining. This book proves it doesn't."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"Arthur Clarke is one of the Masters of Great Science Fiction. After &quot;Childhood's End&quot; and &quot;The City, The Stars&quot;, I thought it couldn't get better - Then Rama.In many ways so different from the others I liked. Near future - true SCIENCE fiction - no fantasy. Still, an enthralling story that COULD happen. Exploration, political intrigue, heros, villains, and most of all the mystery - What is Rama? In the end it is much like life -- you learn a lot, but not all.No fantasy here if that is key to your reading fun. This COULD HAPPEN.Everything comes in threes."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"Arthur C Clarke is my favorite author, and the Rama series is my favorite from him.

And so perhaps the very cosmopolitan and worldly Arthur C. Clarke, celebrated author of 2001: A Space Odyssey and long time resident of India's neighbor Sri Lanka thought it was time the people of the Ganges got some due, and so he named the artificial world that is the center of this splendid novel, Rama, after one of the manifestations of God in the Hindu pantheon. This is &quot;old school&quot; science fiction, written in a not very fancy, but entirely agreeable style that emphasizes communication first and curlicues not at all. This is &quot;hard&quot; SF with a firm scientific basis from which to take flights of fancy. Political correctness, space age romance, galactic shoot outs, ghastly horror, laser light swords, etc., and other stables of the contemporary genre are pleasantly absent in favor of a carefully developed plot based on plausible events. One gets the feeling that something like this could really happen.Rama is a self-contained world that is both space ship and planetoid. It is a 50 by 20 kilometer cylinder that has entered the Solar System and is headed for the Sun. The time is 2130 and humankind has colonies from Mercury to Titan and a governing body called the United Planets. The story of the novel is the exploration of Rama, which Clarke does with clarity and a sense of wonder so that we are carried along, enthralled. There are charming Clarkean touches, the &quot;simps,&quot; lovable human-engineered monkeys who clean and fetch for humans; world leaders whose simple emotions remind us of our neighbors; aliens that are cute rather than venomous; and bad guys that are not really all that evil. There is a certain rational morality to Clarke's view of humankind that I wish were more in evidence in our own lives. In Rendezvous with Rama, the lawyers argue over the number of objects orbiting Jupiter that should be called satellites, not over how to extract as much money from their adversaries as possible. Those who would destroy and murder aliens, just to be safe, are in the minority. World leaders disagree but no one brands the other as an hated enemy, etc.Some observations: On page 31 Clarke implies that a proper human population for the earth would be about one billion. Elsewhere he has gotten rid of automobiles. I like both ideas, imagining they lead to a more idyllic biosphere. On page 35 he has 1,000 miles a minute as a reasonable speed for earth transportation. On page 259 he mentions a US president named Perez...As with other works of Clarke, what really charms here is an infectious sense of wonder, something most of us lost many years ago, a sense of delight in the possible, recalling the magic of childhood and first love. For that, Sir Arthur, thanks."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"One of my all-time favorite sci fi books. How would YOU explore a huge alien artifact? (Don't bother with the other Rama books; Clarke didn't pen them and they're badly written.) (For depth psychologists: Rama could be said to represent an accurate diagram of the transpersonal psyche.)"},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"Arthur C. Clarke has done it again with Rendezvous with Rama. I couldn't put this book down until I was sure that I was finished. His ending is actually not an ending, so it leaves you hungry for a sequel. This is probably the best book I have read since 2001: A Space Odyssey. I also recommend all of the sequels to this: Rama II, The Garden of Rama, and Rama Revealed."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"The reason I would give this book 4.5 stars is simply because the descriptions Clarke gives are sometimes flawed and unnecessary. Otherwise besides that Rama is a great read. It's briskly paced and has enough Clarkian thought provoking matter within it too. I don't advise that you continue on however, Rama II is hereticaly bad compared to Rendevous. Anyway, I recommend this book to anyone who likes SF."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"Very rarely can a book or film truly be labeled an 'Epic'. Rendezvous with Rama is one of these rare occurrences. It is a brilliant story, based on brilliant ideas. Technical genius blends with great storytelling to make one of those rare books that won't let you put them down. I will not tell anything about the story, because that would spoil it. Read it, I command you."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"This is my favorite Arthur C. Clarke book.Clark is very strong on story and ideas, somewhat weak on character. Surprisingly enough, the somewhat flat characters doesn't diminish the story at all, as the wonder of the alien spacecraft, its size and features are capivating in themselves.I find Clarke somewhat more polished in his writing than Asimov and much less fomula based than Heinlein, but overall the three are very similar.If you like &quot;Rama&quot;, I suggest that you not bother with the next volume in the set (Rama II), it isn't nearly as good and the characters are obvious and uninteresting set in the same environment."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"Perhaps you think that a sci-fi book about an alien contact without aliens might fail to intrigue. Perhaps you're nuts! In Rendezvous with Rama, Arthur C. Clarke charts humanity's response to the arrival of a mysterious alien artifact. All the elements of exploration, terror, and elation are bundled into a novel worthy of inclusion in the annals of great science fiction."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"This novel about an encounter with a stupendous alien spaceship inspired in me more daydreams than I can count. Rama is the perfect design for spaceship that can travel between the stars. It's in the shape of a tin can, protected from the harmful radiation of space by thick walls, and rotating to produce artificial gravity. This cylinder world, complete with an ocean, streams, forests, is a mini-Earth. Ah, the dreams!--and so intellectually stimulating.It is explored by astronauts as it approaches the earth.Another irresistable story is the \\"Far Arena,\\" by Richard Ben Sapir. Click here, then scroll down to read by review.The far arena"},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"If you are after some fast-paced sci-fi action, this is not the book for you. This book is not about events or people, instead, this book is about an exploration into an unknown environment. There are no heroes, people take well calculated risks. If all those events were real, a lengthy but well-written report about the whole exploration might be pretty close to this book. That said, it is a very exciting story. Somewhere after the middle, I just could not stop reading until I felt that all important developments are done, and read well into the early morning hours. Next morning when I picked it up again, I was surprised to see that the story ended within a few pages, and the remaining of the book was excerpts from other Clarke books.In my opinion, two things make this a must-read: first, the story itself, that is, the environment it describes, the politics, people's behaviors, etc. Second, the way that these are described. None of the characters feel phony (even though they are not fully developed by the story), and the descriptions are so alive that when I saw one of the illustrations of Rama by an artist in Wikipedia, very few things were not as I expected. I believe almost everybody who read this book have very similar mental images of Rama, and can find their ways in it without much difficulty if it really comes this way."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"&quot;Rendezvous with Rama&quot; was, and is one of my favorite science fiction novels, penned by the great sci-fi writer Arthur C. Clarke.In the 22nd century, the asteroid detecting system SPACEGUARD detects what at first looks like a very strange looking asteroid entering the solar system and heading towards the sun. A space probe sent to investigate discovers the &quot;asteroid&quot; to be really a gigantic cylindrical space vessel. The crew of the spaceship &quot;Endezvour&quot; is sent to investigate the alien spacecraft dubbed &quot;Rama&quot;.Clarke paints such a vivid picture of the inside of Rama, that I could almost see it with my own eyes. The three ladders extending from the center of Rama into seeming infinity, the view of the cylindrical sea, the large empty &quot;cities&quot;, all vividly described. Also, I really liked Clarke's description of Rama coming to life. The way Rama starts off in darkness, then the lights come on, the cylindrical sea melts, and the &quot;biots&quot; start rearing their heads.Clarke doesn't forget about the issue of gravity in space, something many science fiction writers leave out. Rama rotates, giving the inside of the ship a sort of artificial gravity. As you climb down the ladder from the center of the ship, the gravity increases from zero to normal. It's nice to have a science fiction novel with some science in it, something Clarke's novels always have.Appropriately, Clarke doesn't reveal everything about Rama, leaving a sense of mystery much like he did at the end of &quot;2001&quot;.The characters aren't drawn vividly, a frequent complaint by Clarke detractors, but this didn't bother me. We're here to explore Rama, not the characters. This book is a great read for any lover of science fiction or Arthur C. Clarke. Beware of the sequels co-written by Gentry Lee."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"It's been a few months since I actually read this novel and will probably go back to read it again shortly, I have just been tripped up by Thesis papers. . . forcing me to read numerous books on one author (I would have chosen Clarke except that the author had to be American!). Anyways to the review. I read this during last summer in two days (quite a feat for me!), and can confidently say it is the best novel I have ever read (best Sci-Fi novel at least). I'm one of those people who love action and adventure but also love thought provoking books and Rama certainly was thought provoking! The ship Rama comes to life thanks to Clarke and he really showed me what Science Fiction was all about. Clarke sends your mind racing in thousands of directions about the alien Ramans. . . yet we never see one of them. Completely outstanding! If you are a Science Fiction fan you MUST read this book. . . however if you do not like Science Fiction you will probably find this novel to be boring..."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"I have selected \\"Rendezvous With Rama\\" as one of the novels for my next Science Fiction class as an example of the \\"hard science\\" sub-genre of the field even though it is admittedly atypical. The story begins in the early 22nd century with the commonplace of Science Fiction literature where a celestial object enters our solar system and the people of Earth react with great excitement. But Arthur C. Clarke has already done a novel where aliens come to earth with \\"Childhood's End,\\" and this novel takes a decidedly different turn. The alien vessel, dubbed Rama because the pantheon of Greek and Roman mythological figures has been exhausted, is not coming to Earth. It is just wandering through our neck of the galaxy and the scientists of Earth are going to have one crack at visiting Rama and finding out what they can about the gigantic object before it leaves.Of course such a mission is hastily mounted and succeed in reaching Rama and entering the immense interstellar spacecraft. But \\"Rendezvous With Rama\\" keeps to its track of being an unconventional novel as humanity has its first encounter with alien intelligence. Perhaps the best measure of this novel would be the fact that I enjoyed it although I never took a high school science course above Life Through the Microscope, which effectively puts the realms of biology, chemistry, and physics beyond the scope of my understanding. Clarke succeeds in getting through a series of brief and basic science lessons that allow me to keep up with what is happening. Of course this is helped by the fact that the Earth scientists aboard Rama are constantly talking about the possible meanings and implications of everything they are encountering or see off in the distance inside Rama.Actually, I like this 1973 novel more when it stands by itself rather than as the opening volume in the four-part Rama series. The other three books were co-written by Clarke with Gentry Lee and essentially they answer the questions raised by \\"Rendezvous With Rama.\\" However, I liked the way this novel ended, with the explorers convinced the glass was half empty at best because of their inability to understand everything they found inside Rama. Part of that appeal is the reality of it, that unlike the vast majority of Science Fiction novels and movies there was not a point where someone conveniently popped up and explained everything to our collective satisfaction. This novel is about trying to look at an alien world through alien eyes, and the effort is as important as the achievements. Granted, this type of Science Fiction will not appeal to everyone, but as an introduction to the use of \\"hard science\\" in the genre this is an excellent choice."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"In this book, Arthur Clarke set the bar for the unknown alien probe story very high. The setting is that humans have settled Mercury, Luna, Mars, some asteroids, and some Jovian and Saturnian moons. Each group sends an Ambassador to the United Planets, which meets on Earth's moon. Suddenly, an enormous cylindrical space ship enters the solar system and appears completely passive; it is named Rama as that is the next name in the nomenclature sequence.Commander Norton commands the only space ship capable of docking with Rama, so he is ordered to investigate. What he finds is amazing, yet puzzling. He encounters an alien technology that is baffling, yet they find it fairly easy to understand some of what it does. The crewmembers explore Rama, finding their greatest problem to be coping with the sheer size of the vessel.While the description of the alien probe is fascinating, nobody does the scientific details better than Clarke, the best aspects of the book are the descriptions of the interplanetary political situation and the general human reaction to the appearance of an alien artifact. While Clarke's descriptions of the political tensions between the various human political groups are disquieting, they are also clearly realistic. Humans find significant differences developing when groups live in different areas of Earth, it is clear that those differences will be even greater when groups live on different planets. Furthermore, conclusive proof that extraterrestrial intelligence exists will have a dramatic effect on how humans view the universe.Like many of Clarke's other stories, the ending is ambiguous, which is why I consider him the thinking person's science fiction writer. This is clearly one of the ten best science fiction novels of all time."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"In this book, Arthur Clarke set the bar for the unknown alien probe story very high.

Many science fiction authors have written on the subject, but none have done it with as much flair as Arthur C. Clark in Rendezvous With Rama.Rama is utterly massive. Over forty kilometers long and weighing more than ten trillion tons, its arrival into our solar system is hailed by many to be the greatest discovery in history, to others it signifies the coming of a brutal Judgment Day. A crew of specialized scientists is sent on an intercept course with the foreign titan in an attempt to learn its hidden secrets. What they find far exceed their earthly expectations. Rama is hollow.What ensues is the greatest research expedition in the history of science, and what they find while exploring the vast plains and barren cities of interior Rama is overwhelming and mysterious indeed.A great portrayal of man's first encounter with an alien existence, the novel is both exiting and awe-inspiring to lovers of science fiction and every other lover of great literature and should not be overlooked. Remember though, as you explore the great splendor of the alien genius, that the Ramans always do everything in threes. Absolutely everything."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"I loved this book! Now I see why this book is on so many people's top ten SF novels list. I have read other works by Clarke and was not impressed. It's not that he isn't a good writer, he just didn't grab me. I loved this book.From the very beginning, Clarke gradually reveals more and more about Rama. (I won't go into detail because of spoilers.) And with each new discovery, he reveals the science behind it. There's no metascience here - it's solid, science fact.I recommend this book to any SF fan who hasn't read it, and it would make a good introduction to someone who has never read SF. Rama won the Nebula and British SciFi/Fantasy awards in 1973 and the Hugo and Campbell awards in 1974. A real classic."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"I believe this was the first Sci Fi book I read back in high school.

It was one of the first I read, and it hooked me on Clarke. What's not to like about this thing? It has an original premise, a sense of discovery, humorous political intrigue, and it just reads SO smooth.

Where's it going next? these and other mysteries and dangers awaits when the small humans starts to explore the giant cylinder...It's great, you'll never forget it..."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"I finished reading the book about 3 months ago, and I can still tell the details. I really enjoyed reading it, and Clarke is really a fantastic novelist. I must say, I started reading it after I played the video game. I liked it so much, that I wanted to read them all. So when I found the books in the attic, I really rushed through them. But first let me tell what the book is about.The story is about the interstellar spaceship called Rama, that sails through our solar system. As nave as mankind is in the future (in the year 2130), we think it has come for us, and we start to observe it. Commander Newton and crew are assigned to look inside rama, and to find out what's in this huge hollow cylinder. After a lot of adventures where they learn a lot about rama itself, including that it's huge and has biological robots in it (biots), the have to go again. However, the people on Mercury decides to blow the place up, and of course, that doesn't succeed. Ironically enough, in the end mankind discovers that Rama wasn't interested in humanity at all, but only was here to use the sun as a \\"gas station\\". They weren't so important after all..The first thing that you find out, is that not Norton and company are the main characters, but Rama itself. The biggest part of the book is about the adventures in rama, but not of just one person. You don't have a main character who gets all the misery over him-/herself, but the whole crew experiences something new and sometimes frightening (for them, of course). So the characters are not the main subject. But who cares anyway? The book isn't about the lives of astronauts, it's about RAMA! And when you finish the book, you will still have questions, and every time you can answer one, three new ones will replace it. But it is really worth the effort, for sci-fi fans, but also for the rest of the world."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"I don't know that I would classify Clark as a creator of great fiction; as mentioned in other reviews, the \\"human equation\\" in his works is largely missing. Clark excels and creating vivid descriptions of technology and alien grandeur, but his books are a bit lifeless at they have almost no character developement or interesting dialog.I've read most of his books, and find he is a great alternative in those times I would find myself reaching for an atlas or a National Geographic. Honestly, I think AC Clarke is one of those sacred cow authors--praised by those who think it raises their intellectual profile, and read mainly when bored by those who can see that the emperor, while not entirely naked, could do with more than a loincloth."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"It's hard for me to truly love this book but I like it a lot.

It, in fact, is like a great unopened tin can and until the human exploration crew enters it, the reader is going to really wonder what is inside.Rendezvous with Rama, unlike the sequels from Gentry Lee, focuses on Rama itself as opposed to the people exploring it. This is Clarke's forte of course and what is found inside Rama is very believable. I like how much of what is inside Rama is never really understood by the explorers or the reader. There are clues but nothing is ever really explained.The book leaves the reader wanting more. The reader, like the explorers themselves, feel like the mission to explore Rama is somewhat of a failure since there was so much left unexplored and unexplained. This book begged for a sequel and even the last line (\\"The Ramans do everything in threes.\\") hints that this would be a trilogy. The sequel never showed until Gentry Lee met Clarke in the late 1980's and they outlined a series of sequels of which Lee would write. Lee's works, while interesting and worthwhile, focus on human behavior more than the science fiction ideas of the purely Clarke work.I'd place Rendezvous with Rama after Childhood's End, 2001, and 2010 in my list of favorite Clarke novels."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"...kind of makes you wonder...WHY DIDNT THEY MAKE THIS TO A MOVIE!!!"},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"This book is one of the best sic-fi book I had read to date.

Poor characters, thrown in to illustrate the sci-fi; politically incorrect; out of date, no mention even of the Web or the Net :). The sequels however are better, and so this becomes required. Greg Bear did a better job with the idea of a space potato in 'Eon', but neither is so good that somebody won't write a topper sometime in the future. The worst aspect is placing the action in the 22nd century, when it would be out of date even in the 21st. Still, it's an easy read, 8th grade level, meant for mass audiences.

In this book Rendezvous with Rama, Arthur C. Clarke attempts to answer that question. Rendezvous with Rama is a well written book by an author whose books have been given many awards. Mr. Clarke describes things very colorfully. His choice of words makes you think like you are there in the future. This book is good for science fiction gurus and for literature lovers. There is a fair amount of technical phrases while the lingo isn't above most people. Arthur C. Clarke disappointed many people with the ending of his book. I think many people including myself would have enjoyed the book more if there had been a more conclusive ending.- Ryan McChristian"},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"I finished reading this book today and I couldn't wait to review it. A friend suggested it to me. Normally I hate sci-fi but this book was the fire! It was the pertect idea. Set far enough in the future to be interesting but not so far that you can't even relate to it. A.C.C brings up all kinds of great explanations as to what the ship could be, most of which I wouldn't have thought of. Like when Boris Rodrigo wants to inform his church that he feels the second arc has come to collect Gods children. That was a great take on the situation I didn't think of. The characters are a little bland I guess but it's such a short read and there's so much information to digest there was really no room for hardcore character development. Who cares anyway, the main character, Rama, is what I wanted to know more about. A.C.C did an excellent job of not giving away to much information. Im glad that walking away I only know enough about the ship to keep me from going mad. The best mystery is one that can't be solved completly. I would suggest this book to anybody, sci-fi fan or not. It's a short, exhilerating read and worth any amount of time you take to read it. Also, from what I've heard, Arthur's collaborator butchers the soul of the Rama idea in 3 more installments. Im not going to read them.

Without compromising the science involved, Clarke presents a lucid and readable story that almost anyone would find compelling. The feelings of wonder and discovery are strong throughout the novel; one often has the sense of joining in the exploration along with the book's characters.Clarke frequently had problems with endings, but the closure reached at the end of &quot;Rendezvous&quot; is quite satisfying -- even though many questions remain deliberately unanswered. Unfortunately, the book's celebrated final line opened the door for some appalling sequels, written largely by Gentry Lee. These later travesties are suitable only for incorrigible fans of soap operas."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"Another big tasty gob of inhuman absurd fantasyI don't know how I hit on this one but it is wonderfully ridiculous and it takes me so out of reality that I can't stand. This author is really maxxed his middle-class clean and tidy spot free world here. There's not a one foulup in all his forest of machines, and that's where I want to live. As usual I don't really want to live there because I know that once you live there it won't look like it does in the book. So I just prefer to fantasize along with this ridiculous fantasy. It's not like today where every darn day the computer or your neighbor's or somewhere in the IT department everything gets all tangled and messy and a big panic ripples through. I don't know how anybody will ever get us to this point where no technical snafus ever crop up. But I guess the author figures his fantasy people will figure that out, and someday every problem will be solved! Magic. And in the meantime you get to soar way out into the solar system where a big screwball machine has come rolling up. I mean it's huge, like so many football fields long, and round like a cylinder. And the astronauts go poking inside it, and low in behold, it all starts cracking into life, all these cutesy little machine processes start pricking up little limboids. And you watch this fabulousness coming about. And then you get the picture it was just some big thing that a bunch of faraway extraterrestrials build, sort of like an art thing just cause they loved creating big wondrous awesome things. And then by the end of the book it sort of turns over in its sleep and goes on across space, to do the same thing in another solar system and make those people there all dazzled too."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"Rama may just be my favorite Sci-fi book I have read yet.

Clarke is a novel about the exploration of an alien artifact that drifts (?) into our solar system.It is a decent novel. It could have been better.If you have read a bunch of science fiction, you have come across a short list of types of places that can hold humans, while traveling through space. One such place is a planet, such as our Earth, with humans and their air supply held to the surface by gravity or some equivalent. Another such place is a ship that has a hull wrapped around the humans and their air supply. This, second, category includes all 'space ships' up to generation ships. Robert Heinlein wrote about these types of places. Rama is the next size up, a huge metal cylinder, with room inside to hold more people than the Earth can hold. Clarke did a good job of describing such a place when he described Rama. However, Larry Niven has described a fleet of worlds, and \\"Ringworld\\", a larger and more highly populated structure than Rama, and \\"Smoke Ring\\" which is a bunch of small places held in orbit with an acompanying ring of atmosphere, and, if my memory is correct, has described an even larger environment that might be described as a monster bowl of spagetti, without the bowl.Rama is an interesting place. However, at the end, I am not so sure that we have a satisfactory tale. The characters are, about, the same. The artifact is, about, the same. We know more about the artifact. We know that the human race in this novel is no longer 'alone'. But, I was left with wondering why there wasn't something more. I felt that Clarke missed an opportunity for a more satisfactory tale."},{"Title":"RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA","review":"If you like Si Fi you like Arthur C.

I was able to appreciate Rendevous With Rama far more than Childhood's End. There were some genuinely novel innovations, for instance, the use of centripital force (Rama was a rotating cylinder) to induce gravity. Also, the battery powered life forms, that had only so much life in them, and then they simply died. The believability factor was good; in other words, we don't know how old Rama was, or where it came from, and so we aren't sidetracked with having to assimilate a technical history of Rama. Three stars, only because it was rather short and unfulfilled on either end of the story."},{"Title":"Framley Parsonage","review":"If you shy away from Victorian novels because you had to read A TALE OF TWO CITIES in high school, it is time to give these treasures another try. Admit it, you are a bit older now. So are these books by Dickens, Disraeli, Thackary, Austen, the Bronte sisters, and, yes, my personal favorite, the great man himself, Anthony Trollope.Why read something that was written a century and a half ago? Because Trollope knew more about the human psyche than Freud and Jung put together, and wrote about it not with a clinician's jaundiced eye, but with incredible tenderness and love. And entertainingly, to boot!If you have been reading the Jan Karon novels about life in a small North Carolina highlands town, as it revolves around an Episcopal priest named Father Tim and his colorful parishioners, well!--this is where it all began. A book version of finding the source of the Nile.Trollope began what Karon has revised and restyled so engagingly. Trollope invented the \\"church and town\\" novel, with what have become known as his Bartchester Series of novels, all centering around the doings of a fictitious cathedral town and its outlying countryside.Not the first in the series, (it is the fourth but perhaps the best), FRAMLEY PARSONAGE traces the faith, home and political lives of a number of intertwining families. Here you will find love, ambition, political maneuvering, gambling debts, pretension, humility, envy, forgiveness, hate, romance. If it sounds like a slice of modern life-it is. We and the Victorians are so much alike; the human condition does not change.In this delightful mix of clerical, political and romantic intrigue, you will meet everyone from the alarmingly meddlesome bishop's wife, Mrs. Proudie, to the original dizzy blond, Griselda Grantly. All set in the green countryside and the bustling streets of London.The story centers around the bright, popular pastor, Mark Robarts and his charming wife, but it is his sister, Lucy, who will capture your heart as perhaps the loveliest of heroines in any novel.I hope you are intrigued enough to be convinced that there is more to Nineteenth Century British Literature than SILAS MARNER. Moreover, I hope you will read this and the other Trollope works. You may recall that in addition to being one of the most successful and acclaimed novelist of all times, Trollope was also a successful and acclaimed civil servant-his \\"day job\\" was with the British postal system-he invented the corner mailbox. His more than 40 novels and outstanding autobiography were written in his very disciplined \\"spare time\\" in which he produced a specific number of pages every morning before departing punctually for his office. Not only a genius of time management, Trollope was and is a guardian of the human heart.What? You say you would rather start at the beginning of the Bartchester series? By all means! But if you do not, try FRAMLY PARSONAGE first. Dip your toe in there-for you cannot dip your toe into any of his books without emerging the better, having done so.If you find this review helpful you might want to read some of my other reviews, including those on subjects ranging from biography to architecture, as well as religion and fiction."},{"Title":"Framley Parsonage","review":"Young clergyman Mark Robarts receives a choice parish, thanks to Lady Lufton, the mother of one of his university friends. However, Robarts, though newly and happily married, is not content to settle into the life of a country minister. Lured by a wealthy and worldly set of new acquaintances, he finds himself pushed into living beyond his means and, worse yet, being held legally responsible for another man's bad debts.Meantime the young Lord Lufton has been smitten by the charms of Robarts' sister Lucy, much to the displeasure of his aristocratic mother. It take a great act of magnanimity on Lucy's part - helping the impoverished Crawley family during a crisis (the Crawleys are more prominent in &quot;The Last Chronicle of Barset&quot;) - to finally convince Lady Lufton that Lucy is worthy of her son.This beautifully written novel contrasts the simpler integrity, though sometimes snobbish values, of the old ways with the more meretriciously glamorous lives of a newer society. As usual, Trollope has produced a multitude of characters whose motives are completely credible, and his depiction of the different social groups provides a most vivid kaleidoscope of Victorian life and attitudes. As always, there is nothing outdated in Trollope's sure insight into human nature."},{"Title":"Framley Parsonage","review":"As a sixty-two year old professor of English literature and a compulsive reader, I have read many, many novels in my life, and most of Trollope's (for they are, indeed, habit-forming), but this one is perhaps my favorite. I have not read it since 1982, but when I open the cover and look at the fly-leaf, I feel the special delight that I felt when I first read it. Like Austen's Emma, it is one of those perfect books you should not miss."},{"Title":"Framley Parsonage","review":"About three-quarters of the way through \\"Framley Parsonage,\\" the fourth in Anthony Trollope's remarkably entertaining Barchester Chronicles, two of the characters find themselves an unlikely couple, much to their surprise and mutual pleasure. And it suddenly occurred to me why I love this author's works as much as I do: it's the endless optimism. Yes, things always work out for the best in Austen and Dickens (for example), but in Trollope, when a character is caught off guard and overwhelmed by his/her emotions, so am I. The sense that unexpected, marvelous life changes are always a possibility, connects me to Trollope in a very strong way. Which is not to say that there's no edge to his writing, or no psychological complexity; far from it. In \\"Framley Parsonage,\\" bad things happen to good people; but Trollope doesn't shy away from the idea that sometimes good people make bad choices...and must pay the consequences. In this way, Trollope's moral landscape seems to me more complex than Austen's and Dickens', less black and white. (Lizzie Eustace, the heroine of \\"The Eustace Diamonds\\" is a perfect example of this: she's an underhanded liar and thief, but we find ourselves rooting for her.)Trollope introduces us to some new characters here, and brings back old ones, much to our delight; Mrs, Proudie is particularly welcome, in all her sanctimonious glory. If I have an objection to the plot of \\"Framley Parsonage,\\" it's that the dilemma the lovers face too closely mirrors that of the ones in its immediate predecessor, \\"Doctor Thorne.\\". That said, my heart couldn't help but respond when the lovely Lucy Robarts suddenly found her dream of love coming true. I knew it was coming (even if she didn't), and yet the simplicity and honesty with which Trollope expressed her astonishment, disbelief and inexpressible joy brought tears to my eyes. Perhaps I'm just an old softie...but perhaps Trollope is just that good."},{"Title":"Framley Parsonage","review":"I'm reading the Barset series in order and have not been disappointed yet. Framley Parsonage is substantive, richer than The Warden, more serious than Barchester Towers, similar in much to Doctor Thorne, and slightly more intricate than DT. I enjoyed the introduction of a healthy dose of political gamesmanship in the form of descriptions of the parliamentary machinations and electioneering strategies. One also learns how to conduct financial shennanigans with horses, farmland, and public forests. The characters in FP are textured and almost always believable; there's only a few caricatures here. As always, the Everyman's edition is accompanied by a lucid introduction and helpful timetable."},{"Title":"Framley Parsonage","review":"I'm (slowly) making my way through Trollope's Barsetshire series - I find I have to be in the mood. I read somewhere that a contemporary of Trollope's said they hoped the serialized \\"Framley Parsonage\\" would never end, as they loved it because nothing ever happened! That's a bit harsh, but the novel really is about what I consider the timeless struggles and intimate details of life, relationships, property, and responsibility. The main character is country parson Mark Robarts, who has pretty much always had things handed to him by one patron or another; his head is turned by the desire to keep up socially (and financially) with the local aristocracy.Along with the main plot of Robarts' struggle against temptation and eventual redemption, we meet Trollope's usual assortment of county families, aristocrats great and small, and clerical characters with their attendant charms and foibles. One of my favorite plot lines throughout this series is the ongoing, vicious (and rather un-Christian) social and political warfare waged by the rightly-named Mrs. Proudie and pretty much every other clerical wife or fond mama she runs across. The account of Mrs. Proudie's \\"conversazione\\" is priceless, and Miss Dunstable serves as a fine foil for her pompous piety and hypocrisy. Trollope manages to portray the flaws and humanity of his characters with insight and gentle yet sometimes sharp humor, but he's never snarky or malicious; that's why I love his novels and will continue to slowly but surely work my way through them."},{"Title":"Framley Parsonage","review":"Notice how every reviewer of this gem of a novel gives it five stars. Trollope, as these readers have each discovered, is perhaps the most under-appreciated of the 19th century master English novelists. He may not have DIckens' gift for memorable characters or the tragic sense of Thomas Hardy, but does he know human nature in all its complexity and folly.Each of his characters, from the purest young girl to the most dissipated wastrel has that combination of strengths and weaknesses that we recognize (one hopes) in ourselves. Trollope condemns no one unreservedly, while never wholly approving. And he does this all with an ironic distance, yet with a warm sympathy for his characters that is unique in this reader's long experience with master novelists. Finally, this skilled observer of ordinary people tells his story with a gift for the language that is equal to the greatest writers in English. Do not die without spending some hours with this genial chronicler of 19th century humanity."},{"Title":"Framley Parsonage","review":"The fourth of the Chronicles of Barsetshire, Framley Parsonage (1861) is a gentle novel filled with memorable characters, including many characters fromThe Warden,Barchester Towers, andDoctor Thorne (Barsetshire Novels). Mark Robarts, a young vicar with a devoted wife, has a comfortable situation at Framley Parsonage on the estate of the indomitable Lady Lufton. Her son, now Lord Lufton, had been a friend of Mark Robarts at school, and it was their friendship which resulted in Mark's position. Mark, though conscientious in his duties and grateful for his situation, is ambitious, however, anxious to expand his horizons beyond Framley.Lady Lufton, who rules with an iron hand, is appalled when Mark decides to spend a weekend with a \\"fast\\" crowd, one which he believes can advance his career. Young and nave, he becomes the dupe of an aristocratic \\"con-man,\\" an MP named Nathaniel Sowerby, who persuades him to help him out of a financial jam by signing a note for five hundred pounds (more than half Robarts's yearly salary), allowing Sowerby to draw funds on Robarts's name. In the meantime, Robarts's sister Lucy arrives at Framley Parsonage upon the death of their father. Lucy, a sweet ing&eacute;nue in mourning, soon comes to the attention of Lord Lufton, but Lady Lufton has many more \\"significant\\" matrimonial prospects in mind for her son. As Robarts's financial miseries become more pressing, and as Lucy's disappointment in love increases, the scene is set for a final showdown.Numerous peripheral characters, many of them known to readers of the series, add to the drama of the primary action. The implacable dowager Lady Lufton, wishing to maintain her family's social position, pushes Griselda Grantly, daughter of Archdeacon Grantly, as the Duke's suitor. The competition between the (Archdeacon) Grantlys and the (Bishop) Proudies for suitors for their daughters adds great comic relief to the story, and the internecine manipulations among the clergy provide gentle satire in a novel which seems to be remarkably domestic in its focus.Trollope provides a full picture of Victorian life, representing many aspects of society, and though his view of the clergy has in earlier novels been a bit jaded, he is sympathetic to many of its representatives in this novel, seeing them as humans, rather than as types. A sweet novel, part love story and part social commentary, Framley Parsonage is charming, memorable for its characters and picture of Victorian England. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Framley Parsonage","review":"Anthony Trollope is a favorite author of mine, and this audio CD version of Framley Parsonage, read by Simon Vance, is well worth the investment. Deft use of language and a keen sense of human motivation, time, and place characterize all Trollope's writing, and those who enjoy period literature will be more than satisfied with this book. It starts slowly, as Trollope's stories often do, but once the background information is given, there are many interesting social, political, financial, and romantic plot developments to engage the reader and listener. Simon Vance's reading is superb, as always. The only caveat is that his rendering of the voice and character of young women is not as good as his pitch, tone, and inflection when narrating the voices of mature women and all men. His skill in rendering different dialects for different social classes and geographical regions is matchless. By all means, listen to this book."},{"Title":"Framley Parsonage","review":"Trollope's first serialized novel (in 16 monthly installments of 3 chapters each) was a great success. Though the publication, in 1860 onwards, was 'anonymous', there can have been little doubt about the author's identity, since three previous Barset novels had been well received in book form, and the cast is partly the same in this 4th volume.Trollope had little trouble adjusting to the special process of writing for a magazine. Publishing the start of a book when the rest is not yet in the author's mind causes a special kind of challenge. He went into this adventure with a spirit of curiosity: what will I make happen next?Our hero is a young clergyman in the fictional Barsetshire. We follow his career and his ambitions. He is the creature of the lady of the manor, who gave him the job (the 'living' in the strange system of the English church of the time). At times he likes to test his chains, to keep up his illusions of honor and freedom.Due to a misjudged act of financial support for a shady politician cum swindler, he gets into financial trouble. The suspense driver is not if, but how he will be saved from doom. The man Mark Robarts is clearly not marked for doom. Much of the charm of the tale comes from watching the confidence artist spin his yarns.The political struggles behind the plot are between Tories and Whigs, and between High Church and Low Church. Mr. Robarts has difficulties finding his way. This is the time of Lord Palmerston's rule, or rather of its end, despite the victory in the Crimean War and despite the success in suppressing the Indian 'mutiny'.One of the differences between Trollope and his dominant rival Dickens was that T always wrote about the 'now', while D and others put their stories back in time by a decade or two, or more. T's method allowed him to inject plenty of real life references, which helped create a special flavor of realism.Framley Parsonage was the bestseller of 1860, along with W.W.Collins' Woman in White, which T classified as sensationalist, vs his own realism.T's brand of humorous normality worked very well in the market and can still be used for an antidote against the hangovers that are caused by exuberant flights of fantasy."},{"Title":"Framley Parsonage","review":"When Trollope hits his stride nobody, as Henry James wrote of the author, portrays ordinary people and ordinary life better. Framley Parsonage is arguably Trollope at his best, doing what he does best--portraying ordinary people in provincial life. Marc Robarts is a clergyman with fine connections and perhaps a too fine opinion of himself. Raised among the nobility of the country neighborhood he is fortunate in his associations and ambitious in making his way in the world of Barsetshire.Lady Lufton, mother of his boyhood friend and leader of the Framley set is both patroness and problem. She is generous in her largesse but in exchange expects Robarts' gratitude in the form of obeisance and homage. Robarts' obligation rankles and spurs him to attempt something like independence. That is, find out if the grass is greener with the Chaldicotes--the other influential set in the county.The ensuing \\"drama\\", delightfully Trollopean, is all very predictable (if you have read more than two of his novels) and all very pleasant. The debts our hero incur bring him to the brink of ruin and disgrace but that is not really the point. Trollope is a keen observer of human character. He understands that even the fortunate chafe at their good fortunate and it is hard to be obliging when obligated. Robarts, like a spirited thoroughbred, has to learn to get along with bridle and bit if he ever expects to be given his head.Tossed in with the wonderful potpourri of characters is the marvelously vapid Griselda Grantly the neighborhood \\"belle femme\\" who also has an eye on upward mobility. Dull and moderately well born (granddaughter of a Bishop) she is blessed with extraordinary beauty and absolutely no intelligence. Her rise in contrast to Robarts' tumble rings perfectly true to those of us who understand that life is often unfair.Minor characters are wonderful \\"types\\" who add to the color and cleverness of this excellent tale. Framley Parsonage a real pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Framley Parsonage","review":"Framley Parsonage has received nothing but four or five star reviews on Amazon for good reason - it is a great book. Unlike Dr. Thorne, its predecessor in The Chronicles of Barsetshire, which can be read as a stand-alone novel, Framley Parsonage is filled with characters from other books in this series, Dr. Thorne himself being one of them; it is possible to read it out of the context of the series, but much useful information informing the action of the story will be lost. That being said, I think even the reader new to The Chronicles of Barsetshire is going to love this book, as I did.In Dr. Thorne the love of Mary Thorne for young Frank Gresham was the heart and soul of the novel; so to, in Framley Parsonage,the love of Lucy Robarts for Lord Lufton takes center stage. However, Trollope has enlarged the scope of this novel to include other important stories, such as the debt Lucy's brother Mark Robarts, vicar of Framley Parsonage, incurs when he signs his name to a bill of payment for 400 pounds for Mr. Sowerby, M.P., one of the villains of the novel. From the moment he signs the bill Mark does not know a minute of peace as he worries about what will happen to him when the note comes due.A villain from an earlier Barsetshire novels surfaces in Framley Parsonage to aggravate and confuse key players in the story. I speak of the infamous Mrs. Proudie, the Bishop of Barchester's wife. It would be fair to say that Mrs. Proudie is the real Bishop of Barchester, for that is how she conducts herself. Whenever Mrs. Proudie takes center stage, the action heats up in a hurry, much to our delight.Then there is Lady Lufton, the apparent enemy of Lucy Robarts. Lady Lufton considers Lucy \\"insignificant\\" and unsuitable to be the wife of her son Lord Lufton. She does everything in her power to prevent the match from taking place. The final scene between Lucy and Lady Lufton was moving and magnificent. Trollope was at his best as he dramatized the nobility of two good women who at last allowed their hearts to show them what was invisible to their eyes.Framley Parsonage is the 12th novel of Anthony Trollope that I have read; I place it right at the top with other favorites, such as Phineas Redux, from the Palliser series of novels by Trollope. As I have said often, I consider Anthony Trollope to be one of the finest novelists in any language. He is a master story teller who allows his readers to step back in time and enter a world which seems as real to the reader as life itself - so real that the mind, heart, and soul of the reader are engaged. Trollope speaks to us directly and we talk back to him with thoughtfulness and satisfaction. He enriches our lives and we are grateful to him. Add this review to the long list praising Framley Parsonage."},{"Title":"Framley Parsonage","review":"Framley Parsonage is the fourth in Trollope's Barsetshire novels.

We see Lady Lufton overcome her prejudice against Lucy. Lucy is a kind girl who minister to the family of the poor clergyman Josiah Crawley. She wins over the heart of Lady Lufton and the reader.Secondary plots concern the midlife romance of Miss Dunstable and good Doctor Thorne. Olivia Proudie daughter of the fussy busybody and scold Mrs. Proudie and the uxorious Bishop Proudie weds a clergyman Mr. Tickler who is a widower. Griselda Grantley is courted by the stupid Lord Dumbello who possesses a name and title to the Hartletop lands and fortune. Will she win Lord Lufton or choose Dumbello?All's well that ends well in this classic Trollopian tale. Long before Jan Karon, Anthony Trollope wrote humorous, moving and plot driven tales of the lives of the clergy dealing with real life problems, romance and challenges. In my opinion, an Anthony Trollope novel is a good way to spend a quiet evening before the fireplace. Enjoy this wonderful author and the world he created."},{"Title":"Framley Parsonage","review":"First read of author Trollope & thoroughly enjoyed the book. Interesting glimpse into life in a parsonage and the temptations that go with it. Looking forward to reading more of his works."},{"Title":"Framley Parsonage","review":"I have just finished reading all six novels which comprise the \\"Chronicles of Barsetshire,\\" and this (the fourth in the series) is one of my favorites. I loved them all, and although I found the pace a little slow at first, I soon learned to slow down and thoroughly enjoy reading about this fictional part of the English countryside and its inhabitants. I would encourage anyone who enjoys Victorian literature to try these novels, and to persevere beyond The Warden (the first in the series), which was my least favorite (although I realize some people like that one the best). Framley Parsonage is a wonderful read, and has a strong dose of happy ending (common to all of these novels, but especially strong in this one). So happy to have discovered Trollope - how excellent to discover a prolific writer whose work you really enjoy!"},{"Title":"Framley Parsonage","review":"As part of the Barchester series, it is unsurprising to learn that the two church parties are represented in this novel. On the High Church side are Lady Lufton and Mark Robarts, the vicar, the living at Framley having been the gift of the Lufton family. The other side, Low Church, consists of the Childicotes set of Mrs. Proudie and the bishop. Mark Robarts finds the rule of Lady Lufton lighter than that of Mrs. Proudie.When Mark's sister Lucy visits the vicarage, Lady Lufton becomes fearful that Lucy will become too close to Lady Lufton's son Ludovic. Fanny Robarts, Mark's wife, is stalwart in support of her sister-in-law. She ridicules Lady Lufton's concerns.Mr. Crawley is the rector at Hogglestock. Mr. Arabin arranges for Mr. Hogglestock's curacy at Hogglestock. The two men men have been school fellows. Lady Lufton wants Griselda Grantly, the daughter of the archdeacon and the grandchild of Mr. Harding and the niece of Mrs. Arabin, for Ludovic. Lord Lufton contrarily likes Lucy Robarts.Trollope uses irony to put across his points. Frequently he resorts to classical allusions. Suffice to say that everything does not turn out as Lady Lufton desires at the beginning of the tale. There is richness to the story combined with much good sense. Trollope hits his stride in this volume of the Barset group."},{"Title":"Framley Parsonage","review":"Dickens and Austen get all the 19th Century buzz and attention from modern American readers (and who can complain about that since they are always dancing on the heights of the novel) but American readers should spend a little time with the more pragmatic and never dull Trollope. Every one of his novels is filled with a world of detail and character that brings 19th century England to life (albeit in a fictional setting of Barsetshire in this case). No writer seemed to have as artful and practical a grasp on the importance of money, status and power and the ramifications of striving for these things on the individual and his society. Trollope's biting humor, endlessly wonderful characters and moral dilemas envelop the reader in his world. One can make a lifetime of going back to Trollope and his seemingly endless stream of novels and you will always be rewarded. Here in Framley Parsonage he continues the Barsetshire Chronicles in top fashion. This volume does not have as much biting humor as Barchester Towers (which I think remains his masterpiece, perhaps along with The Way We Live Now) but you will be richly rewarded for spending a little time with Mr. Trollope of whom Nathaniel Hawthorne stated that his work was \\"solid, substantial, written on the strength of beef.\\" Trollope's Framley Parsonage seems as appropriate for our time as Trollope's with its themes of unscrupulous politicians and lending. This novel and the series it is a part of will reward."},{"Title":"Framley Parsonage","review":"The fourth of the Chronicles of Barsetshire, Framley Parsonage (1861) is a gentle novel filled with memorable characters, including many characters from The Warden, Barchester Towers, and Dr. Thorne. Mark Robarts, a young vicar with a devoted wife, has a comfortable situation at Framley Parsonage on the estate of the indomitable Lady Lufton. Her son, now Lord Lufton, had been a friend of Mark Robarts at school, and it was their friendship which resulted in Mark's position. Mark, though conscientious in his duties and grateful for his situation, is ambitious, however, anxious to expand his horizons beyond Framley.Lady Lufton, who rules with an iron hand, is appalled when Mark decides to spend a weekend with a \\"fast\\" crowd, one which he believes can advance his career. Young and nave, he becomes the dupe of an aristocratic \\"con-man,\\" an MP named Nathaniel Sowerby, who persuades him to help him out of a financial jam by signing a note for five hundred pounds (more than half Robarts's yearly salary), allowing Sowerby to draw funds on Robarts's name. Though Sowerby swears he will resolve the problem within weeks, he needs an additional four hundred pounds when the note comes due.In the meantime, Robarts's sister Lucy arrives at Framley Parsonage upon the death of their father. Lucy, a sweet ing&eacute;nue in mourning, soon comes to the attention of Lord Lufton, who is fascinated by her naivete, a marked contrast with the women he has known to date. Though Lady Lufton has much more \\"significant\\" matrimonial prospects in mind for her son, the courtship begins, and though Lucy declines Lord Lufton's initial proposal, she remains in love with him. As Robarts's financial miseries become more pressing, and as Lucy's misery at having turned down Lord Lufton increases, the scene is set for a final showdown.Numerous peripheral characters, many of them known to readers of the series, add to the drama of the primary action. The implacable dowager Lady Lufton, wishing to maintain her family's social position, staunchly opposes the Duke's relationship with Lucy Robarts, pushing Griselda Grantly, daughter of Archdeacon Grantly, as the Duke's suitor. The competition between the (Archdeacon) Grantlys and the (Bishop) Proudies for suitors for their daughters adds great comic relief to the story, and the internecine manipulations among the clergy provide gentle satire in a novel which seems to be remarkably domestic in its focus.Trollope provides a full picture of Victorian life, representing many aspects of society, and though his view of the clergy has in earlier novels been a bit jaded, he is sympathetic to many of its representatives in this novel, seeing them as humans, rather than as types. A sweet novel, part love story and part social commentary, Framley Parsonage is charming, memorable for its characters and picture of Victorian England. n Mary WhippleThe WardenBarchester TowersDoctor Thorne (Barsetshire Novels)"},{"Title":"Framley Parsonage","review":"In this novel we find one Mark Robarts, clergyman and parson of Framley. He is an ambitious young man desirous of rising in society. He is friends since childhood with Lord Lufton who makes an unfortunate introduction in the person of Sowerby who seduces poor Mark into signing his name to a debt which the parson cannot afford.Mark Robarts's father passes away early on and his sister Lucy joins Mark and his wife at Framley Parsonage where Lord Lufton falls in love with her. Two more couples form and while I won't reveal how any of these relationships work out it wouldn't really matter if I did. Trollope's plots usually vary from bad to good but they are hardly ever of any importance anyway. What is important in a Trollope novel isn't what the plot is or how it concludes, it's how it works itself out and how Trollope paints his characters.The characters in Framley Parsonage are a little whiter and blacker than those of the previous novels in the Barsetshire series. Sowerby is by far and away the blackest and Trollope was so effective in painting him black that towards the end he clumsily appeals directly to the reader and assures us Sowerby isn't really as bad a fellow as he seems.Dr. Thorne and his niece Mary Gresham appear (from Doctor Thorne) as do the Grantlys and the Proudies (from Barchester Towers). Lucy Robarts is a fascinating woman even more headstrong here than Mary Gresham was in Doctor Thorne, but my favourite character in this novel is Lady Lufton. She opposes her son's desire to court and marry Lucy but does so politely and with consideration. At the same time, Lucy behaves in way Lady Lufton can only find irreproachable. So of course, not having anything with which to reproach Lucy, Lady Lufton has nothing with which to oppose her son's suit. And yet she does. How will this three-sided battle of wills, pitting Lord Lufton against his mother against Lucy against her suitor, resolve itself?Well, that would be telling, wouldn't it? Let's just say that Lady Lufton has painted herself into a corner and let us leave it at that.All in all, another fine example of Trollope's mastery of moral calculus.Vincent Poirier, Dublin"},{"Title":"Framley Parsonage","review":"Trollope weaves a romantic story about mid-19th century England that captures the flavor of the times while he creates vivid portraits of its characters.

Framley Parsonage speaks SO directly about a subject which is so integrated into our lives that it is hardly questioned in our society, namely ambition.The last hundred years of American society seem to speak of the primacy of \\"progress\\" as a driving force. Just look at the current discussion of flat economic indicators. God forbid that we only produce THE SAME as last year. But I digress.

I thought that wargames (boardgames) did a correct job on representing reality. Well, I was wrong. If you are interested in how units really manuvered and reacted then Nafzigers book 'Imperial Bayonet' is THE BOOK par excellence. French, Austrian, Prussian, Russian, British, Infantry, Cavalery, Artillery, Skimishers, Rallying points, unit control, you name it. They all get analyzed. There are even illustrations right down to company organisation: where the sergents stands, where the officers and NCOs are, the drummers and last but not least the normal soldiers of the rank and file. Even the space alotted to each soldier is revealed! Read it, just read it.

A must for any Napoleonic wargamer."},{"Title":"Imperial Bayonets: Tactics of the Napoleonic Battery, Battalion, and Brigade as Found in Contemporary Regulations","review":"I first became aware of this book as it is listed in the revised \\"Recommended Reading List\\" for the newest edition of Col. John Elting's A Military History and Atlas of the Napoleonic Wars. This is an excellent volume on drill regulations and tactics of the Napoleonic period and the analysis by the author adds much to the volume. No other volume on this subject for this period in history surpasses the information and insight included in this book.The book has numerous charts and diagrams illustrating the maneuvers that troops performed on the battlefield, as well as the different skirmishing techniques of the various armies. There are a total of 138 tactical diagrams, 91 tables, and 7 charts. These are helpful, easily read, and contribute immensely to the overall content of the book. The three combat arms are discussed at length (horse, foot and guns), combined arms techniques are discussed, as well as grand tactics and strategic operations.The tactics of the major belligerents of the Napoleonic period, French, Prussian, Austrian, Russian, and British are discussed in some depth. Maneuvering by battalion and brigade is fully covered, quoting French officers Meunier and Ney. Marshal Davout's 1811 instructions on skirmishing are referenced, as well as a very interesting section on Winfield Scott's use of skirmishers in the War of 1812. Scott, one of the most overlooked and underestimated general officers of the period, expertly adapted the French 1791 Reglement for American use. It should be noted that because of Scott's expertise and professionalism, as well as his talent for training, tactics, and battlefield leadership, and his common sense adaptation of the Reglement, enabled the troops he led in the subsequent battles on the Niagara frontier to match the British regulars volley for volley, as well as in the crossing of bayonets in the Battles of Chippawa, Lundy's Lane, and the siege of Fort Erie. These were the first instances of American regulars defeating their British counterparts on the battlefield in the open during the War of 1812.The section on French tactics is clear and concise, demonstrating an understanding of the subject not often displayed in other books of this type. The four chapters covering cavalry and artillery are exceptionally well done, and are clear, concise, and extremely helpful.Errors are few and far between. That being said, the use of the term 'converged' for either composite or provisional units, is incorrect-and it is more of a term used by wargamers than those used to actual military terminology. Geographical Engineers is a mistranslation of Ingenieurs-Geographes, which should be Topographical Engineers. The author's use of Jomini, who is notoriously inaccurate, is also somewhat disappointing, as Jomini's grave deficiencies as both a soldier and historian has been largely demonstrated. However, these minor faults do not detract at all from the overall accuracy and impact of the book.This superb work is a minor masterpiece. It is written in a lively, scholarly style, and is clear and concise. It is a valuable addition to any Napoleonic library, and if you don't own it, or at least haven't either read or used it, you are missing out on an expert work on Napoleonic tactics that will not be equaled or surpassed in the near future, if ever. This work is more than useful as a reference work and is enthusiastically recommended."},{"Title":"Imperial Bayonets: Tactics of the Napoleonic Battery, Battalion, and Brigade as Found in Contemporary Regulations","review":"The main value of this book is in its compilation and pre-digestion of the drill manuals of the major participants in the Napoleonic wars. It contains very little information about the actual battlefield use of the evolutions. Obviously, the evolutions used in battle are a subset of those discussed in the regulations, but which were used in practice, and why, is not discussed here.In addition, many of the quantitative analyses are rather suspect, in particular those of cavalry quality and weapons effectiveness. The study of the rates of formation changes, etc., are useful as a rough guide to relative speeds.In summary, the scope of this book is somewhat narrower than the title might suggest. There is no real analysis of practical tactics, along the lines of why armies did what they did on the battlefield; this is basically a description of the manoeuvers theoretically available to Napoleonic armies. As a convenient reference on the drill regulations of the major powers, however, this book is very useful."},{"Title":"Imperial Bayonets: Tactics of the Napoleonic Battery, Battalion, and Brigade as Found in Contemporary Regulations","review":"This is exactly the kind of work we need in order to go deeper into the understanding of warfare, tactics and wars: I hope George F. Nafziger will write other books of that kind on other historical periods (before (ancient regime) and after napoleonic wars, renaissance, first world war etc...). It is a perfect complement to more conventional books on the subject. Wargamers will definitely appreciate a lot this incomparable source of information. Historians might like it too, if only because this book gives basic complete knowledge to analyse texts on the battles of that period."},{"Title":"Imperial Bayonets: Tactics of the Napoleonic Battery, Battalion, and Brigade as Found in Contemporary Regulations","review":"Much of this book consists of Nafziger's mechanical working-out of estimates for the time it would theoretically take to complete various manoeuvres at regulation pace and cadence. There is a great deal of information about the minute details of the regulation evolutions for infantry and cavalry, but little about their actual use, and almost nothing about the actual experience of men in battle.The many diagrams, while essential, are primitive and sometimes hard to interpret, as some of them fail to distinguish a unit's front from its rear.Frequent errors in Nafziger's tables and calculations render his data unreliable. Finally, his emphasis seems to be more on finding reasonably plausible estimates of times, distances, and strengths of formations than it is on establishing accurate and reliable history. Where information is missing for one country, he simply uses the values of another. There is a ludicrous section in which he tries to establish a mathematical ranking of the effectiveness of the cavalry of various armies, many of whom never fought each other.A far better alternative for those interested in history, though about the era just before that covered by &quot;Imperial Bayonets&quot;, is Christopher Duffy's &quot;The Military Experience in the Age of Reason&quot;."},{"Title":"Imperial Bayonets: Tactics of the Napoleonic Battery, Battalion, and Brigade as Found in Contemporary Regulations","review":"Nafziger's compilation has usefulness if one wants to know the drill regulations. However, if the reader is looking for what the units actually did in combat, it is better to seek a different quality work that utilizes after-action reports (Scott Bowden's NAPOLEON AND AUSTERLITZ comes to mind). Thus, IMPERIAL BAYONETS will provide a basis of drill knowledge, if that is your objective."},{"Title":"Imperial Bayonets: Tactics of the Napoleonic Battery, Battalion, and Brigade as Found in Contemporary Regulations","review":"This book to be honest is a bit of a waste of time as the reality of his calculated movement rates are fanciful at best. He gives precise step distances, for whome and where I ask. A 5'2\\" man, a 6'3\\" man, across rock and bush covered ground, through sparse woods, ploughed fields, mud etc etc. Its poor on the combat side and low on real facts of battles. It is not even relevent to wargames to be honest because the detail he goes into is not relevent and cannot be transfered to the tabletop."},{"Title":"The Masque of the Black Tulip (PINK CARNATION)","review":"This is the second in the Pink Carnation series and I am finding these books very enjoyable. While they have romance, they also feature female adventurers, intrigue, and quite a bit of humor. These aren't meant for someone looking for a serious historical read or pure romantic fiction.

I normally do not enjoy romance-laden novels, but this was written in such a humorous and adventurous way that I could not help but fall in love with it. The characters are well drawn and incredibly life like. Henrietta's frustrations reflect those in most women, while Miles is charmingly clueless both in love and in spying.The parallel story set in modern day is fun as well.

Highly recommend!"},{"Title":"The Masque of the Black Tulip (PINK CARNATION)","review":"I absolutely loved this second novel in the pink carnitation series.

I was excited when I first saw \\"Pink Carnation\\" on the shelves of the bookstore. But I can't read them without feeling as though I'm reading another inadequate Georgette Heyer imitator. I have never found an author who can even approach Ms. Heyer at her best, and all of them seem to use her books as source material (whether they actually do or not, it seems that way). \\"Pink Carnation\\", \\"Black Tulip\\" et al. also remind me of one of my all-time favorite books, a short, YA title called \\"The Sherwood Ring\\" by Elizabeth Pope. Why? Well, its that modern-girl-in-library mixed with chapters of historical fiction approach. The Sherwood Ring worked the same way. OK- accuse me of having read so much historical fiction/romance that I can't avoid seeing similarities. It's probably true, but unfortunately, although I want to love Ms. Willig's books, they seem mostly about repeating conventions, rather than adding new ingredients."},{"Title":"The Masque of the Black Tulip (PINK CARNATION)","review":"Yet again, Ms. Willig impressed me with her lighthearted take on historical romance/mystery! Although I read these books in the completely WRONG order (first Emerald Ring, then Pink Carnationa, and finally Black Tulip), I was taken in by all of them--this one no less than the others. Although I felt that the \\"oh no heroine might be compromised marry her off quickly\\" story line was somewhat repetitive between this installment and Emerald Ring, the stories of Henrietta and Miles vs. Letty and Geoff were different enough to keep me intrigued. I'll just say that I can't wait for the 4th Pink Carnation novel!"},{"Title":"The Masque of the Black Tulip (PINK CARNATION)","review":"There really isn't a better way to describe this book except for wonderful! I loved every single part of it and it was a great follow up to the first book. Willig's use of interesting historical detail mixed with humour and wit makes this book hard to put down.

I recommend this book to everyone who enjoys reading a tale that warms the heart & lightens the spirit. Can't wait for the next one to come out!"},{"Title":"The Masque of the Black Tulip (PINK CARNATION)","review":"I have a love-hate relationship with historical romance/fiction. It comes from the fact that my undergrad was done in history so I look at everything with that point of view. But even with that tidbit I thoroughly enjoy this series. Not just because I've met the lovely author. I was thoroughly invested in the historical characters more than present day ones, for once. Not that the present day ones weren't nice and lovely; they were. I just was more invested in the historical story.Here is how this series works: there is Eloise Kelly, a present day Harvard grad student working on her dissertation in England with Colin Selwick, who happens to be not only adorable and her crush (kind-of-sort-of long story), but Selwick also happens to have historical archives that Eloise needs. Of course Colin wants nothing to do with it; thankfully his aunt does and lets Eloise tackle the archives.When Eloise starts to dig into the archives for her thesis, she discovers the Black Tulip in the early nineteenth century France, who is the arch nemesis of the Pink Carnation (the first book in the series). Eloise is dying to find out more, and she does. But she also discovers Henrietta and Miles, and oh boy did I fall in love with both of them.I'm pretty sure there isn't a time period I wouldn't be in love with Henrietta and Miles. They're both hopelessly in love with each other but in great denial about it. While one of them is (in denial), one of them is clearly in love with the other just they try to hide it well.There are a lot of surprising twists and turns that, days later still leave me wondering about.

Known simply as the Black Tulip, this person is creating havoc on the espionage scene.Unbeknownst to the War Office, Henrietta Selwick, younger sister of Lord Richard Selwick, himself a former spy known as the Purple Gentian, is in contact with the Pink Carnation, an English spy operating in Paris. Henrietta has decided that she will assist England by discovering the identity of the Black Tulip, thus saving her country from invasion by the French.Separate from long-time friend Miles Dorrington, who used to help her brother Richard during his days as the Purple Gentian, Henrietta begins trying to track down the Black Tulip by using parlor games and through her contact with the Pink Carnation. Miles, on the other hand, is using more conventional methods, such as checking immigration lists and tailing suspects. But the Black Tulip knows they are on the scent. Will they unmask the agent in time to save England?Thus is the plot of \\"The Masque of the Black Tulip\\", the second novel in Lauren Willig's Pink Carnation series. This one picks up historically a few months after the conclusion of the first, and like its predecessor, it also revolves around the present-day story of Eloise Kelly, an American historian researching Napoleonic era spies who worked for England. Eloise's story takes place only a few hours after the conclusion of the first book, and due to the constant references to its plot, it really is better if you read that one first.Overall, while this book was fast-paced and as humorous as the original, I didn't like it quite as much. I had correctly guessed the identity of the Black Tulip immediately upon that character's entrance into the novel, and it was more like waiting for Henrietta and Miles to catch on. Also, this one featured much less of Eloise, almost making her a wasted character. While it is still a great combination of historical intrigue and chick lit, it isn't as good as its predecessor. That being said, I will read the next one."},{"Title":"The Masque of the Black Tulip (PINK CARNATION)","review":"I loved this book as much as the first, The Secret History of the Pink Carnation. This one was more romance than mystery, but there's a healthy dose of each. And humor! Once again, Eloise isn't sure what she wants, but she's sure she's making a pretty big fool of herself. And back in history, the secret agents of England and France are up to their old tricks, except this time, Henrietta, the Purple Gentian's sister, wants in on the action. It's not too hard to figure out who the Black Tulip really is, but watching the characters follow the red herring is part of the fun.

Eloise finds plenty of mystery, adventure, romance, and humor in the old code books. She also possibly finds a little romance of her own with Colin, the owner of the code book. This sequel has all the fun, excitement and spying that we saw in the first volume and we do revisit some of the characters in the first book, but in a rather deminished role. Like the first book, the narrative viewpoint sifts from modern to the 19th century and back again at a dizzing pace, but this only adds to the fun. The dialogue is witty, the character's in both centuries are people that we get to know and to care about, and while this book is not altogether historically accurate, as the author, Lauren Willig, takes pains to let us know in a historical note at the end, it is an entertaining and fun read.

However, all the fun and exciting sneaking around and spying still occurs, so no fear! I particularly loved this book (and this series in general) because they are an entertaining and comical read. There are moments in this book that made me laugh out loud at the hilarity of the situation, turn red with complete embarrassment at some of these characters' antics, and on and on. The dialogue is witty, the character interaction engaging, and the set-up of this novel kept me wanting to read more. Two different stories evolve within this novel: Eloise's feelings about Colin continue to grow, while the great 19th century story is told. I personally enjoyed the interplay of the two stories...they were both entertaining and rather suspenseful in that I couldn't wait to get back to the other story to see what was happening.Although not historically accurate (which the author corrects in a historical note at the end) this novel is an entertaining and easy read. Readers should be aware of this novel's gravitation towards Harlequin romance, though it was definitely not too much in any sense...I personally was left feeling like I had wished we as the readers could be a shown a bit more of these steamier moments! This is a great novel to pick up for those looking for some romance tied in with scheming, spying and other fun activities."},{"Title":"The Masque of the Black Tulip (PINK CARNATION)","review":"If you are a fan of The Scarlet Pimpernel and all things related, you will love this series by Laura Willig. Instead, however, of the period hero usually being in male form, Willig's \\"heroes\\" are women. The books are beautifully written with just the right touch of occasional humor."},{"Title":"The Masque of the Black Tulip (PINK CARNATION)","review":"The Masque of the Black Tulip brings us once again into the modern day life of Eloise the grad student and Colin the Selwick descendent. And of course the past lives of Richard, Jane, Miles, Amy and Henrietta. Slipping into the pages of this book was like putting on a comfortable pair of shoes. You knew where you were, picking up precisely where you left off. But oh the places you will go.We see more flirtations between Eloise and Colin, as you might in any good chic lit. But it remains mostly light, sarcastic and fun. They have a witty commentary all the while Eloise is flipping through Colin's family papers. And oh what we learn in those family papers this time.Miles is tired of being the side kick, its not that he doesn't love his fried Richard (The Purple Gentian), he does of course. But now that Richard has been unmasked Miles would like to find his own way to help the kingdom. The problem for Miles is he happens to be very big, very broad, and very blonde. He doesn't move with the same graceful ease as a general spy, rather he looms. And once in a place is somewhat like a bull in a china shop. But never mind he has charm! I positively love Miles; he is witty, charming and just hilarious. I found myself laughing out loud (and getting some looks) on more pages than I can count.Miles is eventually given the job by the War Office of finding the Black Tulip, a very dangerous French spy. You really will enjoy following Miles and Henrietta as they see about catching the Black Tulip. Because Henrietta doesn't see why Richard should have all the fun. Why should her brother be the only spy in the family? Along the way somehow the pair (separately) realise...they are in love. But the key is...will they tell one another? If you enjoy history, and a bit of fun you will love the Mask of the Black Tulip. This is one you can't miss"},{"Title":"The Masque of the Black Tulip (PINK CARNATION)","review":"The Masque of the Black Tulip is the second in what I hope will be a long series. I know a few reviewers thought this installment was weaker than the first novel (The Secret History of the Pink Carnation), but I don't agree. The only thing the first book offered that this one doesn't is the benefit of being the first. Everything was new and exciting and interesting about the writing and the story precisely because it was new. But to my mind, The Masque of the Black Tulip is just as enjoyable a read as The Secret History.Just as with the first book, this novel is a blend of regency romance, humor, history, clever allusions to popular culture and historical events, and spy intrigue. As the order of those descriptions suggest, this is primarily a romance novel, and a wonderful one at that. I see Lauren Willig as a cross between Julia Quinn and Helen Fielding and the result is a very readable book that rises above the mediocre romance novels and chick lit that's published every year.This installment follows Miles and Henrietta, two friends who suddenly find themselves attracted to each other. There's a little less of the heavy-duty spy stuff than in the first, but that was fine with me. The plot rolls along, the romance unfolds, the Eloise/Colin interludes break up the story here and there (but in an enjoyable way, I thought) and it's all a joy to read. Lauren Willig has a distinctive, truly witty voice and knows how to deliver a satisfying read.I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys regency romances, chick lit, or fun beach reads with a historical twist."},{"Title":"The Masque of the Black Tulip (PINK CARNATION)","review":"These books (The Masque of the Black Tulip and The Pink Carnation) are great books. I love fiction and romance, so I am very impressed with Willig's witty novels. Her characters are actually funny yet interesting and the books are long enough to develop the characters as well.This is the second installment of the series. This is the story of Harriet and Miles who find love while trying to stop the Napoleonic invasion of England by France. They are both out to find the elusive and dangerous Black Tulip. This book is great for those of you who love historical romance, but will also have some fiction fans as well."},{"Title":"The Masque of the Black Tulip (PINK CARNATION)","review":"If you like slightly silly romantic historical fiction (as I do) then you will probably be very satisfied by this book. It's not the kind of book you're going to brag about reading at a party; yet it is a quick read. I read it in a few hours; and enjoyed it just as much as the first one. The parallel story with the narrator is slightly better than in the first book; but can still be an unwanted interruption. Overall- a guilty pleasure."},{"Title":"The Masque of the Black Tulip (PINK CARNATION)","review":"Read on the heels of the first book in the series, I found this book to be charming, suspenseful at times and very hard to put down. I found myself thinking about the book's characters while going about my normal routine. A bit less of spying and more of intrigue this time around, but over all, I think the author does have me hooked on this series. Great to read for those who prefer serial stories instead of having every single loose end tied up at the end of 300 pages.This story follows the romance of Hen and Miles and their own escapades into spying and ferreting out the elusive Black Tulip, who is ultimately unmasqued, but will turn up, I am sure, in the next novel!The author did take some literary license with certain instances in the book, but does so with full disclosure as to historical inaccuracies and sets them straight after the book ends. It is unfair to judge the book on regency inaccuracies, after all, the author is not writing a boring tome to be read in a college course called Regency period 101! The object of reading a fiction book is to suspend one's belief and immerse one's self in the plot. I found it delightful and it is a great read for those who like romance novels, chick lit, historical fiction or just want something different to read."},{"Title":"The Masque of the Black Tulip (PINK CARNATION)","review":"As with the other books in this series, this book marries the \\"chick lit\\" genre with historical fiction - my two favorites. As with any \\"chick lit\\" book, you know you're not in for a novel worthy of a Nobel Prize in literature. I don't know that I would call it clever, like I saw in another review. Novel idea, maybe. But, I still found the book entertaining.In this second book of the series, I related a lot more to the historical heroine, Henrietta. A lot of Willig's female characters seem to be ditzes seriously lacking any independent spirit, including the modern grad student, Eloise. Kind of surprising from an author who graduated from an Ivy League school. Speaking of which, I like the idea of the dual plot line with Eloise, but it's slow sometimes & kind of like watching paint dry. And she is seriously neurotic - I'm embarrassed for her sometimes.All in all, still worth a read if you're a follower of Willig's series."},{"Title":"The Masque of the Black Tulip (PINK CARNATION)","review":"Second in the series, The Masque of the Black Tulip was just as delightful (perhaps more fun even?) as The Secret History of the Pink Carnation. If you've read Pink Carnation, then you've already met the main hero and heroine of Black Tulip. Henrietta Selwick, younger sister of the notorious Richard Selwick, is funny and bright and even occasionally silly. There's a scene where she hides from Miles Dorrington that it just hilarious. Miles is, of course, the hero of this story. Being Richard's best friend from childhood and very close to the whole Selwick family, he is deeply involved in all things spy. Miles is deliciously awkward and gets distressingly tangled up in things he shouldn't, including Henrietta.This was a fun romp full of mystery, romance and humor. A fantastic addition to the series. And don't forget, you get to follow along with modern-day Eloise and her budding crush on Colin Selwick, a descendant of Lord Richard, the Purple Gentian."},{"Title":"The Masque of the Black Tulip (PINK CARNATION)","review":"I seem to have a knack for starting a series with the second book instead of the first,and then hopping back and forth through the run, so I appreciate a series that allows me to do that. I had no problem picking this one up and going with it, so that's a big point in its favor.What I ended up loving about it more than anything else was it's sense of fun and its willingness to skewer just about everything in its path: modern romance novels, chick lit, modern historical fiction, bodice-rippers, academia, and eighteenth century adventure and romance novels among them. It's a big leap to make your leads so clueless that they can't see that the passion they have for each other is mutual, but it pays off. I haven't laughed so much in ages."},{"Title":"The Masque of the Black Tulip (PINK CARNATION)","review":"As with my review of The Pink Carnation, I also used this book as a cleanser of the mind. The plot is similar to its predecessor, making me think that Ms. Willig has come up with a formula to her writing - only time will tell. There is danger, romance (opposites falling in love) and the quest to find a secret agent, the Black Tulip. I recommend for those who wish to escape for a time, read the previous book or are interested in historical romances."},{"Title":"The Masque of the Black Tulip (PINK CARNATION)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the first book in the series - THE SECRET HISTORY OF THE PINK CARNATION. I thought it was funny and imaginative. But the second book is even better. The author finds her stride.The story of Lady Henrietta and Miles is better developed. I continue to like the switching back and forth between the current romance/mystery and the 200-year-old one, although some say the story about Eloise and Colin is superfluous.If you like this book, don't miss the first in the series or the next, which is THE DECEPTION OF THE EMERALD RING."},{"Title":"The Masque of the Black Tulip (PINK CARNATION)","review":"Usually Willig's books are fun, light reading for me but this one was a bit much. The plot followed her usual romps with Eloise, the graduate student studying spying activities during the English/French war with Napoleon at the head of his troops. And, of course, Eloise falls for her host, Colin Selwig, hoping for a romantic adventure. However, all this is normal for this series. What bothered me was some of the dialog. I doubt that women of this period used the phrase, \\"Chop, Chop!\\" In addition, the sappy conversation between Henrietta and Miles during and after their fight with the Marquise de Montval and her men was downright silly. I almost put the book down at this point but continued to the end. In fact, I enjoyed the story as a whole but it's hard to forgive the author for that conversation. One final comment and I'll quit. the last chapter seemed like an afterthought to me. I thought the book should have ended with the previous chapter. I did enjoy her historical notes at the end where she explains while her spies did not exist there were operatives who bore floral names. However, I have read others in the series that I enjoyed more. You may agree."},{"Title":"The Masque of the Black Tulip (PINK CARNATION)","review":"This sequel to Willig's first book shares with the first in the series clever, graceful writing as well as entertaining allusions to history, literature and music. Further, Ms. Willig is a funny lady who frequently made me laugh out loud.Alas, that wasn't enough. Black Tulip is actually a continuation of its predecessor, Pink Carnation, starting at the same time Pink Carnation ended and featuring virtually all of its characters. Worse, even after 400-plus pages Black Tulip leaves completely unresolved the modern day romance between the intrepid girl historian and her English would-be boyfriend, and leaves at large the 19th Century villainess, who is a murderess and French spy.The book's unresolved plot lines might be all right if Black Tulip were just one episode in a weekly television drama but presenting a reader with a cliffhanger ending to a long book is to my mind unfair. Ms. Willig and her publishers apparently have their eyes on the main chance and wish to establish a franchise with this series that will run over many, many books. I wish them well but despite my deep admiration for Ms. Willig's talent, I won't be reading any more of the series. Fool me once, and all that."},{"Title":"The Masque of the Black Tulip (PINK CARNATION)","review":"I avoided the Pink Carnation for a long time because it was a \\"popular\\" book, and my preferences rarely run with the crowd. Still, people assure me that popular books are popular for a reason, and so I picked it up and mostly enjoyed it.This book was a watered down version of the Pink Carnation story, and I regret that I wasted my time actually finishing it. The main characters are both cartoonish and ridiculous, and I felt as if I were being dragged through a fluffy romance novel with no semblance of a plot whatsoever. By the end of the book I was sticking with it just for the hope of a decent sex scene, but even that was ruined by the totally out of character behavior of our proper English girl, who brazenly encouraged behavior that, while normal in our times, would have been somewhat deviant back then.The book was fluffy, the spy intrigue was an afterthought, and the sex was out of character and boring to boot. Skip this one, or borrow it if you must, but don't waste your money."},{"Title":"The Masque of the Black Tulip (PINK CARNATION)","review":"With the promise of a plot similar to Willig's first book, I bought and read this book in record time. Willig's sequel to THE SECRET HISTORY OF THE PINK CARNATION is without a doubt one of those books that you cannot bear to put down. But compared to it's predecessor, the book was bland, and did not demanding the attention of the reader as the PINK CARNATION did. The romance between the two characters, Henrietta Selwick and Miles Dorrington is too subtle (and not as developed as the romance between the current Amy and Richard Selwick, and the adventures that these two shared were not as exciting, nor as detailed. The ending seemed too hastily done and the reader is left with an empty stomach, but even with all these setbacks, it is hard to not want more of this series. :)."},{"Title":"The Masque of the Black Tulip (PINK CARNATION)","review":"If you have trouble sleeping you may become fond of this book. Instead of taking a sleeping pill, keep it handy on the night table. Read two or three pages, four or five at most; your eyelids will get heavy - and it's time to turn out the light and fall asleep."},{"Title":"The Masque of the Black Tulip (PINK CARNATION)","review":"This is the first of the Eloise Kelly books I've read, and it was a complete waste of time. I picked the book up from the library, expecting a historical mystery with spies battling their wits. Instead, I got a third-rate romance full of clich&eacute;.Almost all of the plot devices have been used and reused in hundreds if not thousands of other romance stories that I found myself frequently rolling my eyes as I flipped through the pages. The characters, both the main ones and the supporting ones, are shallow and immature. For the present-day couple, Eloise is utterly pathetic as she fantasizes and drools over Colin, a man who in all appearances dislikes her. Does the woman have any self-respect? How many stories have there been where a couple initially hate each other but eventually fall in love? For the historical couple, Henrietta borders on being irritating and obnoxious while Miles often behaves like a fool. Again, how many stories have there been where a couple in fact love each other but mistakenly believe that the other person does not return the affection?The spy part of the book is laughable, as if it was thrown in as an afterthought. The so-called \\"spies\\" are merely men and women of high society playing roles in a childish game. They wouldn't survive for five seconds in the real world. Perhaps the author should stick to romantic stories and not misrepresent her books as anything else."},{"Title":"The Masque of the Black Tulip (PINK CARNATION)","review":"I started out reading what I thought was a mediocre mystery/spy novel that was trying too hard to be Possession, and then I was surprised when it turned into soft-core porn. Be warned! This book would be more accurately described as a romance novel than historical fiction, so unless you want to read constant references to bulges in knee-britches and breasts popping out of bodices, I would recommend passing this one by."},{"Title":"The Masque of the Black Tulip (PINK CARNATION)","review":"Because of the author's academic credentials, I expected a really substantive \\"historical mystery.\\"Instead, it's a coy, saccharine Harlequin romance.Rather revolting, actually."},{"Title":"The Masque of the Black Tulip (PINK CARNATION)","review":"I read the pink carnation and found it entertaining albeit hard to believe. Almost too cartoonish. This second book is just a recycling of themes and doesn't really bring any interesting characters to boot. I won't be continuing the series."},{"Title":"The Masque of the Black Tulip (PINK CARNATION)","review":"Were they lighthearted drollities rather than stomping elephants? O dear. Having read many detective novels, historical and otherwise, and possesed of a passion for Georgette Heyer, this reader looked foward to what promised to be a diverting read. But alas, while I was glued to the book for the evening (one I have lost and shall never recover), it was in awe struck horror, and a masochistic desire to see just how bad it could be. And it was very bad. The author's bio notes that she is studying both history and law at Havard - how? have they read her books? - I have quite lost my respect for that august institution if this is the calibre of work they produce. The author obviously feels that teen romance pulp is the height of literature, and reproduces it with little or no difference between time periods or characters. This is the history of the world as acted by your college's sororities (with the one frat guy playing all the love-interest parts). I pass over the scenes set in France - Mon Dieu - with closed eyes and a shudder,the lack of historical (or life) verisimilitude, and close with the earnest wish that given the author obviously had a fetish for strong, masculine hands, perhaps someone could use theirs to strangle her."},{"Title":"The Masque of the Black Tulip (PINK CARNATION)","review":"Being a large fan of historical fiction (and non-fiction), I was prepared for the usual period correct historical backdrop and a story based true events that were wrapped in an intriguing twisting story. I would say on both the historical and mystery fronts, the author only succeeded half way.Although the novel is technically set during the Napoleon era, the rest of the story didn't fit correctly with the time period. The banter was amusing, but unlike what people would say at that time. In addition, there were references to things, such as adoption, which I believe didn't exist at the time in the way Henrietta referred to it (put oneself up for adoption). The interactions seemed to be supplanted from the present to that era, with the only the costumes and setting working for the period theme.The \\"mystery\\" of who was the Black Tulip was not interesting or a mystery. Vaughn being the Black Tulip was a dead horse that was so obviously not correct. Most of the plot wasn't about the Black Tulip, but the romance between Miles and Henrietta. I am a fan of romance novels, but this wasn't the plot. The romance distracted from the real goal of the book, which was spy with a flower alias.I thought the book was a good read, but would not read it again. The author should have picked a genre. She didn't pick a historical novel, a mystery or a romance. She had some jumbled hodge-podge of all three that didn't harmonize."},{"Title":"The Masque of the Black Tulip (PINK CARNATION)","review":"I really liked the Miles and Hen characters in the first book, and looked forward to seeing their relationship evolve, and of course more great humor and spying, and more modern romance with our historian and Colin. My complaint with the first book was that Amy and Richard seemed too stupid to be successful as spies. Perhaps my complaint was heard, as some of the outlandishness was toned back, perhaps at the cost of humor. Plot-wise, quite good, but I also got the sense that the author was stretching content to prepare for a third book. This book needed more Colin, I think. I did not laugh uncontrollably at this book, or feel as compelled to read it all in one sitting. I wish I'd waited for the paperback--tradesize like the first one."},{"Title":"The Masque of the Black Tulip (PINK CARNATION)","review":"I finished the first one in one day. It took me almost ten to finish this one. This book wasn't bad, per se, but it certainly wasn't up to the caliber of the first.I found the romance a little cliched and although the characters were incredibly engaging, it was full of contradictions. The whole \\"in love with my best friend's little sister\\" idea has been done to death, and for two people who are supposedly as good friends as Miles and Henrietta are, the lack of honesty about anything truly important certainly makes me doubt the sincerity of that friendship.Also, while it wasn't obvious who the Pink Carnation was in the first book, the identity of the Black Tulip was obvious from the first word about the character, if only from the genre of the book.The romance-within-a-romance -- ie, Eloise and Colin -- was much more interesting this time around, if a bit rushed. Simply because so many loose threads are left -- the shattered friendship of Miles and Richard, the strange behavior of Colin -- there's definately a third book coming. I bought the first one as a paperback, and took this one out of the library as a hardcover. Will I buy it eventually? Yes, but only in paperback. Will I buy the third? Yes, with the same proviso. I'm hoping this are just typical \\"second act blues\\" and the third book will pick me right back up."},{"Title":"The Masque of the Black Tulip (PINK CARNATION)","review":"If the story plot sounds complicated, it really isn't. While it jumps around, pulling you from character to character, making you wonder who might be a spy, the real story centers around this complicated relationship and emotional dance between Henrietta and Miles. Although you realize there is a spy story going on, the tension mainly focuses on the misunderstandings and social pressures between the two love birds.As with the last story, there is a good deal of romance involved in the story, but isn't developed until the later part of the novel. In this particular installment, there seemed to be less storytelling done from the present, which I actually missed...strange enough. I have been curious about Eloise, and can sense that she has developed feelings for the man who owns the journals she is reading. Honestly, I did want a bit more from the present, and grew to care a little more about our grad student. For some reason, now that she has uncovered the story behind The Pink Carnation, I wanted to know more about what Eloise was going to do with her story, and hope to get more in the novels that follow!Overall, I have enjoyed these stories and am looking forward the the next installment. This second book leaves you with a bit of a cliffhanger with Eloise, and dropped Henrietta and Miles a bit, even though you knew they were all right and happy. There is a certain playfulness to these stories that I find interesting, and I enjoy following to see how the spies will catch their enemy, and how their female spy love interest will help them. These really are fun to follow, and while you could probably read them individually, I do think you need some back up from the previous story to really dive in. However, if you like period dramas with a bit of romance built into a spy thriller, then you might enjoy these."},{"Title":"The Masque of the Black Tulip (PINK CARNATION)","review":"This was the second installment of Lauren Willig's Pink Carnation series. Be sure to read The Secret History of the Pink Carnation first. The Masque of the Black Tulip was funny and romantic. Willig is an excellent writer. I flew right through this book. - worth the money."},{"Title":"The Masque of the Black Tulip (PINK CARNATION)","review":"Eloise, the Harvard grad student, who uncovered the identity of the Pink Carnation, is set to discover a new mysterious identity, the Black Tulip. As she does some more research at the home of Colin Selwick, descendent of Henrietta and Richard Selwick, she discovers more than history when her feelings for Colin begin to change.The Pink Carnation is still the most elusive spy yet and is getting help from Lady Henrietta Selwick, the sister of the Purple Gentian. While Richard Selwick hasn't received any spying missions, Hen is still being watched carefully. Instead, Richard's best friend, Miles Dorrington has been given 2 tasks, to watch over Hen while he enjoys marital bliss and find the most dangerous French spy, The Black Tulip.As Miles and Hen enjoy the everyday joys of Regency London, such as attending balls, they cannot forget that someone out there is looking for them. When Lord Vaughn, a notorious rake returns to London, he sets his attentions to Henrietta, causing them to be in awkward yet suspicious situations. And a mysterious, but beautiful woman, a marquise, has targeted Miles. Even through these distractions, Miles and Hen fall in love, and when caught in a compromising situation by Hen's angry brother, they get married.But married life isn't all that it's set out to be. While returning home from their hasty wedding, Miles and Hen are shot at from another carriage. They suspect that the Black Tulip has found them. While Miles checks in with the War Ministry, Hen decides to do some snooping of her own and finds herself in the deadliest situation of all.I can't even begin to say how much I loved this book, along with its predecessor, The Secret History of the Pink Carnation. I was really happy to find out that the author, Lauren Willig, is writing a 3rd carnation book, and there may, in fact, be others. I tried to read this as slow as I could, but I still managed to finish this in 1 day. The Masque of the Black Tulip has everything, from romance to mystery to historical fiction. This book will appeal to anyone. I love how the novel is set in London in the 1800s, yet has a bit of a modern story too. If you haven't read these books yet, you are missing out on a lot. I can't wait until the next Carnation book comes out!"},{"Title":"The Masque of the Black Tulip (PINK CARNATION)","review":"I picked this book up at random, not knowing what was in store. I expected a dry historical mystery of some sort, but found instead an incredibly humorous romance and social satire. Willig's history is clearly well-researched and her spy intrigue interesting, but the interplay between the characters and hilarious passages will keep you reading all night long."},{"Title":"The Masque of the Black Tulip (PINK CARNATION)","review":"Harvard graduate student Eloise Kelly continues to search the English archives to learn more about the mysterious Regency era spy the Pink Carnation (see THE SECRET HISTORY OF THE PINK CARNATION). The History PHD candidate comes across some interesting early nineteenth century correspondence between Lady Henrietta and the elusive Pink Carnation.Henrietta learns that France has sent the Black Tulip to England to assassinate the Pink Carnation. No one in the War Office has any idea who the Black Tulip is or whether the person is male or female though most assume the assassin is a male except for the few who knows what sex the Pink Carnation is. Unable to ignore what she found out, Henrietta is determined to uncover the identity of the killer secret agent before that person can harm the Pink Carnation. At the same time the War Office assigns her best friend rake Miles Dorrington to do likewise. As initially the two counter spies trip over one another, they admit their attraction and fall in love, but he wants her out of the deadly contest while she demands to be his partner in every way.This sequel contains much of the same ingredients that made the first book so delightful. The story line stars two likable protagonists with the same objective, but differing views on how and who should achieve this goal. Thus the likable lead couple adds romance and tension while much of the support cast provides humor and even more tenseness to this strong historical espionage. Though Ms. Kelly's role seems unnecessary and the final confrontation between spies a stretch considering the talent readers will take immense pleasure from this enchanting thriller and look forward to more flowery espionage romances.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"A Chorus of Detectives (Signet)","review":"I've always loved and re-read Barbara Paul's very short series of Golden Opera Age cozies. The mysteries are usually slight, and if judged as mysteries, fail miserably. The killer always takes a back seat and is revealed in one of those moments that Lionel Twain derides in \\"Murder By Death.\\"Instead, what has always made these books fun is the cast of amateur detectives, the most glittering names on the 1910s Metropolitan Opera roster. Farrar, Caruso, Scotti, Amato, Destinn, and their boss Gatti-Casazza. The characterizations are guaranteed to be way out of whack, but whatever. It's still fun. I'm predisposed to like these books anyway because I've collected the recordings of these artists and they're as well-played on my ipod as anything of more recent years.While the other two opera books of Paul's are light-hearted and fun, this one had a more somber tone, and throughout I often felt more sad than amused. It's 1920, and Amato's voice isn't what it once was (his 1921 recordings attest to that). Farrar has the young and sexy specter of Maria Jeritza looming over her shoulder for the next season. Caruso has to share roles with new arrival Beniamino Gigli while suffering ill health. He hemorrhages blood during a performance of L'Elisir d'Amore and his condition a topic of conversation among the others throughout the book. Destinn is changed by her wartime house arrest on her Czech estate, bitter and apathetic. The gay and frivolous pre-war theater world is gone forever, and a scene between Farrar and David Belasco emphasizes the theme of this book, which is about final curtains and graceful retirements after years of fierce dedication and stardom.So the peppy, fun reads of Prima Donna At Large and A Cadenza For Caruso don't apply to this last installment, but if one has an affection for the era and its celebrities, then this book doesn't disappoint."},{"Title":"A Chorus of Detectives (Signet)","review":"An ailing Caruso, with the aid of several other stars of the Metropolitan Opera House, tries to track down a killer who has a nasty habit of doing away with the chorus members.Anyone who enjoys a neat murder plot, set against a carefully researched background, will find this book well worth reading.Ms Paul has crafted another interesting mystery, and more: she has brought her historical characters back to vivid life."},{"Title":"2005 Guide to Literary Agents (Guide to Literary Agents)","review":"Finding an agent is one of the most challenging pursuits you'll encounter as a writer.

Of course, the listings themselves, of over 600 literary agents, constitute the bulk of the book. Each entry contains contact info, what kind of material the agents represents, terms, and, often, recent sales. Near the end, the editors provide a section on writers' conferences, where many authors meet their eventual agents. (Note that many agents do not wish to be listed in this book because of the volume of submissions it generates.)If you want to get your book published by a major publisher, you must have an agent. Publishers now rely on agents to screen manuscripts for them, to weed out the unprofessional and the boring, so that when you acquire an agent, you've conquered a large part of the battle. Beyond that, however, you'll need an agent who has extensive connections within publishing, who knows exactly which editors like your kind of material, and how to present your work in the best possible light. Finding that agent among the listings here won't be easy, but at least Writers Digest Books will give you a gentle push in the right direction.Highly recommended for those who already have a polished book manuscript or script. For those who aren't yet ready to find representation, save your money for next year's guide."},{"Title":"2005 Guide to Literary Agents (Guide to Literary Agents)","review":"All of Writer's Digest resource books are excellent. If you think about it, where else would this vital industry contact information be available? I'm getting irritated with \\"Quack's\\" comments on every Writer's Digest review page. He obviously never sent a query or manuscript to an agent (as he probably can't write one to begin with) because I've had a lot of luck sending queries, proposals, and manuscripts to agents and publishers who \\"say\\" they aren't accepting new authors, etc. I have one book deal in the works because I sent my proposal to a publisher who clearly stated, \\"No new authors.\\" So Quack needs to get a life, learn how to write, and stop being such a kill joy. He'll never be a successful writer...or a successful anything. He's just too pessimistic. If you're serious about writing, you need all of the contacts and resources you can get. This book will get you started on the right path."},{"Title":"2005 Guide to Literary Agents (Guide to Literary Agents)","review":"I am purchasing this because a friend of mind had last years edition in her library. If you do anything Duck Quack tells you to do, you will be thrown out of any publishing house in America. All of it is rude, crass and will not get you any closer to acheiving your goal. Read this book and many others, take it's advice, and stay within the realm of professional, responsible behavior--then the rest of us will not have to read complaints from editors and publishers about pushy, difficult writers who think they deserve special treatment and don't follow protocol."},{"Title":"2005 Guide to Literary Agents (Guide to Literary Agents)","review":"I haven't actually tried to submit anything using this book but I am going to begin sending out query letters using information from this book. Because I haven't actually used the information in the book I can't say what kind of results it will garner but that would probably depend more on my material and letters than the information in this book. There are a lot of advice articles and I can saw that my letters and approach is going to be much better than it would have been had I not bought this book. I think the book is worth the price that I paid for it for the articles alone much less the contact information for which the book is really intended."},{"Title":"2005 Guide to Literary Agents (Guide to Literary Agents)","review":"In fairness this is a guide to literary agents. No doubt. The catch is the premise that from this book one can pitch his or her's manuscript. Well the pitch can be made but it will not be read. You will get your response with a dear john \\"your project\\" card. (They cannot even find the time to write down the title of your book.) Why is this? Why do the agents allow their names' and adresses' in these books. It's vanity, all vanity. Now they have a new gimmick. It's advice. \\"I'm too busy, have too many clients anyhow, have you tried Writer's Market??? That's the kiss off. Er, please never send me anything again. A few will actually mention that the three chapters that they requested in their advertising blurb and you sent them were disposed of unread. So what to do? Call them up. Call'em. Find out if they want to read your stuff or not. Better yet get on a program of meeting agents and editors. This is all about money, not creativity. Maybe you can bribe a credible editor (not an agent) to read your work. (I know everybody tells you not to do this.) Sometimes you have to succomb to extream measures. You're a creator, be creative. But save your copying dough and your envelopes and the postage and the time and give these agents a call. If they don't have time to take your call they certainly dont have time to read your stuff. Be tough."},{"Title":"Emma (Blackstone Audio Classic Collection)(Library Edition)","review":"I have fairly recently read Pride & Prejudice and Sense & Sensibility and really enjoyed those two books and decided to give Emma a try. As with Austen's other major characters, Emma has many wonderful characteristics, but she also has some flaws that are the cause of most of her problems. It was fun to see how she got herself into trouble time and again due to some pride and a tendency to meddle in others lives.Austen has a very good ability to bring out peoples strengths and weaknesses without sounding preachy. This is one of the things I enjoy about great literature; I am able to learn from the characters and see how I may have some of their weaknesses and resolve to do better.The audio book was read by Nadia May. I thought she did a good job, but I do wish the characterizations were a bit more distinct. I had a hard time telling which character was speaking during portions of the dialog. I've been spoiled listening to other audio books where the characters voices are so distinct that it is very easy to tell them apart. This is the reason I gave 4 stars for this audio book instead of 5.I highly recommend the book, though I would search for another reader who did more distinct characterizations."},{"Title":"Nothing but the Truth Level 4 Audio Casette (Cambridge English Readers)","review":"I think this book is good and easy to read. It is suitable for learners of English. This story show the problems , which may be occur , if you do not say the truth. The story makes me follow it till the end. Importantly, it make me realise that we must tell nothing but the truth. This is a wonderful story and I think everyone will enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Nothing but the Truth Level 4 Audio Casette (Cambridge English Readers)","review":"Nothing but the truth is an interesting book. This story makes me stuck on it and did not want to put it down. The interesting point is the way that Hu solve her problem, and when she will tell the truth to everyone."},{"Title":"Creating Beautiful Boxes With Inlay Techniques","review":"Good tips and beautiful boxes. The directions are sufficient to be able to make the boxes in the book."},{"Title":"Creating Beautiful Boxes With Inlay Techniques","review":"As a person who is involved in Marquetry I had hoped to find some new information on inlaying but that was not to be. The boxes described will take a long time to make for most folks."},{"Title":"Creating Beautiful Boxes With Inlay Techniques","review":"Doug Stowe's beautifully photographed book clearly stands heads and shoulders other woodworking box books. Stowe's designs range from the simple to the complex, in a variety of styles, with an emphasis on contemporary and Arts-and-Crafts. I am usually suspicious of books with step-by-step instructions, as I am a relatively advanced woodworker. However, I found Stowe's construction hints helpful and decidedly not tedious. Stowe also breaks the book up with personal essays, which make it a big step up from an arm-chair picture book. The book is fun to read, as well as look at.Stowe appeared to also write the book to give confidence to the novice. The photography is excellent. One thing I found especially good is one can get a feel for tolerances required for given operations by looking at the photos. One can tell that the finished product is going to be a success, even if a splinter is off here and there, which gives confidence to the novice-- reason being that too often those lacking experience put off trying harder techniques because they have feel for how &quot;perfect&quot; work must be in order to achieve success.Another strength of the book is that the boxes made are all significantly different, embodying different techniques. This is a good step in the right direction from previous box books, which give umpteen variations on a single theme.If you're going to buy one book about making wood boxes, this is the one to pick."},{"Title":"Creating Beautiful Boxes With Inlay Techniques","review":"A woodworker with little experience with inlay technique often thinks these beautiful projects are beyond their capabilities. This book takes the mystery out of inlay design with its copious photos and descriptions of work in progress. As a modestly experienced woodworker, I found the projects somewhat challenging, while the end result was truely magnificent. The book is a course in appreciating wood for its natural beauty. The boxes are relatively plain, however the projects represent nature's most beautiful art form. A definite must for any wood library."},{"Title":"Creating Beautiful Boxes With Inlay Techniques","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, not only for the techniques and beautiful boxes, but also for the sidebars on the philosophy and observations on woodworking.It stirred my soul, and I want to go out and build some more boxes now.I'm glad the publisher convinced the author to write this book."},{"Title":"Creating Beautiful Boxes With Inlay Techniques","review":"The book has some really interesting ideas for boxes. It is definitely worth getting for that reason alone.This is not a good book for an inexperienced woodworker. Many of the router table techniques shown are incredibly dangerous---I can't believe the author has gotten away with doing things the way he does without losing a few fingers along the way. I shudder to think what might happen to a new woodworker who tries these techniques.The projects described are somewhat incomplete and quirky. One project, for example, has panel doors---the cutting list contains dimensions for the rails and stiles of the doors, but not the panels. Not a problem for me, since I normally use these things as a source of ideas/inspirations for projects of my own design. But for someone who is looking for a step-by step project guide, this will prove disappointing. As another example, one project mentions using \\"brainerd hinges\\"--not a knife hinge, a slot hinge, a quadrant hinge, etc, but a \\"brainerd hinge\\". But the author neither shows the hinges in any of the illustrations nor explains them in the text. I was quite puzzled as to just what exactly a \\"Brainerd Hinge\\" might be and asked several woodworking buddies. Nobody had any idea. Finally, out of desperation, I \\"googled\\" the term \\"brainerd hinge\\" and found out that there is a \\"Brainerd\\" company that makes hinges. Apparently the author meant a simple butt hinge made by the Brainerd company. The book is full of these quirks and one can either be frustrated at them or view them as part of the book's charm.One final comment---many of the boxes appealed to my design sense, but some others seemed rather clunky in their proportions. But that's easy enough to change on your own. I say this to stress that the strength of the book is in providing a number of interesting design/construction ideas that can be adapted in many different ways."},{"Title":"Creating Beautiful Boxes With Inlay Techniques","review":"I bought this book hoping to cull some ideas for an idea I have for a box with inlay. However, this book is just straight ahead projects. The book does cover other things, like hand made dove tail joints, and making wood inlay - but they weren't as in-depth as I was hoping. If you have a shop full of various power tools and chisels and saws, etc - this book is for you. If you're looking for ideas on box designs/construction, and have a limited set of tools - I wouldn't recommend this one."},{"Title":"Creating Beautiful Boxes With Inlay Techniques","review":"Doug Stowe definitely knows his boxes. He's built thousands over the years. Anytime an expert like this decides to share his secrets, one should take the opportunity to acquire the knowledge.The focus on \\"inlay\\" is a fuzzy one at best. Stowe talks in detail about how to make inlay strips or panels and for that information alone, this book is worth its price. A true artist should know how every little bit of his/her works are put together. Since inlay can be a beautiful enhancer to wood projects, designing and assembling your own inlay can only increase your artisanship.Once the basics of inlay work has been covered, the book goes into some excellent box designs that I look forward to trying. However, and here is where one star goes away, many of these boxes don't require inlay for them to be successful. As a woodworker I both like and dislike this. I like the freedom to use the designs without being bound to the concept of inlay. I dislike that the title of the book specifically ties it to using inlay when many of the projects don't need to utilize it.Picky? Maybe. Either way this is a good book and many useful designs and techniques can be drawn from it."},{"Title":"Creating Beautiful Boxes With Inlay Techniques","review":"good book to have if you're a novice at inlayed boxes. this is an intro, so it's not for the seasoned professional. Based on this book, i now understand how interesting inlays are made. The downside in my case is that now i need a 16\\" bandsaw to try to make inlays like those in the book. a little knowledge can not only be dangerous, but expensive as well."},{"Title":"Creating Beautiful Boxes With Inlay Techniques","review":"Doug Stowe makes some very eye catching woodworking projects. In this book he shows how it's done. Good descriptions and good recommendations on tools and supplies. Emphasis on using what you have, not going out and spending a bunch of money to start. If you have basic woodworking knowledge, this book will have you making detailed inlay boxes and other fine wood projects in no time."},{"Title":"Creating Beautiful Boxes With Inlay Techniques","review":"Creating Beautiful Boxes With Inlay TechniquesIf you love wood boxes and are a woodworking enthusiastist, this is a definite to add to your woodworking library. Why not 5 stars -- this is not the best book for woodworking beginners because of the \\"inlay\\" process (which makes the projects a little harder to do). It is a great book to help teach you how to improve your techniques with inlay."},{"Title":"Creating Beautiful Boxes With Inlay Techniques","review":"The Inlay book is an invaluable resource for beginning woodworkers. Very informative and well written. The author demonstrates methods for using pre-made inlays, as well as providing instructions for making your own inlays. I highly recommend the book. I have all of Doug Stowe's books on box making and enjoy them all."},{"Title":"The Gymnasium of Virtue: Education and Culture in Ancient Sparta (Studies in the History of Greece and Rome)","review":"This is an excellent book about the Spartan system of educating young men (The Agoge). It looks at the way the Agoge existed in the Roman period and then traces it back through the Hellenistic period to the Archaic period. It has great coverage of the various rituals such as the Endurance contest. Occasionally, it becomes weighted down with discussion of details such as the names given to Spartan age groups. This is however within the scope of the book. It was not written so much for a general reader, though it can be read by one, but rather for someone with some knowledge of Spartan history. Overall, it is well researched and documented. Kennell reaches interesting conclusions about the Agoge's ties to society and religion."},{"Title":"Portable DBA: SQL Server","review":"If there is one book that you are considering for SQL Server Administration, this is the one to buy. Covering all the major topics of administration, this book goes above and beyond other SQL Server books for several reasons. Not only does it live up to the promise of an easy to find guide for everyday tasks, it offers the ability to read up quickly on several advanced topics and gain knowledge rapidly. Taken into consideration, are the three latest versions; SQL Server 2000, 7.0 and 6.5, detailing out differences between versions where applicable. Everything is explained clearly. The authors have done an excellent job of providing a wealth of information in short and concise content. It is very refreshing to see a book that was obviously written to be as brief possible without skimping on important details...clearly no fluff here!!!! This has two benefits to the reader, 1; information is easy to find, no time is wasted reading through frivolous content, 2; the cost is lower than those 1,000 page volumes that contain less valuable information. Hopefully this is the start of a new trend in technical books.In just a few minutes after flipping through, and reading up on backups, I realized that I'm not backing up my production data properly, and can substantially decrease data loss risk by backing up my transaction logs regularly with the data. Also, some security concepts I had a bit of difficulty fully comprehending became clear to me as well.Reading through this book, it is obvious the authors have extensive experience with SQL Server, as this book has many insider tips that only experts would know through practice.

Covers differences from SQL 6.5 through SQL 2000. Sure, there is a lot that is not in here, but it is impressive how much is covered (from basics of physical design, to ACID transactions, to replication-related stored procedures). The smaller form factor makes it easy to carry around, which is an absolute bonus.

And there is an added treat for the legions of fans of Anya Setion's &quot;Katherine&quot;: her character is given a major place in this novel, vivid, warm and very real, from her marriage to John of Gaunt to her death.

It may seem a bit drier, but I think that has more to do with changes in the genre since the '70s. (when it was written)As for this book, I loved it. Rofheart's depiction of Henry V and his life and loves brought him to life for me, as Sharon Kay Penman did for Richard III, Edward IV, and others.It is told from 5 different points of view at different times in Henry's life: Himself at boyhood, His first love Morgan ap Owen of his teens, Up to his last days.Wonderful story, to be savored rather than gobbled :)"},{"Title":"Fortune made his sword: A novel (A Dell book)","review":"From the Times of LondonSunday Times[...]TLS Letters 02/01/08John Cowper PowysSir, - As someone who wrote a dissertation on the autobiography and Wessex novels of John Cowper Powys (University of Virginia, 1971) and published extensively on him in literary journals during the 1970s, I wanted to contribute the following addendum to Morine Krissd&oacute;ttir's excellent account of his misfortunes at the hands of publishers, attorneys, and agents during the 1930s (which was reviewed by Margaret Drabble, November 16).In 1972, I was preparing to write an essay on Powys's Owen Glendower (1940), a two-volume, massively researched novel of the Welsh prince's revolt against Henry IV, and I learned that a historical novel on the same subject had been published that year by G. P. Putnams. This was Martha Rofheart's Fortune Made His Sword (published in 1973 in the UK as Cry God for Harry). I quickly got my hands on a copy to see if Powys and Rofheart had used the same sources, but what I discovered was page after page of verbatim plagiarism. This was no accident: I counted more than a hundred such instances, extending over about 150 pages in the middle of the novel. I considered writing to Putnams directly but was advised instead to contact Laurence Pollinger, Powys's literary agent and executor, detailing the plagiarism, which I did.I still have Mr Pollinger's reply, acknowledging the plagiarism, advising me as to the futility of seeking legal action against a rich American publisher, and suggesting to me as a remedy that I send some money to Phyllis Playter in Blaenau Ffestiniog to help her buy a badly needed set of false teeth.I sent her a $50 cheque, which was, I suspect, the last royalty ever collected by the Powys estate on one of the greatest (and strangest) historical novels in the English language.DAVID A.

The author uses a straight forward approach which he appropriately mingles with humor. Drawings throughout the text add levity. The annotated table of contents is truly beneficial.Dr. Fauteck has thoughtfully created a practical guide for individuals who are attempting to adapt to life once they have been released from prison. He offers advice spanning the topics from family, friends, loved ones and those who offer an ex-convict assistance in staying out of trouble, to those who assist the ex-convict in maintaining criminal ways.Dr. Fauteck points out the traps of blaming others for difficulties and firmly advocates personal responsibility. The author guides the reader toward personal growth. If the reader is able to integrate the advice given in these chapters into his/her life, the reader will find himself/herself on the road to success.I higly recommend this book for those who are incarcerated, prison officials, counselors, mental health professionals, social workers and educators.
