Floey Packer, age 13, is living in a life of boringness. She is the wallpaper. The wallpaper behind her glorious sister, that is. She feels like no one notices her. So she decides she needs to make a major change: she is becoming the new and improved Floey Packer.Her change starts when her best friend, Azra, sends a picture of her posing in a tiny bra to her Aunt Sarah. But that's not all. Her sister suddenly gets married and Floey experiences a beyond embarrassing moment (after meeting her dream boy).Most unfortunately, Aunt Sarah's notorious cousins are staying for three weeks. (Yikes!) And suddenly, people are noticing Floey. She is no longer the wallpaper behind her fab sister. But then Floey finds out that her private diary has been posted on a web site called [...]Floey is furious at first, but later she is torn between taking down the web site or leaving it up for the world to see. She likes being noticed and she doesn't want to go back to being the wallpaper again. But then some drastic events cause her to make a decision. Does she want to continue being the star of the show or should she return to be her old self?I really enjoyed this book. I could really relate to it and I understood what Floey was going through. I reccomend this to any girl. Life is full of surprises."},{"Title":"I Am the Wallpaper","review":"I am the Wallpaper, was a fresh look at coming of age. Elements of this story will appeal to all readers and across genders. Modern touches, such as young boys using technology to spy on the developing girl will appeal to boys. The wit and charm of Floey's poetry and diary entries will delight all readers and young girls will especially relate to Floey's constant attempt to redefine and to define herself. Her mantra of Zen witticism and feeling of \\"I am Wallpaper\\" are great. Also this books treatment of early dating and family dynamics will appeal to young readers."},{"Title":"I Am the Wallpaper","review":"I am a young adult librarian- and I am stunned this book does not have any negative reviews. This book has a laundry list of inexcusable issues: the character of the mother is as one-dimensional as they come, the dialogue is laughable, the resolution of the story is so implausible and unbelievable. The protaganist fights back against lies, stalking, and peeping toms- by lying, stalking, and turning into a peeping tom. It's all just nauseating trash."},{"Title":"I Am the Wallpaper","review":"Floey Packer feels invisible next to her exciting older sister. She feels like even her friends don't pay much attention to her. She might as well be the wallpaper.She decides to turn over a new leaf and become the new and improved Floey. A daring Floey with funky colored hair and a dashing fashion sense. An alluring Floey who captivates would-be cowboy poets with her imaginative haiku.But what really happens is that even her best friends Wen and Azra are more confused than supportive of the new Floey. And the poet? He's got a girlfriend. And the boys who do admire and follow around the new Floey? A pack of ten year olds.Then things get really out of hand. Floey discovers why the pack of young boys has been following her around - her neighbor conspired with her visiting cousins to post her entire life online: her diary, embarrassing pictures, the whole nine yards. Everything.So, what's a girl to do? Floey does her best to exact some revenge and get her life back together. And just when everything seems like it couldn't get any worse, things start to improve. Floey, whether new and improved or not, is a darling character who will keep readers laughing.I recommend this book for girls 10 and up or for anyone who's ever felt like the world just doesn't understand them."},{"Title":"I Am the Wallpaper","review":"This is Mark Peter Hughes's first novel, and I can't recommend it enough. It has everything you could ask for -- it is funny, touching and never ever boring. The characters are very likable. I really hope he is going to write another one soon!"},{"Title":"I Am the Wallpaper","review":"When Floey Packer writes something in her diary, you know it's the truth. (In her diary, she writes about everything from her crush on her friend Wen to her plans for the future, supercool, noticeable Floey Packer.) That is, until her two gross cousins come over to her house to stay for a month! Within days, the contents of her diary are on the Internet for the world to read. Within hours, www.floeysprivatelife.com has gathered thousands of readers from all over the country. Floey must not only deal with the results of these disastrous web postings, but also decide whether or not the new and improved Floey is better than the old, wallpaper Floey. Along the way to enlightenment Zen-style, she finds humor in many situations, uses a jar of Deep Wild Violet hairdye, and even gets a bit of romance!I enjoyed reading I Am the Wallpaper because it was a fun and lighthearted book that nevertheless had a solid storyline that kept me wondering how on earth Floey would overcome her latest batch of problems. I would recommend this book to almost anyone looking for a sweet story, though it may be a bit mature for the younger readers. I could not change anything about this book to make it better!

Floey was a very believable teenager and I grew up outside Providence, so there were a lot of things in it that reminded me of growing up there (e.g. going into town to listen to bad poetry). It's really worth reading and I'd really recommend it."},{"Title":"I Am the Wallpaper","review":"Spread the word! I am the Wallpaper is a must-read! Floey Packer, 13, ranks as one of the funniest, most sympathetic screwed-up heroines in recent memory. I am the Wallpaper manages to be laugh-out-loud hysterical while at the same time suspenseful and moving. Even the secondary characters, especially Floey's surprisingly confident couusin Tish, are fresh and memorable. The story stayed with me a long time after I finished. Teenagers and adults alike will race through the pages following Floey through her transformative summer!"},{"Title":"I Am the Wallpaper","review":"This book is great!

The lessons are easy to follow, there are plenty of \\"practice\\" phonics for sounding out (A Beka always errors on the side of too much repetition. Of course, the teacher may choose not to have the students repeat everything if the class is picking it up well), and the lessons also have cursive versions so that the teacher has the option for instructing students in cursive recognition as well. At the end of each lesson, the student has the opportunity to read short sentences using only what they have been taught in the book thus far, allowing them to put into practical terms what they have been studying. I used this book, along with flashcards, to teach all three of my children to read well by age 4 1/2. Since the lessons are short, they were able to pay attention and learn every day without getting bored. By the end of the book, they were ready for reading short books on their own. For a fun supplement, I also used \\"Shortcuts to Reading You Can Teach Your Child\\", a large print cartoon-style book that can be used simultaneously with this reader."},{"Title":"A Handbook for Reading, Phonics Textbook (A Beka Book Reading Program)","review":"I have used this book to teach my 6 year old to read and it is excellent.

Many of the exercises consist of isolated words with few illustrations. There are also nonsense vowel-consonant combinations, whereupon the teacher must make guesses regarding what the authors meant. There are no complete sentences until page 20.Starting on page 53, the authors start inserting religious messages. If you are working in a public school, you had better choose something else."},{"Title":"Prodigals of Monte Carlo,","review":"\\"The Prodigals of Monte Carlo\\" is \\"Prince of Storytellers\\" E. Phillips Oppenheim's second-best of 180 or more novels.Set first in London, the book takes us to the offices of a great Harley Street specialist, where the hero of the story has just been given very bad news indeed. In short, within a few months, his life will be over.Wealthy, handsome, intelligent, single, with the world at his feet--suddenly he finds his world crumbling. What will he do, in response to the shock the doctor visit conveys?He throws a small dinner party, to which he invites several of his closest friends--one of religious sentiment, one who is a wizard of investments and another whose artistic tastes are beyond reproach. At the right point in the dinner party, he asks them what they would do if they were given only a short time to live.Their answers form the basis of what the hero decides to do. As a result, the reader is transported from the grey fogs of London to the sunshine of Monte Carlo, where, along with the hero and some new friends, the real adventures begin.If you are fascinated with the 1920s, the Europe that was between the Wars, the world of the well-heeled cafe society, the hint of danger and espionage, the unfolding of a story with plenty of adventure and many plot twists, then this is your story.P G Wodehouse dedicated one of his books to E Phillips Oppenheim and F Scott Fitzgerald was also numbered among his author-friends. So, guided by their estimates, give this book a read!If you find this review helpful, why not read some of my other reviews! Happy reading."},{"Title":"Worlds of Shadow: Teaching with Shadow Puppetry","review":"Although this book is a wealth of information, it is most useful to someone who has access to an overhead projector. If you are a \\"regular\\" person who would like to do shadow puppets in your home for their kids and grandkids, this may not be the book for you. The one good thing about the book is that there are some good patterns for shadow puppets. The book is advertised as a teaching aid, but I was unaware that the only projection system they recommend and explain in detail is the overhead projector."},{"Title":"Worlds of Shadow: Teaching with Shadow Puppetry","review":"Great initial or elementary primer for the study of silhouettes, shadow puppetry, and their use through theatrical performance or in animation."},{"Title":"How to See, Understand and Paint Skin Tones Hb","review":"I admit it: I bought this book for myself for a Christmas present, and it was well worth the price paid. Here is information I have never gotten in art school. Though it is probably entirely possible to learn to paint the face and figure by being presented with a model in a crowded and badly lit room, there has to be a better way, and I think this book is it. Through a clever system of charts using a palette of only 12 basic colors, author James Horton shows you how to create an infinite array of skin tones for people of pale, mid-tone and dark coloring. Specific modifications for pastellists are included, and though I'm just a beginner, I was amazed what I could do following his directions when I was only about a fourth of the way through the book. I recommend this very highly for all students, whether you're enrolled in an art course somewhere or just slugging it out on your own at home. I intend to finish every exercise in the book before I go back to art school at the end of January. Highly recommended!!!"},{"Title":"How to See, Understand and Paint Skin Tones Hb","review":"This book is always on my workbench. As stated by another reviwer, the \\"Suggested Tonal Charts\\" section has been invaluable, and has inspired me to experiment with colors not on the list. By step-by-step examples, and by showing works of various artists, you really get a sense of color technique. I also recommend this book to model figure painters; after studying this book, the skin tones on my figures have started to look more natural instead of having that \\"exaggerated theatrical make-up\\" look!"},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"This book was every bit as delightful as At Home in Mitford, and I look forward to reading the rest of the series. Jan Karon has created the perfect small town in which we would all like to live, and it is a joy to visit there, even if only for a little while. Esther Cunningham, the mayor of Mitford, says that Mitford always takes care of its own, and I think that is what we all love about the place. It's a place where the community love God and love their neighbors, with all their faults and eccentricities. It is also wonderful to read a about romance between mature adults Father Tim and Cynthia. I applauded Karon's way of communicating Christian values without hitting us over the head with them. I always leave Mitford a little more aware and a little more kindly disposed toward my own neighbors. If only we could create such a community in the real world."},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"It had been over a year since I read the first Mitford book, so I figured it was time to take another visit. I will admit I wasn't too excited about reading Mitford #2 because I knew there wouldn't be much action in the story. However, after about 50 pages or so in A Light in the Window, I realized what I was missing. I was finally home once again...This second installment is chock-full of happenings. We have recent widower, Edith Mallory, setting her eyes (and hands) on Father Tim; a mysterious Irish cousin who comes to stay in the rectory for questionable reasons; and we meet a new character, Buck Leeper, the hardened, unpleasant building supervisor hired to build Mitford's new nursing home. But the most important part of this book is Father Tim's growing feelings toward his neighbor, Cynthia, and his struggle to accept them, be happy, and let nature take its course. And naturally, Cynthia has a word or two to say about that!I enjoyed A Light in the Window much better than the first one. I found myself reading this novel until the wee hours of the morning because I couldn't get enough of the characters or heartwarming storylines. No action, no plot twists, no shocking endings -- but I simply didn't care. Jan Karon has a way of telling a story that makes all those other page-turning qualities seem unimportant. Mitford is a home away from home, a fictitious account of REAL life, and a place where I will look forward to visiting in the books to come."},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"I have zoomed through the first 4 Mitford books and am now midway through the 5th. The characters grab you and transport you to a town where I think, deep down, we would all like to call home. Father Tim is a &quot;real&quot; person with very human characteristics. Yet his basic goodness will restore your faith in humanity. The theology is not shoved down your throat, but rather is grasped between the lines. All the characters are memorable. Cynthia and Dooley in particular help shape the wonderful story line. The huge dog, Barnabus, who is disciplined only by hearing Bible verse, worms his way into your heart. I am so glad I discovered this series, and I recommend it to absolutely anyone!"},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"I am totally engrossed in this series. I have already purchased the next two available. My first thought in reading this series is what a peacful feeling it leaves with me. It's an easy read and a welcome change from the violence and depressing thoughts prevailing in so many of the books today."},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"This book is a lesson in everyday life. It teaches us to honnor the difference in people not shy away from them. It teaches acceptance with a smile. Relates to my life in so many ways. Wish I could turn everything, including my selfwill and a sick dog, over to God and have the patients to wait for an answer. Wonderfully sweet and I feel after reading all 5 books that I have another family that lives in Mitford and I would dearly love to go visit them. Wish I had a friend like Miss Sadie, all full of wisdom and starch. A blessing to read and hopefull retain."},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"I saw a program advertised that a librarian friend of mine was doing on the Mitford series. I couldn't go, but remembered the series when looking for a new book. The store only had the first in the series. I bought it and was hooked within an hour. I have read all her books about Father Tim and am so enchanted and yes, addicted! I passed mine on to my daughter who is now rationing her reading to make them last longer! I ordered a set for a gift, but am seriously thinking of not giving them away. Will pre-order her next book due out in April of 2001. These books are wonderful gifts for any age. Everyone I have talked to has loved them."},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"I must confess that I had seen the Mitford series of books in the stores and never even picked one up. So it wasn't until I received the first book in the series as a gift that I discovered what a treasure this series of books are! After reading the first one, I could hardly wait to read the second....third...etc, and I wasn't disappointed. If you're looking for the action and high drama of something like the Left Behind series or a John Grisham novel, this may not be to your taste. But it has a sweet, gentle and wonderful quality to it that makes you not only like the characters, but to love them as well. There *is* action and drama, but it has a gentleness and &quot;next-door neighborly-ness&quot; that makes it so easy to relate to. My only disappointment is that I have read all of the books in the series, and given them to others to enjoy so I can't go &quot;visit&quot; the characters in them again!"},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"I liked this one better than the first book, At Home in Mitford. The story lines in this book seemed more compelling, more interesting. Father Tim deals with the long absence (most of the book) of his neighbor, Cynthia, while she writes her new book in New York. He also deals with Edith Mallory, a recent widow with her sights set not only on the rector but on a well-known Mitford establishment too. Sadie Baxter tells more of her interesting life stories while she arranges for the long-closed ballroom in her house to be fixed up for the wedding of a relative she didn't know she had. And the man in charge of construction of the new Hope House seems to be quite a rough old sourpuss. The usual charming cast of characters is back and if you liked the first book, you'll like this one even better."},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"After loving \\"At Home in Mitford\\" I was sorely disappointed in this next installment. Instead of being charming and heartwarming, it was annoying and frustrating. Father Tim, so lovingly developed in the first book, becomes ineffective, brainless, and spineless. And the downfall is that the book concentrates so much on his reverted character, and so little on the wonderful townspeople and small miracles that happened in the prequel. Ms. Karon creates unbelievable, comic book characters (i.e. the widow after Father Tim) and then drags on and on about so few folks. How disappointing, I am not sure I will ever start the third book in the series."},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"Reading \\"A Light in the Window\\" is a bit like catching up on gossip from your hometown. The going is slow, and you get lots of tidbits about people you don't ever think about between visits. While the overall effect is still a warm glow and you're happy to hear the latest about the people you really care about, you still wish your maiden Aunt Isabel would get to the point a bit faster and not get mired in minutia.Also, Father Tim can be a lot like a dithering Hamlet in priestly garments, and he can be such a doormat! He undergoes some needless discomfortures because he either doesn't think it through or he doesn't know his own mind.\\"A Light in the Window,\\" like its predecessor, is a sentimentalized account of life in a North Carolina mountain town. People are kinder and race relations better than anywhere in the real South. However, if you can get past that -- and the overly leisurely pace -- you'll enjoy Karon's second installment in the much-adored Mitford series.It's a bit slow for me to say that the books are great, but all three of my sisters-in-law love them and can't wait for the next one. It's a good enough read, but I wish Jan Karon would pick up the pace a bit and not drag every episode out. Less can be more."},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"This was my first time to read a Jan Karon novel. I did enjoy it very much. I would recommend this arthur to other lady friends."},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"Interesting characters, light hearted story. Good bedtime reading.

Probably will continue reading the series, at least one more."},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"Several people had recommended this series of books and I am so glad that I finally took the plunge. I have found myself escaping back into a time when life was at slower pace, when people/relationships in your life were more important than \\"things\\"."},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"This is a wonderful book continuing in the Mitford Series about life in general and God's grace. Once again Father Tim ministers not only to his own church but also to anyone in town with a burden, only to find the town giving back to him when he most needs it. Cynthia becomes the love of his life through trial and error."},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"I rate this series as a 4 and not a 5 because it is not very deep - it is light reading. This series is composed of sweet, wholesome stories with likeable characters in realistic situations. It's very small-town - meaning it's not fast-paced or exciting, but it does make for a nice afternoon read."},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"I always enjoy Jan Karon's books, Can hardly wait for the next one.

A dear friend started me on them and they are wonderful. You will not be able to put them down.They are a series where you get inside the characters and just make you feel good.I was able to get all my copies on amazon with free shipping."},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"Besides his growing feelings for Cynthia, Father Tim's life is complicated by a lustful widow, his young ward Dooley, a killer blizzard, and various town problems.As in the first book, there is no real plot, more a series of short stories. But it's still enjoyable and held my attention all the way through. I particularly liked that both Cynthia and Father Tim openly sought the Lord's will for their relationship."},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"I grew up in North Carolina and felt quite at home with the characters. I did find myself wanting to get to the next page quickly to see how the situation would resolve itself. I could not put the books down until I was finished with the last page of OUT TO CANAAN. Father Tim changed for the better, even with all of the constant comings and goings of the parish, family, friends, etc. I think it would be wonderful to live in Mitford because of its charm and all of the good people. I especially liked the positive influence of the older people like Miss Sophie on the younger folks. Even if one reads it in a book, caring for your friends and neighbors is a trait that I hope has not gone out of style."},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"I am reading &quot;A Light in the Window&quot; right now. It is the second Mitford book I have read. I truly enjoy these books. They are written with great care. What I enjoy most is the representaion of communtiy. In our fast paced lives it is easy to not let anyone to close. Community is not all ways easy, but as far as I am concerned it is always admirable."},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"Have read the 3 books and loved them all.

Wonderful books."},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"This second book is just as good - - if not better -- than the first one in the series. It reminded me of a trip back home. It is so very nice to be able to read such a delightful book. I enjoyed it thoroughly. I am presently devouring the third one. I would be most happy if Ms. Karon continued the series for a very long time. I wish that I could move to Mitford"},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"I couldn't wait to revisit Mitford and I certainly was not disappointed with my stay. This is a terrific book and definitely just as good as Ms. Karon's first &quot;Mitford&quot; book. I feel like I have a whole new set of friends now in the Mitford books. I am reading the third book now and will be quite sad when I run out of Mitford books to read. I sure hope that Ms. Karon is working hard on her fifth one"},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"After reading the first book in the series, I couldn't wait to see how the budding relationship between Father Tim and his neighbor, Cynthia would progress. For awhile, the 61-year-old batchelor's bumbling had both my wife and myself wondering if he would ever get his act together. As usual, the supporting cast of characters in the book made the whole experience worthwhile. Everyone should start their day at the Grille and every town (or city) needs the kind-hearted neighbors and off-beat characters who roam the streets in Jan Karon's mind. Wouldn't this make a great TV series"},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"I've read all the reviews posted here and can see I'm in a tiny minority of folks who've read this, but I can't for the life of me see what this book is about. Nothing ever happens, just talk, talk, talk, and a lot of feel-goodism. The word \\"leisurely\\" has been used a lot, and that's putting it kindly. Books should be stimulating, not stultifying. Sorry to all the Mitford Fans, but I just can't like these books."},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"Purchased as a gift, I cannot share an opinion of this book, other than what the recipient told me. It seemed to be a satisfactory story and was what the reader expected of it. Based on that, it would be recommended. R.E.W."},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"READING THE MITFORD SERIES WAS A VERY UP-LIFTING AND PEACFUL EXPERIENCE FOR ME. I COULD NOT PUT THE BOOKS DOWN.

THE SITUATIONS CREATED IN THIS SERIES COULD HAVE BEEN LOCATED ANY WHERE IN AMERICA."},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"Jan Karon allows the reader refreshing new perspectives on life and compassion for one another.The Mitford Series, while providing entertainment, focuses on spirituality, gentleness, and humor in it's purest form. In real life, there are real Fr. Tims and community if we take the time to look. Thanks Jan Karon. I hope she's writing another great read!"},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"This is not my usual type of reading material, but to tell the truth, the cover caught my eye. I am finishing A Light in the Window and i can't wait to get the next one. I hope they go on forever!!!! This is the first time I have ever read something that made me truely sorry that it is fiction. If it were real, I'd move to Mitford in a heartbeat!"},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"This book,the second in the series, is mildly entertaining, as is the first. But it seems that the author considers a perfect town to consist of a variety of Protestant denominations, with nary a Catholic, a Jew, or anyone else. In this volume, she has one of the characters say \\"My grandpa said he never met a Catholic that knew pea turkey about th' Bible\\". Now, this book was written in 1995; I might have expected such an anti-Catholic remark in a book from 100 years earlier, but I was surprised and put off by this sentence in a book from 1995. I guess a cozy little town peopled only by Protestants might appeal to a certain demographic, but it seems a rather closed society to me."},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"In the interest of full disclosure, this is the only book in the series I have read. As some escapism fluff this book hits the spot, but as some model of Christianity its falls woefully short. As an example, the Miss Sadie character pays an exorbitant sum for a wedding reception for a secret relative while treating her black maid pretty shabbily. Why would Luella want to sleep on a couch at the foot of Miss Sadie's bed in the worn out mansion? All the characters from lower socio-economic groups seem hollow, but I guess that makes it easier to swallow the social injustice.I guess the lack of four-letter words and premarital sex makes this a \\"Christian\\" book. It certainly isn't the behavior of the characters."},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"If you have a Kindle - Best not start this series. The third book is not available for Kindle. Why only some books in a SERIES is made available is beyond me.

Make sure to compare prices. I was very disappointed!"},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"After reading the reviews, I was hoping for a really nice, light read. I found the two main characters in the story to be very self indulgent and whiny. From the titles I assume that they eventually get married. I have to assume that later in the series both Cynthia and Father Tim become less consumed with their own feelings. Maybe some heavy editing would have helped the story."},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"On the recommendation of a relative, I read this book. Wow. It feels like it was written by somebody's maiden aunt. In fact, the entire town seems populated by old ladies, males included. The boy in the story came across as written by someone who never has contact with anyone under 50. I like a cozy story as well as the next person--but I do prefer that the characters act like adults and don't spend their lives dithering around ineffectively. Stay far, far away from this series."},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"The story is great, but the book cover could really use some major improvement. When it arrived, the cover was already curled up before I took it from the box. Since I've been reading it, the cover remains curled and seems to get worse with time. I usually pass my paperbacks on to others for their reading enjoyment, but this one is a bit embarrassing to pass on due to the curled book cover. So, it will probably go into File 13 or collect dust somewhere."},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"The second installment of the Mitford books is refreshing yet thought provoking. It picks up where the first book ended, with Father Tim struggling with his relationships with Dooley and Cynthia, while trying to meet all the various needs of his congregation at the same time. I found Father Tim's anguish in trying to reach beyond his fears and deepen his romance with Cynthia realistic and probing. Their love letters to each other reflect great courage on both their parts. Dooley continues to exasperate and delight Father Tim as their trust in each other grows. Reading this book is like going on a vacation...you want to savor every minute but can't wait to see what happens next!"},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"I'm going to be so sad to have this series end. I hate to arrive at my destination because I know I will need to turn my car off. I bought my first CD at Costco only because I couln't find anything else I wanted to listen to. I was hooked after the 1st CD. This is Americana at it's best! Age is not a factor in this book. Sit back and enjoy!"},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"John McDonough is Father Tim. He has narrated all of the Mitford series books and is a treasure. As many know, quite often the scenes center on his fictional church or the choir. A veteran of the Glimmerglass Opera Company, he sings the hymns himself which is an extra treat for listeners. When one voice actor has read all of the titles in a series, that performer has created a strong connection to listeners. Thus, just as listening to another story of Mitford is enhanced by its familiarity so hearing John McDonough's narration stirs feelings of comfort and recognition.McDonough describes his first reading of a book as being \\" like the first listening of a piece of music.\\" \\"You have to be completely free,\\" he said. . \\"As you read and think about the piece, you hear voices, and it starts to take on life.\\"How fortunate for all of us!In this, the second installment of the popular series, Father Tim has just returned from a vacation - his first in over a dozen years. While he enjoyed the respite he is a bit anxious to come home and see his neighbor, Cynthia Coppersmith, a woman with whom he thought he had an understanding. He's perplexed by what he perceives as her coolness and a bit agitated when a widow in his congregation sets her sights on him.The church has undertaken the building of a care center and an unexpected visitor arrives, evidently for an extended stay.Life goes on in Mitford as listeners renew acquaintances with some of the townspeople and once again are charmed by the fictional community.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"I'm not going to gush, but I really like this book. If you are from a small southern town, an epsicopalian, or you just like good books you should read this book."},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"Plan to buy the whole series--you will not want to wait to get the next one! Jan Karon has mixed delightful characters of all kinds with conflicts, mystery, romance, danger, and spread over all plenty of humor. No matter what your favorite genre, you'll love this continuing story. I keep wondering what's happening next. There were plenty of young people to follow in a 6th book. Maybe next year..."},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"As with each of the two previous Mitford books, I was completely involved personally in the lives of the Kavanaughs and the other residents of that delightful little community!

Will Father Tim follow his heart?"},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"I'm a so called &quot;sophisticated reader&quot; and adored all of Jan Karon's characters.

The characters are real, and real issues like alcoholism, death, illness, fear are all dealt with in a where-the-rubber-meets-the-road manner. I am anxiously awaiting the next installment. I don't want to put a Cynthia Coppersmith type &quot;crushing deadline&quot; on Ms. Karon, but your lovingly enthusiastic readers await!"},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"I can't put in words how much I enjoyed this series! I fell in love with everything from the characters involved, whose roles were intelligently created, to the wonderfully profound statements made by Father Tim himself. I found the books very much a relief and I found myself crying and laughing outloud with the characters in their different situations. The words of Jan Karon through her characters are thought-provoking and made me question many things about my life. The spiritual aspect of the books are unusual to a best-seller but I found it very reliving to read about the way a single man was able to bring Jesus Christ to so many people's lives in such a big way. I would definitely recommend this series to anyone who wants a relief, a word of encouragement, and an uplifting experience."},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"This was truly enjoyable as the second in the series. This book continues the friendship that we develop with the all-too-real characters. I truly appreciate the ability to show that Christians can demonstrate their faith through the way they live.

It reminds me of the &#34;Little House on the Prairie&#34; series in that it's about small town life with a slow pace of living. It's very comfortable, even in the parts exciting parts. The characters and their relationships are very well developed. It's been a long time since I've read a series of books that I have so much trouble putting down to go to sleep. I'm glad I'm reading them after they've all been written so that I can go from one book right into the next."},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"Such a heart warming series I would love to live there.My Widows Group at church endouraged me to read the entire series"},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"I did not walk, but ran, to my local library the second I was finished with At Home in Mitford in order to get my hands on A Light in the Window. I was terribly homesick for Mitford in the few moments that it took me to grab the second in the Mitford series. Upon my return home, I took the phone off the hook, drew the drapes, and once again I entered Mitford, alternately smiling, chuckling, guffawing, and even shedding an occasional tear. How Jan Karon can cause the gamut of such emotions in this reader is beyond my understanding. How thankful I am that she has used her God-given talent to transport me to the wonderful, wacky world of Mitford!"},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"Sure, we love the Mitford novels for their portrayal of life at a slower pace. But this second novel may have dragged the story out a little too long. We all know that Father Tim and Cynthia are made for each other, but I grew tired of Tim trying to read her mind and Cynthia chastising him for failing to read her mind.I do enjoy reading the novels, but I listened to half of this one on CD. John McDonough takes a slow pace and slows it down even more - at least two discs could have been eliminated if he could have read just a little faster."},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"In this continuing book, (sequel), of At Home in Mitford, Father Tim's attractive neighbor Cyhthia Coppersmith is at his door, pursuing Father Tim with hot casseroles. Then, his cousin Meg has moved into the rectory for the long haul, disturbing his whole household! Dooley, the boy Father Tim has taken under his wing in the first story, is still living with Father Tim and causing problems in school. They can't seem to locate his mother, and his father is a terrible drunkard.This book is truly as enjoyable as the first one was, and well worth the reading time!"},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"Jan Karon's second tale of Mitford is not quite as good as her first. Her characters don't display as many of those little quirks in their personalities and as much of that homespun philosophy that made me fall in love with the town in her first book (\\"At Home in Mitford\\"). And frankly, this entry in the series shows definite signs of belonging on the same shelf as your basic Harlequin romance.But there was enough of the original charm from the first book to allow me to recommend this one. The spiritual and emotional center of the town is still the local Episcopalian minister, Father Tim Kavanagh (whose last name we finally learn at the end of this book!). His relationship with his next-door neighbor, Cynthia Coppersmith, is still going down the same road as in the first book - although there are a lot of bumps and potholes along the way - and his bond with the boy Dooley is only getting stronger.Aside from Father Tim's pursuit of Cynthia (and vice-versa), it would be impossible to describe all the little episodes that make up this book. But there are some that stand out. The town's latest widow, Edith Mallory, shows a definite mercenary streak - she's in shameless pursuit of Father Tim and also wants to close down the local diner and replace it with a dress shop that's willing to pay double the current rent. Miss Sadie, the town millionaire, is literally pouring her millions into repairing her home, just so she can give her newfound niece the wedding of her (and Miss Sadie's) dreams. And a redhead comes to Father Tim's door claiming to be his cousin Meg from Sligo, Ireland.I do wish Ms. Karon had gone more deeply into the \\"Cousin Meg\\" sequence, but I can live with what she gave me.Overall this is a worthy sequel to a fascinating tale of small-town life."},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"&quot;A Light in the Window&quot; is tied with &quot;These High Green Hills&quot; as my favorite in the series thus far (although I am looking forward to reading the next one about Tim and Cynthia's marriage). The loving letters back and forth between the two as Father Tim lets go of his lifelong bachelorhood are wonderful! I also enjoyed the sinister story twist involving the widow Edith as she attempts to seduce Tim (she pops up in the remaining books from time to time...like an evil spirit). Watching Dooley develop into a loving and trusting boy is terrific too. But special kudos to the plot twists involving Cousin Meg - which was hilarious."},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"For a long time, the marketplace was missing books like the Mitford Series that is warm and cozy. There are some of us who just like feel good kind of reads and these books are definitely that. Jan Karon is to be congratulated for starting this trend.I also recommend an equally lovely book -- though clean, solid fiction, it tends to be more a page turner than the Mitford. The Town That Came A-Courtin' by Ronda Rich is a must read for any and all Mitford readers. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"In this second book centering around Father Tim, his congregation, and his neighbors in the small town of Mitford, Jan Karon delivers more of the same uplifting stories, grounded in practical Christian beliefs.Father Tim is beginning to lose his heart to his next-door neighbor, Cynthia, whose down to earth intelligence, coupled with her sincere enthusiasm, make him feel as if he has come home. The path to love is rocky, though, and planted with obstacles, including the ferocious widow Edith, who is determined to sink her claws permanently into Tim, through such methods as good cooking and deliberate entrapment.Tim's struggles of the heart are interspersed with his continued adventures as pastor and citizen of Mitford, including the growing pains of his foster son Dooley, and the unexpected arrival and protracted stay of his reclusive Irish cousin.Throughout the book, Karon sends a hopeful, uplifting message without becoming syrupy. She incorporates a decidedly realistic portrayal of the confusion and uncertainty of new love with a subtle but unmistakable moral message that will do more for Christianity than a hundred sermons."},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"Boy, do single pastors relate to this. While single, remember very well the continued efforts people of the congregation would attempt to fix you up with someone they just knew was perfect.This is so humurous and entertaining, with wonderful cast of characters. Buck and Puny and Emma and Dooley and Miss Sadie and Luella.The contrast and play between Edith and Cynthia is a stitch. Father certainly has his work cut out for him.This is just another gem in a series of gems. Delightful, at times, oh so true to life, stories. Can we ever get enough of this, Mitford fans?"},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"We love the Mitford books. Though, as a pastor, I am amazed at how much one man does and how intimate he is with his congregation, this book serves as an inspiration and heart warming tale. It certainly provides a better light on the clergy."},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"This is book 2 of the Mitford series. It is full of loveable characters and reminded me of Maybery RFD but instead of Andy Taylor, the sherrif, we have Father Tim, an Episcopalion priest; both of them in small North Carolina towns. His message is down to earth, straightforward and very funny at times."},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"The charms and foibles of Father Tim and his community continue to roll on here. If only this were a real place. This is my idea of Utopia. A community where all are accepted, and loved, and everyone can chuckle at the ups and downs of life."},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"I am Episcopalian and I love Fr. Tim. This is a fun read and I never tire of this series."},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book as I have all the books on life in Mitford and would highly recommend them to all readers. The characters are so interesting and I am going to hate to see the series end."},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"You can't go wrong with a Jan Karon book. She is the only author that I have read and re-read her books. You get to know the characters and they grow and change with each book. I love Father Tim and his relationship with Cynthia. The town of Mitford is a small town with a lot of character. I would love to live in Mitford!"},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"I happened upon the Mitford Years series at our local library and promptly fell in love with the stories. Our library had every book in the series except \\"A Light in the Window\\". thus I was able to read the entire series in a matter of weeks, one after the other. The problem...I wanted more.The stories are beautifully written - I did think Father Tim, the Episcopal minister was more than a little dense when it came to romance but given the fact he was in his 60's and had never been in love nor been married, I suppose it was understandable to an extent. However, he nearly lost his chance to be with this incredible creative lady he belatedly proposed to.The way the people in the town are incorporated into the story is beautiful, you come to know and care for all of them.Beautiful book, beautiful series!"},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"Another one of Jan Karon's series of books that are so relaxing to read and enjoy. She has such a way of hooking us and wanting more. Makes me want to move to a small town...almost."},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"Title: A Light in the WindowAuthor: Jan KaronPaperback: 414 pagesPublisher: Penguin BooksISBN: 0-14-025454-4February 1996, $14.95Genre: Fiction/ChristianAfter a summer in Ireland, Father Tim is back in Mitford no more than a day before he is thrust onto the small town fast track to adventure once again. A wealthy widow attempts to seduce him with gourmet cooking; the new job superintendent for the Hope House construction project nearly runs him over in a pick up truck; his attractive neighbor takes off for New York City to write a new book, and his Irish Cousin Meg comes to stay at the rectory quite uninvited.With divine help, Father Tim must step out of his comfort zone to navigate the stormy waters of life in a small mountain village.-----------------------------------------------------------------When I read the first book in the Mitford series, At Home in Mitford, I was thoroughly captivated by the cast of small town characters who came to life on every page. This second installment of Father Tim's saga introduces a new set of dynamic characters who readers will quickly grow to love. One of my favorite new characters is Buck Leeper, the rough and tumble, foul-mouthed, hard-drinking Hope House job superintendent whose rough exterior conceals a tragic past. Another favorite is Cousin Meg, the eccentric author who wears owl-eyed glasses and a trench coat and has a metabolism to match her appetite.Unlike the first Mitford Book, A Light in the Window is primarily a love story of somewhat epic proportions. (I will note that there are three weddings in this book.) Following the romance of Father Tim and his neighbor, Cynthia Coppersmith, which was kindled in book one, an entire chapter is devoted to the correspondence that flies between the two while Cynthia is in New York.Overall, I think the narrative is not quite as well written as in the first book; however, this is more than made up for by the thorough development of old characters and introduction of new ones.Part of: The Mitford SeriesAt Home in Mitford (Book One)A Light in the Window (Book Two)These High, Green Hills (Book Three)Out to Canaan (Book Four)A New Song (Book Five)A Common Life (Book Six)In This Mountain (Book Seven)Shepherds Abiding (Book Eight)Light from Heaven (Book Nine)"},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"i did not really enjoy the first book of the series and hesitated to pick up the next one.While still a little unbelievable and sweet, i did enjoy it pretty well. This book centers around Father Tims growing relationship with his neighbor Cynthia. They go steady, write letters, and are really sweet together. Almost too sweet, so Karon throws in a few fights. or disagreements, fights seem to be too harsh a word. A couple times i found myself getting frustrated at the seemingly silly misunderstanding between the two(such as Edith Mallory's chasing him and sending him roses). But then, i was pleased at the ending.This one, while rather light on actual spiritual doings and heavy on everyday doing, was a nice quick reaad. I'm still not sure about some of the dialouge, and the fights could be just downright silly, hence the 4 stars. But its a pretty good read, a real improvement from the first!"},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"I really thought I was part of this community and wanted to meet all the friends and neighbors!~!

A Light in the Window is book two in this charming and captivating series. I had just finished reading a few very heavy books that were wonderful, but draining, and was looking for something light and fun to read. When I began reading the first book in the Mitford Years series I was completely hooked, and now finishing book six I have not been disappointed. I find myself reading and wishing to live in a little town like Mitford."},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"Terrific book -- easy to read & understand. Did not want to put it down. Am now collecting the rest of the 9 books in this series & can't wait to get started on #3."},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"I read this immediately after finishing the first book in the Mitford series, and, although it was not quite as enjoyable as the first novel, it was still a rare pleasure. It is almost (but not quite) too nice. The story takes up where the first book left off; Father Tim is back from Ireland and bedeviled (perhaps a poor choice of verb on my part) by the same doubts and problems as before. There's what to do about the crude boy, Dooley; how does the priest feel about his neighbor; etc. And there are new problems: the wealthy and obnoxious widow who is intent upon seducing him; a \\"cousin\\" from Ireland who invades his home and takes advantage of his good nature; the forced closing of his favorite reastaurant haunt; the profane presence of the foreman at the job site of the new nursing home, etc. All in all, it is the usual stuff of small town life.And there is a great deal of very announced and public praying for this and that and for various people. I found that slightly troubling. Jesus said that prayer was quite a private activity, to be done in \\"closet,\\" i.e., private. Those who pray in public have their reward. Saying you will pray for someone has a haughty tone, a free way of putting the addressee under a vague obligation. Moreover, one is supposed to pray to put oneself and others attuned to God's plan, not alter God's plan for temporal reasons. But perhaps I am all wrong on that. Someone will surely put me aright--or think they have.Again, I enjoyed my stay in Mitford very much. It's the Prairie Home Companion with grits. The plot is episodic, as one might guess from the previous comments. The characters are well drawn. The dialogue sounds right. And the atmosphere is comfortable. In fact, it is the atmosphere alone that makes it all worthwhile.I was a bit troubled by a few lapses in writing, especially with pronouns that did not refer to the closest antecedent noun. In fact, I had to stop several times to try to figure out what was what."},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"Jan Karon is an excellent writer and I have enjoyed all the books in her series. A Light in the Window followed along in the series expressing love, kindness, all of the good qualities of life interminged with real life."},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"Sometimes trilogies are trying. The first book has to have an ending but not so much of one that the reader won't want to follow the characters they have learned to know on to the next book. The author faces the same task with the second.A Light in the Window is Jan Karon's second in a series. It was originally a trilogy (at least in the set I purchased), but is now a series. Karon does serialization very well not only because her characters are likeable but also because she understands that, if a book can't have a nice, tight ending, then at least it had better have a satisfying premise.\\"Light,\\" the second book in the series about a small town in the Carolinas, is really about commitment and fear. Although the characters and place seem almost to be from another century, the theme is well-grounded in the problems that many of us face today. The story does seem to unfold gently in another time and another place, even though it is firmy let in the present. Still, it is not \\"only\\" a tender tale but contains a lesson or two for most lives today.Carolyn Howard-Johnson, author of \\"This is the Place\\""},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"I received the first in the Mitford series in August and before I was even halfway through the book, I went online to Amazon and ordered the whole series plus the cookbook. These are outstanding reading about everyday life and people. No sex, no violence, they are just super reading."},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"These series are simple, light, enjoyable entertainment! Coming from a small town, it is quite easy to relate. Karon writes in such detail. At times I find myself laughing aloud at the predicaments the characters find themselves in. Being a series, I was somewhat leary that the 2nd book would not be as good as the first. This is not the case in this the 2nd of the series. It is just as enjoyable as the first."},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"In this second book of the Mitford series, Jan Karon reintroduces us to our favorite cast of characters and throws in a few new ones. Father Tim is up to his eyeballs with his dog and Dooley, the boy we met in the first book. Add to the mix a rich widow who makes no bones about the fact that she herself has her eye on Father Tim. The whole mix makes for another wonderful adventure in Mitford."},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"The covers on these books are wonderful--they attract attention instantly, even if you know nothing about the books.This book was as wonderful as the last--the only thing a little annoying was Cynthia and her expectations of Father Tim. I kept thinking, &quot;What do you expect? He's a man! Get over it and marry him! &quot; One of the few book series that hold your interest in an &quot;older&quot; romance.I do hope Ms. Karon intends to devote the rest of her life frantically scribbling around the clock during her every waking moment and continuing this series, until all the characters get old and die (along with the rest of us). How could she do any less, now she's gotten us all hooked?"},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"If you cry during reruns of Little House on the Prairie, you'll love this and the other four titles in the \\"beloved Mitford series.\\" This is the kind of reading that diehard nonfiction readers scoff at: too soft, too sweet. But don't we all deserve to be touched by an angel once in a while? The Mitford series centers on Father Tim, an aging priest who ministers to the small by lively congregation of the Lord's Chapel. He is by turns fussy, funny, and faithful (the kind of faith that is simply there, not overdone, just a part of daily life). And Karon's gift as a writer is that she allows his story to unfold. We discover the characters and the subplots without the heavy hand of a writer who wants to ensure that we \\"get the message,\\" and we're delighted in the process. Even if your usual bedtime fare is A Brief History of Time, I encourage you to visit this little town for a while. You'll come away enriched."},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"All of Jan's Karon's novels epitomize escapism at it's best. Every time I finish one of her books, I am sorry and even a bit depressed at having to once again leave Mitford and it's charming, warm, and amusing residents. Start with At Home in Mitford, and enjoy this heartwarming series. You will wish that you lived in Mitford...and for a short while, you will feel as if you do."},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"Jan Karon knows how to make a body feel comfy. Even if all that ever happened in Mitford was an occasional bake sale and the change of seasons, that's enough if we can spend it with Father Tim and crew. This book, however, gives us the idea that just perhaps Father Tim might not be alone with his dog forever. I'm ready for Book Three!"},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"I read this as soon as I finished Book I, and was not disappointed. The story of Father Tim and his neighbor Cindy continued. Karon portrayed the pitfalls of falling in love can be just as difficult at 60 as during the teen years. After a rocky beginning, the couple begins to cement their relationship through a series of beautiful letters over a period of months when she goes away to New York.Other characters' stories also continued. Although Mitford is a 'feel-good' read, Karon doesn't shy away from difficult situations and near-tragedies. She's a gifted storyteller. As someone who grew up in the Episcopal Church, but who hasn't returned to it in decades, it was nice to revisit it through the eyes of Father Tim."},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"Awesome book series! My sister in law gotted me hooked on this and it is a great book. Would highly recommend it."},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"A Light in the Window is the second book of the Mitford series. Sometimes sequels are never as good as the original, but in this case, the second book was just as delightful as the first. The book begins with Father Tim returning from a summer vacation to visit relatives in Sligo, Ireland. While the first book, At Home in Mitford, was more of an introduction of the characters, this book has more action. On the very first page Father Tim is almost run over by a guy talking on the phone in a red pickup truck. Later his dog, Barnabus, gets stolen and has to be retrieved. The relationship between Father Tim and Cynthia begins to grow, even though she is in New York for most of the book and he is in Mitford, North Carolina. Their letters to each other show his fear of committment. He is sixty years old and never been married. Jealousy abounds as the hearts grow fonder with the distance. He wonders who the man is on the other end of the phone saying that Cynthia is getting dressed and will call tomorrow. And Cynthia gets jealous when she finally returns home and sees the &quot;beautiful&quot; Irish cousin who has come to stay with Father Tim indefinately. To find out what happens in the end, read A Light in the Window."},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"This is a perfect love story. I care about each and every character in this book. My 99 year old grandmother loved it as well. Beautifully written. Bravo."},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"Jan Karon has found a way to witness Jesus Christ in an entertaining, creative way. As a Christian, the book was rich and fulfilling with Biblical verse and reinforcement of beliefs. To the non-Christian, the story will be interesting with teaching of the Word of God, non-threatening, because it is an integral part of the lives of these humans who have the frailties, concerns, and screwups of the average human being. The story is gently told. If you want a lot of shot-em-up action, try another book."},{"Title":"A Light in the Window","review":"From the first page of At Home in Mitford to the last page of Out To Canaan, I could not put the books down. I've never felt compelled to write to an author before but I would love to write to Karon or visit with her in her kitchen over a cup of coffee. Her integration of faith and life is not preachy or sacchrine but sincere and warm. The characters live out the golden rule and have a wonderful sense of humor that more of our world could use.

The curator was Margrit Brehm. So, do not be mislead: this is not a Murakami-curated exhibition, unlike the current Japan Society show entitled \\"Little Boy.\\" (This book does contain works by Murakami and others of the Kaikai Kiki alongside other important contemporary figures).Also important to note is that as this is a catalogue of an important art event, it contains several essays on topics relevant to the Japanese Neo Pop movement. It is not necessary that one fully comprehend these essays in order to enjoy the artwork reproduced here.

Simultaneously, the book serves as a good visual record of the artists' work and provides them in high quality."},{"Title":"Japanese Experience: Inevitable, The (In the Floating World: Slash with a Knife, 1999)","review":"The artists featured in &quot;The Japanese Experience: Inevitable&quot; are artists that I have come to enjoy from seeing their art in magazines such as &quot;Giant Robot&quot; and other publications. As a purveyor of art in Europe and especially in Asia, the art presented in this book is quite amazing. The book features fine artists in Japan and the copy is featured in English and Jerman.As much as I enjoyed looking at the book, reading the book is a different story. As much as I enjoy cultural literacy and learning new words, upon reading this book, I felt that Gregor Janse may be a bit too cerebral in the words and the way he writes.The book, while informative, reads like one of those cerebral college books that you just don't want to read. I own so many art books and this book has to be one of the most cerebral and for me that's fine but for others...By the cover alone, this book is going to attract anime fans and fans of Japanese pop culture but is this book targeting them or the art afficionado?A book with so much potential and what could have been a fun book to read is more like a scholarly thesis."},{"Title":"Japanese Experience: Inevitable, The (In the Floating World: Slash with a Knife, 1999)","review":"HMMMMMMM? where is Tenmyouya Hisashi's masterful work that actually engages what is going on in Japanese culture.

There appeared to be several grammatical mistakes, mostly a missing word here and there; nothing major, and I wouldn't say the missing words (most of which were small words-it, of, etc) distracted much from the story, but there were enough to be mentioned. The characters were likable with good character development. Although the descriptions were well written and added to the flow of the story, there were a few sections with too much detail, perhaps useless information, which caused the story to drag a bit. Not that this is an actual issue but something to consider: a bit more creativity to describe the penis would have been nice-perhaps a different term once in a while. Also,a woman on top of a man is hardly naughty, and nowhere near being \\"nasty.\\" Considering I only paid$2 for this book,I do consider it fairly worth the cost and would consider recommending it."},{"Title":"To Protect An Heiress (Zebra Historical Romance)","review":"very good and engrossing book. read it over the course of an afternoon. great summer reading"},{"Title":"To Protect An Heiress (Zebra Historical Romance)","review":"while Ms Basso's writing style is good, the storyline-the heroine gets with her best friends husband 8 years after she's killed, and she was killed because she was mistaken for the heroine. Well, it was just kind of distasteful to me.Also, the idea of the heroine, a spinster, tracking down and seducing a rake to win a bet for her brothers-then lo and behold, her reputation is ruined by this-a bit far fetched and implausible too.Sadly, I'd say skip this book.2 stars."},{"Title":"The Power of Money Dynamics","review":"Written in 1982, this book was given to me as a Christmas gift back in 1984, so it came as somewhat of a surprise when I found it on our required reading list when I was studying personal finance with Primerica in 1995. The book is absolutely full of outstanding advice and is written so that the average reader can comprehend it. One of the areas that I was especially impressed with was the keen insight on life insurance. Yes, dull, boring life insurance. If you are still into any type of whole or universal life policy, you need to read this book. If you are planning your finances, I believe there are many books out there that are fine, but this is one of the few that really gives proper attention to a very important part of your financial picture. It is out of print right now, but if you can get your hands on a copy, the info is still quite relevant for today's readers."},{"Title":"Designing and Conducting Cost-Effectiveness Analyses in Medicine and Health Care (Jossey-Bass Health Care Series)","review":"This book was really well-written in that everything was laid out clearly and consistently. I could basically choose my level of involvement, since the author explicitly delineates what each chapter and each exercise is for. The book was especially helpful in helping me choose which statistical methods of analysis would best fit the data set and research question I was working on; no other books I looked up did this in a readable way. Also, what really impressed me is the fact that the book made all the exercises not only seem, but actually feel, easy (or at least logical), and it wasn't until the end that I realized that I had built a decent foundation in cost-effectiveness analysis. The lessons were cumulative, so that the process of doing the problem sets actually felt fulfilling."},{"Title":"Lipsmackin' Vegetarian Backpackin'","review":"I stumbled upon this book while perusing other vegetarian titles and must say the Connors' title immediately grabbed me. \\"Lipsmackin' Vegetarian Backpackin'\\" -- makes you want to read the book and recommend it to someone, just so you can mouth those toothsome words! Obviously, a healthful lifestyle and thoughtful approach to diet have served the authors' intellectual capacities well, everything about the book is smart. The recipes are mostly contributed, apparently by friends the Connors' have made on and around trails, and the recipe titles are sometimes almost as clever as the book's title; more importantly, the recipes look simple and delicious (at this writing I haven't tried them), and their presentation is smartly organized. Nutritional information is included. For its niche audience, be they vegan, lacto-ovo vegetarian, or ready-to-improve omnivore, this book has got to be as good as it gets."},{"Title":"Lipsmackin' Vegetarian Backpackin'","review":"It is way past time for more healthy alternatives to meat dishes for people in the backcountry or in the bush.

Look forward to trying some recipes."},{"Title":"Lipsmackin' Vegetarian Backpackin'","review":"I am a cookbook collector and avid cook. I was looking at this book to help me prepare delicious dehydrated emergency supplies, which could be re-hydrated into nice meals in case of disaster. I live in a place which could be months without power, if a big disaster strikes.Perhaps because of the perspiring that occurs on the trail, this book provides high salt recipes. Many recipes I saw for savory meals had close to 3,000 mg of salt in one serving. Because of the heavy reliance on processed ingredients, there is probably a hefty dose of MSG too. Too much salt for a lot of people. MSG is an excito-toxin which is used to induce obesity in lab animals, and reportedly does so by causing brain damage of a particular sort.I also did not care for the pouring of boiling water into plastic pouches to re-hydrate things. I guess on the trail it might be convenient but it just did not appeal to me. It does not sound healthy, as the plastic might leach chemicals when treated like that. One of the healthier recipes called for uncooked dried shiitake mushrooms to be rehydrated with a cup of boiling water poured into the ziploc. Besides not liking the idea of cooking in the plastic bag, and I usually cook my shiitake mushrooms better than that.Even the so-called highlight recipes were repulsive to me. Brownies and cookies fried in vegetable oil. When Laurie Ann March reviewed this book and liked the fried brownies and the green dragon thai noodles made with lime kool aid, it made me question whether I should buy her books, which I was going to do next. Sigh. (7/24/11: I am editing to update--I did buy the Laurie Ann Mark books, and I was sooo glad that I did! They are wonderful!!! I bought the new one, Another Fork in the Trail, and loved it so much that I bought the original one too! Not just for trail food--they are good for daily cooking too! Laurie Ann March's Fork in the Trail and Another Fork in the Trail books offer recipes for good food, and then tell you how you can prepare them for the trail, camping, etc.)For me, it was hard to come to terms with the fact that one of the least objectionable recipes in Lipsmackin' was for one of my all-time unfavorite cafeteria foods from childhood, carrots and raisins. I can see where an organic version might be a good substitute for a sweet, but the thought of that as a salad substitute left me cold. ;-) Further, there is a reliance on powdered milk in this book as well. Powdered milk is one of those things on the top 10 list of foods to avoid, along with hydrogenated trans fats.If the ideas in this book appealed to me, then perhaps I could re-formulate and re-work the recipes somehow, despite the reliance on commercial seasonings like oriental noodles with seasoning packets, gravy packets, etc, which would have to be re-seasoned from scratch. But, these recipes are not worth the trouble for me.However, I can see that this book could cater to a certain segment. Thank you to all the other reviewers! If I had read your reviews more carefully, then perhaps I would have known to avoid this book."},{"Title":"Lipsmackin' Vegetarian Backpackin'","review":"I had the opportunity of traveling with the authors last summer in the Canadian backcountry.

We relied completely on this book for meal planning and food preparation. We were not disappointed. The recipes are all written in clear language, and are easy to follow. Packable trail instructions are available on-line, which helps with cooking in remote campsites. Of course, we could not try every single recipe -- but here are some of the best ones we tried. We had Olympus Oatmeal for breakfast every day. The Brunswick Stew was excellent, although it took a long time and lots of fuel to rehydrate the dried beans. The Vegan Super Hero Burritos were our favorite. The Whole-Food Granola Bars and Horse Thief GORP (we used unsweetened chocolate chips instead of carob chips) saw us through some long days of paddling and hiking. Our favorite snacks were the Energy Balls. We fought over the last one of those! I would warn others that many of the recipes call for prepackaged foods, such as Zatarain's Red Beans and Rice. People with specific health concerns should check the contents of these items before they use them. Fortunately, Zatarain's makes a low-sodium version of Red Beans and Rice, which we used. Otherwise, this is an excellent book. You can truly trust the recipes. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Lipsmackin' Vegetarian Backpackin'","review":"I really enjoyed the first book by Tim and Christine Conners and now the couple has come out with a second book in the Lipsmackin' Backpackin' series that is completely vegetarian. Recipes include Fabulous Fry Brownies, Miso Madness, Algonquin Apple Leather and a series of bread recipes that would make any backpacking trip more enjoyable. There are great dishes for each meal time and some wonderful GORP ideas. The book has a range of drinks, fruit leathers and decadent desserts. I was pleasantly surprised when I found a recipe for Coleslaw which is dehydrated at home and rehydrated on the trail.The recipes are tested numerous times to ensure that they turn out well on your adventures. The gang here did a little of the testing to help out. We even found that the Green Dragon Pad Thai tastes great once you get past its vibrant color. Trailside instructions are printed with each recipe and again in the back of the book. The packable trailside cooking instructions are perfect for placing in the zipper bag with the food contents. The cut-outs appear in the same order as the recipes for easy finding.Although Lipsmackin' Vegetarian Backpackin' is a meatless collection of good eats, it is a book easily enjoyed by all."},{"Title":"Lipsmackin' Vegetarian Backpackin'","review":"This book is a God send for a Vegitarian Backpacker and especially one into lightweight Backpacking!The food really taste good and is so simple to make."},{"Title":"Lipsmackin' Vegetarian Backpackin'","review":"We really enjoyed several of the recipes on a recent three nite pack trip to Porcupine Mountains, MI. Burritos, Cous Cous and Brownies made from dry ingredients available at grocery store made for really great almost gourmet and inexpensive trail dinners. Many recipes require a dehydrator which we lack, but it seems like any serious backpacker should consider buying one to save big bucks on food. This book is not just for vegetarian or Vegans. Three of four in our group are defintely meat eaters but dinners especially were loved by all of us. I actually ended up making some recipes at out of leftovers from trip and they tasted good even in the comfort of my own kitchen at home."},{"Title":"Lipsmackin' Vegetarian Backpackin'","review":"I was invited to go backpacking with some friends for 4 days. I went to my local big town (Redding, CA) and was shocked to not find Mary Janes Farm food anywhere. The other vegetarian food sounded really terrible. After being a vegetarian for 10 years, I have vowed to never eat Pasta Primavera again!So I got out the book and found many yummy recipes. The food took me a long, long time to prepare, but most recipes seem to take me a long to prepare the first time I cook them. So I'll blame myself for that one.When I got to the campsite, my meals were the hit of the group. They were intrigued with my burritos and other yummy foods.This is a great book. I would suggest that you set aside a day the first time you prepare the food, and enjoy the process. I was a bit rushed, but I am already planning my meals for next months trips.BTW, you'll need a dehydrator. I got mine dirt cheap at Wal-mart.

The only issue that I had were that some recipes are set up that you \\"pre-make\\" something at home and then finish it on the trail (sometimes it's just add hot water). This is only an issue if you are trying to hike light and don't want to carry around a cookbook. I often had to photocopy the page and put it in with my ingredients. Overall though it's a well rounded cookbook and covers breakfast too! I would suggest this if you are planning an outdoor trip and want to save money on those pre-made instant add water meals that can cost a fortune!"},{"Title":"Lipsmackin' Vegetarian Backpackin'","review":"Christine and Tim Conners did a great job putting this book together. Not just a collection of appealing trail food recipes, it gives tips on where to buy ingredients as well as other items of interest to the backwoods hiker/camper. I was privileged to be asked to contribute some of my own trail food ideas to this book. In my discussions with Christine, she told me that a lot of long distance hikers didn't like to use a dehydrator - something I can't identify with since my dehydrator has been invaluable in preparing for backwoods treks. Christine included a humorously written article about the benefits of the dehydrator. Many of the recipes include short notes from the contributors on the recipe and its use on the trail. If I had to pick one negative of the book, it would be that the title includes the word &quot;vegetarian&quot;. I would think this may turn off the meat eaters. The book will appeal to all paddlers and trail hikers who want good tasting, unique, yet easy-to-prepare food. I own several trail food cookbooks, including the Conners other book, Lipsmackin' Backpackin'. I tend to reach for Lipsmackin' first when I am preparing for a trip and now I'm sure their new book will get just as much use from me."},{"Title":"Lipsmackin' Vegetarian Backpackin'","review":"My husband was so impressed with the recipes in this book.

The stories contained within these letters are deceptive in their simplicity. At first glance, the letters feel like a hybrid blend of Lake Wobegon and Seinfeld. A more careful reading places them closer to a spiritual Winesburg, Ohio. This spirituality, tacit and gently woven throughout the stories, leaves the reader with a sense that a deep and powerful stream is running just below street level. Where Anderson's Winesburg inhabitants -whom he termed \\"grotesques\\"-- live lives of futility and despair, Pearson's residents of Maybe present themes of beauty, hope and redemption.The people and geography of Maybe develop with each letter. Elizabeth, the letter writer, parallels the voice of Anderson's George Willard, the town reporter. She begins each letter critiquing Rev. Answer's sermons, and never gets too much out of the last half. She tells of happenings at the Busy-Bee Cafe, the Refrigerator Magnet Museum, Thelma's Cut 'n' Curl, and even the local nudist colony, Hyde Park.Letters from Maybe should be read much as a box of fine chocolates should be eaten: one delightful morsel at a time, savoring the unique flavor of each nugget, reflecting on the pleasure of each bite before moving on for another simple yet complex taste."},{"Title":"Shell-Shock: A History of the Changing Attitudes to War Neurosis","review":"In SHELL-SHOCK, Anthony Babington argues that the First World War marked a turning point in understanding and treating the psychiatric casualties of war. Prior to the twentieth century, psychiatric breakdown in battle was observed and noted under categories such as &quot;nostalia&quot; (general melancholy), &quot;irritable heart&quot; (stress reaction to physical and/or mental strain), and &quot;windage&quot; (symptoms of shock due to near misses from shell-fire), but the general &quot;official&quot; attitude of armies was that of skepticism to mental breakdown, viewing this as probable cowardice.With the First World War, attitudes changed. From late 1914 onwards, Army doctors became increasingly sophisticated: they understood shell-shock as an independent type of casualty, one which was psychological in origin (that it was not strictly due to the commotional effects of shells exploding, but rather was a heterogeneous collection of different nervous disorder ranging from concussion to sheer funk). They developed methods of treatment to relieve hysterical conversion symptoms, and return men to the front. They understood that the main cause of shell-shock was mental stress due to persistent fear, and recommended pensions for men adversely affected. Unfortunately, official military policy was less sympathetic. In a war where the official British strategy was to wear down the Germans through attrition, General Haig and others tended to view mental breakdown as a failure in character, and continued to execute shell-shocked men for desertion and cowardice, even up to the end of the war. The statement of a medical officer called as a witness at an inquest is revealing: &quot;I went to the trial determined to give him no help of any sort, for I detest his type . . . . I really hoped he would be shot, as indeed was anticipated by all of us.&quot; Medical officers who sent &quot;too many&quot; shell-shocked men to the rear were reprimanded, or even relieved of duty.World War I was a watershed: in the wake of that war, Parliament outlawed execution for cowardice and desertion, and by World War II, psychiatric methods were accepted as standard by Western armies, in both screening recruits, and treating &quot;shell-shocked&quot; men at the front. Military leaders understood that solders could only endure from 140 to 180 days of combat before they broke down and became ineffective, and official manpower policies were adjusted to this reality.Babington's book is lucid and well-written. It is mainly a survey of leading reports and medical figures, and does not purport to be a work of original research; it focuses primarily on the First World War, and its coverage of post-World War I wars is thin, presented to make the point that World War I had worked a revolution in official attitudes towards dealing with the mental casualties of war."},{"Title":"Shell-Shock: A History of the Changing Attitudes to War Neurosis","review":"I found this book to be quite informative and useful in my quest to gather information for a research paper on Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Although PTSD is a relatively new term, only about 15 years old, this book gives a good overview of symptoms suffered by WWI soldiers of what was called at that time War Neurosis. Various treatments, Dr.'s opinions, and the general attitude of military administrators were also discussed, as well as some personal stories."},{"Title":"A Big Cheese for the White House: The True Tale of a Tremendous Cheddar","review":"I have read this book to my two grandsons (Brooks nearly 4 and Pierce nearly 3 yrs old) and their interest and response to this book has been fun and surprising. The story interests them and the art illustrates the story very well. They enjoy finding the characters from the story in the associated pictures. Phineas Dobbs' grumbling has become an inside family joke. The boys go around the house often repeating his comment, &quot;I told you, it can't be done!&quot; while placing their arms across their chest.The book has provoked them to ask many questions which has proved to be a good teaching opportunity as well.They read everytime before naptime and bedtime and they have insisted that this book be included each time for about three weeks now.

Not to be outdone, Elder John Leland convinced the residents of Cheshire to put their curds together, along with one day's milking from each of their cows and create a \\"whopping big cheddar.\\"Easier said than done the villagers soon realized. They had to resort of using a huge apple press to squeeze the whey from the curds. Then, the local blacksmith had to make a huge, custom-forged hoop to hold the cheese. Their efforts paid off however. Once finished, they had on their hands a 1,235 pound, four-foot tall round of cheddar.After letting the cheese ripen, Elder John and the ever-doubting Phineas Dobbs set off to deliver the mammoth cheese to Jefferson. Sledding and sailing their way to Washington, the duo finally arrive at the nation's capital amid trumpets, banners, and gaggles of gawkers.Jefferson, after cutting into cheddar and tasting it, declared it to be \\"The best you can serve at your table.\\"Fleming serves up a terrific treat. The tale is charmingly told and fun to read.

Finally they haul the cheese in a wagon to ripen in Elder John's barn. To get the cheese to President Jefferson's New Year's Day party, they have to put it on a sleigh and take it to Hudson, New York. Finally it sails down the Hudson River and is then carted on a sleigh to Washington.Apparently, the cheese was served for years and someone said it lasted until 1805.Just by the way, cheddar curds can't be beat.

It is part of U.S history and highly recommend, for your children. In those days ministers were called circuit ministers which means they traveled from town to town preaching the gospel,that is who Elder John Leland was to the people of Cheshire.

And that's just one of the many wonderful stories in this big volume. To think that it's out of print is almost criminal. John F. Kennedy was a fan of Irwin Shaw and you should be, too! Irwin Shaw wrote &quot;Rich Man, Poor Man,&quot; which became one of the first TV mini-series back around 1976 or 1977. It was the series that gave Nick Nolte his first break. Along with John O'Hara and John Cheever, Irwin Shaw is one of America's greatest story tellers. The stories in this volume deserve to be put back into circulation!"},{"Title":"Short Stories: Five Decades (Phoenix Fiction)","review":"A poor man's Cheever, Irwin Shaw was a man of his times, and his writing reflects the issues faced by the \\"common man\\" from the 1930s through the 1970s. He reminds us that not everybody in America was rich and ennui-infected. \\"The Eighty-Yard Run\\" is his classic study of the effects of the Depression on one man's marriage and his sense of self. \\"Sailor Off the Bremen\\" depicts a brutal act of vengence committed under the guise of political activism, \\"The Passion of Lance Corporal Hawkins\\" shows us an equally violent incident in the birth of Israel, \\"Main Currents of American Thought\\" looks at a hack writer in the age of radio, and \\"Act of Faith\\" is an optimistic if cautious affirmation of American values. \\"The Girls in Their Summer Dresses,\\" with its breezy prediction of a new husband's sad and faithless future, was said to have been John F.

Shaw's words have a masculine beauty to them, while his plots are precise and honed."},{"Title":"Short Stories: Five Decades (Phoenix Fiction)","review":"I whole-heartedly agree with the first reviewer of this book - Irwin Shaw was one of the best (if not THE best) American storyteller(s) of the 20th century. Beautiful prose, great characters, lots of emotion - his books just seem to sparkle with life.This wonderful collection of short stories - written between the 1930's and the 1980's - will leave you with even deeper admiration of his writing skills if all you've ever read of Mr. Shaw is &quot;Rich Man, Poor Man&quot; (which is an equally great novel)."},{"Title":"Short Stories: Five Decades (Phoenix Fiction)","review":"Irwin Shaw's best work is found in this collection of short stories.

Scott and others always seem to collect the awards and accolades whenever someone talks about a good American writer for the ages. Weirdly I've never finished a Hemingway novel and the only F. Scott story that I made it through was his short story \\"Dayrimple Goes Wrong\\".Anyway, for my money the great American writer of the 20th century is Irwin Shaw. Shaw's writing speaks to me on a simple level; he doesn't spend pages and pages trying to convince the reader how cute or clever or complicated he can be. The guy just writes.I read Rich Man Poor Man in high school and later did a race in France. It was quite a personal thrill to stand on the beaches at St. Tropez after reading so much about it in Shaw's text.This book contains many of his short stories over a fifty year career. Some were dogs, some were decent and some were great. The great made up for anything substandard.When it's pouring down rain and I'm inside and dry I still say \\"Rich man's weather\\" to anyone or everyone. Nobody knows what the hell it means and I can't even remember which book of Shaw's that line is from, but I still feel it, say it."},{"Title":"Short Stories: Five Decades (Phoenix Fiction)","review":"I have a great deal of respect for Irwin Shaw. If you've read 'Rich Man, Poor Man,' you know that he is a consummate craftsman and storyteller. His literary world is largely limited to New York City, Hollywood, and metropolitan Europe. His stock in trade is melodrama. His characters are types. His forte is popular fiction with relatively little intellectual content. But he writes very bankable fiction of the New York magazine variety (clean, crisp, world-weary, mildly nihilistic), and he was surprisingly consistent over five decades. A number of his stories appear in college anthologies. If you are a young writer interested in writing for the slicks, you would do well to study Shaw's short stories. On the other hand, if you are interested in literary quality, buy his novels 'Rich Man, Poor Man' and 'The Young Lions.'"},{"Title":"Short Stories: Five Decades (Phoenix Fiction)","review":"In reading Irwin Shaw's Five Decades, a huge book of sixty-three of his best tales, in 756 pages of small type, written between the Great Depression years and his death, the only thing that an impartial reader can come away with is Shaw's consistent excellence in the field. Although having gotten his start, and made his name in the pages of The New Yorker magazine, I can tell you his tales hold up better socially and artistically than far more lauded New Yorker writers like O'Hara, J.D. Salinger, John Cheever, Alice Adams, John Updike, or Ann Beattie. The earliest tales, especially, with only the omission of a few definitive words that reference their era, could have been written yesterday, and are almost as minimalist as they are realist. And there is little fat in Shaw's tales- they are lean with the rat-a-tat-tat staccato of their sentence's construction, and their poetry comes not from a strained contrivance of clich&eacute;s, but the juxtaposition (often jarring) of the most common of things, phrases, and moments. Even though most of the stories, especially the early ones, are set in a New York City milieu, and reflect the accents and slang thereof, Shaw powerfully captures the realistic dialogue of the masses like few other writers ever have- perhaps, of published short story writers I've read, only Russia's Anton Chekhov comes close, and even he tended to lean a bit more on allegory rather than the offhanded poesy that comes in real spoken dialogue, and can best be pared down by the good ear of a good writer. Not even Eugene O'Neill, at his best, could capture the American idiom as well, and perhaps only Clifford Odets did- and it's worth noting Shaw started out as a playwright....The stories are so well-wrought with the trimness of necessity, and possess a grit and realism that Ernest Hemingway could never equal, even in the best of his hit and miss tales- and are just as poetic, if not more, and certainly more consistently poetic, with the poetry of concision in the construction, not the mere phrasing. Again, look how inherently straightforward sentences like, \`He couldn't remember having had a nicer day,', \`Michael watched her walk, thinking, what a pretty girl, what nice legs,', and \`You must be very careful in a strange city,' seem, yet how poetic they become by their mere placement. Shaw does this over and over again in these tales, which is a feat that writers like John O'Hara, or J.D. Salinger, his contemporaries, at their best, could never do with any consistency. Yes, some of his later tales are too long, but never ungodly in length, and they never become as airy as the lesser tales of many far more lauded writers in the Pantheon do. I urge any reader who wants to be entertained or enlightened, and also learn a good deal of what America in the last century was like, to seek out the short stories of Irwin Shaw. There's no better place to start than with these Five Decades to get the whole century."},{"Title":"Short Stories: Five Decades (Phoenix Fiction)","review":"Irwin Shaw was one of the best writers of short stories in the history of American literature. ( He was, incidentally, my father's classmate and acquaintance). His work has unfortunately not received enough attention in the 20+ years since his death. His clarity and the unobtrusiveness of his way of storytelling are examples of the best sort of writing.The University of Chicago press should be thanked for making this collection of his stories so easily available. Some, especially earlier productions like Girls in Their Summer Dresses and The Monument, will ( or should ) be read as long as American literature remains a serious subject."},{"Title":"Short Stories: Five Decades (Phoenix Fiction)","review":"Shaw wrote with little pretense and in his life and his writing he rejected mindless conformity. Both traits hurt his prospects with the jingoistic American literati of the 1950s and 1960s. Post-WWII Europe embraced artists as it had after WWI, and that is where he moved early in the McCarthy era. Shaw had a good war record, he could tell a story, and he didn't make news with his liberal views; a combination that enabled him to generate a loyal following among the era's book buyers and other readers and achieve financial success few writers enjoy.Chekov and O. Henry are writers I compare to Shaw - lean existentialism on Main Street in the shadows of the Quality. As a young man Shaw's new books were worth my giving up something else for, and between times his short stories were references for living. Somehow Shaw's writing made me feel smarter than I probably was or am.This collection is more than a pleasant second bite just slightly diminished by fine print and aging eyes."},{"Title":"Short Stories: Five Decades (Phoenix Fiction)","review":"but as long as there are book dealers willing to part with good literature i'm glad i had the chance to buy this"},{"Title":"Short Stories: Five Decades (Phoenix Fiction)","review":"Shaw was the Rodney Dangerfield of great American writers.

James Willard Schultz came west for adventure and joined an Indian trading post 45 miles north of Fort Benton, Montana.He not only traded furs, gold, liquor, and dressmakers goods to the Indians, but became fluent in the language of the Blackfeet, sharing in their hunts and wars and even taking a young Indian wife.It's a somewhat self-conscious story from a masculine vantagepoint during a time when warrior bravado was in vogue and the buffalo were still thriving. This book portrays a segment of Native American life and culture just before the buffalo were diminished and the people were forced to reservations.Given that _Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: an Indian History of the American West_ by Dee Brown contains only 2 or 3 pages in reference to the Blackfeet, a book such as _My Life As an Indian_ is a superb addition to one's bookshelf.

It starts with the buffalo in plenty and ends with reservation life. This is a bittersweet book. Schultz marries into a band of the Piegan branch of the Blackfoot confederacy. But although he lives among them, and loves them and their lifestyle, he never completes his assimilation. This is evident when he writes with almost distant amusement of some of their religious beliefs. Adding to this is the problem that while he loves the life of the buffalo days and deeply laments their end, his occupation as a trader in buffalo robes is hastening the end of the very thing he loves. His description of the post-buffalo, early reservation life is the most distressing, complete with corrupt reservation Agents, and sometimes rascist newcomers.His stories are not all downers though. His writing is a very detailed, intimate, and at times amusing description of his life and those around him. I've loaned my book to a number of people and they all have liked it. If you read this and like it too, you'll be glad to know he wrote a whole series of books of his life in early Montana, and of the lives of prominent people he knew.

Any Christian (lay or clergy) will be blown away by this book, as their faith in Christ and the Apostles will be strengthened.CONTENT:This is not a fast read (many chapters and much detail) but J.N.D. Kelly starts our slow enough where anyone can see that he is approaching this topic with an open mind (did the early Christians of the first century have a CREED)? In the end we learn that history does not give us enough evidence for an answer, BUT we can see even from the New Testament extant manuscripts and texts that there are remenants and hints about CREEDAL statements.CONCLUSION:This invaluable resource is also used for seminary students and graduate work in theology (such as Historical Theology courses). In this book one learns the evolution of creedal thoughts and ideas, as well as the development of the various formulae themselves, and both Eastern Church and Western Church statements and creeds are well represented (especially the oecumenical one - Nicaea-Constantinople).I concur with the previous two reviewers that this is a book that I cannot recommend enough, and one that should be on the shelf of any pastor, historian, or theologian."},{"Title":"Early Christian creeds","review":"This volume is essential reading for anyone interested in the formulation of doctrine in the early church.

In this book he chronicles some of their experiences working with tigers, big cats, and other animals over the years the park was in development. Further, he talks at length about instinct, intellect, and emotions in animals and shares many of his observations on these topics. The book has numerous anecdotes that were fun to read.Unlike many biologists he is not afraid to give recognition to the higher intelligence and emotional lives of the animals, even their spiritual lives, since animals cleary possess these attributes whether bioligists are willing to admit it or not. My only complaint is that I think he goes too far in trying to fit animal behavior into models of human behavior, even devoting a couple of chapters to this later in the book. Lions and tigers don't live by all the same rules as humans and one can only go so far in trying to fit them into a common model.The photography in the book is excellent, and if you love animals, this will make a great addition to your bookshelf. I also recommend visiting Out of Africa park if you're ever in the Phoenix area."},{"Title":"Return To Eden","review":"\\"Return to Eden\\" is a wonderful warm little book that I really enjoyed. One of the reasons is that this book describes the Harrison's love of animals especially great cats. It also describes what started as a hobby to a full fledged business and the ups and downs of such an endeavor. Their description of the cats are almost human-like to include how they talk to the animals and reason with them. Some of these explanations are a little over the top for me but I more or less attribute that to their love of the animals and I think they may well think they can really reason with the animals. It doesn't really matter as this is a story of love. If you want a real zoological study then I suggest getting that data from a university that offers those courses, however, when it comes right down to it I am sure the Harrisons and their staff could hold their own with any institutionally trained professionals.The book is a nice fast read and if you have been to the park and go back as I do it is a must read.I have been to the new \\"Out of Africa\\" wildlife park many times and contribute to same as this is the way these magnificent animals especially large cats should be maintained. It is not a zoo per se and the Harrisons really hate to have the park called a zoo. Everything described in the book are the same as they are now except they have moved the operation to the Verde Canyon area North of Phoenix, Az.Their park is just wonderful to see for adults as well as kids. I have taken their extra cost \\"behind the scenes tour\\" a few times which is a fair amount more but well worth it to see how the operation works. I have also spent many a day there just watching many of the cats especially the ones whom will let you get as close as the fences will allow. It is heartwarming and incredible experience. Every trip makes me feel so good and gives the average person a chance to get up close and personal with some of the most beautiful creatures on earth. Much better than any zoo I have ever seen and I have seen them all over the world.The staff at the park is incredibly friendly, knowledgeable and they ALL seem love their job which is so refreshing. I know it is very hard work but they all seem to love their work. I strongly suggest googling the \\"Out of Africa\\" website and if you are ever traveling through the area be sure to stop and see the operation. Dean the author of the book is always there and usually the one who puts on all of the shows and is open to talk to anyone.We need more people like the Harrisons."},{"Title":"Science and Human Transformation: Subtle Energies, Intentionality and Consciousness","review":"Having studied college-level physics, biology, chemistry and calculus many years ago, I thought I would have a bit more than just the fundamental knowledge necessary to understand the scientific language and ideas presented in this book. However, I had to quickly turn pages because I was unable to comprehend most of the ideas. It was a shame because I am deeply intrigued by the topic and was looking for something that would further explain some of my questions. It's likely I took on more than I could chew as the average layman, but I was under the impression upon buying it that a science-minded person could decipher 80% of it. Nevertheless, I will probe even deeper into the subject -- Tiller's book did not cause my interest to wane."},{"Title":"Science and Human Transformation: Subtle Energies, Intentionality and Consciousness","review":"This book, which was a predecessor to Conscious Creations, is much better written and organized. I had a much easier time understanding the concepts, likely because there was an acronym list, a glossary, and because the author expressed the concepts in language that was much less technical than in Conscious Creations.The book focuses on scientific experimentions dealing with paranormal powers. The thrust of the book is to prove (from a scientific perspective) that human intentionality can affect reality, and it seems that the author succeeds in doing this.If there is one thing I'd like to see however, it's more awareness on the author's part of occult and magical works, which have focused on intentionality and the application of it to reality for a rather long time. This is not to say he should adopt such paradigms, but an awareness of previous literature can't hurt. Granted he may not feel that as a scientist he can do this, but given that his work is essentially focused on proving that intentionality affects reality, it'd be good for him to consider the previous perspectives on it."},{"Title":"Science and Human Transformation: Subtle Energies, Intentionality and Consciousness","review":"William Tiller has stepped out of the safe paradigm of current thinking in physics and has presented a way to describe quantitatively the consciousness/intention contribution to reality. This is cutting edge theory and the theory will indeed evolve as paranormal phenomena are studied more extensively. Before any scientific theory needs to be developed, observed phenomena, to be explained by such theory, must be verified in replicated experiments and/or measurements. Such verification indeed exists. To get added perspective on how the scientific method has verified paranormal phenomena exhibited in controlled experiments, any reader with a skeptical leaning needs to read some of Dean Radin's books, in particular, \\"Entangled Minds\\". Then, with an updated mindset, such skeptic should reread Tiller's book."},{"Title":"Science and Human Transformation: Subtle Energies, Intentionality and Consciousness","review":"As a technologist (and registered Professional Engineer) whose 20-year career has required the use of real science,(even though I'm not too sure what REAL science is, Bill Nye the science guy told me what it is and I believe him because Bill is my hero) I was extremely disappointed by this book. I had just finished reading Michael Talbot's _Holographic Universe_, which made no pretense at being scientific, but presented an incredibly intriguing \\"model\\" of reality -- and I was looking for some follow-up reading to provide some scientific \\"meat.\\" A casual flip through _Science_and_Human_Transformation_ entices the technical reader with charts, graphs, diagrams of experimental apparatus, and appendices on Fourier Transforms and antenna theory. But the letdown began with the first page, with a vague sentence fragment identified as \\"equation 1.\\" Something like:\\"function&lt;-&gt;structure&lt;-&gt;biochemistry\\"On the next page, Tiller asks \\"what is the glaring omission from equation 1?\\"\\"Electromagnetic radiation, of course!\\"Well, I laughed so hard I had to put the book down for a few moments. Sadly, the book never recovers from this silly beginning. The appendices on Fourier Transforms and antenna theory are wasted print. Except that Tiller mentions the subjects within the main body of the text, in my opinion these are thrown in purely for appearance sake, as if to trick a technologist into reading the book. But alas! Let me detail a specific example. As a materials scientist, Tiller has undoubtedly made bona-fide use of the concept of the \\"inverse space\\" domain, where \\"real space\\" is transformed by Fourier into a \\"universe\\" measured in \\"wave numbers\\" and having units of reciprocal length -- much as I routinely use the Laplace Transform and work in the mathematical \\"s-plane\\" (where everything is measured in reciprocal time) for my transient models of the thermal properties of semiconductor packages. Thus (immediately after the silly start already panned) Tiller's book jumps into a discussion of how we can overlay this \\"inverse space matrix\\" onto the real one; the significant difference between the two being a difference of scale of twenty orders of magnitude. Whence does this scale difference arise? From the fact that the physical universe is comprised at the atomic scale of matrices of atoms and molecules separated from each other by roughly 1E-10 meters. Still don't see it? Here we are, living at the scale of meters, and we're made up of building blocks ten orders of magnitude smaller. So if you create an inverse space matrix from atomic dimensions, you'll have units of 1E+10 reciprocal meters. Voila! Twenty orders of magnitude of difference. If our bodies and universe coexist within those two matrices, is it any wonder that (as suggested in the _Holographic Universe_ model) that the entire span of the universe is accessible within the very confines of our own bodies and minds?Only when you take a step back and go, \\"wait a minute! Just how big is a reciprocal meter, anyway?\\" And you then realize that the entire concept, though somehow initially appealing, is an \\"apples and oranges comparison.\\" You simply can't compare the size of 1E-10 meters to 1E+10 reciprocal meters! Worse yet, this premise is founded on an arbitrary measurement system that happens to use the meter as its basic scale (which just happens to be approximately the size of our bodies). Let's start over: what if we'd decided that the Angstrom unit was to be the fundamental unit of scale? (That would make sense, actually, being precisely 1E-10 meters, and a rather natural unit of scale for atomic lattices.) But if we did, then the \\"inverse space matrix\\" based on atomic lattices would be the same \\"scale\\" as the physical atomic matrix (because the reciprocal of 1 Angstrom is 1 reciprocal Angstrom). Further, as you went to bigger and bigger distances in the physical universe (10, 10000000, 1E10 Angstroms - where you get to us), you'd be going to ever smaller inverse distances (1E-1, 1E-6, 1E-10 reciprocal Angstroms) and you'd have to conclude that the inverse space matrix of the entire universe resides within the confines of a single atom (and odds are it's not one of yours :-) ).Well, obviously I've got serious issues with Tiller's fundamentals, so I'm unlikely to be swayed by the rest of his meanderings. And it doesn't help any when he discusses his experiments with self-sharpening razor blades in Plexiglas pyramids. At first, he thinks he gets positive results, so he conducts (one of his few) more rigorously controlled follow-up experiments and is then disappointed to find nothing. His final conclusion is not that maybe his initial positive results were wishful thinking, but rather that significant \\"metaphysical\\" results always disappear when you look too closely. As a scientist, that's supposed to convince me of something here? Duh ....And as for the other \\"experiments\\" he describes in his book, I'm afraid they left me cold. For instance, he could have used the space taken up by the appendix on Fourier Transforms instead for a more thorough log of his lab experiments on psychokinetics. As it is, almost all of his experiments include a disclaimer to the effect of \\"but I haven't yet done double-blind studies\\" (so the results may be artifactual). Usually, real \\"science\\" doesn't take place (and results aren't published) until after double blind studies are finished. Remember \\"cold fusion?\\" Tiller's book is not likely to encourage another real scientist anywhere to follow his lead -- certainly not to admit it!"},{"Title":"Science and Human Transformation: Subtle Energies, Intentionality and Consciousness","review":"I cannot believe this man is a professor at Stanford University. I was looking for a book that would present a scientific explanation for unexplained phenomenon. This book is pseudoscience and superstition from a mind stuck in a christian paradigm."},{"Title":"Science and Human Transformation: Subtle Energies, Intentionality and Consciousness","review":"Dr. Tiller's excellent book, SCIENCE AND HUMAN TRANSFORMATION, boldly goes where few books dare to enter. Tiller presents a fascinating model of our universe as being multi-dimensional with a spiritual component. This book will likely be enjoyed most by readers who have experienced psychic or psycho-kinetic events in their lives, and are seeking a rational explanation for what might be going on. Those who have not yet had such experiences may not be convinced that such things exist -- even after reading Tiller's fascinating account of how he created a gas-discharge device in the 1970's while he was a professor at Stanford University which demonstrated that &quot;anyone could produce a positive (psychokinetic) result&quot;.SCIENCE AND HUMAN TRANSFORMATION is a joy to read for anyone who loves to play with new ideas and theories. It contains a wealth of schematic diagrams, charts, equations and references to support the theories Tiller presents. This book will most appeal to readers who love books they can ponder for some time, as it is packed with such ideas as: sensory arrays, etheric light cones, nodal networks and holograms.The main point of SCIENCE AND HUMAN TRANSFORMATION is that the component of mind and consciousness has long been excluded from scientific study, and even omitted from Theories Of Everything (TOEs). Obviously, if we're going to have a theory of everything it had better include consciousness! Tiller knows this quite well, and artfully constructs a bridge for future scientists with open minds to cross over to a place where unseen things (such as human energy fields) have huge effects. If we want to know what has eluded us for so long, we need to go to the very places which are currently least well understood. SCIENCE AND HUMAN TRANSFORMATION provides a sturdy bridge for us to reach those previously unknown places."},{"Title":"Science and Human Transformation: Subtle Energies, Intentionality and Consciousness","review":"I suspect that Roger Stout set out to try to trash this book without first going through the effort of seriously reading it. This can be readily seen from the word equation that he misquotes. He obviously didn't read the surrounding text with any care to see what kind of a pedagogical bridge I was building via that set of word equations. The point about direct space and reciprocal space that seems to have eluded Stout is that, together, they aoutomatically provide for both the particle aspect and the wave aspect of substance, the two fundamemental but entangled features dealt with by quantum mechanics. The novel approach that I have taken in this book allows one to distinquish these two complementary aspects simultaneously. Furthermore, it is surprising to me that a supposed professional engineer would make the mistake of trying to compare the distance scale of reciprocal space since this is a frequency scale. They do not have the same units of measurement and, therefore, cannot be directly compared, as undergraduate engineers in all universities are taught. If Stout had not been so intent on his \\"lashing\\" goal, he might have realized that the very small in direct space corresponds with the very high frequency region in reciprocal space. Likewise, the very large in direct space corresponds with the very small frequency region of reciprocal space. Since high frequency for photons corresponds with high particle energy, he shold have at least seen how the particle size scale in the angstrom and below range match qualitatively with the energetics of fundamental particles. As an illustrative example, if a time domain pattern has a 10 nanosecond interval, then its frequency domain counterpart along the inverse time coordinate would be comprised of a set of waves localized around 0.628 gigahertz for the first band. Likewise, if one has a direct spaces spherical object of 1 angstrom diameter, the first band counterpart in reciprocal space would be comprised of waves in the 6.28 x 10 ^8 cm ^( -1) range. Changing the scale of direct space units that one wishes to use just produces a corresponding scale change of the reciprcal space units one must use. Stout states how much he liked Talbot's book, \\"The Holographic Universe\\", yet he seems to have missed the crucial point that the entire basis of holography is wave diffraction. Further, the resultant wave intensity diffracted from any kind of direct space geometrical object can be shown to arise from the modulus of the Fourier Transform for that geometrical shape. He should have learned this in his electrical engineering classes. It is sad that Stout was so intent on trashing this book rather than reading it with an ip mind-he might have learned something useful for his life! As a final comment by the author to this open forum , this book was not in any way casually written, and I know that is is challenging for some readers. However, one should keep in mind tht it was based on 35 years of personal experimentation and thought by an acknowledged world-class expert in several areas of academic science. This same author taught for over 30 years at one of the most prestigious universities in the world, Stanford University, and was selected to be Chairman to study these new areas of human experience. During his industrial and academic career, he has published over 300 peer-reviewed scientific papers in various international journals plus 3 three technical books, all of which have meaningfully aided the evolution of the materials science and materials engineering fields. Can Stout, the trasher, claim as much! In today's world, unfortunately, it seems very easy to trash the works of others. It is much more difficult to constructively build upon them. Roger Stout would be well served by paying more attention to his intenttions than to his misquided logic."},{"Title":"Science and Human Transformation: Subtle Energies, Intentionality and Consciousness","review":"One needs a deep intuitive mind to appreciate this book. It's an excellent book that holds a beacon of light to the future of science in America which has become so warped with lack of intuition. Currently, we are following an old paradigm of dark ages &quot;materialistic science and theories&quot; - it's very hard for someone who is still stuck in dark ages to appreciate the valueof intuition which comes through understanding and experience of subtle energies. In anycase, people might argue over the value of this book, as a biomedical engineer and a scientist, I must say that Prof. Tiller has made full use of this Stanford position to bring to the world the best, instead of playing politics with funding agencies and approval of his peers for his self-preservation or ego gratification.

Dr Tiller and associates have provided us with a model for reality which is simple, yet profound. WE have a significant role to play in the physical structure of things. What we need to do is to carefully look at the vacuum (space) and understand that WE do indeed have a profound influence on it's structure. When the vacuum changes, so does \\"material\\" structure.Human Intention is the way we can change the vacuum and thus physical matter. We do this by way of setting energy frequencies. This view changes \\"medicine\\" from a chemistry based model to an energy based model.\\"Reality\\" is actually a COMBINATION of matter and vacuum, and when we come to understand that WE influence both, our conception of our place in the cosmos becomes more clear. Personal responsibility takes on the two positions of PRO-action as well as RE-action. What is wonderful about all of this is that we are CONNECTED. We are not separate and alone.What caught my eye was that Dr Tiller and associates have used the very same technologies used in \\"science\\" to demonstrate their model. They have employed the same measuring technologies, the same experimental designs, and the same data analyses used by scientists ranging from those in physics to those in chemistry to those in medicine, and so forth. The difference, however, is that Dr Tiller has demonstrated phenomena which can not be explained by current scientific theory UNLESS Human Intention and the vacuum are included as major players.The model presented in this book does not discount current science.

This work includes discussions of familiar physics, such as the nature of basic particles, and presents data on less well known studies including the influence of volition on physical processes. Tiller's aim is to present a theory of physical reality which incorporates more than the familiar 4 dimensions, and new variables, including consciousness itself. His theory is a work in progress, similar in its basic premises to the alternative version of quantum theory advanced by David Bohm. Tiller's theory is still undergoing development but his ideas are intriguing and the possible applications he describes are fascinating. The one flaw seems to be a blend of informal theorizing, such as borrowing from the Budhist world view, with a more formal scientific theory, without clearly distingishing between the two.

This book is obviously a product of many years of research and experimenting. I can see where a lot of the science community would want to close their minds to such a book. For example research and experiments with people with clairvoyance. William Tiller treats all of this subject matter in scienctific manner. Roger Stout's review shocked me, I could not believe it when he said how the book made him laugh and that it did not recover from the silly beginning. My guess is that when Roger went looking for follow up reading to Mike Talbot's Holographic Universe with scientific &quot;meat&quot;, he found a book with more scientific &quot;meat&quot; than he could handle. I admit, that it is a bit complicated. But the subject matter is one in which must be complicated, if it is to be tackled from a scientific point of view. This book changed my life and helped me to figure out what I want to research in the Biomedical field.

The first type is one who relies on vertical facts. This type of thinking results in established limitations and, often, a dogma of conventionality. The second type is lateral or circumspectual thinking. This person innovates and is not moved by the limitation doctrine characteristic of the straight educational process. Dr. William Tiller in Science and Human Transformation shows himself to be the second type. More and more we are led to apprectiate the cybernetic process with regard to each cell in our body. Each of the 80 billion carries its own DNA and acts like it has its own mind. Each is influenced by its effect on the whole. This complete integration is what the biologic sciences are all about. It has long been known that light has been shown to behave as a wave and a particle and that each is used in the process of light which has led to the controversies. Not only has Tiller offered methods for dealing with the mechanisms simultaneously, but has opened the door for the whole resonance-frequency phenomenon. Maybe Tiller has also unlocked the door to an understanding of the spirit of Love that bothers many who prefer to keep it in mysticism. Maybe, still further, we are on the threshold of a new era in physics dealing with mass and energy that cannot be quantified with the present assays of matter.

There are many valuable avenues opened up by the book, areas where there could be great transformative potential. The one that I am most familiar with is the relationship between what Dr. Tiller talks about and the Chinese practice of Feng Shui.As someone who grew up observing the positive effects of Feng Shui on the lives of those who believed and practiced it, Dr. Tiller's book was an eye-opener as it provides the beginnings of a scientific basis for Feng Shui.For those of us who are interested in the human potential of science, this is a must read. It is not for those, like Mr. Stout, whose paradigm of science is so narrowly reductionist that anything more expansive is immediately viewed as a threat and an opportunity to go on the attack.Finally, lest Stout and others like him should disparage people based on their lack of credentials, I have a Ph.D and was trained at one of the top universities in this country.

As their points of view converge, split and merge again, the book develops into a heady brew of intrigue, world building, action scenes, and an intriguing magic system in the nature of the furies.My traveling companions and I entirely and wholehearted enjoyed the book, which sports good production values with the voices and narration. I will definitely be looking to reading or listening to further volumes in the series.Lovers of Epic Fantasy will definitely like Butcher's take on the genre.

Indeed, the entire book has a good and interesting premise explored in a powerfully developed plot. The characters intrigued me, both the good guys and the bad guys, and most of all the ones who are somewhere in between.The magic system is interesting although I think it's probably the place where someone who wanted to poke holes could. The world is believably drawn.

The plot is very easy for me to get involved in, but then has twists and turns that I wasn't expecting. I like all the characters in the book, and am intrigued to find out what some of their next steps are. My only problem is that they are too captivating, leaving me thinking about them at work, driving, cooking, everywhere!"},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I absolutely adore Butcher's Harry Dresden; innovative and clever with a voice in character that is credible. I found The Furies... to be too predictable. Interesting story line and interesting characters, however no one grabbed me as Harry has done. I am finished with the series and will wait patiently for the next adventure Harry has from the grave."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"Jim Butcher is fast becoming one of my favorite authors. He reminds me of the Joss Whedon of the book world. I have devoured all of his Dresdon Files novels, and was expecting something similar when I started the Codex Alera series. Boy was I wrong, and glad to be so! If you are expecting a Harry Dresdon style series, take a minute to cleanse your pallet and you will not be disappointed! This is a whole different world, a whole different time, and a whole different and exciting story. If you like science fiction and fantasy, sword and horse stories, strong well-defined characters full of determination and raw emotion... then you will love this series. Things are never as they appear, and the surprises just keep coming till the end. I recommend this series, and this author, to all of my friends and family."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I picked up this audiobook for a long trip, and quickly fell in love (I'm working my way through the rest of the series now, and have not yet been disappointed). Not only is the book itself captivating and well-written, as I'd come to expect from Jim Butcher based on his Dresden Files series, but the audiobook was one of the best narrated books I've encountered."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I can't think of an other fantasy which gets better with every book. this one does. the story is original and enthralling, the characters are real: they change and grow and fail and try again. you cannot stop reading and when it ends you want anotherone, want to know what else is happening and how are they coping. i'm still hoping for another one....please..."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I was introduced to Jim Butcher in the first person viewpoint Dresden Files, and decided to give his third person fantasy series a try. I am glad that I did. I thought the idea of the Furies, elementals of Earth, Air, Fire, Water and Metal, was very cool. The villain, Fidelias, is not evil. He believes what he is doing is right. The empire is weak and he supports the man he believes can save it, even at the cost of innocent lives. His apprentice, Amara, takes her oaths seriously and defends the empire against her old master. The boy Tavi is a rarity in the empire, a person who doesn't control a Fury. Along with a large cast of characters they form an interesting web of deceit, betrayal and affirmation. And its classic Jim Butcher. Just when you think the heroes have gotten away from some disaster, they end up in something worse. Just when you think it can't get any worse it does. Not every one makes it out alive, but the thrill ride is worth it."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"First off Jim Butcher is one of my favorite authors. I was really surprised to find this series after reading the first 10 or so Dresden books. I was skeptical at first but I really enjoyed this series. The characters are great and the powers they use (furies) are exciting and new to me (roman-last avatars?). Butcher can add humor to his writing like no one else I have read and he creates worlds that I can picture so easily. I was pleasantly surprised by some of the battle scenes and how inventive Butcher was in Tavi's tactics. Tavi is an amazing character and races like the Vord, Alerans and Canim are well thought out. This series is a thrill ride from beginning to end. I enjoyed these books and i enjoy reading them to my children. I truly hope Butcher continues to write more fantasy in the future because I thoroughly enjoyed these books. If you are sitting on the fence....don't READ THEM."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I can't say enough how much I love this series. They are worthy of the name classic and should be on every fantasy lover's bookshelf. The story line and plot detail is amazing and the character development is flawless. Butcher covers a period of about 6 years in the series and grows his main character from a 15 year old little boy to a grown man, and he does it perfectly. I love how Butcher slowly reveals secrets in each book and every time I reread them I am thrilled to find the clues that I missed the first time. Also, there are lots of books out there that describe their character as \\"smart\\" or \\"intelligent\\" or \\"clever\\" and contrive a plot to show how \\"clever\\" the character is. Tavi is truly a \\"clever\\" character and Butcher must have an amazing mind. In each book Butcher has Tavi truly thinking outside the box in extremely creative ways. If I was ever in a tight spot I would definitely want Tavi on my side. The detail and world construction in the series blows me away. If you haven't read this series yet, you are really missing out. Read them today!"},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"A single grain of sand can tip the scale. A single beat of a butterfly's wings can add just enough wind to create a tempest. And the single action of one boy can change the fate of his homeland forever. Of course, that's not what Tavi was thinking about when he shirked off his responsibilities for the evening to collect flowers at the request of the most beautiful girl in Bernardholt. But even as the \`yes' left his lips, the wheels of fate were already turning, propelling him forward towards a greater adventure then he could ever have imagined.Tavi's grandest hope for his future was simply to attend The Academy and make something of himself using his brains and wits. No one in Calderon Valley thought he would ever amount to anything. He was fifteen years old and still had no furies of his own. His aunt had a water fury and his uncle had both a wood and an earth fury. Even their simpleton slave Fade had a metal fury and some capacity to use it. But he would show them he could do great things even without an elemental fury helping him, if only he was given the chance.However, there are consequences for every action, and his uncle's anger for this one irresponsible act could ruin Tavi's chances of ever leaving the valley. But how could Tavi have known the trouble that finding the sheep the next day would cause? How could he have known the great plans he was about to disrupt and the powerful eyes that would soon be focusing in on only him?No one was supposed to be that deep in the pine hallows that day. No one was supposed to see the single Marat warrior that had crossed through the pass into the valley. And no one should have been able to escape him even if they had. However, as Tavi was about to learn, the simplest choices can have far reaching effects, and even a simple \`yes' can change history.* * * * *This was an interesting book. The plot, while not complicated, was good and the world was typical high fantasy, with just enough uniqueness to make it interesting. But the thing that made this story so hard to put down was the characters. Each person, no matter how small their roll seemed at first, had a greater purpose and their own unique challenges to overcome. They struggled through their normal lives, then when trouble came they faced danger and hardship as best they could, striving to rise above the everyday and reach their goals no matter the odds. And while most stories focus on some highly talented or gifted person destined to bring about great change in their world, the main character in this story was just the opposite.Not only was Tavi young and inexperienced, he was also the only person in remembered history to not have an elemental fury companion. He was, as far as everyone around him was concerned, completely helpless, someone to be pitied and protected. Definitely not the type of person who normally sets off on a quest to save his homeland, or at least not the type that does so and returns to tell the tale. But it's always more fun to root for the underdog. While he doesn't possess the same gifts as everyone else, he still shows time and time again how a little courage and some thinking on your feet can make up for a lot in life. And unlike other books where the main character starts off magicless then awakens during story, Tavi stays furyless for the whole book. That somehow makes him even more appealing as a main character, because it's easier to relate to him and makes his triumphs that much more triumphant!The magic system in the story is also very interesting. It consists of spirits called furies, elemental beings of earth, fire, water, air, wood, and metal. They can affect objects of their specific element, giving the owners of air furies the ability of flight or the owners of earth furies the abilities to shape and move stone. Everyone at some point in their early teens or younger becomes bonded with at least one of these other-worldly creatures. Well, every human does anyway. The warrior tribes of the Marat that live just outside the Calderon valley do not have furies. They instead have animal totems, great beasts that they commune and speak with as brothers and sisters. They are not really human, and as such are treated like wild savages by the people of the valley, who drove them out just over fifteen years before the story begins. It is this tension between the Marat and the humans that threatens to erupt the entire valley into war.I gave this book 4 out of 5 stars, mostly because of the wonderful characters and how easy it was to keep reading about them. They could grab you enough to keep reading in just a few short sentences and not let you go again for chapters and chapters. But by the end of the story it still had not reached 5 star status, simply because not a lot happened in this book. Sure it was 500+ pages long and I would have kept reading past that if it had been longer. And there was plenty going on, lots of danger and intrigue, but the plot portion of the book was very short and you get to the end of the book with a lot of, well, loose ends left. Now granted, this is the first in a series and I am definitely going to read the rest of it, but as a stand-alone book it's just a little light on plot. But I think if you like character-driven stories and high fantasy, this would be a good book to try. I also have it on good authority that the next few books in the series are just as good, if not better then the first, but that's a story for another day."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"A friend turned me on to this book and series recently. I didnt buy the book here on Amazon, but did just finish reading it recently.It has a very interesting premise. Basically, there are elemental spirits throughout the lands. They each have one element they represent: water, air, earth, fire, metal, and wood. Almost everybody in the world (or at least the ones in this book) have one or more elemental spirits that are essentially their familiars. The more powerful people have as many as three or four of these elemental familiars. The elementals are known as \\"Furies\\"So....basically, an agent of the Empereror is sent to find and infiltrate a camp of possible insurrectionists, and find which of the Noble Lords is supporting and directing their actions. This inevitably leads to Calderon, an area that is basically on the edge of the empire, and also the first defense against the Barbarian, Marat tribes from the lands beyond the valley.One of the primary protagonists has never gained any Fury familiars, and so has to rely on his quickness, bravery, and intelligence alone, in a world where almost everybody has the added advantage of elemental support.One other cool characteristic is that each element has a dominant trait. For example, water's dominant trait is healing, while fire's is charm and mental suggestion/control.Anyway, i really enjoyed this book and look forward to reading part two."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I found the way elementals were used to be rather interesting. I did find the whole Citizen situation a bit confusing at times, but I figure it would be better laid out in subsequent books.The action was a bit slow as some foundation was laid for the reader to better understand what was going on. But then about a third of the way through, it picked up quite a bit.The Furies of Calderon I felt was a fun read and am looking forward to the next in the series.

It's so rare in the fantasy-genre to find a book with so much plot.I'd recommend these books to everyone who likes a fast paced-action/adventure, political intrigue, and good character development and anyone who's a fan of the genre, especially: Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time and Weis/Hickman's early Dragon Lance books."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"While I didn't care for how overwhelmed the good-guys seemed all the time, I did enjoy the actual story. One problem... A 14-15 year old boy is going to react differently to a woman than he did. The character seems much less mature than he is. It's more like he is a 9-10 year old than a teenager. It was obvious that the author intended something happening between the Cursor and the uncle, but the way that the boy reacted to her was wrong. He would have been embarassed about being around her, but he would have been attracted to her too...."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I actually liked Butchers writing, and thought the overall story line was good, but had to give up this read because I became increasing tired of the non-stop violence on his poor characters. They rarely get any rest or sleep, are almost constantly getting beat up, raped, buried, strangled, punched, burned, stabbed, and attacked by magical creatures (furies) who seem to have no will of their own and are just plain nasty. I gave it up during the rape and domination scene - it was just too much! Give these poor folks a few hours of sleep!"},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"... and admit that there are some very annoying aspects to this first book.The biggest of which was that the book lost any sense of danger or intensity a few chapters in. The recurring theme went something like this:[Tavi finds out that everyone he loves is either unquestionably dead or facing certain, unavoidable doom. He fights back tears and frustration, but alas, how can the poor lad not cry about everyone being dead? Tavi grieves for several paragraphs, and then his fear/sadness turn to a cold anger/determination and off he goes to do something brave. Turn the page, and.. OMG SURPRISE!!! Everyone is OK, after all. Nope, not a single one dead.]Well, that can be excused I guess. Let's see what happens in the next chapter...[Amara finds out that everyone she loves is either unquestionably dead or facing certain, unavoidable doom. She fights back tears and frustration, but alas, how can the poor lass not cry about everyone being dead? Amara grieves for several paragraphs, and then her fear/sadness turn to a cold...]Err, wait a second. I think I know how this is going to end. Flip a few pages, and what do ya know? EVERYONE is just fine and dandy. Well, at least he won't try that trick again. Let's keep going...[Isana finds out that everyone she loves is either unquestionably dead or facing certain, unavoidable doom...]OK, hold on.. I'm not retarded. What..? You mean someone got cut nearly in half, someone else's neck got broken, two others fell and were covered with tons of rocks, another was sliced into little scraps, and another still was poisoned? OK, I'm still skeptical, but let's see what happens..[OMG SURPRISE!!! Everyone is OK, after all. Nope, not a single one dead.]At this point, if Jim Butcher wrote that the entire Calderon Valley was leveled with 600 billion nukes, flooded with acid from one end to the other, and then magically lifted off of the planet and thrown into the sun.. I would still know with absolute certainty that no one important died.The second big issue was cliches/unoriginality. From the rather stereotypical warrior societies, Helm's Deep battle, and so on to the stock characters, government setups, and court politics. Yes, there are furies and all that.. but that's what makes the unoriginality of the rest of the story's universe so annoying. You would think that if everyone had had furies back in Medieval Europe that, well, you know.. things would have been a bit different.The third is the mistreatment of minor side characters. Look, a minor character who expresses herself sexually and actually thinks of sex as more than a duty to a man. Oh no, she's trapped in a room with a lovable mother type who is all sorts of pure. Their captor HATES the pure one with a passion. Gee, I wonder which one is going to get gang-raped and abused repeatedly? Surely the pure one, right? I mean, she's the one he hates, while the other woman is a stranger. He couldn't possibly be planning on leaving her absolutely *UNTOUCHED* just long enough for her to escape, could he?!?!This book is decent enough overall, and has laid a decent framework for future books, but let's not pretend that it isn't mostly derivative or doesn't have some serious \\"believability\\" problems."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"OK, silly heading, I know, but it's what came to mind, because this book reminds me of a dessert: no nutritional value, but still tastes pretty good.

For all its flaws this book is good to relax with if you just want to unwind at the end of the day and not have to think too hard--it's literary meringue. I just wish it wasn't quite so cheesy."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"There are so many reasons to recommend the Furies of Calderon that I was surprised that it was not nominated for any of the major awards. There is a great deal of action but it is not that irritating phenomenon of action for action's sake. I joke with my husband that my tombstone should read \\"Just one more page!\\" because while reading a book like the Furies of Calderon, I struggle to stay up turning pages into the wee hours. Like a first rate play, one of this book's best points is that it is built on a strong ensemble of characters. There is not just one superstar character; nearly every character is compelling. There is warfare, compassion, romance, bravery, foolishness and magic all in good measure. The plot is complicated but not to the point of being dry. If the rest of the books in the series are as good as this one, it is a series well worth investing the time to follow.[...]"},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"What if everyone in your world had magical abilities except you? In Alera, where even lighting a lamp requires magic, Tavi is in just such a situation. When the realm falls under attack he has only his mind to help save himself, his family, and the whole of Alera.Furies of Calderon follows several characters through the web of conflict that threatens their lives. Overall the story is engaging and enjoyable, but can seem slow and overwhelming at the beginning due to the complexity of the world and situations you are thrown into.There are graphic violence scenes as well as some sexual content. While the sexual scenes are few and not significant to the story, they tend to focus on the characters feelings of \\"hot need.\\"As far as a romping good tale goes, I would highly recommend this book, if you can get through the overwhelming nature of the first quarter. However, I have to dock it for sexual content that I do not feel adds positively to the characters, romance, or plot. It is entirely possible to do good clean romance without going beyond something I would feel comfortable with my son reading.

It's what all fantasy books should be--an epic tale, full of adventure, intrigue, romance, humor, and suspense, set in a world that's different from our own. Unlike many other books in this genre, Furies is fast-paced and full of action, yet with plenty of details to put the reader firmly in the realm of Alera, where magic, in the form of earth, air, fire, water, wood, & metal furies, is an everyday occurrence.Also notable is the depth of characterization. Jim Butcher has created a fairly large cast of characters and made each of them vividly real, with strengths and weaknesses, good points and bad, all painted in shades of gray.The good:The worldbuilding. It's layered in amongst the action, not handed out in long lists of descriptions that you'd tend to skip.The characters. All well-rounded, all with strengths and weaknesses, all with individual voices.The pace. There's something happening on every page. You never get bogged down.The writing style. It's clear and vivid, particularly noteworthy in the action scenes, which I have no trouble following, contrary to my experience with other books/authors.The bad:It's kind of long to read in one sitting, but you'll want to.The excellent:The intrigue. I'm a sucker for intrigue, and this book (the whole series) has it in spades. Lots of little clues hidden here and there that you only pick up on a second (or third or fourth) reading that give you hints about what's to come in the series.The verdict:Absolutely wonderful. I couldn't recommend it more highly."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"Indeed, I'm immensely please with Jim Butcher's new fantasy novel. While in his Dresden books, his main character has a wry, cynical wit--Codex Alera#1 doesn't have the same tone. Immediately this is noticed, but instead of being disappointed, for I love cynical wit, I was quite pleased at this adaptation. I don't think every author can pull it off. The characters were dynamic and the world an exciting new one that didn't seem to be like every other fantasy world--it was more mercenary and the book seemed to be on the dawn of a huge war, which is always exciting. I'd give this a whirl--it certainly won't disappoint."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"The plot is predictable, the characters archtypical, the setting is fantasy norm.But this is a good book.One thing I liked about this book was Butcher's treatment of the reader. He assumes you already know this world and what rules apply to it. You get no detailed descriptions or synopses of people places, ranks, powers, or anything like that. You gather that knowledge yourself, or let your imagination fill in the blanks.The Furies themselves have virtually no explaination. And I like that. I found myself filling the gaps of knowledge myself, and be confirmed in my theories of what something is.The story is typical epic fantasy stuff. Young boy Tavi, a shepherd looking to lead a better life, embarks on an adventure that changes the course of his people. Unlike most fantasies, here everyone has a fury to call. Representing the elements, wind, fire, water, wood, metal and earth. Everyone has one, except Tavi. With no fury, Tavi survives using his keen wits, and does so very well.During the course of the novel, Butcher breaks off and follows other characters around, it's not confusing and Butcher does a good job bringing characters to life.All in all, this series is right up there with Dresden. I was skeptical as hell about this series but now I can't wait."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I had some trouble getting into this. I didn't really know what it was going to be about and it just didn't seem to grip me. There were too many different things happening and to be quite frank, none of the characters engaged me at all: Amara was a stuck-up little pain, Fidalias was the righteous betrayer and Tavi was a silly little boy cliche.I am so glad I gave this book another try, though.By the time the battles started happening, I couldn't put the book down. Jim Butcher writes the most awesome battle scenes ever! Normally they bore me fairly quickly and I stat skimming, but they're so well woven into the story that they just make it that much more interesting. Plus the author's obvious familiarity with what he's talking about makes the situation so much more visual and understandable.The characters that I was frustrated with in the beginning fleshed out and became true people to me, ones that I could like and root for. In the end, this book had me laughing out loud, furiously turning pages to find out what was going to happen and left plenty to build on. Having read all of the books in the series, I can say it just goes from strength to strength. Jim Butcher has the character development, epic story lines and world building down; I can and do recommend this to all of my friends."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"Have you ever noticed that the standard fantasy setting is basically nonsense? It is basically medieval Europe with magic grafted on it like dog with antlers.In reality, think of the effect that even minor things has had on the world. The introduction of pepper changed the way people eat. Gunpowder changed the world. Now how can something as far reaching as \\"magic\\" leave the world otherwise identical to medieval Europe? Wouldn't magic change daily life, war, the world itself?Jim Butcher is an imaginative writer who has managed to transcend his pulp series to write truly imaginative fantasy. He creates a world with magic that makes sense and is integral to the world. In Codex Alera, everyone is bound to a fury, an elemental spirit, and can use them in daily tasks. Peasants use their furies to help in their daily chores, cooking, cleaning, and farming. The nobles are those people who have access to stronger furies which they use to wage war and engage in larger tasks.Mixing elements of Roman culture and his own imagination, Jim Butcher has created something unique. I have read a lot of fantasy, and this stands nearly alone as intelligent and logical."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"Among the ranks of modern high fantasy novels that have broken through the saturated market to make it to the bookstore, we find some ambitious masterpieces that redeem their use of clich&eacute;d stereotypes by succeeding at an epic scope, using literary devices that inspire and awe their readers. Then, there are other fantasies that are less ambitious, attempting to give the reader an enjoyable excursion into a new take on the standard fantasy conventions. Furies of Calderon by Jim Butcher, published by Ace in 2004, first book of the Codex Alera series, is one of these.The plot of Furies of Calderon follows one of fantasy's most cherished traditions in the archetype of the reluctant hero. The protagonist is a fifteen-year-old boy named Tavi, who apparently possesses no special power or skill or artifact to set him apart as a savior. I feel that this goes against a trend in contemporary fantasy to make the commoner hero turn out to be some sword and magic-slinging Hercules (although my first-hand experience with modern mainstream high fantasy is mainly based on Jordan and Paolini, as well as a little Sanderson and Lackey). Even in Tolkien, Frodo does not start out as a completely commonplace hero; by the time he becomes involved on the archetypal epic quest, he already possesses an uncommon burden with the potential to give him uncommon abilities. Bilbo, on the other hand, is completely common at the beginning of The Hobbit. Tavi's attitude and motives are far different from Bilbo's, but they both never outgrow their readers, allowing readers to experience all their wonder and terror at the awesome forces that take them away from their simple lives.Classic use of the reluctant commoner protagonist is the most stereotypical element of the entire plot. Furies of Calderon lives up to the major challenge that high fantasy currently faces, to step outside of the genre's overused conventions. Calderon cannot be accused of being clich&eacute;d, at least not in regard to its story. For one thing, the main plot arc takes place in a relatively limited geographic region. There is still a fair amount of travel in the main story line, but the characters do not undertake a cross-continental journey through multiple lands and kingdoms. Most of the action occurs within the rural valley that Tavi grew up in, analogous to the Shire in The Lord of the Rings and the Two Rivers in The Wheel of Time. Here Butcher shatters the stereotype of the peaceful rural village homeland into pieces. The Calderon Valley is not a happy, isolated community, untroubled by war and politics. Not only does the plot of the novel itself bring massive devastation to the rural communities within the Valley, but the Valley has also been the scene of a very significant war, set only within twenty years from the time of the story. Furthermore, the inhabitants of Calderon are not necessarily a basically good and simple folk. The beginning of Furies of Calderon includes a trial for heinous crime, with not only bad will but intense malevolence. This is a far cry from the simple rivalries that take place in the Shire and the Two Rivers, used to relieve tension from the terrifyingly epic scope of the main plotlines of those two fantasies. Also, the land of the Calderon Valley itself is dangerous and often forbidding, filled with rogue spirits and venomous lizards, as if it were a cross between the Two Rivers and the Aiel Waste of Jordan's world.The unique plot of Furies of Calderon is driven by its characters. The concepts behind the characters are by and large fairly unique. Some of the basic archetypes are present, and some of them are used in creative ways. For instance, this book's grim, honor-bound swordsman is a bad guy. The most interesting component of the characterization, especially of the numerous villains, is the diversity of motives and moral orientations. Noticeably absent is anything resembling a Dark Lord figure. Instead, the very human villains are divided into two categories - truly evil people who love only themselves and hurt others for their own gain, and radicals who justify their atrocities as means to an end that they are willing to die for. Some of the most evil characters seem to be so wicked as to be beyond pardon or repentance, but even those characters are portrayed with a dash of sympathy. The story makes the point that all die alike, that the evil oppressor dies at least as pathetically as all the people that he abused. Butcher manages to stir the reader to a degree of pity even for his most immoral characters by showing them to ultimately be as feeble and human as anyone else, only deprived of the consolation of love. The other class of villains, the radicals, are shown to be victims themselves. They are hurting people who have now been driven to hurt other people. Although they seem to have no conscience at times and hold unreasonable grudges, they are not too far fallen to see and respond to the good in others. I feel that the two major villains who fall into this redeemable category are the most interesting characters in the novel. Perhaps the continuing Codex Alera series records them either casting off their sense of right and joining the ranks of self-worshipping demons, or else finding healing from their trauma and restoration with those whom they had wrongly made their enemies. Another interesting concept develops the character of an apparently mentally handicapped man, who is treated by the novel as a person of honor and respect.The world that these characters inhabit is not of the austere, mystical variety, as Tolkien's and Jordan's are to some degree. Not only is magic a common occurrence, but the great majority of humans in Butcher's world seem to be able to use at least a little of it. At least two nonhuman races exist in this world, neither of which is directly based on the stereotypical Neo-Tolkien races. Of those two races, the one encountered in the plot is a barbaric people called the Marat. The initial image that the novel forms of the Marat makes them out to be crude, primitive cannibals. As the Marat are futher developed, they are shown to posses a sort of simple nobility without ever the original image ever being dispelled or falsified. Though physically different from humans in some small ways and socially different in many ways, the Marat are very human at heart, possessing the ability to do good or to do evil. Part of their function as a nonhuman race is that they make the disparity in the human heart more vivid. When they do evil, they are disgustingly savage in a way that is far beneath human sensibility, but they can also exemplify the wonders of the ancient and unspoiled wild. Thus, the Marat serve as both the Orcs and the Elves of Butcher's world. The rival neighbor of the Marat tribes is the human Empire, the concept of which combines all the coolest elements from historical ancient Rome and medieval England. Most of the human characters have Latin-like names. The native inhabitants of the Calderon Valley, who seem to have somewhat Germanic or Anglo names, are an exception. This sets up the loose analogy of the Calderon Valley as Britain during Roman occupation, the dangerous outskirts of the civilized empire. Under this analogy, the Marat are the Picts, or perhaps all the unconquered Celtic and Germanic peoples in general. (As a side note, I feel the need to complain about the absence of a map of the secondary world in at least paperback edition that I read. This novel makes frequent mention of geography, and maps add visual interest and curiosity to any high fantasy. I think the decision not to include a map was a serious mistake by the publisher.)Mythology plays a relatively weak role in Furies of Calderon, and only a few vague details of a vague legend describing the humans' conquest and subsequent founding of their Empire is given. The result of making magic so common while downplaying the role of myth is to make the secondary world seem less solemn and profound than it could be. This is not to say that the fantastic elements of the novel are ineffective. Actually, the beginning of the book does produce the sense of awe that draws readers to fantasy by showing the everyday interactions of an imaginary world that is more bizarre than most fantasy worlds tend to be. Although Furies of Calderon has no sword-slinging hero, it has an element of the sword-and-sorcery subgenre, with its battle scenes laden with action and gore.Furies of Calderon is not subtle at all, both as fantasy and as novel in general. Not only is the magic blatant and the mythology rough, but the writing holds very little stylistic impact for the reader. Too often, Butcher resorts to awkward sensuality in order to produce crude emotional appeal. Furies of Calderon does have some literary value, but the writing has little to do with it. One literary theme that runs loosely throughout the novel, binding the beginning to the end, is the necessity of having right priorities, of sticking to one's duty no matter what grander temptations may come. This simple theme is probably the central \\"moral\\" of the story, the thing that the reader can take away as the meaning of the novel. As the main moral, the theme of fulfilling one's duty is not developed carefully enough to seem particularly inspiring or moving, but the theme is adequate as a pleasant, non-controversial message for the audience. The only other theme that I picked up on is the already-mentioned distinction between the two types of bad people. Even though this theme is not as central to the story as the theme of fulfilling one's duty, it is far more elegantly developed over the course of the novel, using dialog and character examples to support its premise. The theme of the two types of bad people is definitely the deepest and most significant literary accomplishment of Furies of Calderon.Among other high fantasy novels, Furies of Calderon is reasonably distinct for its innovations in plot and worldbuilding, but it is not noteworthy for literary excellence or inspirational quality. Those who enjoy exploring speculative worlds for their own merit will probably find Furies of Calderon to be an interesting read, and those who are fans of mainstream high fantasy in general will probably find it to be at least tolerable. It does not offer much to take hold and digest, and it will probably not stay with you and become part of you; however, its statement about the nature of evil and of evil people is worthy. I think it probably held my interest enough to motivate me to read the rest of Codex Alera eventually. Until then, my priorities are bound to other duties."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"This review refers to the audio version.#1 in the Codex Alera fantasy series, a much more 'traditional' fantasy than Butcher's other modern-day \\"urban\\" fantasy Harry Dresden series. The land of Alera is about to be besieged by war, with the barbarians at the gates. While Alera itself seems based in Roman history, it's odd because the barbarians (the Marat) sound like the marauding American Indians of tomahawk and scalping fame with their various tribes and clans. Alerans use magic by bonding with furies, which are elementals based in air, earth, fire, water and metal.Like many fantasies, this story switches point of view several times to tell the various storylines of the main characters. Tavi, a fifteen-year-old boy living in Bernardhold, nephew to the steadholder, has not yet bonded with any furies, and thus is known as a freak and Amara, a young Cursor (messenger/spy) who is a windcrafter sent by the First Lord to the Calderon Valley (Tavi's home) to seek out information about the invasion, and who finds a traitor very close to hand, are the main characters. Tavi's uncle and aunt and Amara's tutor and traitor Fidelius as well as several other secondary characters also figure heavily in the story. As they trek along, sometimes together and sometimes not, they meet a fairly predictable set of adversarial situations.I did enjoy the book, but something about it failed to fully engage my interest. Good, but not great, in other words. It was a rather slow starter, and Butcher does a good job of building the world of Alera, although all the various magical rules and the governmental setup were a little confusing for awhile. The tone of the book was completely different than Butcher's Dresden Files series also, missing the wry humor and smart-alecky main character, but if anything it shows that the author is not a one-dimensional writer but can easily expand his horizons, and has done so. I'm hoping that subsequent books in the series will be a tad easier to get through now that I'm familiar with the world of Alera. The reader for this one was good, but not a favorite."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I've finished books 1-3 of the series, and while it's not the greatest fantasy ever written... it's competent and entertaining and I'm looking forward to reading book 4 (even though I feel a bit guilty about it).I rated the series at 3 stars, which for me means it's worth reading but not without flaws, probably 70% of the good books I've read fall in the region of 3 stars... so I may be a bit lower with my ratings than most (not many 4 star books and only a handful of 5's).No SpoilersThe Good:Many good qualities; likeable and well differentiated Characters, interesting use of Roman elements, interesting and relatively novel magic system, complex political landscape and multidimensional adversaries. The books are serial but also have self-contained fully developed plotlines, which makes them satisfying to read one at a time.I particularly liked the Roman feel of the Aleran society, and I wish Jim had fleshed it out even more (Religious connections for instance), but what he DID use was well done.He also had a few scenes that had a nice poignancy to them, conveying deep emotion without the melodrama.Battle scenes (even chaotic ones) are well visualized, plausible within the rules of the story universe, and fun reads. They're not hugely detailed and leave you with a few \\"why didn't they just do xxxx\\" moments, but not enough that it becomes a problem (unless you're a real stickler for detail).The plot tends to follow the Epic form, which I personally don't have a problem with at all. I think people get too hung up on novelty, a well crafted story that follows a form is eminently preferable to a bad but novel one... but then again... I don't get modern art either so I guess I'm a bit old fashioned that way.The Bad:By far the biggest fault in the series is that it lacks subtlety, especially during climax periods of the story. It makes the story come off as overly melodramatic. Every challenge ends in a 'nick of time' cliffhanger, with astronomically low probability of success for the good guys... but it always somehow works out.While Jim does a great job of portraying major non-Aleran adversaries that are multidimensional (don't fit the 'evil Orc' stereotype), he is not nearly as good at doing the same with good characters (with a handful of exceptions, good guys are WAY too good), and there are some Aleran adversaries in the political subplot that are absurdly Evil.Additionally - I think it fairly early on becomes apparent that Jim gets attached to his characters, so there's no risk that a character will be lost during an encounter, and all that leaves the reader is to find out how they dodge the bullet. Jim is an entertaining writer so that's not the end of the world, but sadly, it limits the overall impact possible by the various well implemented plot twists.Finally - WAY too much romance, which too often comes off as cloyingly sweet. Some of the scenes (if made into a movie) would be as bad as the terrible Star Wars Annikin/Amidala love fest (\\"I love you more\\"... \\"NO, I love YOU more\\"). I cringe.So I read, and I've enjoyed the books overall... but I feel a little guilty about it because they occasionally have what I image as a Harlequin Romance feel about them. I just wince and plow on.EDIT: Now that I've finished the entire series I'm editing my review to eat some crow. Everything I said above is still just as true as it was then, but the series grew on me as I read more of it, I found myself getting interested in how the young protagonist was going to pull victory from the jaws of defeat. The big surprise for me was that several of the characters became TRULY interesting, like a traitor and assasin who becomes a commander and faithful. There was a lot of character growth through the breadth of the series and it added much to the story... and in the end it triumphed over the flaws and turned the series into a genuinely enjoyable read (changed rating from 3 to 4 stars)."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I read that this book was a dare to the author to take the worst ideas one could come up with dealing with fantasy and make them good. Well I read this book and I agree and disagree. It was said that he was challenged with the ideas of Pokemon and the Roman Civilisation. I thought that the pokemon aspect of the book was gods awful. I hated the whole notion of 'furies'. The Roman Civilisation however I thought was a pretty good idea and played out fairly well. This book didn't work for me though. I didn't care for the overall storie, nor the characters, nor what happens to them. It was almost a struggle for me to finish. I will not be picking up the second installment, and I would not recommend this one, the first. There is plenty of other books based on bad, or overused ideas that come out much better."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"This is a fantasy story, and it follows almost every fantasy formula I can remember. On the positive side, the story has some interesting ideas and characters. The humans of Alera all have a paired Fury, an elemental being who aids in tasks from simple chores to fighting other humans. The enemies in the book were well rounded, with understandable reasons for why they took the actions they did. I especially liked Fidelias, the traitorous spy. He reminded me of Jim Butcher's highly successful character Harry Dresden.However, this story frustrated and bored me. The dialogue often seems forced, with characters droning on, even in the midst of battle scenes. It reminded me of a manga battle scene where the characters talk for pages before fighting. Once action did commence the fighting was not convincing. In a book with a rape scene, I expected the fighting to be gritty and bloody. Instead, characters hold back, even characters trained to kill, allowing other characters to conveniently survive encounters they should not have. The hero character, Tavi, is not particularly likeable, or relatable. His constant emotional instability made me annoyed with him.My suggestion to readers interested in Jim Butcher is to try his superior Dresden Files, which I have found very enjoyable."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"For me this book was like finding a diamond in the rough. There are a lot of good fantasy writers out there and this book has just joined the club. It's a fast and intense read with many twists and turns that keeps you waiting for more. I can't wait for Book Two in The Codex Alera."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I am a huge fantasy fan as well as a Pokemon fan. This book reminded me of Pokemon...Let me explain. The people of this world bond(How does it really happen? It is never explained!) with furies/Pokemon when they get to their mid teens. Like Ash and his buddies in Pokemon. The Furies help them throughout their lives with various tasks that they are bound to depending on what type of Fury they have. Water are healers, Metal are swordsman, Earth are farmers/foresters, etc. The people have little animal/elemental type creatures running around with them helping them in their lives just like Pokemon. I think this idea is really cool, kinda like Pokemon of steroids. Real cool idea and this aspect is really well written throughout the book.Then comes the happily ever after/Disney part. In the beginning a character DIES, but don't worry here comes the miracle, and a healer does the impossible and saves him. I can buy into this because it was close to the first of the book and it established how powerful some of these people can be, BUT IT KEEPS HAPPENING. Even to the bad guys. By the end of the book almost every character has been ALMOST killed and healed, or so tired they can't use their power then they use it more. One guy gets burried by tons of rock and he is OK. Another gets hung and HE is ok. One gets gutted and he is up and about within a few pages. You get the idea.Another part of the book I didn't like were the battles. In one part two characters call up their furies and they lay waste to eachother and everything around them(this WAS a cool fight!), then towards the end of the book when things are going bad and the furies would really help, the guy forgets he even has his fury and doesn't even call him up!??? Instead he uses a pole and an axe. It would have been really cool to see his Pokemon/Fury kick some butt. And what about everyone else in the fortress? They ALL have furies!!! Even the halfwit has \\"some metal craft\\".OK.....Enough complaining. I COULD go on. I actually did enjoy this book. If you go into it ready for a childrens book written with some adult events(there is a rape), you will like it more. I think if it got rid of all the adult elements, it would be an AWESOME read for a 10-12 year old. But I wouldn't want my kids to read some of the more graphic scenes in this book. I will get the next one, but at least now I know what I am getting into."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"Butcher writes an action packed, compelling story, but it's in the details that Butcher's writing falls short. I've read two Codex books and the first Dresden book and I can confidently say that Butcher and I will part ways. It's death by a thousand cuts.Pros:- Plot progresses quickly, very action packed.- Plot is good enough that I truly want to know what happens next.Cons:- Butcher's heroes are seemingly pushed to their physical limit in very the first conflict they encounter, but then manage to go for days without sleep or rest, accumulating more drastic injuries while barely making it through the next action packed scene. The only sleep his characters get are when they black out from trauma. It's hard to believe any of the characters when Butcher belabors how badly injured, tired, and on the brink of collapse his characters are, all the time.- Characters behave differently than they are described, even during a single scene. In one instance Tavi's is described as being left only with rage. The next sentence explains that in order to win this deadly battle, he'll have to remain calm and use his wits rather than rely on strength alone, because he is clearly outmatched. Dude Wtf?- All of Butcher's characters have identical powers of analytical reasoning. Regardless of background, personality, or context within the story, Fidelias, Amara, Gaius, and even Isana draw the same conclusions about the political manuevering of the Lord Acquitaine. They all explain the complicated and nuanced fallout if events go a certain way, despite Isana talks of being a simple homesteader, Amara having a small fraction of the details compared to Fidelius, and Gaius barely even involved.- All women are gorgeous and obsessed with sex, or ugly and bitter about it. A couple of his characters seem to go from being plain into being beautiful (and therefore obsessed with sex). I'm curious whether Butcher has actually known, or talked with, any women.- Butcher uses cliff hangers in a terribly clumsy way. During the conclusion of the second book, (Academ's Fury, he spends one chapter on each plot thread during the climax of the book. Each chapter takes a small step forward, leaving the conclusion of the book disjointed and frustrating to experience as you hop between each segment, waiting for anything to conclude. In contrast to Sanderson's clean reveal, this tactic is petty and unsatisfying.- Butcher's adult scenes are not even remotely classy.- Fight scenes are action packed, just make sure you don't pay too much attention to the words used, or the specifics of what's happening. Frequently a foe will slip and fall, only to make a clumsy horizontal swing at the hero, who 'ducks easily'. Keanu Reeves is the only hero I know who ducks from the knees...- The whole world is very inconsistent. Alerans all have elemental spirits that make them utter badasses in battle. Marat bond with animals but have no over magic, but are still badasses. Wild elementals are total badasses all by themselves. Then there's some creepy alien goo that seems to have a mysterious power of its own. What ties it all together, how do these things relate to one another?I'm sure there are more cons. None of them are so overt that I couldn't finish the book, but I don't like having to shut off most of my brain to enjoy a book. If that's your cup of tea, and the occasional segment borrowed from a cheap romance novel aren't a problem, Codex Alera might be for you."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I will read more in the series but I bought it because I liked the Harry Dresden files.

Can't wait to read his next book."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I enjoy Butcher's \\"Harry Dresden\\" series, so I was excited when he released this new series. What a disappointment, though. From the beginning, \\"Furies\\" did not seem as light-hearted and entertaining as the Dresden books. I can live with that, though -- a new series, a slightly different genre, a different tone to this new stuff.But the writing also seemed clunky, like Butcher was spending more time making sure his writing \\"sounded like\\" high fantasy than just letting his writing flow. (He's GREAT at letting the words just flow in his Dresden series. That feels like a much more natural writing style for him than this novel.) Again, I could live with that. He was imitating somebody (possibly Tolkien, as the cover blurb said), and if that was the style he wanted to imitate, so be it. I could muddle my way through the chunky sentences.The characters also didn't appeal to me. I sort of grew to like a couple of them as the story went on, but there was no true hero that I could look at and say, \\"I want to be like that guy (or gal)!\\" Dresden has his problems, but he's overall a fun guy to be around. I've stuck with him through each book, and I enjoy his attitude, his sense of humor, and the loyalty he displays toward his friends. I couldn't find much of that in this book. Again, I was willing to give Butcher time to let these things develop -- he'd already earned my trust through the Dresden series, and I assumed that somebody would appeal to me if I just kept reading.However, I put the book down when, about 2/3 of the way through, he decided that one of his characters needed to be gang raped. Sure, the rape didn't actually happen \\"on screen.\\" Yes, I know this sort of thing happens in real life. I know the woman was \\"just one of the bad guys.\\" And I'm certain that the man responsible for the raping would have justice done to him by the end of the novel. But where is the entertainment value in this sort of thing?Sorry, but I have better things to do with my time than read about this sort of thing happening to a character I've grown to somewhat care for (I can't say I liked her much, but that's still not the sort of thing I would even wish on an enemy). This is the last Calderon book I'll (mostly) read, and I really hope this new series doesn't influence his Dresden series."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I like Butcher's Dresden books as an interesting diversion, so I decided to give this series a try. Honestly, I never made it to the end of Book One.I think one thing that's missing here that Butcher managed to instill in the Dresden books is that I never really cared about the characters in this series. Every night, sitting down to read, I'd heave a sigh and pick this book up before finally admitting to myself that I just didn't care about these characters, didn't care whether they lived or died, and was really starting to root for the latter to happen so that it would just end.His writing is still good, but not nearly as snappy as in the Dresden series, and the dialog seems stilted. Okay, sure, older times, more formal perhaps, but I don't buy that.Wife loves this series almost as much as Dresden, so maybe it's just not the genre for me."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"The realm of Alera has been at peace for centuries having pushed the barbarian hordes back behind the borders into lands that the realm does not claim. Yet for its entire serene surface, civil war appears imminent unless one of the high lords manages to become First Lord by ousting the aging and heirless Gaius Sextus from power. So far the First Lord refuses to name his replacement.Amara is unprepared when her mentor Fidelias asks her help in overthrowing the First Lord. When she refuses to abet his quest, he tries to torture her into giving him the response he needs in order to make an assassination attempt. The student uses magic to learn what is going on and escape. Next, First Lord sends Amara to Calderon Valley on the outskirts of the realm where she learns Fidelias meets with his mercenaries and the Marat the barbarians who killed the First Lord's son. They overrun the valley to persuade people that the empire is crumbling and new leadership is needed to save Alera.In Alera almost everyone has at least one elemental spirit to aid them in their daily lives especially in times of danger. The few without an elemental are considered freaks. In that environs Jim Butcher has created an epic fantasy reminiscent of Tolkien and Brooks yet has an originality of its own. Book one of Codex Alera is an enchanting and riveting work due to the ordinary people (mundane in this realm) fighting to do the right thing; ironically the villain believes he is doing the right thing too. Mr. Butcher provides a deep saga filled with a deep cast in which ordinary citizens must save the realm.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I consider Jim Butcher as a \\"big name\\" in the fantasy genre, from his Dresden files and overall positive views regarding all his work. After reading other big names like Hobb, Jordan, Martin, and so forth. I have similar expectations for Butcher's Codex Alter series from all the positive reviews. From reading the Dresden Files, I expected some clever, good writing, entertaining, etc. The first few chapters in Furies of Calderon were intriguing and different. I was entertained and liked the characters. The Furies were cool. However, as I read on, I found the characters and plot to be too predictable, contrived, and tiring. After the middle of the book, I found myself putting it down and forgetting where I put it. Had to push myself to finish it and even had to skip paragraphs and pages. Lucky for me, I borrowed this book from the library.If I had to give a summary of this book, the main plot would be so boring and common. Let's see, a boy without special powers gets involved in these chain of events that would save his people. The other characters are just as predictable. A royal follower of crown vs. disenchanted one (they try to outdo and outguess each other-lets not forget this struggle is between student and teacher.) A totally different kind of people/society that others don't understand vs. regular humans (don't forget the discrimination factors) The just leader/lord vs typical evil leader (of course his one dimensional character that can't even get along with his own son and loves to rape and torture.) I can go on. I know that all fantasy has similar elements therefore, they are in the that same genre. I wonder if this book would receive the same positive reviews under another name.I probably will borrow the second one in the series just to see the quality of writing and where the story goes. I recall I was not over-enthusiastic with Wheel of Time's first book which turns out to be a favorite."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"If you watch low quality anime you see the same pattern repeated in this book.

Deus ex Machina and the good guys win one small victory.

The biggest flaw is that he spends far too much time on action scenes and not nearly enough time on character development. There are too many people skipping in and out, and you never get to know any of them, which makes it hard to care when they are fighting for their lives for the umpteenth time. And against who- there are so many bad guys you can't keep them straight! He writes good action scenes and describes an interesting world, but when you don't care about any of the people who live in it it gets boring.I hope that in the second novel he takes more time to develop the people since it started with such potential. In the meantime, start on the Dresden file novels. Witty, full of action and suspense and GREAT characters!"},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I'm only posting this once for the entire series.Spoilers::---------------I found the Codex books to be poorly written, and having suffered through all of them I have to say the 4th book is pretty much the true end of the series. It plods on in book 5 and 6 with the most anti-climatic ending of all. The last two felt rushed and stuffed full of filler material with characters with little to no purpose or significance other than to be a road block for the 'king to be.' I kept expecting the story and the idiot main character to evolve and mature, but all he does is 'act' mature rather than 'be' mature. Then throw in side characters that frankly don't matter, are boring to read about and detract from the story line. Seriously, about half of each of the books focuses on characters that don't matter or could have been told differently. Mr. Butcher even pulled out the whole chiched \\"I can't love you because &lt;name of stupid reason here>.\\" It was so bad, that I ended up speeding through most of the books just so I could read the parts where the real main character does stuff. In fact the main character is so boring I can't even remember his name. Never mind that the whole son of the king in hiding was blatantly obvious half way through the FIRST BOOK. sorry.Insipid, dull, derivative, full of characters you won't care about and have little long term impact on anything, and just plain boring. First series in a long time I wanted to scream at the books' plots for wasting my time.I feel like the series was written by someone else. The pacing is wrong, the plots aren't engaging, the characters poorly defined, irrational behaviors plague the story line like pot holes. Just plain bad writing."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I don't know what happened. I wasn't expecting Harry Dresden when I picked up Furies of Calderon, but I was expecting something equally fun, witty, interesting, and--well, good.The narrative is flat. There is none of that wit that Butcher is capable of. The characters are uninteresting. The plot takes far too long to get set up.It feels like something that a 15-year old wrote. When I think about the talent the Butcher has of putting out a Dresden novel year after year--and they're all great--I look at Furies of Calderon and think he did himself a great injustice. The plot is fine, it's just that the narrative as a whole is completely lacking his usual skill."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"Best known for his Dresden Files series, author Jim Butcher's foray into epic fantasy begins with the tediously predictable yet irritatingly addictive FURIES OF CALDERON. I found the book mostly epic fluff, but surprisingly unputdownable. The book contains episodic, soap-opera plotting which will inexorably compel me to find out what happens to some of the characters in spite of my overall lack of enjoyment. With names like Gaius Sextus and Legionnaires in the Legion, a Roman inspiration characterizes the book's settings and backdrop. This book firmly belongs to the young woman Amara, her missions under the First Lord and her romance with Bernard.Some positives to begin with. I liked the magic system: humans command \\"Fury\\" elementals incipient in earth, water, air, wood, steel to do their bidding. Some of the elementals lend themselves to naturally restorative functions such as water furies while other elementals exhibit a tendency for destruction such as earth furies. For a fantasy series, Butcher injects the book with a prevalent romantic flavor. Astonishingly, I felt some of the romance here could have been written by pure romance novelists, and it almost seems like Jim Butcher has read some historical romance novels. For instance, Amara's tingling, melting reactions in response to a tall, broad-shouldered, handsome widower. The pacing is fast, and Butcher keeps the action and romance flowing in this 504-page paperback. There's some genuine gray characters and the book thankfully dismisses the black-and-white Good vs. Evil struggle in epic fantasies. In fact, treachery and civil conflict marked much of the climactic battle here with each group and character striving for their own end goals.Possible SPOILERS ahead.Now for the negatives which easily overwhelmed the positives. The plotting was entirely formulaic and predictable. There's even a magical river flood akin to the flood in Tolkien's FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING before the companions arrive at Rivendale. The prose was, in general, below average to average. There's an attempt at settings and world building but I've seen better, even in pure romance novels. I hated that our 15 year-old protagonist boy Tavi behaves more like a 7,8 year-old baby often crying and screaming in terror most of the time. If I were a 15 year-old boy, I'd resent anyone calling me a \\"boy\\" or \\"child\\" at every turn, and I'd definitely avoid any emotional outbursts in public (hugging, crying). Tavi is too much of a do-gooder at 15, I know I found myself in much more mischief at the same age. For a series about a boy's coming-of-age, the first installment FURIES OF CALDERON firmly belongs to our young woman Amara, and her mission as Cursor under the First Lord of the Aleran Kingdom. I really could have done without Amara's romance with Tavi's uncle, the tall, broad-shouldered, strong and handsome Bernard. I found myself begrudging any chapter from Amara's perspective, which comprises a majority of the novel. I don't know, something about her, I just didn't like, and I liked Bernard even less. The entire combination was just... bleh. Butcher mostly employs Amara's perspective in the prolonged climactic finale featuring the battle between the Marat barbarians and the Roman-inspired Alerans at the Garrison in Calderon Valley. The interminable climactic battle was long and pointless! Almost every other chapter, there's the threat of a major death, but unfortunately, you know this type of novel lacks the audacity to kill off a major character. By the end of the novel, with *everyone* surviving for future books, it all seemed sooooo very, very, very vapidly pointless. It's funny, I couldn't take The Major Death in Scott Lynch's RED SEAS UNDER RED SKIES, but I was begging for some deaths here, Amara and Bernard most of all. I would have given the book 2 stars if this novel had killed off Amara and Bernard! Most of the protagonists I found aggravating or unlikable. I disliked Tavi, hated Bernard and Amara. I liked Tavi's Aunt Isana (though she sparingly appears), I enjoyed the redoubtable warrior Aldrick's mistress, the water witch Odiana, and I definitely enjoyed our disillusioned antagonist Fidelias. Finally, the magic is egregiously overused. It's a danger of fantasy novels, but magic users here fling their furies at foes and allies alike with impunity and without any limitations. Whenever Amara needs some aid in a pinch, oh let's just call on her wind fury Cirrus to fly her to safety or deliver a lethal blow! Oh someone suffered a fatal wound? Fear not, Isana's water fury Rill to the rescue! It gets seriously out of hand, and you start to question whether death exists for our main characters in Butcher's world at all.Anyway, I can't believe I want to read the next novel in this series after this poor fantasy effort. I guess Jim Butcher hooked me enough to find out if/when Tavi will ever get his fury, who Tavi's parents are, will we see Tavi's Marat rival Kitai who turns out to be a girl, will Tavi grow out of his crying and screaming, will Amara and Bernard ever die. Episodic? Anecdotal? Fluff? Yep. Yep. And yep."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"The Dresden Files prove that Butcher can write, worldbuild and direct compelling characters. This book has none of these qualities - the action and world are full of holes, with paper-thin characters acting in improbably, unbelievable and cliched patters of interaction.The only reasonable explanation I have is that the books have been written by someone Jim is close to and that he has lent his name to them. If you enjoy the Dresden files and the works of authors like Hobb, Rothfuss or Martin, stay away."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"Am I over 13?

Buy everything Dresden and I 100% guarantee you get your money's worth. For reasons that can only be explained by an ego run amok, Jim Butcher decided that he had the same talent to write the Codex series. He didn't. The Codex series (I stopped at reading the first three which were painful to get through) - is so bad, that if I had read them first, I would never have been willing to buy ANYTHING written by Jim Butcher. There is a DISCONNECT between the two series. Dresden is written first person, fun, entertaining, interesting characters, and he sticks with the same character, Dresden, following him through the entire book. The dialogue is witty, sarcastic, and spot on (in most places). All Dresden Books are written in the same, self deprecating, fun spirit. And the characters range from the tiny, to the incomprehensible powers that lord over the universe. All of it kept fun and fast paced, easy to follow, and to enjoy. The Codex on the other hand, lumbers, stalls, takes way too long to develop anything of interest, and the dialogue is dull, lacks purpose, unenjoyable. The books are way to wordy. Way overly descriptive rather than interactive. Way boring. I would read a Codex only if I had insomina and had to do something to bore myself to death. In my opinion, Butcher created a raging success in Dresden and a raging failure in Codex. But too many in Butcher's close circle (his friends, his editors, his 'people') have drunk the kool aid and won't tell the emperor that the Codex has no clothes - that it sucks and that he should spend all his time on Dresden and admit he failed with Codex. If he writes another series, he needs to use the style he employs in Dresden. Butcher should not experiment."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"This author has some latent hostility towards women. Things start off fine as a sort of cookie-cutter high-fantasy in a male dominated culture where most women seem to be slaves, sex objects, or man-less feminist stereotypes. Then all of a sudden it's time for the gang-rape scene. One of the main female characters is forced to watch while another is drugged, gang-raped, and then tortured with a magic dog collar. Classy. All of the \\"drama\\" leading up to the climax is is so forced that it makes no sense. If you replaced all of the bafflingly mean, obtuse, sexist, and poorly written characters with normal people who acted sanely, this story would only be about half as long. The author had such a ridiculously thin plot to work through, that he was forced to pad this story with inane confrontaions and nonsensical arguments to fill the pages. I find it sad that this garbage passes for \\"popular fiction\\". What a waste."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"This is my favorite series (with 1 more book to go) I love it.

This first installment sets the stage for an entertaining ride. Butcher has created a very good and original fantasy setting that is easy to get pulled into. I finished reading this book in two days, then quickly went out to buy the other four books. I finished them rapidly as well. I could not pull myself away from them. The plots are great, the characters are awesome. The books are not too long. There is very little 'fluff'. Basically you will not get bored reading these. I can't recommend this series enough.As for Furies of Calderon specifically, it is a typical first volume. It's purpose is to set the stage for bigger things. The magic system is different than what you see in typical fantasy, and thats a good thing. The battle scenes are very graphic and pull you right in. The plots and subplots interweave at a very comfortable pace. The characters are the driving force behind the books. Each are battling their own pains and turmoils. Fade, in my opinion, ranks as one of my favorite characters of all time. Bottom line: Read it. Then plan on buying the other Codex of Alera volumes very soon after."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I very much enjoy Jim Butcher as an author. I was put on to his Dresden series by a friend and ate them up. All of them. Can't wait for the next one. Then he also put me onto the Codex Alera series. LOVE them, too. Read the first three in about as many days and actually ponied up the dough for 2 day shipping from Amazon for the 4th, Captain's Fury.I'm a huge, huge fan of George R.R. Martin's series, A Song of Ice and Fire. The Codex Alera is not as intricate or complex as Martin's series, but it doesn't make it any less enjoyable.I enjoy a series with a character that has something special about him/her that developes over the storyline. I enjoyed that with Orson Scott Card's Alvin Maker series, Neo in the Matrix, Gambit and Wolverine in X-Men, so on and so forth. I enjoy that with Tavi in the Codex Alera. I have hope that he eventually finds his Furies and becomes an absolute monster of a powerhouse with them and reading about his journey on how to use them. I find that I'm also hoping the same thing happens to Dresden.Anyway, I enjoy the series and can't wait to read the next one."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"This book is a real page turner. It is not what I would call terribly original--there are elements from the history books and things rather reminiscent of other fantasy novels. But that's OK. Rather than being a hodge-podge of things, the various elements meld together nicely in a well-told story that easily keeps the reader engaged. It also seems a bit more mature than the Dresden books, in a way. There are some writing hitches, where conversation gets too clever for the situation, or where things taking place at the same time don't seem to match up well, time-wise. But these are really minor sorts of things. All in all, this is a very enjoyable book, and I'm looking forward to the next book."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"While dealing with a kind of fantasy standard of the furies this book is really creative and interesting. The pace is great and really keeps you involved without short changing the character development. The characters are all very well develped and interesting, even the bad guys. It is nice that the book has a action filled center, but a deeper more evolved intrigue to keep you thinking as things develope. I would highly recommend this book and its sequel to fantasy lovers and novices."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I keep underestimating Mr. Butcher - I started off with the Dresden files and figured that I'd give his Codex Alera series a chance as well. It was kind of a \\"oh, what the heck - it won't be as good (as the Dresden books), but it'll probably be alright\\". I was wrong - it was terrific!Jim has a knack for creating characters that you really come to care for. Tavi, a young boy with none of the special abilities to control 'furies' (beings of air, water, earth, fire, metal, and wood) that come natively to the other people of his kind, is essentially 'handicapped' - or so it seems. However, intelligence and courage prove that Tavi can make his own way, learning from his mistakes and showing that determination, bravery, and a quick mind are all that are needed to make one's own mark on the world.A crackling pace, empathetic characters, and a clever story have made this one of the most enjoyable books I've read lately. Don't be put off by the cover - as I mentioned in a previous review, you really can't judge Jim's books by their covers. 5 stars, and highly recommended for all lovers of fantasy and magic."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"This is the first book I've read by Jim Butcher.

He had me sitting on the edge of my seat throughout the entire thing. Don't buy into the complaints of other reviewers. Read it and judge for yourself. If you go into it expecting some form of reality based story, you may very well be disappointed. To that I say, choose another book then. But if you love fantasy, as well as action and suspense, then this is the book for you. Enjoy it!

This is a REMARKABLE series I would recommend to anyone. I have NEVER read straight fantasy, nor really wanted to, I am more into horror. As Mr. Butcher has become one of my favorite authors I REALLY wanted to try this book, but wasn't sure the subject matter would interest me all that much....boy was I WRONG and am SO glad I followed my instinct, trusted my favorite author's ability and bought this book. I cannot for the life of me understand the complaints I read about this book from other reviewers. What I find SO great about this book and I think showcases Mr. Butcher's amazing writing talent, is that it IS different, story and writing style, from the Dresden books, yet it STILL manages to pull you into this fascinating and intriguing new world. This book, while different from Mr. Butcher's other books, is JUST as great as the Dresden books. I cannot wait for the next installment in this wonderful series!! Mr. Butcher has created another world that is sure to be a GREAT success!!"},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"Furies of Calderon (2004) is the first fantasy novel in the Codex Alera series. Alera was settled by people from the outside. They gradually pushed out the Marat, the Canim and other native tribes. One of the Aleran advantages was the ability to use Furies -- anima controlling the four elements -- against the natives, who lacked such talents.In this novel, Academ Amara travels with Fidelias -- her patriserus -- to an area supposedly occupied by a mercenary legion. This is her graduation exercise and she is very tense from worry before a sentry stops them. After that, she is too wrapped up in her role as a slave girl to worry much.Unfortunately, Fidelias has turned his coat and is helping apply pressure on her to provide them information. She has to escape on her own. With a knife swiped from Fidelias's boot, Amara digs herself out of the dirt pit where she is buries and gets Cirrus -- her windfury -- to fly her away from the camp.After evading the Knights Aeris and reaching the river Gaul, Amara reports her activities and knowledge to Gaius Sextus, the First Lord. He declares that she has passed her final exercise and bestows the title of Cursor on her. Then he sends her to the Calderon Valley in Riva to check the status of the Marat tribe.In this story, Tavi is the nephew of Steadholder Bernard and Isana the watercrafter. He does a favor for Beritte instead of bringing in the sheep. When his uncle asks about the sheep, Tavi confesses his error and sets out to gather the sheep, with Bernard accompanying him.Tavi finds the sheep huddled in a thicket, with several dead lambs and ewes outside. After examining the bodies, Bernard orders Tavi to leave the sheep and return with him to the steadholt. When asked why, Bernard says that flight from the area is the only way to stay alive.Unfortunately, the herdbane soon finds them. When Bernard takes a bad wound in his leg, Tavi takes his sword and attacks the great bird. He chops at the neck and wounds the bird, but it doesn't stop fighting. He finally chops it into smaller pieces, but they keep wiggling. Bernard tells him that the first blow was enough to kill the bird and that Tavi should have held back and let the loss of blood finish the job.Bernard has Brutus -- his earthfury -- raise a chunk of rock and then take them back to the steadholt. Bernard soon passes out from his wound. Then Tavi notices that a Marat and another herdbane have come into the area. They will surely discover Bernard and himself, so Tavi rolls off the rock and starts leading the savage and bird away from his uncle.This story brings Amara and Tavi together inside a horrendous storm. The windmanes attack both of them. Tavi takes Amara to the Memorium for the son of the First Lord, who had been killed by the Marat in the valley sixteen years ago. After a final skirmish with the windmanes, Tavi and Amara find peace, protection and warmth in the shrine.When Tavi finally tells his story to Amara, she infers that the Marat is a hordemaster since he had two herdbanes. Obviously, he would not be inside the valley without some of his followers. And they would not be on the valley side of the pass unless invasion was imminent.The tale has several puzzles within the plot. Tavi is the nephew of Bernard and Isana, but his parent's names are not mentioned. Moreover, Bernard treats him as a nephew, but Isana loves him like a son. Also, Isana is greatly worried about someone coming to take Tavi from her. Who were Tavi's parents?Fade is a slave within the steadholt. Bernard has paid him wages to allow him to buy his freedom, but Fade spends the money on presents and other frivolous things. Fade has a coward's mark on his cheek and mostly acts as if he fears almost everything, but sometimes he does things that don't fit the image. Who was Fade before he became a slave?At one point in the story, Tavi gains more than a passing acquaintance with the Marat. Despite their reputation and image, the Marat have their own language, culture and religion. Some Marat can even speak his language. How can the Marat be thought of as animals? If the Marat are misunderstood, what about the other native tribes?Not all these puzzles are solved in this volume, but surely they will be answered in the sequels. The next volume is Academ's Fury. Enjoy!Highly recommended for Butcher fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of strange cultures, close combat and exotic magic.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"Jim Butcher is a great author.the series is an easy read and really sucks you in. I devoured them as fast as I could"},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I can't say this is one of those books that pulls you in from the first page. It takes a while to set up because there are a large number of characters and the author does a wonderful job of exploring them fully. I was impressed especially with how Butcher depicts the villains in this novel. They aren't one dimensional, but instead fully fleshed out characters that have both good and bad qualities.Butcher is one of those rare authors who is adept at characterization and plotting. I won't take the time to summarize the plot because plenty of reviewers have done a fine job of this. But I will say that if you give this book a chance, you will come to care about these characters greatly and you will be in for a very fun ride. I will definitely be continuing on to the other books in this series.Content: This book is fairly clean, although it does contain intense battle scenes so expect quite a bit of violence. There are no sex scenes, except an instance of rape that is disturbing but handled without excessive detail. The language is mostly mild with only a few uses of profanity. I would say this would be appropriate for teens and up.I am happy I gave this one a shot, and looking forward to reading the others in the series."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"Being a casual fantasy fan, I'm not going to pretend to have read all of the classics, but I do know that I liked this series. Butcher spins a wicked yarn that introduces intriguing characters, has lots of sub-plots, and includes a ton of action that all comes to a great climax. This is the case with each book of this series. I found his base premise of everyone having control of \\"furies\\" which gave them powers to be original (as far as I know) and interesting.I originally read these from the library, but will definitely be buying them all. They are worth re-reading. Being a fan of the Dresden books, I am definitely concluding that I am not only a fan of Dresden, but of Butcher's writing. Good stuff!"},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"The best part: it doesn't read like a modern Tolkein-wanna-be with elves, dwarves and the usual allotment of fantasy creatures as people embark on a quest, and blah-blah-blah. What we have here is a serious attempt to create a world that is full of just enough side-referenced mystery to keep you asking questions, to keep you wanting to know more about the broader world, and anxious for more.Butcher does a great job developing characters, especially among the Marat people, whose politics and society I found a fascinating blend of Native American and indigenous African cultures. The broader plot line is one of political betrayal and treachery, standard enough, but hidden behind layers of other major events and thematic developments including clashes between cultures of civilization and nature, adolescent growth and development, love, and an interesting kind of class struggle between those who can use furies (or magic) and those who cannot. The whole notion of furycrafting is an intelligent and original take on the use of magic in fantasy stories and making Tavi, the main character, someone who lacked that ability, while surrounding him with very powerful crafters helps the reader sympathize and identify with him.One other thing that Butcher does amazingly well: suspenseful action. Once you hit the back half of the book the action is non-stop and relentless in a very, very good way. The story was a little predictable, especially with the appearance of a legendary figure in an unassuming one (too much coincidence and melodrama for me), but it was still highly entertaining and fun to read."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I originally purchased this book in paperback form around the time the third book in the series was published. I was a fan of the Dresden Files, but burned out on \\"high fantasy\\". I don't remember why I decided to give it a try, but I loved the series. Well, a number of years later, I purchased a Kindle and decided to buy some of my favorites in Kindle format. I had forgotten most of the main points of the plot and it was like reading a new book.Furies of Calderon was just as good a read this time around. Looking at it with an older eye, I can see some foreshadowing that I missed the first time around, but I still think the characters all speak with individual voices (important as the focus shifts from one to the other) and Mr. Butcher's world-building was marvelous.The only thing I didn't care for (and I'm not sure if this was part of the Kindle formatting or in the book itself) was that, while it was easy to tell when the book shifted focus between characters, the time shifted a bit as well with the new character and it was somewhat jarring."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"So after reading this entire series, I must say that it was darned good. Before even reading the first book, at first there was a feeling of betrayal and absolute dislike for these inanimate objects . Because with Butcher writing these then that meant that Dresden was being ignored (and there was a thought that maybe he couldn't switch from modern times to another world). But after a few weeks of walking by this [then] new book, it just had to be picked up. And guess what, it wasn't bad (surprise!). It was a semi-quick read (three days, rather then one) but the characters were well thought out, the plot was constructed well enough that until reading the second book I was unsure about a few end-scenarios.But for a rich and fantastical series these books are a good choice."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"My husband is a fan of Jim Butcher and convinced me to read this series..I have to admit that this book and the other books that follows it does start slow with setting up the plot, but Butcher is able to build and build the action to the point where I had to put down the book to \\"breathe\\" because I was so tense. There aren't enough words to describe how I feel about this book and the series itself..but I can certainly try: awesome, amazing, thrilling, involving, action packed, easy, incredible, fantastic, fast paced, emotional, etc, etc... I don't usually write reviews but if you are looking for an amazing journey to an incredible world of fantasy & action; this book and the rest of the Codex Alera series will take you there!!!!"},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I'm reviewing once for the whole series.Overall, I'd rank this series in my top 10 for fantasy. It's absorbing, fast-paced (once it gets moving) and leaves you with a little extra perspective and knowledge than you had before you picked it up.Repeating what everyone else has said: this is a very different series than the Dresden Files. While each book in the Dresden Files is somewhat self-contained, the Furies series absolutely have to be read in order. Also, this book is written in the third person, and rotates through multiple perspectives. It's also more complex and compact -- there are a lot of subplots going on at once, and because it's a trilogy, there's not a lot of space for each plot. The series is also more morally complex. Bad guys become good guys, or at least do good things. Good guys do some things that are not so good (moreso than in the Dresden Files). Personally, I enjoyed these differences and thought they made the series deeper and more involving that the Dresden Files (which I still adore). That said, this series might not be for younger readers or readers who enjoy the straightforwardness of the Dresden Files.Still, this is Jim Butcher's work and so the basic things that make his work excellent are still there. Stubborn, hard-headed, intelligent heroes who always, always do the right thing. A constant uphill battle against impossible odds. Heroic sacrifice (rather more of it, in fact, because there are more characters to sacrifice).Most of the main plot points are fairly inevitable -- which is a little different than predictable. Butcher leaves enough hints along the way that you can guess the \\"surprises\\" long before they are revealed. You know what the ultimate outcome is going to be, but how the characters are going to get there (and who/what's going to be left standing when they do) is what's interesting anyway. Butcher takes on the challenge of having creative, intelligent characters and rises to it by having his characters do creative, intelligent things.One last thing: I don't know if Dresden has ever served in the military. I don't think so; he's never mentioned it. But he writes the military mindset extremely well. Not a lot of authors do the kind of research necessary to get the nuances of culture right. He's also got the attitudes and expectations of each rank down: Junior Officers act like junior officers, NCO's act like NCO's and lower enlisted act like lower enlisted. Both the good and bad. There's some obvious differences from the modern military -- less emphasis on small-unit tactics and more emphasis on stabbing things with with swords, for instance -- but I imagine those are well researched as well.Now it feels like this review is longer than the book. Anyway, I'll finish by saying that this series is very good. It's not perfect -- some of the characters who could have more depth are dissapointingly shallow -- but it's fun, it's engaging and it's marginally educational. But if you make the effort of getting past the first half of Book 1, you'll be well rewarded."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"Although I didn't know who Jim Butcher was, I did see that he had an established series when I stopped in the bookstore. I tend to pick up new author works when I know that they were at least successful enough to get multiple books published, plus that they have more books ready to read on the shelves if their particular style fits my reading palette. Since I was tempted by the Dresden Files works, and was more than pleasantly surprised, it required no special urging for me to pick up Furies of Calderon.The introduction of meaningful characters that the reader can connect with was expected, as Butcher does a great job of that in his other series. While his other series does have mystical and fantasy aspects, he is able to fully engage his world building skills in this storyline. I found myself wanting to read the next page not only because of the story, but also because it would help reveal the nuances of this newly created world and the mechanics that make it work.In short, if you want a good read, with more world growth already waiting on the shelves, then you can count this book and series in as a must read."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"Furies of Calderon introduces us to Tavi, alone among his people in that he has no magick at all. The average Aleran, at a young age, 'comes into their furies' as they call it, being bonded to one or more elemental beings known as furies and wakening in them an innate talent for magick they call furycraft.Tavi, as a young man, is bereft of any furycraft at all, though his quick and clever mind more than makes up for this apparent deficit. This book follows Tavi and his family as their land is laid siege by the Marat- so called barbarians who, like Tavi, possess no furycraft, but who share otherworldly bonds with their clan totem creatures. Beneath it all lies terrible treachery from within the Aleran Empire itself and a far greater and far more alien threat than the Marat could ever hope to be."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I just finished reading this book last night, and have to say that it has rekindled my desire to read AND write (rare in any book).

The system of magic is very interesting, and I'm curious where he will go with some of the characters and plot developments that twisted within this excellent novel. Planning to start on Academ's Fury today, absolutely addicted to the series."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Clearly, this is the set up for the longer, more epic storyline, but the author made the most of it by introducing not only the interesting characters, but also the textured world, social structure, and magic system.As much as I liked the overall plot, there was nothing terribly novel about the main story, but it was presented nicely.The best touches to my mind were the unexpected villain on villain horror and the magic, which allowed each fury its own strength and weakness, but also a secondary magic effect for each particular variety.This book gets four stars from me because of the imagination and promise of future novels. The author did a very nice job of introducing his world and the rules of that world, while capturing it in a pretty exciting plot.I look forward to future novels in this world."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"Pretty good for such an ambitious project. I am always leery when an author attempts to create a new fantasy magic system, but Mr. Butcher seems to have pulled it off; for the most part. This book, read alone, will leave you somewhat wanting. It's pretty much a prelude to the rest of the series, as a decent description of the furies and what they are doesn't even come until the second book. The series definitely gets better as Mr. Butcher seems to finally find his groove in the second book; I'm hoping that the rest of the series keeps up the pace."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"When I first began reading these books, I was excited due to my love of the Dresden Files books. The writing style was similar, which I appreciated, though the story in general was different in practically every way.One thing I didn't appreciate at first, though I came not to mind it, was that Butcher doesn't explain the magic system in the books. He doesn't explain what the furies are, how you come by them, how you use them, nor what all they can do. You are left to figure it out by reading the books and seeing for yourself how the furies are used.Initially, I was pretty put off by this. Characters kept doing things with their furies and I was left asking \\"why\\" and \\"how\\".However, over the course of the novel, the details about the furies are explained not by any kind of narrative, but by their direct involvement in the story. I didn't mind it after a little bit.Having said that, Butcher's books are simply thoroughly entertaining to read. He may not always have the most complex stories, but they damn sure get your attention and keep you coming back for more.I read through all 4 books of his Codex Alera series and can't wait for the next one to come out.If you like Butcher's style of writing, you should like these books. If you don't like his style, find something else to read like A Song of Fire and Ice.

I've run through all the good urban fantasy books, so I figured why not? So glad, I did!Butcher has built a complicated and beautifully fit together fantasy world. Even better though, Butcher excels in his likable and complex characters. Our hero Tavi is the shepherd boy with the hidden destiny who manages to be tenacious, clever, decent, and wildly endearing all by the fifth chapter. And there begins a wonderful cast of characters that feel familiar and fascinating almost immediately, even as you jump from subplot to subplot on route to the dramatic conclusion. There was no down time in this book where you wait around for the characters to quit talking or sharpening their weapons. Everything feels urgent, and it's near impossible to put the book down. Which is why I'm saving the sequel till the weekend. No more snoring at work, Butcher!"},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I like many recent purchasers bought this book because of knowledge of the Author and 'The Dresden Files'. Quite by accident was my purchase actually. I was in an airport, had lost my copy of Dresden Book 1 while traveling and bough it, and then grabbed the next one thinking I'd have time to read it on my 5 hr flight.Upon initially starting to read it, my disgust with buying the wrong book melted no more than four pages in. Jim Butcher creates an entirely new concept of fantasy environments and drags you through it rather quickly, and as the story progresses you learn more of the environment in which this world is created.I quickly bought the next two in the series, and have enjoyed them as well. The only frustration I've had is that I thought it was just a trilogy, and burned through them so fast to want to find out what happened only to realize there are at least two, if not more, titles."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"Fantasy fans can rejoice: this series is that good.Butcher's foray into high-fantasy is a rousing success. The elemental=based magic system is well-thought out, the behind the scenes scheming is filled with twists, there are fantastic fight scenes, creatures galore, and vivid personalities brought to life. The best thing about book one is how rapidly the pages fly by, helped along by crisp dialogue and taut action.I recommend this highly, and am eager to continue the series."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"Overall: 5 stars-----------------This is the first book of the Codex Alera series by Jim Butcher(JB). He does great world building using Romanesque imagery, fantasy magic-using and some novel new creatures as the backdrop for the story. The main character is clearly destined for greatness despite his \\"handicap\\" of being furyless. The plot moves along quite well and has a large scale to the events.The events in the book as started by Tavi (15 year old furyless boy) going to get a flock of sheep his is responsible for. The story moves along as he and his Uncle stumble upon an invasion block by savage creatures, Marat. His story becomes entwined with a Cursor (Imperial spy / courier) and the events quickly unfurl themselves. The other reviews have plenty of spoilers if you are interested. It is enough to know that Tavi's potential greatness shows through in actions not his words.Summary:--------Characters: 4 stars -- interesting but a bit on the 2d side (expected for a first novel in a new series). The Tavi character is the main character of the series. He is not able to contact furyies (spirits -- air, water, fire, earth, metal, wood, war) or have any companion furyies. He only has his courage and intellect to make it in a hard and dangerous world. It is great to see an inverse of most fantasy novels -- the main character is handicapped while the rest of the people have tremendous power. JB is clearly making a statement about intelligence and resourcefulness vs. raw power and raw talent. [Note: a message many people never learn in the course of their lifetime, unfortunately.]Plot: 4 stars -- it moves along well and has many of the classic plots -- love, treachery, power, idealogy fantaticism, coming of age...a bit of everything for everyoneWorld: 5 stars -- it is built up well on a rough framework of the Romain empire combined with feudalism, magic and fantasy creatures/societies. The descriptions are detailed, yet leave you wanting to find out more about the world and the people/creatures living in the world.Action/pacing: 5 stars -- the pacing is done very well will a gradual buildup to the climax but it is done in a way that does not feel forced. The combat sequence are clear, concise and not overly done as can happen with authors like R.A. Salvatore. The key events get the attention deserved.Writing: 4 stars -- Jim Butcher uses a similar writing style as in the Harry Dresden novels. So, if you like that, great; if not, be forewarned. The prose is generally crisp and filled with a good amount of detail for the scene / action. The style is to keep things moving without being encumbered with overly complex sentence structure or inconsistent vocabulary."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I would definitely use this merchant again. The book came very quickly in the mail and was in excellant condition....like new. Thank you!"},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"A good start on a new series. Wish it was as amusing as the Dresden files series, but I'm willing to be coaxed into the story. Knowing that this is a new series means there's no real resolution to the plot for however long the series goes on. It's hard to keep up with lots of different characters being introduced and no real handle on some of the intrigue that's sure to come.The furycrafting isn't really explained in such a way that the reader \\"gets it\\" but it does come out more in the subsequent title."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"If you have read much about Jim Butcher, you have read his little blurb at the end of many of his novels about how he became interested in Fantasy. He talks about being sick and being given Lord of the Rings to read as a boy. He also talks about how he initially attempted to create \\"Swords and Horses\\" Fantasy first, and stumbled onto Dresden as a \\"happy accident\\" while trying to refine his Fantasy.The reason I relate this story is because you can see all those things evident in this, the first book of the Codex Alera. You can see the kid influenced heavily by Tolkien at the beginning of the novel, and you can literally see his writing grow as the story unfolds. I once read a blurb by Stephen King talking about how the beginning of the Gunslinger was one of the first things he wrote, and you can tell! It is so ambitious and so epic, you can tell that it was written by someone who is still finding their legs as an author, and has not given up that youthful exuberance that drives you to aim very high. As that story grew, you could note the growth as an author, both in the storytelling, and in the professionalism. It was not just what he added to the story, but what he was willing to take away, to diminish a bit for the sake of the story. It does not have to be SO epic, and it does have to be SO cliche, SO by the numbers Fantasy.The first 150 pages or so of the Furies of Calderon is very much like this. Many of the elements are very typical Fantasy and you can hear Jim Butcher finding his voice in this field. However, by the time you get to that point in the novel, you are still being entertained and are interested enough in the plot to continue. After that point, you can really start to tell where Butcher begins to put his own unique stamp on the field, where his Fantasy world starts to distinguish itself from those that inspired him. And while the Second Battle of Calderon feels very Helm's Deepish, by that point you are so enjoying the more unique aspects of his world and story, that it feels more like homage than borrowing.The Furies of Calderon begins the journey of Tavi, a young Shepherd boy who is unique among his people. He is without \\"furies\\", the magic of the world of Carna, and is the only known Aleran to suffer from such a \\"malady\\". The story revolves around Tavi and his family, his Aunt Isana, Uncle Bernard and house slave Fade, as they are swept up in political events that stretch far beyond their relatively peaceful little hamlet. Along to help them is Amara, an envoy of the First Lord (Emperor or Caesar) trying to preserve the peace of the realm, and prevent a Civil War.This book is rife with seeding for future books in the series, obvious hints of \\"destiny\\" for Tavi, and secrets that are clearly intended to be uncovered in later books. However, these hints are done well and make you really want to read more in the series to uncover them, rather than annoying you with the teased information.One of the things that makes Alera a unique Fantasy world in my experience, is the Roman Empire analogue setting. There is a hint in the books that the Alerans were \\"brought\\" to this world of Carna a thousand years ago and forced to fend for themselves. So perhaps a Roman town or Legion was transported to this world long ago, and maintained the identity of Rome (Alera) on a new world with Magic replacing the need to advance technologically. So they still have the same class system, same slavery institution, similar government structure, and of course the same style military with Magic added.The book's villains are political schemers who are utilizing one of Alera's primary enemies, the Marat barbarians, as a tool to try and weaken the First Lord's hold on power. However, Butcher gives us a very nuanced and layered Marat society that is realistic in that it is at odds with itself, with elements for and against war. So where the barbarians could easily become cliche plot device, they are instead sophisticated and diverse in their own right.In all Furies of Calderon offers the reader a quality introductory adventure in a fresh new Fantasy world from the imaginative mind of Jim Butcher. From here the novels just get better, and Alera offers much for the traditional Fantasy fan to love, while maintaining much of the wit and humor that makes the Dresden Files so enjoyable.440 HC pages 4 out of 5 stars"},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I keep feeling that I should have liked this book more than I did, it has: a Roman-analog Empire, a loyal Agent of the Empire, a young man who must live by his wits, political intrigue and war! But they just do not fit well together. And there are little things that bothered me (door knobs in a Roman house? really?) and the magic system, well, it is interesting but not coherent.The Alerans, the main culture in the book, are born with the ability to manipulate furies which are elementals (the usual four plus wood and metal) but most Alerans only one or two types at their command. The furies a character commands are usually named and have some vestigial personality and the power level of these furies vary greatly from master to master. One of the main characters (the young man who must live by his wits) is the only Aleran ever not to have furies of his own, at least that is the impression the book gives. But for all this structure, the furies ultimately do what is needed by the plot not what they should be in a coherent structure and, but some unknown method, they can be bound into items so we can have magical flashlights and floodlights (\\"fury lamps\\"), which halfway make sense in the setting, and will destroying slave collars, which do not.The plot is also very predictable. While it was an easy read and the battles at the end of the book are very intense, it is just very . . . standard. Every plot twist was telegraphed and played out as expected. Most of the villains barely had three dimensions though our heroes managed slightly better. Still, not a bad read, but not really engaging enough to make me want to read the second book. My Grade: C/C+"},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"A much shorter review would be to say, \\"I loved 'Furies of Calderon' and highly recommend it\\", but I'm going to try to give you a little more than that because I think this book deserves it. :)In \\"Furies of Calderon\\", the first book of a new series, Jim has created a world of characters that will draw you in and leave you ready and waiting for the continuation of their stories. If you are a Jim Butcher fan already and are expecting Furies to be similar to his Dresden Files novels, you will be in for a surprise. One of my first thoughts was that it's like trying to compare apples to oranges. Suffice it to say that it is a well-written, engaging book that begins a new fantasy epic. Jim shows what a talented author he is by writing in a totally different, but just as effective and entertaining, style. Whether you are a Butcher fan already or a potential new fan, if you are looking for a wonderful, new series to begin, Furies is for you. The book has a smooth flow, and the characters have a very natural \\"feel\\", which to me, is another sign of the talent of the author.I won't repeat the basic storyline since Harriet Klausner's review gives a concise over-view of the novel. While Tavi, a 15-year-old boy, is the central character, Amara plays an equally important role in Furies. The large ensemble cast of characters that is introduced hints at multiple, intriguing possibilities for the future books. In short, just what Book 1 of a series should do.Furies does an excellent job, in my opinion, of showing us that, as in most conflicts, battles and wars, both sides feel that they are right, just and even justified and rarely is the intent purely evil. Actually, several of my favorite scenes were among the 3 main \\"bad guys\\", Fidleias, Odiana and Aldrick. The humor and sarcasm (snark) that we expect from Jim is present in small, appropriate doses; a good example is: \\"\`The pretty boy?' Odiana asked. \`I wasn't hurting him. I was killing him. There's a difference.' She sniffed and said, \`It wasn't anything personal.'\\" Also, there are a few romance scenes that show the start of relationships that I think will develop over time; the way they are written is just right -- the heat or hint of heat is there without being overt or 'clinical'. I'd like to add that if you have teenaged children in your family, this is a good book for them also.To go back to where I began: \\"I loved \\"Furies of Calderon\\" and highly recommend it.\\""},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"Since the other reviewers have done a good job of describing the plot, I'll concentrate on just my opinion of the book.I've read all of Jim Butcher's 'Harry Dresden' novels and have generally enjoyed them but I've always felt that Jim's writing style wasn't really quite suited to the hard-boiled detective sub-genre. Apparently he felt the same way because he's created a brand new classical fantasy world and has obviously spent a lot of time thinking through the practical applications of his magic system.My first major concern came when I read his acknowledgement that he enjoys playing with the International Fantasy Gaming Society. I've got nothing against roleplaying, heck I've got 26 happy years in the hobby myself. But the elements that make a good roleplaying game usually don't create a good book. A few writers have managed to span the distance but most fall into the abyss between the two genres.My second concern came when I realized how generic the situation appeared on the surface. We've seen most of the elements of this story at least a dozen times before. The question for me was 'What can he do that's new with the situation?'The answer:Plenty! The big secret is that the author has done a marvelous job of shaping heroes. I'm not talking about just their personalities (although that's well done too), I'm talking about creating a real living interesting personality that just happens to be able to believably outwrestle Arnold Schwartzenegger, beat James Bond at cards, and out-think Capt. Picard on the best day of his career.Now multiply that by about eight radically different characters, make sure that they don't like each other very much, and set them in a very difficult situation. Finally shove the action quotient up to about a 20 on a scale of 1 to 10 and you'll have troubles putting this book down before the ending. Although the action is extremely intense, it very rarely dips into the unbelievable, is very creative, and is very well thought out.More character development would have been nice but at 500 pages, this book bordered on being too big already. My only real complaint is that the ending drags a bit compared to the rest of the book. This is hardly surprising, I'm amazed that the author maintained the high tempo that he did, but it would have been wonderful to have finished the book on same high note that the rest of the book maintained.My greatest feelings on finishing the story were impatience that it had to end and confidence that the next book would be just as good. Considering my concerns at the beginning this is a powerful statement of just how good the story is.Altogether it earned a solid 4.5 from me, rounded up since I feel that the author's done an outstanding job of telling us such a mature and interesting story starting from such humble and familiar beginnings."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"What a good start for a new fantasy series. In some way this book remind me Eddings first fantasy book(Pawn of Prophecy).The book is a fast read, and you get caught up in the action and could not put it down. I like the character Tavi and Amara. I think the most intresting character of the book is the slave Fade, I think he is key to answer who really is Tavi's parents, and why he is so protective toward Tavi.If you like Eddings and Feist, you should pick up this book."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"\\"Furies of Calderon\\" is the first in Butcher's \\"Codex Alera\\" series (Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1),Academ's Fury (Codex Alera, Book 2),Cursor's Fury (Codex Alera, Book 3),Captain's Fury (Codex Alera, Book 4), andPrinceps' Fury (Codex Alera, Book 5)). I'm a bit torn, though, on how to rate it. On one hand, I really enjoyed reading it: the characterizations are pretty good, the writing is good, and the world and plot are interesting. On the other hand:- it's basically your standard \\"hero fights hordes of enemies and is usually cold\\" type of book.- the pacing could use some more work since, after the beginning, there's really not enough of a lull in what's happening to provide a good resting point.- the sheer number of enemies gets a bit silly later in the book.- Butcher needs to set down the rules for how this universe works (i.e., how do the furies do what they do and what are the rules that empower/limit them).- the behavior of the \\"good\\" enemy doesn't seem to agree with his barbarism.Most of those are fairly minor and I don't really mind the formulaic content since it was done fairly well (heck, it's the genre). So, I'm going to err on the side of positiveness and rate it at a Very Good 4 stars out of 5."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I'm a huge D&D fan and got introduced to Butcher through the Dresden Files series (I'm almost caught up on that series). When I saw Furies, I figured I like Butcher's writing but was skeptical of his ability to pull off his style of writing in a completely new fantasy setting. Boy was I wrong. With Furies of Calderon, he sets the stage for a world where different races rule parts of the world (ala Lord of the Rings). The barbarian Marats rule the plains, while the Fury wielding Alerans rule the valley and most of the continent, etc. What's interesting is that each race has subraces and the interplay between the lead characters makes for a fantastic storyline full of heroism, political intrigue, love, and frienships. The rules for the world are relatively straightforward, but in true Butcher style, his weaving of the tale is anything but. I'll admit, some of his characters (e.g., the ruthless Kord or the regal Emperor Gaius are stereotypical) but his use of them is not. Once I got warmed up to his new world and some of the lead characters, by the 20th page or so, this became a real page turner for me. I thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"This took me a little longer to get into, compared to Butcher's Dresden Files Series (which I love, by the way). It's a whole new world, and it took a little getting used to the fury thing. But once I got used to them, it was easy to really get into the book. The characters had a lot of depth and were likeable, even the bad ones."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I really wasn't able to get into \\"Furies,\\" even though from all the reviews I read, it was right up my alley. Even now, a week after I dropped it, I don't care what happens to the characters. They happen to be in mortal peril where I left off, but I don't care. I'm sure they'll make it out, but even if they don't, whatever. If I don't like the characters in a book, I find it really hard to engage.I think my problem with this book was that the author drops you right into the middle of the action. You don't start with a character and get some backstory: you get a character who's in a predicament and using her power (which you don't understand yet) to get out of it. The author doesn't introduce you to his world so much as he plunges you into the middle of it and expects you to pick up the details as you go along. The magic in this book isn't complicated, but because you don't feel connected to the main characters, it's unimpressive at best.I took this book back to the library after about two weeks of ignoring it, having not finished reading it and absolutely not caring what happens next."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"Having read the first book in this series, I will definitely seek out the others, but my approval of Jim Butcher's \\"other\\" fantasy series is tinged with a note of caution. I love Butcher's Dresden Files series. One of the most enjoyable aspects of that is the way those plots go at breakneck pace, with perils popping up at every turn. This works well in the \\"real world\\" setting of Chicago.Butcher has created a unique and interesting world in his Codex Alera series, peopled it with interesting and engaging characters and spun a tale to delight and wonder the most hard-core fantasy fan. The setting is quasi-Roman and the barbarians are at the gates! Magic is done by controlling elemental \\"furies\\" of wood, water, earth, fire and air. Butcher's most compelling hero is Tavi, a young man who is coming of age without having mastered a \\"fury\\". Lacking magic, he must rely on his wits and his courage.There is plenty in this premise but Butcher gives us a generous portion of more: Amara, a young Imperial agent on her first mission, Bernard, Tavi's uncle--still grieving over the death of his wife, Bernard's sister Isana, powerful in magic but unsettled by her spinster status. The villains are equally believable and compelling.My main complaint is that in sections, the story seems forced, as if the author feels he must push along at the breakneck pace of the Dresden Files. Generally speaking a author should err along the lines of more story rather than less, but a plot should be driven by the characters. At some crucial points, the author lost my suspension of disbelief in his story because I felt that when the barbarians are literally at the gates of the fortress, and there are fires burning within the walls, an aerial attack coming in, etc., etc. etc. -- this is not the time for hanky-panky in a storehouse with the victim playing hide-and-seek with her kidnapper. The two compelling stories somehow undermined one another."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"This is my first Jim Butcher book, and it will be my last.

Something of a ripping yarn and for the most part it keeps you hooked. The Dresden files it is not.It a shade similair to George RR Martin's Song of Ice and Fire series. Although without the long, depressing parts and more sorcery. Also Mr. Butcher's characters careen through one cliff hanging situation after the other. George Martin has the nerve to kill off favorite characters; whereas the heroes of Calderon always manage to scrape through, with a last minute 'lucky thrust' from an unexpected source. I half expected to read 'and with one almighty bound Ginger was free.' They really did have one desperate life or death escape after another. The expletive favored by the characters is 'Crows!' This may be a small homage to Mr. Martin's work as the crow motif is widely sprinkled throughout the Ice and Fire saga.The concept of people having 'furies' elemental spirits that aid them in daily life, is well handled and made for an interesting set of circumstances. Like having a whole 'other' cast of players, without them needing to speak, only 'be'.The whole sequence where our teenage, furyless hero interacts with the Marat, a tribe of wild cannibals, that suddenly develop manners and a political sensibility is very contrived. A huge suspension of disbelief to swing that one.But overall a good read that does not disapoint. Not an instant classic, but enjoyable. The ending is way too neat, everyone living happily ever after, smiling monarch, noble savage, wounds all healed etc. Some dark doings to set up book two, but a little too sugary.Borrow it from the library, or get the paperback."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"To begin, I will not compare this series to the Dresden Files. The two series are meant to be completely different and it is unfair to the author to create an association between them.I did not enjoy this book. The writing is overly verbose, distracting from the plot, and tedious. The action takes 200 pages to develop, and even then, barely anything has happened.Also, I can't get over the fact the the character Fade is a poor imitation of George R.R. Martin's character Hodor from A Song Of Ice And Fire. Butcher also uses the name Valerian, also from Martin's series.If you're looking for good fantasy, this isn't it."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I read this book about a month ago, and I have a difficult time recalling the story line. What I do remember, however, is that the author likes to use some of the same descriptive phrases frequently, which makes me grind my teeth at a certain point.I thought the world Butcher created has potential. The characters seem stiff and un-convincing, but that may change after he has some time with them over the next few books. I wouldn't buy another in this series, but I would check them out of the library."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"If you love fantasy, you have to read this series. The Dresden Files were good, the Codex Alera is Great."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"Jim Butcher, author of The Dresden Files, also has a less well known series called Codex Alera. After reading the first book of this series, Furies of Calderon, I can see why it is less well known. That is not to say that it was a bad book, or badly written. It just wasn't as good or as original as his other series. Fans of Butcher will likely place it high on a pedastel and worship it next to his other works, but surprise surprise, I did find a few things in it to complain about.Furies of Calderon begins with Amara, a trainee taking her final test to become a Cursor, agent of the crown. Her test: recover intelligence on a gathering army of rebels. Things go awry when her mentor and trusted father figure turns out to be in league with the rebels and she must flee for her life with what little information she was able to gather. She is ordered to the Calderon Valley because ... to do her best to throw a wrench into the works of the rebels.Upon arriving she meets up with the young boy Tavi, who is remarkable in his complete lack of Furies, elemental spirits that everyone has at least one of. After a night of misadventure fleeing hostile elemental spirits in a storm they make it back to Tavi's home where his aunt and uncle have taken in nearby farmers against the next storm that is building. Unfortunately the rebels have come under the guise of travelers caught in the storms, seeking Amara, and anyone that may have seen the Marat, outland savages, poking around the valley.After fleeing into the storm from the rebels, everyone gets seaparated. Bernard, Tavi's Uncle, and Amara find their way to Garrison where they rouse the army and prepare to defend against an invasion of Marat and rebels. Tavi is taken by the Marat, and makes peace with them through young adult fantasy cliche #4, and everything comes together in a big battle where the Marat clans turn against one another due to Tavi's influence. The attack is averted, but the rebel inciters escape with the only evidence that implicates the lord behind the rebellion.The good? This book has an extremely good beginning. It did everything right. I'm going to make a few comparisons here between Furies of Calderon and The Demon King by Cinda Williams Chima because Furies of Calderon is a study in how to begin a book, and The Demon King is a study in how NOT to begin a book. Furies had likeable characters with real motivation, emotions, reactions and problems, The Demon King did not. Furies had an excellently crafted beginning that quickly laid out how magic works, the current political climate, the conflict of the story, and introduced the characters and their motivations, The Demon King did not. Furies had real emotion, and a colorful world that was laid out for us a stroke at a time as the action progressed. The Demon King dumped all of the info at the beginning in an emotionless boring jumble that was impossible to read through or care about. All in all, this is the perfect way to start off a book of young adult fantasy. The characters are introduced and made likable, their motivations are made clear, the conflict is introduced perfectly, and the world is not explained to us in encyclopedia form, but rather through the interaction between different characters, and through characters interacting with the world. I'd go so far as to call this beginning pure genius, because it was done so perfectly.The ending is also extremely good. There is a very tense battle that takes up the last 25% or so of the book. It's full of real tension, a lot of plot lines converge in a rather spectacular fashion, and the characters are not immune from danger, as all of them are horribly wounded throughout the course of the fight. The plans of the enemy are foiled, but the bad guys get away. It's a perfect lead in to the next entry in the series, and just enough of things are left unsaid to make a reader want to continue on to the next book. Also, Butcher did not resort to the Dues Ex Machina solution I was cringing in expectation of, instead letting things play out more realistically in a loss for the character that might have suddenly saved the day through the timely introduction of new powers. Very well done *claps*. It has always been a failing of the fantasy genre that characters will win by the power of Dues Ex Machina, and to see an author not take that route when it would have been very easy for him to was quite refreshing.The world itself is very well crafted. The politics are sound and well implemented, the magic system is intriguing and original, and the history manages to be interesting while only being brushed over here and there in conversation. Butcher is really a master of world building and it shows spectacularly in this book. He manages to build up his world, the history, the magic, the politics and everything that go with them without ever--not even once--actually telling us anything about them right out. But by the end of this book, you know them all inside and out. THAT is talent. So Cinda Williams Chima can suck it hardcore.The bad? This book did such a good job of world building, starting things off, introducing everything, and wrapping things up that I almost hate to say anything bad about it. The problem is that it does have one or two glaring problems. The middle of this book draaaaaaags something terrible, and it took me a while to figure out why. There are two reasons that I could identify, probably more if I really dug into it. First of all, after the initial introduction of the characters and their motivations, they all sort of fade into their respective stereotypes. They start out very well defined and then they go a bit bland and lose some of their personality, only to find it again for the big ending. Yes, I know it sounds like I'm nitpicking here, but these characters started out so well that it really put me off to see them fade into the background a bit as events washed over them.The second glaring problem I saw with this book was the pacing. IT NEVER STOPS RUNNING!!! There is not a single quiet moment in this entire book. It is action from start to finish. You can't keep everything racing from beginning to end. The characters AND the reader need a few calm and quiet moments tossed in to collect their thoughts and examine what's going on. When there's nothing but action, it can ruin a story as surely as bad writing can. A story needs its moments of calm as much as it needs good, likeable characters, and an interesting plot.On top of those, there were a few really bad uses of cliche, and the reasons for everything going down in the Calderon Valley were very lame. Everyone just goes way out of their way to get to it so everything can happen there, but there's no real point to it. There aren't any real reasons given for the fact that everyone suddenly wants to claim a valley in the ass end of nowhere that isn't important in the slightest bit, and no one in the kingdom proper would even notice if it was gone from the realm. Why this valley is important, and why everything happens here are never really explained in very good detail. To use a Star Wars reference, it's like half of Episode 1 taking place on Tatooine simply because it was a popular location in a previous movie. There was really no point to going there, much less to spending half the movie there. The characters simply went because the writer wanted them to, not because there was any real reason.In conclusion, this book had a great beginning, a great ending, and the stuff between was ok, but not great. It wasn't BAD, but when you compare it to the rest of the book the contrast is rather distracting. To see something start off so great and then languish into blandness shows me that the writer does have great talent, but kind of phoned in the middle of the book rather than putting some real effort into it. It was still a very enjoyable book, and I do plan to read the rest of the series, but it wasn't good enough for me to clear my schedule and read on right now.I'm giving this book 3 stars. It wasn't the best book I've ever read, and it certainly wasn't the worst. It was simply ok. \\"Simply ok\\" is fine, but it seems rather cheap when Butcher showed us in this same book how good and how bad he can be at times and the contrast is what makes it \\"simply ok\\" rather than great. It could have been so much better had the middle of the book held up to the beginning and the ending. Had the middle been better paced, or the beginning and end been a bit duller so that the contrast was no so great I'd likely have tossed in another star to the rating, but Butcher showed us IN THE SAME BOOK how much better he can do than he did with the middle, and for that he loses points."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I'm all for rare book dealers making a reasonable profit.

Butcher says that this is the stuff he always wanted to write, and that the Harry Dresden tales were just what he managed to get published first...Well, maybe he started writing these when he was 15, and now is publishing them when his momentum from the Dresden Files has created a readership? Because this is far weaker work. The Codex Alera characters are a bit flat, the pace is so non-stop that there is no contrast of mood, and the wise guy humor that makes Dresden so appealing is nowhere to be found. \\"Furies\\" is so earnest it hurts.Other problems with the story - there are far too many moments when a character will demonstrate incredible cleverness and insight one moment, followed by total stupidity/lack of judgment the next - just when it is handy for developing the next crisis in the plot. That just does not cut it! I lost my suspension of disbelief (which was sorely needed at a lot of points) more than once because of that.And there is just a bit too much of the bad luck and overwhelming odds getting piled higher and deeper before the good guys pull the fat out of the fire. ALL the crises are just TOO desperate. There goes the suspension of disbelief again... A reader is NOT supposed to get 3/4 of the way through a battle, and have to roll their eyes.All in all, I am sad to say that this is rather average sword and sorcery writing. If I did not have all the other books of the series piled in front of my nose, I would not read any more of them. But they are, so what the hey, I will probably read them. I do wonder what happens at the end."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"This was the worst of the Alera novels.I didn't care about Bernard or his Girlfriend, but the next are worth it.So suck it up, even at his worst Butcher is still entertaining."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"Very interesting.

GreenAlera is a land where all it's citizens possess furies, beings of elemental power such as water, earth, metal and metal, that is for all except one, Tavi. Tavi is a young boy living in a outpost, without even a weak fury to aid him (furies are used for all tasks from healing, hunting and fighting). Tavi stumbles across Amara, a young spy while she is on a mission and later across barbarians. Quickly he becomes embroiled in magic, war and intrigue. And that's just the beginning.Okay, the synopsis could have been better, but you can find a nice neat one on Amazon.com.Jim Butcher is one of my favorite authors, his books have an abundance of action and well UMPH. I have yet to read a book by him that didn't have me trembling and eager to turn the next page or buy the next book. And Furies of Calderon is no exception.Furies of Calderon is the first book of his Codex of Alera series (I have reviewed First Lord's Fury as well, the final book). Jim Butcher has once again created a fascinating world full of richly defined characters. He has modeled Alera on the Roman Empire and tossed in magical and fantastical elements, from men that bond with beasts to giant talking wolves (found in book 2, Academ's Fury no it isn't a spoiler I swear!). The magical system and how he has made the society dependent on it is also well-thought out. The fact that the hero himself doesn't have such powers and has to rely on his own wits while dealing with prejudice and people nearly infinitely more power than he is himself also makes this not your classic fantasy story.It is a relief to actually read a book where the hero isn't all powerful, but instead has to be clever and has to think, use his resources and what skills he has on his own to overcome his problems and obstacles.The secondary characters and the history of the world are also incredibly laid out and leave you wanting to learn more.Overall this is a solid book that leaves you eager for more, and this is one of the rare series where each book in it is just as good if not better. It gives you everything you could want in the series, war, magic, romance, action, intrigue, mystery, epic battles, clever flawed heroes and terrifying villains.Furies of Calderon and the Codex Alera are must reads if you like the fantasy genre, and then even if you don't."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"A great book and a great series. jim butcher likely the most talented and entertaining writer i have ever come across."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I read this series as a recommendation by a friend that got me hooked on The Dresden Files. I confess, Jim Butcher is my favorite author presently. His webweaving of a mastered plotline is unlike any other I have found, and I love reading a good book. The Codex Alera is an ingenious concept, based on a silly challenge between Butcher and another author. (Seriously, YouTube his explanation during his Q&A; sessions; it's just hilarious how he comes up with some ideas yet fascinating). This obviously is in the fantasy theme much like Lord Of The Rings, however Butcher doesn't try to bore us with medieval or romantic character peformances; instead, they're more modern and stylish, providing fantastic humor and relatively volatile portrayals of virtue, politics, and heroics.Tavi of Calderon is a character that never stops becoming more brutal and worthwhile. By book six--(\\"First Lord's Fury\\")--he is just something else; like Hercules, or Thor. He starts out in \\"Furies of Calderon\\" in a Frodo-like fashion, but by book three he is more like Aragorn, King Arthur, or Julius Caesar. His development is spellbinding and always on-target. The rest of the characters are just dessert to the main course. If this mastered crafting of a story isn't enough to enrobe you, enchant you, and enthrall you, then certainly the humor and nowaday-stylish witticisms will ignite your taste buds.\\"The Furies of Calderon\\" is a retro beginning to an unbelievably satisfying fantasy series. Let me add this in there: \\"Araris Valerian rocks!\\" My favorite character ever... All the characters will marvel you, and the story's daring, unprecedented firepower will certainly rival anything else you've found out there in the fantasy genre. I'm happy to know Jim Butcher works vigorously day and night on writing his fiction, otherwise I couldn't think of a better reason to read."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"This is one of the best fantasy series I've read in a long time. It took me awhile to get to it--blame Butcher for that as I've been busy reading his excellent Dresden books. But while the Dresden series is great, it is also more episodic and limited in scope. This isn't. In the grand tradition, this is an epic, a sprawling fantasy. Unlike some (Robert Jordan comes to mind), though, it is tightly written and suspenseful all the time. Indeed, it comes as close to \\"can't put it down,\\" as a book can come. The characters are engaging, the action non-stop and the political intricacies frustrating--as politics usually are. Butcher creates a new world I am eager to explore here. I'm through #3, and every one has been just as good."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I finished the first two Dresden books while on vacation because I simply read them too fast, which is always a good problem to have. So luckily for me I went to the closest book store only to find out they didn't have Dresden book two, BUT they had book one of his other series. Curious. Once you start the book, meet all the characters and figure out the world you're hooked. Atleast I was, I've since gone on to read book two which is just as good.Fans of fast moving high fantasy or Jim Butcher should pick up this series!"},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"First of all, I am a little confused by someone calling this book \\"misogynist\\". Not really sure where that came from, but it seems to me that someone is a little sensitive. One of the main characters is a female who outranks most of the men and is a good little warrior at that. Sure, there are moments that soldiers throw out crude comments and there is a bad guy who mistreats women. If it was misogynist, though, these activitites would have been treated as acceptable but they weren't. I am a female and I am not offended by this book in any way. I thought it was a fantastic read and I love the characters. I can't wait to read the rest of the series! :)"},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I just now finished this first book of Butcher's Alera series. I did enjoy it for the most part, and it is a real page turner. It's just that there are some contrived imperfections in the protagonists that prevent them from succeeding all the time as they could, and should, given their enormous powers via their furies.I note that the furies of the villains never tire in battles, but those of the heroes do, and battles are lost due to this discrepancy. Did Butcher overlook this inconsistency? Don't know. It kept the narrative going instead of having the hero/heroine win easily as logic would seem to dictate, so there is that. Can't have a planned multi-book series end so quickly.The other nit I have to pick is with the continuous reluctance of the main female character, the Cursor Amara, to inform her allies of info she has come into possession of which would also turn the tide of battle and planning to her side. She keeps getting herself further into trouble by doing this, and she has no need to keep stuff close to the vest if her goal is really to survive and save the innocent folks. Very frustrating. As another reviewer noted, this leads to multiple instances of the protagonists getting beaten/stabbed/killed, over and over again. Bad things happening to good people ad nauseum.So it's another book, like Redick's \\"The Ruling Sea\\", that imposes untoward and implausible self-limitations upon the heroes/protagonists in order to keep them from winning easily over the bad guys. The bad guys have no such limitations imposed upon them, are seemingly smarter, and definitely ruthless in pursuing victory. In one on one matchups with the villains, sans the author's handcuffing of the heroes, the latter would prevail all the time. Their furies make them immensely powerful, almost superhuman, yet they keep losing to the bad guys.Plus the ruler of Alera is so powerful and has so many forces that he could have swooped in and wiped out he attacking hordes easily, as apparently happened fifteen years in the past. But Amara chooses not to bother him and so thousands die. Huh?But, I'm sticking with it. The ending is the traditional feel good, rewards to the heroes kind of ending I like. My assumption is that Butcher is going to dispense with the self limitations of the good guys/gals and let them fight the good fight with their full powers. Except for Tavi, the main male hero in making, who has no powers. At this time anyway."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I am a huge fan of Butcher's \\"The Dresden Files\\". He has created a fantastic character in Harry and it's the charm of Harry that helps smooth out some of the rough edges with the rest of the series.The same is true of the first of the Codex Alera books. I found Tavi to be a winning, endearing character and, from very early in the book, I really cared about him and wanted him to succeed. I liked that he was emotional and sensitive and I especially liked that he was resourceful. The idea of a character without furies who lives in a world defined by furycrafting is a concept I found very appealing. This makes Tavi something of an unconventional character in the realm of fantasy. Sure, he is at the center of events that threaten the future safety of his world, but this does not mean that he comes into awesome powers that make him nigh impossible to kill. Instead, he has to rely on his wits rather than brute strength or awesome furycrafting powers.I'm not always fond of Butcher's female characters, but, for the most part, I liked the women in this novel. I initially wrote Odiana off as a sort of typical villain, but I was pleased to find that Butcher gave her facets I hadn't anticipated. Isana was also nicely drawn. Amara, though, is certainly the most well-rounded female character in the book. She is very believable as a capable, strong, and brave women who still sometimes finds herself frightened by the events unfolding before her. The biggest problem with Butcher's female characters, though, is the sort of misguided chivalry he shows them. The men in general tend to be pretty sexist, and whenever a capable female is in their presence, they are compelled to sneer and say, \\"But she's just a girl!\\" Maybe this is a device on Butcher's part, intended to show that his female characters overcome the obstacles before them. Still, it struck me as annoying that the male character automatically assume that the female characters are inferior, especially when there are so many examples of powerful women in the novel.All in all, Butcher has created an interesting world that is people with various creatures and cultures, most of which I found to be well-realized. I found the concept of furies and furycrafting to be an interesting change for the sword and sorcery-type fantasy, and I also liked the pseudo-Roman world in which the novel takes place.What I did not like were the villains. I didn't think that Fidelias and his cohorts were interesting enough to have chapters devoted to them and, moreover, I thought it would likely be more interesting if the reader didn't know exactly what they were planning. I found Aldrick particularly unappealing as he came across as little more than a stock character. The reader learns hardly anything about him, and what is learned about him is very insignificant and doesn't serve to give the reader a real sense of the character and his motivations.My other real problem with the novel came about during the prolonged ending battle scene. In the interest of not giving any spoilers, I'll simply say that I found it very hard to suspend my disbelief when I found out who had survived and who had not. I think it would have been a lot more interesting if Butcher had made some different choices in that regard.While I did like the book, if I were to recommend a Butcher book to a friend, it would definitely be a Dresden novel over this one."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"So enjoyable!

Order it or download it to your Kindle already! Jim Butcher (IMHO) is likely the most talented author to emerge over the past decade.Book One of the Codex Alera gives you a chapter or two to warm your eyes up, and then Butcher pushes the pedal down and doesn't let up. He lays groundwork for many characters that span most, and in some cases, all 6 books of the series. He does this without being dry (Modesitt, anyone?) or repetitious, and without introducing an undecipherable language or an extraordinarily complex landscape that detracts from the story (a common pitfall in other fantasy series).Another positive: Butcher develops both male & female characters well. Many authors simply cannot pull this off, no matter how hard they try. He seems to have a unique insight into the female persona (Shannon, perhaps?).He's able to surprise you a couple of times, too -- sometimes you just don't see it coming -- and that's also rare in the first book of a series.There's a good amount of the dry humor in the story, too, similar to that found in the Harry Dresden series.My *only* complaint is that there was no map of the world in books 1-5. It would have been helpful for reference, especially when you have to read the book over an extended period of time.I really can't say enough about the Codex Alera. I rate it a solid 5 out of 5 stars -- all 6 books. I'll be adding a review for each book as I re-read 1-5 for the third time, and the final book for the second time."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"Typical Jim Butcher writing where you find yourself not being able to put it down, and if you do put it down, you can't wait to pick it back up again. Once you learn the charactors you become drawn in deeper and deeper to each of their story, and wanting to know what's going to happen now, but then you're transferred to another story with every bit as much intensity, and in this book there are quite a few well written and intriging story lives that you travel back to and from, so the whole story is told at the same and right time.

My worries soon disappeared when Butcher took something done before and turned it into his own. The magical system he creates is unique enough that I looked forward to learning how it worked throughout the book.I was surprised to find that Tavi was the only character mentioned in the book description. While he's definitely the main character, as much time was spent on the secondary cast as him. At least in the first book in the series. In book two, he seems to play a larger role.The GoodI already mentioned the magical system.The action sequences were great (mostly). Much of the book keeps the reader on the edge of their seat, a big feat in epic fantasy.We're introduced to a broad cast of characters, each with distinct personality traits, similar to what Butcher brings readers in The Dresden Files. Probably the best aspect of the story was the motives behind these characters' actions. They were realistic and fit the \\"gray area\\" often found in real life. Characters weren't good or bad for no reason, they had grounds for the decisions they made.The BadDrawn out and monotonous scenes were too abundant. This is an element of epic fantasy many writers fight with. Epic fantasy readers want detail, too much detail is better than not enough, but I think the secret is knowing when and where to place this detail.When reading Furies of Calderon, I pictured the Orcs from World of Warcraft when they're in the midst of conversation and say, \\"Ooh! Shiny.\\" I'd be in the middle of a great battle sequence, pumped and curious as to what would happen next... when we're brought almost completely out of the story to discuss a part of characterization that shouldn't be anywhere near that fight sequence. If it was needed at that particular time, Butcher should have found a way to trim the information down, or maybe refer back to information already known to the reader.As mentioned earlier, I already began book two and can tell Butcher's experience with epic fantasy has expanded. He keeps up the suspense even during information dumping periods, and best of all, the information given is pertinent to the situation.I genuinely look forward to reading the next five books in the series, especially if Butcher continues to improve as much as he has in book two."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"Mr. Butcher does a good job with character development and with a \\"magic\\" system. And 80% of the way through the book it probably was 4 star worthy. But the end really fell apart. An epic battle that got a little boring and confusing, and a super cheesy, expected ending lost it at least another star (it ended up more of a 2 1/2 to be honest). Let me put it this way. I might read the next book if I really can't find anything to read, and I really want something to read. That's a lot of qualifiers."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"This is one of the few series I can think of where each book is a good, solid addition. Each book has a satisfying ending (it doesn't feel like a chain of to-be-continued), yet the plot of each book builds upon the previous ones. I often thought \\"oh I know where this is going,\\" but the author frequently surprised me.This book actually isn't one of my favorites in the series. By itself, I'd give it 4 starts, but I feel like the series is so strong that it's worth giving this first book a little extra generosity. If you like the book sample, you'll like the rest of the book. If you read this book and think it's pretty good but not great, I encourage you to give the next one a shot."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"As the title of my review says, this is the beginning of an outstanding fantasy series with an engaging system of magic and lots of intrigue.(Spoilers - general ones, anyway - ahead)The books are set in a heavily Roman-influenced nation called Alera. The population is able to control the elements via the command of elementals called furies. Besides having control over the six elements themselves (earth, water, air, fire, metal and wood), each type of fury offers up ability with other less-obvious forms of magic: emotions (fire and earth), healing (water), stealth (wood), speed (air)... The majority of people have some minor-to-moderate ability with one or maybe two of the elements, while the nation's high lords can command massive numbers of all the furies. In addition to direct offense and personal enhancements, furycraft can be combated by a particular element's opposing fury; an earthcrafter is unable to call his or her fury if he's not in contact with the ground, for example.(I'm outlining the magic system because it's what initially drew me into the books. It has flavors of many other stories, but it's uniquely done and extremely well-developed...and I found it completely fascinating!)Anyway, enter Tavi. He's probably the only kid his age in the whole country who has no furies at all. Living on the frontier with his stern-but-goodhearted aunt and uncle, he's learned to rely on his not-insignificant intelligence and tenacity and the abilities we all can cultivate. When a deadly storm and a chance encounter with the neighboring Marat - a barbarian race that substitutes connections with animal totems and physical prowess for furycraft - Tavi has to rely on those abilities to stay afloat as everything falls apart.If you're a fan of fantasy, I highly recommend this book. Actually, the whole series; the book was terrific enough that I bought the rest that were available at the time and was thrilled to find out that they get better and better. The magic system is intriguing, but I'm not just recommending the book based on that; Furies of Calderon is exciting and fast-paced with superb character development, and while it stands alone, it also sets up this wonderful world for the continuing fate of Alera. All the power struggles and political intrigue and integrity challenges make for a very entertaining read."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"This book is a great introduction to a riveting and page turning 6 book series!

If the characters would only stop doing the old \\"now I must go do something noble\\" routine (say this in the same voice that John Stewart does his queen of England imitation), it would relieve some of the sugary sweetness. There were so many parts of this book that had me rolling my eyes with the unrelenting triteness. Blech. Characters are one dimensional. Every bad guys either beats children and abuses women or else is an incompetent coward. Every good guy is ridiculously noble. Painful.Because this is Jim Butcher, I read the second book and it got a bit better -- plot points that were begun in this first book were added too in a good way. Triteness level is down a bit.

Yes, that is how thin I thought it was. Sorry, Mr. Butcher."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I don't normally read fantasy of this type, which appears to be inspired by bad dreams engendered from a night of playing Worlds of Warcraft and eating mediocre pizza. My taste runs to more classic, literary stuff (Tolkien, Peake, Lindsay, Eddison, Dunsany, etc.), but on a whim I wanted to see what contemporary genre fantasy was like. I chose this book because of a strange coincidence: the main character's name, Tavi, is my own son's nickname (his formal name is Octavio). Not only that, but his uncle's name--Bernard--is the name my wife and I were GOING to name Tavi before we change our minds at the last minute.Butcher's Tavi is indeed a likeable character, a refreshing change from the usual blustering hero, a bit Frodo-ish without the weight. I found the concepts of Furies, the elementals that folk here have (sort of counterpart to the daemons in Pullman's Dark Materials) to be intriguing, though they're really only used in battle. Oddly, Tavi and his uncle are the only ones who appear to be engaged in any kind of work activity; they're shepherds. You'd think with all these nifty Furies around they'd be able to cook up some really peachy lifestyle stuff, but I guess they lack the imagination to do so. Again, this is straight out of Magic the Gathering or whatever.(spoiler alert!)Butcher creates a whole class of orc-like villains, sort of a combination of demonized Native Americans and Klingons, or something like that. Later in the story he tries to humanize them some more, but either he shouldn't have done this at all, or he should have taken it farther. Tavi has a psychedelic mind-meld with one of them, who turns out to be a girl, and if they weren't being chased by evil, giant spiders in a huge pit of wax (huh?), they might have even consummated their species-crossing love right there. Too bad.Anyway, the pace was pretty good, and though not great literature I got through the first two-thirds of the book fine. Then we hit The Battle. Of course, we all know The Battle is coming. What we don't know is that The Battle lasts longer than the wizard fight scene in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. And it's filled with the same phrases over and over: He swallowed. A casual flick of the wrist. Crows peck out their eyes. Vast hordes. Again. Please, pass me the remote!I did like the very end though, when Tavi found chasing after lost sheep more interesting than getting a reward from the King himself. Now that's my kind of hero!"},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"First I should mention that I bought the first two books together with the third coming out a couple of weeks later. I read the first two straight through and that may be why I don't have many complaints. I've read all the books currently out and I like each one better than the last. It's difficult for me to rate them separately because I read the first three very close together.A lot of the complaints I've read in other reviews aren't an issue later on. For example, I didn't like the 15 year old Tavi (main hero) all that much myself, but each book takes place a couple of years after the last one. This helps the characters grow a lot and have more depth and maturity. In fact, I actually had forgotten about some of my earlier annoyances until I read some of the negative reviews.However, I also have to agree with other reviewers that if you're looking for another Harry Dresden then go somewhere else. This is not the same at all and you will be disappointed. I happen to have read Harry Dresden only because I read these books first and I was almost disappointed in the Dresden books (which I now love). I really wish Jim Butcher had decided to use a different pen names for the two series similar to Nora Roberts & J.D. Robb or Michelle West & Michelle Sagara (& sometimes Michelle Sagara West). This would have served as a good warning to expect something different."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"After reading seven books in the \\"Dresden\\" series by Jim Butcher, I started reading the \\"Codex Alera\\" series that begins with \\"Furies Of Calderon\\", set in a fantasy world where magic is wielded by people who can influence a personal elemental fury that are everywhere in nature. The young Cursor Amara and the older Cursor Fidelias are assigned by the First Lord to investigate rumors of a rebel military force that's threatening to overthrow the Realm. Their loyalties to each other and the Realm are tested when it becomes obvious that Fidelias has thrown his lot in with the rebels and expected her to the do same. She refused to do so and flees to the Calderon Valley at the First Lord's direction to take command of the garrison as he expects the flash point with the rebels to be there. Meanwhile, young Travis, who possesses no fury and is considered an oddball outside his family, and his uncle Bernard are looking for the sheep that Travis was supposed to bring in the previous night before the storm furies overwhelm the Calderon Valley with lethal weather when they come across a Marat scout (a barbarian people who live in the cold, northern reaches beyond the valley) and they barely survive the confrontation. Amara and Travis's fates are intertwined as they unravel the rebel's conspiracy to bring a hoard of Marat warriors into the Valley as an attempt to destabilized the Realm and force out the First Lord in the Senate to set up a new government. Amara takes charge of the garrison to withstand the assault of the first attack with the help of Bernard, and Travis convinces a Marat leader through a personal challenge of honor by saving his daughter that the conflict was a mistake. The fantasy world is consistent and a lot different than I expected it to be, the characters are as interesting as the conflicts that they find themselves thrown into, and the humor is where it's supposed to be. My only complaint with the book is that the series might get too Harry Potter-ish as the First Lord has granted Travis's request to enter the Academy to become a Cursor. Or maybe I'm being too cynical about the future direction of the series without waiting for the next book."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"Ever wondered what it would be like to have command over even one of the elementals? Enter a world in which the elementals, called furies, are a part of every day life for everyone except one boy....Tavi lives with his aunt and uncle, Bernard and Isana, at Bernard's Steadholt. A moment of carelessness with the family's sheep leaves him as a witness to the probable invasion by the Marat, the brutal enemies of the Aleran people. Tavi has no furies to call and will have to rely only on his wits and the support of his family and friends. Meanwhile, Amara is a young Cursor completing her graduation exercise who is about to become heavily embroiled in the upcoming drama. Together, Amara, Tavi, and a cast of others will try to protect Alera from the war that is soon to come.FURIES OF CALDERON is a very well-developed fantasy novel. The characters are believable and show great depth. Most of the characters are neither fully evil nor completely good but rather demonstrate the many layers that are present in all of humankind. Tavi and Amara are particularly interesting as both are young, brave, and determined to do the right thing. Secondary characters such as Odiana and Fidelias provide many thought-provoking scenarios as the story unfolds. Perhaps the only really evil character is Kord who displays no redeeming characteristics whatsoever but is sure to invoke very strong feelings in the reader. Jim Butcher is to be commended for his phenomenal character development as he has created characters one will want to continue reading more about.The concept of the furies and their powers displays the superb genius of Jim Butcher. The unique ways each elemental is used in the various furycraftings keeps the reader guessing as to the outcome of the story. The action doesn't really kick in until the story has had time to develop but once the action starts, the reader should buckle up for the roller coaster ride ahead! FURIES OF CALDERON is the start of yet another fantastic series by the creative talent of Jim Butcher and one readers should definitely not miss out on.COURTESY OF CK2S KWIPS AND KRITIQUES"},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I discovered this series after reading another series by Butcher, the Dresden files. This book will appeal to fantasy readers of all ages. In a world that resembles a cross between ancient Rome and Avatar: The Last Airbender, the people of Alera wield the powers of earth, water, air, fire, metal, and wood against their foes. Enter Tavi, a young boy who is considered a freak, possessing absolutely no power (called furycrafting) of his own. However, Tavi becomes an unlikely hero as his home is threatened by an old enemy. Relying only on his wits and the help of friends new and old, Tavi sets out to stop this threat, and becomes caught up in a struggle for the realm itself. Featuring intrigue, action, memorable characters, and the power of furycrafting, this is one series that should not be missed."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"The Dresden Files were awesome. This book was pretty close, but, and I can't believe I'm saying this - it was almost too fast-paced. In fact, the only problem I saw with this book was the pacing. It never slows down; I cannot recall a single moment of quiet reflection in this entire book. With an interesting plot such as this, though, I was able to read it quickly - and don't get me wrong, it was a satisfying read - it's just that it was a little exhausting from the reader's perspective too.But all in all, I wouldn't have any trouble recommending it to any fan of Dresden."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I bought this while on vacation, on the glowing recommendation of one of the bookstore employees. Fortunately, I bought two other books as well, both continuations of other series: A Clash of Kings (good stuff, gorgeous detailed world) and Ender in Exile (Oh, how I envy you if you haven't read \\"Ender's Game\\"! Run, don't walk, and snatch it up. Now, THERE'S a yarn! This was a worthy continuation of the series--and don't make the mistake that books concerning children are children's books. Oh, no no NO!).I started Calderon first...and put it down. Read the other two: yum, satisfying! Then bit back into Calderon. Meh.Well, it's certainly not the worst thing I've ever read, and I did stick with it til the end, so a modicum of interest was generated. But Lord, it's formulaic. After a while, I was identifying every character by their archetype instead of their name...\\"Oh, look, here's plucky-but-misunderstood-youngster-who'll-save-the-day. Accompanied by hulking-moron-that-everybody-discounts-but-who-will-save-the-day. Seems they've encountered overly-prickly-pseudo-enemy-who-will-become-friend...\\" The Reluctant Hero. The Emperor. The Tragic Anti-Hero. The Trickster. Yup, they're pretty much all here, and they're all made of cardboard. It's a bad sign when one starts correctly predicting the future in the book by the archetypes: \\"Hmm, things are getting calmer, about time for Over-the-top-EEEVIIILL-Dude to show back up....yep, here he is!\\"None of the characters were developed enough to invest in. Plenty of descriptions of action...after a while, I started skipping over large sections of it: \\"Whatever...whatever...okay, they win, movin' on...\\" But a paucity of actual character development...and if the characters aren't developed enough for you to care about them, why should you care about their fancy battle scenes?And for crying out loud, WHAT is the author's thing with CROWS?!? Nearly every exclamation was \\"Crows!\\", in addition to gobs of crow imagery. You can't throw a rock in this book without hitting a crow. The place must have a terribly unbalanced ecosystem if they've got so many bloody crows. The repetitive exclamations reminded me of those tedious novels whose characters drop F-bombs in every other sentence, as if that made them \\"edgy\\"...but their constant overuse of the word simply renders it into meaningless, annoying noise. If you want a word to mean something, save it for special occasions, guys. And use more than one word; show some creativity! Sheesh.So, yeah, I finished it; I kept hoping the end would be worth the investment, but...not so much. What with all the archetypes I'd already correctly guessed the ending, no surprises; so I won't be looking up the rest of the series. It's the literary equivalent of a puffed rice cake: crunchy, but tasteless and unsatisfying. You can do much better with your reading time than this; how about Moon's Paksennarion series? or the splendiferous Vorkosigan series by Bujold? Check out \\"The Princess Bride\\"--did you know the author was also the screenwriter of the movie? Or go back and gobble some adventure classics you may have missed: The Scarlet Pimpernel, The Prisoner of Zenda, Treasure Island, The Call of the Wild...there's plenty of good stuff out there, and the true old classics have free downloads on FeedBooks. Nestle into your comfy chair, wrap yourself around a copy of Kipling's \\"Kim\\", and get a load of how to properly write archetypes (plus a fascinating lesson on historical cultural assumptions). Honestly...you can do better than this. Life's too short to waste reading mediocrity."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I have to guess since you are looking at a review of this book, the first in a series of six, you have not read any of the others in the series yet. That is good, you definitely need to start here.I have decided to review the whole series, I noticed some people in other reviews , did not love this book, however, if you keep going after reading this book, I know you will find it as much fun as I did.I actually liked this first book, a lot, but not as much as the other books in the series. One book was better than the book before it, and taken as a whole, this is one of the best fantasy series I have read.I loved all of the characters,and this first book is actually a coming of age story. I found myself getting attached to all the characters, even some of that \\"bad\\" ones, and I was so glad I had not started the series until all the books were out. That way I could just keep going book after book, which is what I did. I could not quit reading until I had finished all six books. I found myself tearing through the pages, even the battle scenes, on the edge of my seat through the books.For someone who reads Mr. Butcher's Harry Dresden books, and finds they like urban fantasy more than regular fantasy, I think you would still really enjoy this series. Mr. Butcher made them easily accessible to people who might not normally read fantasy books. The world that these books take place in is really interesting, but the stories are so character driven, you can't help but be caught up in their stories. For others who read a lot of fantasy, I think you too would love these books. There are plenty of fantasy elements that would appeal to you.All in all, I so enjoyed this series, I kept the books on my Kindle ,which is what I do when I know that it is a book I would like to read again. Read this series, it is a must read!!"},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"There's a lot I really liked about this book. It starts off with a bang by introducing a fabulous Roman-esque world with some neat twists on fantasy magic. But the book never really explores all that good stuff. We're introduced to it, and then immediately plunged into action scene after action scene, culminating in a mammoth (and eventually unrealistic) battle. Don't get me wrong: I love action scenes. But I would have liked them better had the story had a little more character context and a little more world exploration under its belt first. Three and a half stars and I'll be tentatively checking out the sequel, hoping for more of the good stuff and less of the bad."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"Once you begin this book, it does not take long to get obsessed. Though this book does serve as a self-contained story, the characters and setting are so interesting that one cannot help but be tempted to tear right into the second book, then the third, then the fourth... It is well worth your time! FOR CALDERON! FOR ALERA!"},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"Hadn't read Butcher before (probably have to try the Dresden files) but picked up this series first.Overall the concept is good, but definitely a bit derivative and lacking polish in this first book. Probably more at the level of a lesser Feist book than really great fantasy. Probably worthy of a 3 and 1/2 star rating, but since the next two were better and are closer to 4's, I'm gonna have to round this one down."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I loved the Dresden Files series, and was very pleased to get my hands on \\"Furies\\". I found the world to be fully-realized and intriguing, and I'm looking forward to the next book . . . however, unlike some fantasy series, this first book is very satisfying in and of itself, without just being a 'buy-the-next-one-to-find-out-what-happens' cliffhanger. Highly recommended :)"},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"Jim Butcher has said that early on in his writing career he failed at writing \\"sword and horse\\" fantasy novels. This series proves that maybe he hasn't really overcome that failure. His system of magic, furies, is terribly inconsistent, and things are routinely done that goes against the rules that he has laid out. And as he has proven in his better series \\"the dresden files\\" he continues to have absolutely no idea how men and women interact with each other. This deficiency is painfully obvious, and makes men of his intimate dialogue scenes nearly unbearable. Not only that its tough to say whether its an homage or just his writing, but the writers that he claims are influences seem less like influences and more like source material."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"Okay, Anna Karenina it ain't, but this is a damn good fantasy novel. Not excellent. Not outstanding. But just...damn good. The world (a pseudo-Roman fantasy nation) is not overly complex. But it handles its simple customs and peoples well, and the reader is left comforted that s/he is in the hands of an author who would rather create a good but unambitious world than let his story fall apart by overextending the story he's trying to tell with a lot of contrived \\"differences\\". The plotline (simple farming folk overcome deadly assault by outside forces, farmboy-turns-hero, savage people understood, overtones of protest against rich man's greed, etc.) is a bit been-there, done-that...but it's also handled with Butcher's gift for intrigue and suspense. I swear, the man has a God-given gift to glue his reader to the page.Put simply, this is fun. Don't expect any fireworks. Don't expect it to change your outlook on life, or rock your world. It won't do that...but then, it's not really meant to. Butcher handles the old tropes of fantasy with a respect that's almost reverence, something that says to me at least that he knows just what he's doing...he's not trying to disassemble all things fantasy and create a new and shocking whatsit out of the bits and pieces. He's just setting out to tell a good yarn in the old style, with his own personal spin on it. I see nothing wrong with that. Not every new fantasy book has to \\"bring the genre into the modern age\\". Butcher knows that, and he sees the opportunity in creating a book that just offers its reader a good time and good characters to share it with.This is a book for a lazy Sunday or a winter's night. Curl up and enjoy. Recommended highly."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"There's nothing else to say about this book that hasn't already been said. I decided to pick this up after reading the first of the Dresden Files and enjoyed it quite a bit. It does it's job well enough in introducing a new world and the characters are likeable. I'll be reading the rest of the series.One thing bothered me though, just a minor gripe. It seemed like every time Jim wanted to convey uneasiness or anticipation in his characters he would use the action of them, \\"licking their lips\\". It's used so often that I started to laugh about it towards the end of the book."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"Furies of Calderon is just the starting point for this great series.These books weave a wonderful and unique world with characters that you're never quite sure about and never feel false or flat. The traditional take on magic is not used here, but instead people gain their \\"powers\\" from a manifestation of different elemental powers in the form of furies. The world is dependent on furies in their everyday life; to cook, heal, travel, hunt, build, fight, etc.The main character is the only known Aleran to be considered furiless and it would be the equivalent of being born without both your legs in our world. He is looked down upon and considered a freak. He must use his mind and his drive to rise in the world and prove himself. You want him to succeed, you want him to win at everything, and you can't help but cheer for him all along.He is supported by a wide range of characters that really bring home the idea that no one and nothing is truely right or wrong, black or white. The \\"bad guy\\" you can't help but like and understand what he's doing. Some of the \\"good guys\\" you don't necessarily like and wonder if they are all that \\"good.\\" I like that your are constantly re-evaluating your opinion of the characters involved through these books.I will admit that Furies of Caderon unlike the other 4 books (out so far) in the series does take a bit to get into. Butcher has to spend some time setting everything up, but once he has you never stop running.I hope you give them a try and enjoy them as much as I have and will continue to."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"The way Amazon counts your helpful votes now, does not encourage you to write older reviews, but I just had to for this book. If you are like me when you find an exceptional read you want to share it with others. So here I go. I loved this book and the best thing is all of the five books in the series are available. You don't have to wait to get them which is one of my pet peeves. There are so many subplots that you can't get bored and each one is equal so it is like having several great adventures at a time that are all connected. Well I guess you can tell I LOVE THIS SERIES.Tavi has been raised by his aunt and uncle, he is training to be a shepherd so that he can save enough to go to the Acadamy in the capital of Alera. Everyone in Alera can summon magical help from the furies, either earth, sea, wind, or fire. Tavi unfortunately has no furies and at his age he is unlikely to gain any. When his Uncle's holt is attacked by the Marat he is forced into the fray and weird and awful things begin to happen to him, his family, friends, and his country and ruler.Lady Isana is his aunt, she has raised Tavi and we find very quickly that she is a strong woman with lots of secrets. She and Tavi are watched over by a slave with a coward's brand on his face, yet we find he is no coward. I loved the character of Fade and his relationship with Lady Isana and Tavi is enthralling.Amara is a Cursor, a spy for the First Lord, Gaius. She becomes enbroilled in the battle and in Tavi's uncle Bernard. Bernard is an earth mover his furies are of the earth. Amara is a wind furie, she can fly and use wind as a weapon. They are great characters and their attraction adds much needed romance to the first novel.Lord Gaius is alone without an heir, his son Septimus was killed by the Marart at the first Battle of Calderon. He seems to be a very smart man and that is how he stays ahead of those who would take his place.Fidalius was the No. 1 Cursor, until he turned against Gaius, not because he hated him but because he feels that Alera needs a strong leader and new blood. He is a spy and one of the best if not the best. Lord and Lady Aquataine, Lord Kalador, the Canim and the Vord Queens make up just some of the enemies that must be faced.This is a tale by a superb storyteller. A splendid, enthralling, spreading tale with action, romance, and so many surprises. Do not fail to get this one, if you can't afford it, get it from the library, but don't miss it."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"Outstanding book from Butcher in a fantasy setting. I've enjoyed the Dresden Files from Butcher and wanted to give the Furies of Calderon a try. I was cautious how Butcher's style would cross over to a fantasy setting. I'm happy to say I was reall impressed. Butcher delived great fantasy action with an excellent plot and captivating new world."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I decided to try The Furies of Calderon, Jim Butcher's second series after Dresden and the one he originally wanted to write, because it's Jim Butcher, one of my favorite authors, and it's epic fantasy -- what could be wrong with that?Nothing. It was a great book, though it was very long, and felt at times like a chore. Not because it was boring, but just because so much happened, so much information was put out, and it took so very long for the main plot themes to wrap up that the tension was a little wearing. But everything ends well, amazingly enough; the final battle (which takes up more than a hundred pages) was up to Butcher's usual standard of excellence, which I have come to expect, and crave, from the Dresden books.The Furies were okay; it's a nice take on magic, though not exactly an original one (not that a good fantasy series needs to be totally original; I'm not sure a fantasy series can be, considering how many ideas have been put into print in the past), but I particularly liked the Marat. These are the big enemy, the race (non-human, though pretty danged close) that live outside the kingdom of men and which threaten the dominance of the civilized group. They have a great concept for a society that isn't based on technology and knowledge and order, like ours: they follow animal totems, just like the Native Americans they're based on (I assume -- obsidian knives, loincloths, long hair in braids with feathers woven into it, close ties to nature and disdain for modern weapons and those who use them -- what would you think?), but in the case of the Marat, they bond with those animals and become halfway part of their pack or herd or flock. It's an interesting concept, and Butcher gives it a hell of a twist in this book.The writing was great, the characters are excellent on both sides, and the plot was wonderfully done. Definitely going to read on in this series. And try very hard to swallow my envy."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I have been a fan of Jim Butcher's series the Dresden files for years and have been curious about his Codex Alera series for awhile now. But I always held off reading it. Not because the series premise was so different than than the Dresden books (Traditional as opposed to Urban Fantasy) instead I held off because I didn't want to be disappointed. As has happened a few times in the past with beloved authors. So for a long time I have held off reading this series. That is until I read the reviews and comments written by a few people on LibraryThing.Once I started to read this book I became mad at myself for waiting so long to do so. For even though its entirely different that the Dresden novels - tone, location, etc - the story was engaging and the characters endearing. While Harry Dresden and friends ooze sarcasm as if it were their life blood the people of Alera are more subtle in their display of wit and its this subtly that works really well for them. This is especially true for Tavi, a boy who lives a simple life and stands apart from everyone else around him because he isn't attached to one of the elementals who inhabit the world and bond with the people. By necessity Tavi has had to use his wit and intelligence in order to survive. These skills become essential when the quiet valley that he lives in is invaded by a savage race known as the Marat and it is up to him to help protect it along with his Uncle Bernard, Aunt Isana and Amara - a Cursor, an elite spy for the Crown.This book is filled with action and mystery from page one that makes you hurry to turn each page wanting to know what happens next. This book isn't perfect. I felt that there were some inconsistencies with a few characters from the way they were in the beginning to the end. As well as one instance where the time line of events don't seem to mesh. But those little inconsistencies aside this was a good story. A good start to what I am sure is a good series. One that I look forward to reading."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"The Furies of Calderon is the first novel in Jim Butcher's six-part fantasy series, Codex Alera. Butcher is also the author of the popular Dresden Files series. For those who have read the Dresden Files and are considering Codex Alera, be warned that the two series have very little in common, with very different plots, characters, and writing styles. That being said, if you're a fantasy fan, the Furies of Calderon is well worth your time.The series is set in a society based on the Roman Empire. All of the people of the land have at least some access to a magical, element-based power - furies, which manifest themselves in physical form, typically taking the shape of an animal. Well, everyone in the land has access to at least one fury except for young Tavi, who is completely fury-less, making him the classic underdog protagonist. He gets through the events of the Furies of Calderon entirely through his wit and quick-thinking. In this regard, Tavi really is a rather unique fantasy protagonist - he has no power, no skill, he has no destiny about him. The reader gets the sense that Tavi is more than he seems to be, but no power comes to him in this novel.The Furies of Calderon has a lot of strengths. For one thing, it's pleasant for a change to see an underpowered main character. Not only does Tavi not have any special powers, he's the only person in his entire country that doesn't have any special powers, meaning that he is at a constant disadvantage in every confrontation he encounters. It's rather entertaining watching Tavi work his way into and out of trouble with nothing but his intellect (a talent so often ignored in fantasy works). Although Tavi is the main character, there are a slew of other important characters, including some perspective characters. These characters are well drawn and realized, they have their strengths and weaknesses, they fail and they succeed. Admittedly, the good guys tend to be very good and the bad guys tend to be very bad, but the good versus evil battle that we see in Furies of Calderon is executed very well.Further, Butcher proves himself capable of writing solid third person stories. The Dresden Files were written from a first person perspective, providing little attention to detail, providing no peak into other characters' thought processes, etc. But Butcher writes from a few third-person perspectives, and writes some very solid prose. His prose isn't a major strength, but it is more than sufficient to carry the reader through. Butcher also creates a very vivid world. The Furies of Calderon takes place in a fairly small, backwater area of the country, but we get a few tantalizing glimpses of the overarching society, which promises to be fleshed out in future novels. And as I mentioned earlier, the magic system is based on control over elemental creatures called furies. Although this is nothing groundbreaking, Butcher handles it very well, and the powers are used in some very interesting ways.The main criticism I have of the Furies of Calderon is that the pacing is a bit slow, particularly in the first half. There is a lot of background and build up in the first half, explaining the world, introducing the characters, developing the plot, etc., but very little actually happens early on. That being said, the plot really takes off in the second half and the novel becomes a serious page turner. As I mentioned earlier, Butcher proves himself a competent writer, but his prose his never spectacular and is occasionally somewhat stilted. His dialogue is definitely stronger than his narrative.All in all, the Furies of Calderon is a really solid opening novel and the Codex Alera series promises to be a rather entertaining take on classic fantasy fare. I can't say for sure that fans of the Dresden Files would like Codex Alera, as the two series are very, very different, but every fantasy fan should give the Furies of Calderon a try. It's entertaining and well executed. Recommended."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"How boring can be a story about a young shepherd becoming an emperor?

The characters are great and there is a lot of action. There is a lot of humor as well. I found myself grinning during a few parts. It's nice to read a book that doesn't involve elves, dwarves, demons, and orcs. Instead this book creates new original races that are both unique and quite intelligent. I also like how the main character's race, Alerans, can use magic. EVERYONE is a mage/wizard/witch/sorceress. No more super powerful mage overpowers people with no magic powers. Now everyone has magic powers and even if they don't have magic powers, they have skills that make them just as effective and lethal as magic, so everyone is on a common ground.For those people who are looking for complicated epic stories, this book wont do it for you. It's a fast read with lots of action and a GREAT story."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"This series is great. The first in the series was a bit confusing because you are just expected to follow along without much knowledge or description of how this world works.

Jim Butcher takes you on this roller coaster ride where at every turn there's a surprise for you. If you want unpredictable, this is the perfect book. The pace is very well controlled, the plot engaging. I'd highly recommend this book to anyone.In case you're wondering, unfortunately I can't say the same for the rest of the series, but I'm not going to take away any stars for this first book. Jim Butcher is so unpredictable but in all the predictable ways that his unpredictability becomes predictable. That is to say, you learn to expect the opposite of what you'd naturally expect to happen; it starts to lose some of the edge when you stop worrying about characters as they hit a dead-end because you know \\"unpredictably\\" some escape will be found, and when you start worrying again when that escape is found because you know \\"unpredictably\\" something will happen to ruin their new hope again.Also some of the surprises that come later in the series irritate me because they don't quite agree with the earlier books, so you feel like you've been cheated (or simply, the surprises are a bit forced).And I personally find the \\"cutting off a narrative to switch to a different character's just so to create a cliffhanger within the book\\" technique quite annoying.All that said though, the first book doesn't have those flaws (or so I remember), and is a very delightful read. The paragraphs above are just a caveat for those who may be reading this review and wanting to know the opinion of the entire series before they embark. So in conclusion, the first book deserves a 5 star on all accounts; I'd probably give the entire series a 4 star."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"First let me say that I was turned on to Jim Butcher through his Dresden books. I had read the reviews of people who came from reading Dresden, expecting Dresden or a Dresden like character to be the protagonist in a purely fantasy world. So to make my reading as non-biased as possible, I went into this book expecting nothing at all.The first chapter seemed off to a bumpy start as if Jim hadn't found his voice yet. But this only lasted for a very short time. Before I knew it I was reading hours past when I wanted to go to bed. I felt a connection with all of the characters and I even found myself cheering the antagonist on as well.What struck me as interesting about this book is that the \\"hero\\" of the book isn't even the main character. If you are familiar with George R.R. Martins \\"Song of Fire and Ice\\" series, then you will understand how this book is divided up. The chapters jump from character to character and you end up with 5 or 6 different stories happening at once.I had read in one of the 1 star reviews that there were to many names and places to keep up with and that Jim is overly descriptive of some characters. I didn't find either of these to be true for me. All in all there were 7 or 8 \\"main\\" characters, and then a few more random people on the side.The reason I gave this a 4 star rating is that there were a few parts towards the end that killed the euphoric reading experience I had been on. The \\"hero\\" makes a few remarks here and there that don't fit the situation at all and seemed to be an attempt to lighten the situation with a wise crack but failed miserably. There were also a couple inconsistencies that could be excused away, but had still bothered me.All in all, the magic system was enthralling, the characters loveable and there was enough potential for political intrigue to get me to order the second book."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"Spoiler alert: This review discusses aspects of the entire 6 book series.I love the Jim Butcher's Dresden Files. This series is decent, but does not measure up.None of the characters have the dry wit of Harry Dresden, and the grit is missing from the series.Butcher does a decent job creating a new world, breathing life into the characters, and as usual he tells a good story.But while there is plenty of action, gore, and even some clever moments from the main character, there is very little suspense. One can tell fairly quickly that no one of any import to the main character is going to die, and not only not die, but be unhappy. Butcher goes out of his way to make sure they \\"all live happily ever after.\\" If this series was written for children like Harry Potter, I could take it a bit more.However, the Butcher writing style in this series was just not riveting or even suspenseful because you knew everything was going to turn out fine and none of the main characters would bite the bullet. In this particular series Butcher could take lessons from George Martin or the Malazan Books of the Fallen, where few characters are safe.Butcher is a talented writer, and these books are a fun read. Just be prepared, they are a cut below his usual fare. He could do better. Not sure if balancing this series and the Dresden Filesresulted in his fantasy series turning out to so predictable. He falls into a trap where he sacrifices reality in his writing in order to achieve an unrealistic goal-the everyone lives happily ever after ending. He should have just skipped the last chapter and had that traditional 6 word ending that comes at the end of a children's story."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"Give this series a shot. Butcher is known for the Dresden files but I enjoyed this series even more!"},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"Jim Butcher has done an excellent job with the Codex Alera series, and the first book, Furies of Calderon is a great read. It'll seem familiar at times, and refreshingly new at others.You may find it too familiar in parts. I know I did on the first read through. With Academ's Fury, I felt the same way. It wasn't until I had read Cursor's Fury that all the pieces Butcher was laying out started falling into place, and were awesome for it.Like Jim Butcher's first series, the Dresden Files, he takes 1-2 books to build the world, set the threats and get the reader interested in the characters. Once you've enjoyed the kiddie rides with Furies and Academ, the reader understands enough to go out and enjoy thehigh adventures of the last four books of this series with a full understanding of the politics, capabilities and nuances of the characters and forces at play.Lately, I've been re-reading Furies and Academ. Now that I know, and can watch how things are being laid, I enjoy both books all the more for it."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I was a little apprehensive starting this series. The result of starting this book was a completely sleepless night as I strove to get to the end; unable to leave the story unfinished. Then several more sleepless nights as the feeling translated to the rest of the series. A masterpiece that blends history, culture and a certain computer game (I applaud you if you can guess which one) in an awesomely refreshing and fabulously well written book and series!"},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"Hi, I am really loving this series! Great world building, magic that has to follow rules, and political maneuvering enough to satisfy any reader, this book is just terrific! A must for any fantasy lover!"},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"For any fantasy fan, this is a must read. Tavi, the main character, seems to be the only one without a Fury (elementals that help the person they bond with), but that doesn't stop him from accomplishing what he must. Instead, Tavi relies upon his wits to defeat the enemies threatening his empire of Alera. Butcher creates well-rounded characters that readers will really fall in love with and root for (or in the case of the villains, you'll really come to hate them). If you are a fan of fantasy or Butcher, you should add this to your reading list."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"Great start to a fantastic new series! Very interesting and entertaining! Very likable characters. Another great book by Jim Butcher!"},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"Jim Butcher can tell a good story and that is what this one is. Highly imaginative, moves very fast, I strongly recommend it to any fans of the Fantasy genre."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"The general storyline is exciting and fresh. Some of the elements seemed forced and unnecessary, such as the fits of passion and lust. The story would have benefited from deeper plot development without these aspects. I plan to read on in the series to see if Butcher evolves his writing to build out the characters and storyline further. It has good potential."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I loved this book. I've read the whole series 3-4 times now. This book has a few slow spots, but it's an excellent beginning to an amazing series. While the pattern of talentless farm boy succeeds against all odds has been used before (Belgariad, Xanth), this book still does a good job of introducing the characters and makes you want to keep reading the entire series."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I have really enjoyed Jim Butcher's books, and the same holds true for his Codex Alera series. I must admit that it took me a little bit to get into the first book, but once it grabbed me, I could not put them down. I really enjoyed the unique magic system, which is hard to do in fantasy these days. The characters slowly grew on me and I loved how I was able to follow the growth of the main characters. I loved all the books in this series and I think any fantasy fan who likes quick, action packed books, not bogged down by page after page of detailed description about things that don't matter, will enjoy this series."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"The first thing to know about this book is that there are multiple main characters and that each chapter jumps to a different person's perspective. I rarely read novels in this style because I like the one-main-character approach, but a friend of mine recommended this book with such passion that I dived into it regardless.The jist of the plot, without spoilers, is pretty simple: In a land where people can summon the elements in the form of creatures called Furies, some bad Fury-wielders want to overthrow the current 'government', and, as per usual, our main characters are pulled into the drama of it all, and their destinies lead them to become important pieces of the plot. There's one character that seems just slightly more main than the rest, and he is a boy named Tavi, who is a rarity because he can't summon Furies at all. His uncle, a steadholder and powerful fury-crafter, is dragged into the mix, as well as a couple of evildoers you love to hate and a young woman who works for the crown and is risking quite a bit to save it.Pretty basic.I really appreciated the creativity of the author in terms of writing about people being able to use elements, but in a way that, at least for me, is unique. Jim Butcher is also very good at establishing characters, so you don't feel the drag of not caring about any of the personalities that he introduces. He's also got a pretty wicked imagination that doesn't stretch too far into that 'high fantasy' world where you're utterly confused most of the time, trying to figure out what's going on.What I feel like this book lacks, however, is depth. It's *so* basic to me in terms of the 'Hero's Journey', that it's really difficult to keep my attention. The parts that I like reading best are the chapters that follow Tavi, and most of the time, when it switches to someone else, I just feel irritated and bored. Instead of the characters developing as I read on, they just become cookie cutter pieces of the over all puzzle...honestly, if you google the Hero's Journey, that is exactly how this book is written.Another thing that was bizarre is that I feel like parts were missing. I don't know if perhaps my kindle edition missed a few paragraphs or if the novel was just written ambiguously, but there was one scene in particular where two men were talking to two boys on a road, and the boys said something, and then the men spoke, and then a paragraph later the men were stepping over the boys' dead bodies to leave...I still have no clue what happened in that scene, or how the boys died. I asked my coworker, and he said, 'I think you're just supposed to assume that they got stabbed', and I laughed.I've heard in the past that a great book isn't actually defined by the hero, but by its villain. All of the villains in this novel, save one who is barely in it, aren't even that evil. Actually, the main characters constantly outshine them, which, for me, is boring. A book with villains you don't fear - so bizarre!All of the cons aside, the book is decent. Not quite my cup of tea, but I'm sure that fans of fantasy writing who read fantasy often will find it entertaining."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I never really considered myself a sci-fi fan until I was Introduced to Jim Butchers work.This particular series is my favorite out of any genere...

Something different. Good adventure. Always liked Jim Butcher's character development. The whole series is good. Worth the money. Buy it, now."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"It might be me, because I haven't read anything about it from anyone else but I think the fighting is drawn out way too much. I love the story and am dying to know what is going to happen to the characters but then there is this endless fighting going on, chapters long. I'm not very interested in how people kill eachother or how many hunderds are killed, it is boring and could have been handled in half a page. This is probably why I like the Harry Dresden series better. Still, I will probably read all the books Butcher writes in this series as I'm intrigued by the characters and would like to know where this is going. I'll just pass over the fighting scenes I guess. PS I have read more about Tavi and the others now and I can promise you, things get better!"},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"First of all, I have to explain that I just L O V E \\"The Dresden Files\\" books - and (to me) the best part is the constant witty banter/dialogue...the personalities of his characters - pretty much everything about these stories. I just can't get enough of them - can't put them down. I even very much enjoyed the tv series [although I'm still completely amazed that they canceled after 1 season - everyone I've loaned my DVDs to has realy enjoyed this series...I think it simply didn't get enough publicity]. At any rate - it was because I loved Jim Butcher's writing so much in that series, that I decided to read this 1st book of his new series.It's not a stinker - it's just that it's HUGELY different writing...I just didn't find the \\"Jim\\" (quick wit, great dialogue, etc.) in this book. For me, it was just \\"ok\\". Something I would expect from someone with less storytelling talent than Jim has. It was not a book I just hated to put down...and truthfully, I probably won't even read the next book in this series. The characters didn't grab me...and the \\"story\\" wasn't all that great. If you're thinking of reading this series BECAUSE you really liked the style of writing in The Dresden Files - I think you'll find this something of a let down. Sorry Jim."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I'm not going to write a resume of the book (well okay series) because that's for all of you to discover as I have, and with a lot of love and pleasure may I add.Butchers characters are thorough, complex,loving hateful in short human, which is the best way to make them. Even-though it's fantasy you can really get to know them bit by bit and feel for them, even if they're not always on the good side of the battle. They are very three dimensional, not all hero or all bad. The storyline is compelling and event-though you know where the story is going you are still surprised when a plot is unravelled. The battle scenes are extensive and very well planned out, as though he has a maquette in his writing room and plays them out before writing them down. The most lovable feat of Jim butcher's novels (including Dresden files) is that you never feel like the story is forced, it all comes so natural. All I can say is, buy them read them and re-read them when time has gone by. I surely will. And Jim, though the chances are small, if you ever do read this, please keep on writing, it's your true gift. You might ask, doesn't she have the smallest criticism here? Well no, only that if Jim ever stops writing I will loose my favourite author. Thank you Jim for all the joy you bring to your readers."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"Jim Butcher seems to love taking his readers on a glorious romp through the worlds he creates. The Codex Alera series is no exception to this. As a huge fan of the Dresden Files series I wasn't sure how I would like a new world from Butcher. However after staying up till 2am last night to finish Furies of Calderon, I have to say he's hooked me again. He excels at creating characters that you love and hope he doesn't kill of before the end of the book! If you enjoy a brand new world of magic take a step into Alera. You will not be disappointed! Fast paced and loveable (and hateable) characters!"},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I've found Butcher's series to be a fantastic series which rivals that of Fiest, Jordan, Martin, and Goodkind. Unlike the previous authors Butcher's story is much more involved with character development, he's more restrained with random plot threads, and each novel gives some sense of cloture. Whereas at times with Jordan and Martin you can get drowned in the subplots, Butcher's subplots enhance our understanding of the characters seem to have definitive path, albeit with a few twists, and are all together interesting. Finally, the series seems to be on shcedule of 1 book a year. If you love Martin, Jordan, Fiest, and Goodkind (and especially if you get frustrated with them) you'll love the Codex of Alera."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"This book had started out slowly and then works up a good head of steam. This book is totally awesome and Jim Butcher has a flair for working a reader up."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"The emperor is old and his heir is long dead. The Emperor's family has ruled Alera for a thousand years, but that time is now drawing to an end. Once, it was obviously good for the Empire to support the Emperor, but if the emperor is to fail, doesn't it make more sense to prepare for a worthy successor? Isn't it essential to head off the very real possibility of civil war? When a Cursor (sort of a trouble-shooter/spy/mail carrier for the emperor) turns against the emperor himself, the entire empire trembles. Only his young, female, student, Amara, has a chance to right matters--and she hardly knows where to start.On the Empire's borders, barbarian Marat have been peaceful for more than a decade--after their great defeat by the 'fury'-wielding Alerans. But they are restless again, urged on by schemes of those seeking succession. When a young sheep herder, spots a Marat warrior on Aleran soil, he accelerates the countdown to open warfare. Tavi, the young shepard is one of the few Alerans completely devoid of the power of a fury--the elemental forces that Alerans command--but he has powerful relatives and has seen more than the rebels can afford to have seen.Author Jim Butcher combines intriguing world-building, sympathetic characters, multiple inter-related subplots, and plenty of action in a the first book in a wonderful fantasy series. Butcher's strong writing brings the reader into the story. Although there's never any doubt who the good-guys are in this story, Butcher recognizes that everyone is the hero of their own story and makes the antagonists sympathetic and even likable.Underlying Tavi's story is a deep secret--one not fully developed in this novel, but that will gradually come out as the series unfolds. Although this is a part of a series, FURIES OF CALDERON is a complete novel and can be read and enjoyed as a stand-alone.I am happy to recommend FURIES to anyone who enjoys heroic fantasy."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"\\"Furies of Calderon\\" starts \\"The Codex Alera\\" series with appealing characters amid pure storytelling. The characters and environment details are exceptional plus the intriguing tale has plenty of adventure and suspense. Constant action outside of the great battles develop all of the characters sufficiently, protagonists and antagonists alike.The magic is fascinating yet overwhelming since an entire populace has it. Aleran's work with at least one fury, a spirit like entity related to air, earth, fire, metal, water, or wood, and each fury has special abilities and strengths generally depending upon the creativity and skill of the crafter. Unfortunately young shepherd Tavi cannot summon any furies and relies solely on his strength and wit to function in an enhanced realm.There are countless characters throughout, the sneaky Cursors Amara and Fidelias, the dangerous duo furymasters Aldrick ex Gladius and Odiana, and Tavi's guardians Aunt Isana and Uncle Bernard (sister and brother). All individuals receive enough literary consideration to understand their primary motivations but leaves adequate mysteries unresolved as excellent cliffhangers for future novels. Several of them unreasonably survive near death experiences, a trait numerous authors exploit with their favorites.Even though the occasional sentence structure suffers from rambling, the novel would be more acceptable by young readers if not for the rare vicious incident where its specifics aren't essential to the plot. A detailed map of the significant terrains and comprehensive appendix would have been useful.I recommend this series to any fan of the fantasy genre.Thank you."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"My girlfriend picked this book up for my birthday last month and I devoured it over the course of several days. The setup does take a little while, but I did not feel that it dragged, and it was well worth it once the action really began kicking. This is definitely a page turner, as the characters face crisis after crisis and combat after combat. The concept of \\"furies\\" - elemental spirits that bond to almost everyone in the land (with the exception of Tavi, one of the protagonists) - is a well-executed one and Butcher was very creative in how he had his characters use them to help them in various situations. The world itself also feels well fleshed out and most of the characters really do read like characters, not just caricatures - the protagonists are likeable and you root for them to come through, while the antagonists are a mixed bag - they range from truly evil (Kord), to conflicted but determined to follow their beliefs (Fidelias). Well done there.The only disappointments I had with the novel were minor - he really lays it on a bit thick in the ending, specifically the last chapter, rather over the top and kind of indulgent (the very last couple of paragraphs are nice though). And his sexual morality seems rather on the conservative side (good guys blush at nudity, enjoy only fleeting kisses and nothing more - bad guys enjoy nudity, sex, infidelity, rape, etc), which seemed somewhat out of place given the darker aspects of the plot. Perhaps he wrote it this way because he was going for a younger audience, but then again, there are some pretty sinister scenes and chapters that may not sit well with kids (or more likely their parents).Despite those two complaints, I'd have to give this a strong recommendation to anyone into the fantasy genre. The book is well-written, with nice description, believable motivations and a gripping tale in a land rich with magic and history. I'm very much looking forward to continuing into the series.Oh, and as a side note, both of the \\"professional\\" reviews at the top of the page have typos and/or misinformation. User reviews are much better for this novel."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I've read a lot of fantasy novels over the years and there comes a point where you can map the story out in your head. A girl/boy or man/woman have powers they are not aware of and are part of a great prophecy or destiny that unfolds for the reader throughout the series.Jim Butcher has put a new twist on this formula by giving his central character absolutely zero powers. Rather he is forced to use intelligence, whit, and integrity to face the many challenges that unfold in this story.While the characters have the power to control aspects of the elements, called furies, they are by no means in control of their world or the many dangers they face. This makes the story so much more real and thus draws the reader more fully into the world the author has created.Mr. Butcher has also included secondary characters that become as important to the reader and the story as the central character. In other books, an author will flesh out a secondary character and then do nothing with them, but this is not the case here. Rather, Mr. Butcher's secondary characters are as much a part of the heart of the story as the main character, which makes this book so much more enjoyable.I thoroughly enjoyed this story, fell in love with all the characters, and when the story was finished felt satisfied that I had been a part of a world unique and quite set apart from anything that has been created before it."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"First things first: please ignore the reviews that compare this to Tolkien? Except for the fact that both these book and the Lord of the Rings are fantasy novels, they have NOTHING to do with each other, are nothing at all alike. Both excellent reads, but not at all alike.I'm a big fan of Butcher's Dresden books,. but I avoided this one for a while, just because I've read too much bad fantasy in the last few years, and I've gotten picky about it. Finally picked it up on a whim and was very pleasantly surprised.Honestly, this is an excellent book, with sympathetic characters, excellent villains, believable politics and a fascinating magic system. It's an interesting twist on the genre, too: the hero is a boy with no magical talent whatsoever, in a world where EVERYBODY is a mage, to a greater or lesser degree.Definitely worth a read, and I expect to enjoy the rest of the series just as much."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I always enjoy seeing how fantasy writers explain their magic powers system. too many writers make wizards or soceresses all powerful.

I read Dresden for the humor and for the juxtaposition of modern life with the magical world Butcher has created in his Chicago. I was afraid that wouldn't translate into the realm of \\"typical\\" fantasy very well. Luckily, Butcher didn't try to drag Harry (or anyone like him) into this series. The Codex Alera stands very much on it's own merits as an entertaining tale of magic (furycraft), politics, war, and the growth of the young hero. It's a little formulaic in that the young, helpless, bumpkin kid finds his strengths and talents and becomes a true force to be reckoned with while the world around him devolves into war and chaos from which it requires rescue. Nonetheless, that formula has stood the test of time because it provides a solid framework for a good storyteller to build a world that's worth our time to visit and characters that we can relate to and root for. Butcher has done an admirable job of crafting a world that feels different from any other I've experienced and one with enough surprises to keep my interest throughout the tale. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I read all of the Dresden files and decided to give these a try. The story is truly unique and easy to read.

Personally I love to see a writer who has something different to offer, and I wasn't disappointed in this book.I admired Tavi's struggle to adapt to an environment where he clearly does not fit in. The mechanisms he had developed to not only cope but conquer that environment rang true (in the context of a fantasy novel of course).The idea of the furies was something I hadn't come across in any other novel to date and I found the premise fascinating and refreshing.I have now read the whole series and enjoyed the development of the story line and characters in general but, because of the newness of the premise in this first book, it's my favorite."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I find these books are not written as well as I would have hoped, based on my previous experience with this author.

There are far too many easily found mistakes. Whoever proofed these books needs to move on."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I found this book while perusing through a used bookstore a few years ago, and decided to give it a try, based on the cover. Not a terribly original way of finding a decent fantasy book, but more often than not that's been how I've found good fantasy books. They just have better covers than other genres, apparently.Anyway, I absolutely loved it. It's a different fantasy premise, with \\"magic\\" based on elemental beings ruling the world, which I found very refreshing in originality. It's a well-developed idea, and Butcher really runs with it and gives it a lot of depth.The protagonists are lovable, and have definite personalities, but are also rather predictable in their actions because of their cut-and-dry loyalties. I don't mind loyalty in characters, I really don't, but this book has a lot of blind loyalty in its protagonists. The more interesting and intriguing characters that I found myself getting into were the antagonists, because they actually had very well-developed reasons for doing what they did, where the heroes' side seemed dull and flat by comparison with their unchanging sense of loyalty. It seemed like Butcher put a lot more thought into those traitor characters for development than he did the protagonists, and as a result, I didn't really feel all that strongly for a majority of the \\"good\\" characters, because they were just so stereotypically drawn into that \\"hero\\" mode mentality. It almost seemed a crutch for Butcher in character development; when in doubt, give them big, heroic and entirely expected actions and it's in the bag.The plot was very well written and developed. It never slowed down, and the entire last half of the book is nothing but battle scenes and daring feats done by Tavi. Butcher is apparently a huge fan of battle writing, because he doesn't slow down for a minute at the end of the book. I'm normally not a huge fan of battles (the ones in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" drove me batty, because Tolkien's dry writing is hardly inspiring), but Butcher does a great job of presenting the battle, interspersed with Tavi's own tasks and various other character contributions, and keeping the intensity going, which is always difficult when jumping viewpoints between entirely different character scenes. It was very well-balanced writing, and very gripping.Butcher could have done without the very corny ending, though. I felt awkward reading it, honestly, because it was unbelievably cliche. Doesn't kill the book, but it doesn't live up the standard set with the rest of the writing in the book.Great start to the series, and the rest of the books afterward only get better, as Butcher develops the characters further."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I live in the UK and bought this book for download to my Kindle.

I'm a Kellerman (both him and her), Cornwell, Sanford, Connelly, etc. reader. I read a lot of Sci Fi growing up (Heinlein, Asimov, Ellison, Dick, Brunner, etc.) and absolutely loved Dune, but hated Lord of the Rings (too boring in book form - terrific in movie form). Based on the recommendation of a friend, I started the Harry Dresden books and got hooked and devoured all of them. So, then I started on the Codex Alera and have devoured them.No spoilers here ... just a recommendation to give both of these series a try ... if my likes and dislikes sound familiar, you might find a new author to give a try.This is really a 4.5 rounded up to 5 - it's not perfect, but it's a fun ride."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"A well crafted fantasy by Jim Butcher. The setting is a Romanesque empire called Alera where the people bond with furies (elementals) of air, earth, fire, water, or metal during their childhood or early adolescence to obtain magical powers and thus defend the land against their foes. Our main hero's name is Tavi. He is a 15-year-old shepherd boy, one of the only people in Alera who has not bonded with a fury. Obviously he turns out to be more than he first appears. Amara is a courageous and resourceful heroine; Fidelias a bold and daring villain. As I've come to expect of Mr. Butcher, the writing is excellent, witty, and very entertaining. His style in this one is quite different from the Dresden novels, however. For example, rather than remaining first-person throughout, the perspective bounces around between the three main players. The pacing is superb, a real page turner. While the Dresden Files are more my style, I very much enjoyed this book as well. Recommended read."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"According to a video interview Jim Butcher gave, he started writing the Codex Alera series on something of a dare: someone challenged him to write an epic sword-and-horse fantasy based on the two things the challenger found most annoying, those being \\"Pokemon and lost Roman legions\\". One would think this would be an awkward combination, but in Jim's hands, it's something new and original to bring to the genre. I love the modified Roman Empire milieu, and the concept of \\"fury-crafting\\", of working with elemental beings which can shape the substance of things around the crafter, fascinates me.That said, I also approached this series on something of a dare: a rather strident teenaged fan of Jim's urban fantasy series, \\"The Dresden Files\\", came onto the forums on Jim's website, blasting the Codex Alera series and practically ordering Jim to stop writing it and focus his time and talent on more Dresden Files books. His reason: \\"Codex Alera sucks because it isn't the Dresden Files\\". I'd only at the time scanned a few sample chapters of Furies of Calderon and had found it a little hard to tune into (I'm a little leery of epic fantasy since, to me anyway, the bar got set so high by greats like J.R.R. Tolkien and Robert E. Howard), but I decided to give it another shot and see what the kerfuffle was all about.I'm glad I rose to the challange set by this otherwise forum troll: In some ways, the book is a set-up for the series to come, but it is still a very worthwhile read. The characters are life-like, complex, and very sympathetic -- even the antagonists: the Marat might, at first glance, seem like mere barbarians who work closely with the totem animals of their tribes, but as the story unfolds, we find they are a complex community of individuals with their own psyches and ideas. Even Fidelias, the ironically named traitor, has his deep-set motives that are still unfolding.But at the center, perhaps the most fascinating individual is Tavi, a young man who has not yet manifested any fury-crafting talents despite having close relatives who are strong fury-crafters, and who thus must rely on his wits and his courage to navigate a world on the brink of earth-shattering changes. His story and his journey are going to be incredible to watch and I'm already reaching for the second volume to see where his choices -- big and small, for better and worse -- take him..."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"Jim Butcher's Harry Dresden series succeeds largely because the wry humor underlying the story is irresistable. Furies of Calderon is good, too; but it has a totally different tone. You'll enjoy FofC, I think -- Butcher is an excellent writer, and he paints a compelling word-picture -- but don't come into expecting Harry Dresden in a Fantasy Universe.I admit that I found the beginning of the book a little slow. The setup takes several chapters, because there are quite a few characters to introduce: Tavi, the 15-year-old boy with no furies (magic powers of air, water, earth, or fire) to call upon; Amara, the crown's spy; Tavi's uncle and aunt; and a few more. *Do* give the book 50 pages before you decide what you think of it, as that's when the action really starts.And it's good stuff. If you've been looking for a solid sword-and-sorcery and a nice not-so-predictible quest, you'll enjoy the book a lot. I'm looking forward to the second book in the series, which (thankfully) has already come out."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"The 'Furies of Calderon' is the first book in the 'Codex Alera' series by Jim Butcher.I've been a fan of Butcher's Dresden novels, featuring famed vampire fighter Harry Dresden. So when I saw this book was available and it had received generally high reviews, I was eager to get into this book.When I started this tale I was impressed; I thought I'd finally found the holy grail of fantasy books...that being a writer that was possibly equal to, or at least comparable in fantasy writing skills as George R.R. Martin ('Ice and Fire' series). However, my initial enthusiasm quickly fell away, replaced by the realization I'd stumbled upon a very good story, but unfortunately, supported by mediocre story telling.First, the good:All the ingredients for first rate fantasy were there; magic, unique characters and creatures, deceit, treachery and some perilous treks through dangerous territories. There was even a hint of romance and some subtle erotic moments. The plot for the story itself was noteworthy with the classic good vs evil motif. Then coupled that with Butcher's proven ability to weave magic through the written word (as he's done so many times before with the Dresden Files) and you should have an outstanding tale...should have.However, I have a principle regarding fantasy writing, as defined by the following statement...'TO HAVE GOOD (OR GREAT) FANTASY, IT MUST BE, WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF FANTASY WRITING, BELIEVABLE'And with my statement in mind, these are my concerns: ***No specific spoilers, BUT, read at your own risk***1.)There was one mode of travel, that seemed utterly unrealistic; unrealistic, even given the fact that magic was a factor. (and exceedingly advantageous to the party(s) involved)2.)Grievously injured characters that were able to keep going on and on and on.3.)One character kept popping up, unforeseen and unexpected and usually at the most unlikely and inappropriate time. I remember one instance where I said to myself 'not again, this is unbelievable'.4.)Battles (both large and small) throughout the book, that seemed destined to end in gloom and doom, had outcomes reversed at the last moment by someone or something arriving in the nick of time to save the day.5.)Many of the characters appeared to be too nice, too fair, too forgiving...too much alike. Several of the 'good guys' appeared 'squeaky clean'; just unrealistic traits for so many different personalities, especially in this perilous setting.6.)And finally, no map! I realize some readers don't care if a map is provided in stories such as this, but I do. This book was the perfect example of a tale where a map could have been so useful to define distances and geographic locales.Conclusion;A very interesting first book in this series and it does hold promise for future installments. The story had an excellent beginning, but ultimately succumbed to some writing techniques that were of questionable benefit. 2 1/2 to 3 Stars.Ray Nicholson"},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"All the people of Alera are bonded with elemental furies which come to them in their childhood or early adolescence - except Tavi, who at 15 does not have his fury yet and is considered somewhat of a freak.However, it is Tavi and the escaped Cursor Amara who will set off a chain of events that will change their world and help foil an invasion attempt of their home instigated by traitors. This is an action-adventure fantasy novel that moves along at a brisk pace with a fairly wide cast of characters.Jim Butcher has created an interesting world with this novel and it is obvious that most of the secrets of Tavi's family have yet to be explored, but thankfully there will be another book which may flesh out some of the lingering mysteries.My only slight disappointment is that Butcher succumbed to the fantasy clich&eacute; of using an orphaned 15 year old boy as his central character - but that did not stop me actually liking Tavi. On the whole I'm glad I've read this book and will be looking forward to book 2 when it is published."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"Spoilers - just so ya know. Oh, and snark.Furies of Calderon is your standard fantasy story. The novel takes place in a quasi-medieval past time on an alternate Earth or some kind of Earth-like space populated by humans. Everyone in this world has a Fury, which is some kind of sentient elemental power that attaches itself to a person when they're hitting puberty and allows them to do elemental magic. The stronger your Fury, the stronger magic stuff you can do. Some people even have more than one.There is a boy protagonist (Tavi), teenaged, who is an outsider (sort of) because he doesn't have a Fury. He is special in some other way that is hinted at yet never revealed in the book because this is volume 1 of who knows how many and there has to be some way to make you read the next 6 books, right? Right. So, he's special and doesn't know it, is considered a freak by some and a pity case by others, wants to leave the \\"homestead\\" and go off to the \\"city\\" to study at the \\"university\\" so he can make something of himself. And, by gum, his dreams are gonna come true! (cue Disney music)And, of course, we have the familiar set of Kings and Queens and Knights and nobles and Homesteaders and serfs and all that jazz. You'd think that people with such wildly different everyday circumstances from regular humans would find some wildly different way to organize themselves and structure their society. Nope. Damn humans, always the same.To go along with this standard worldview is the standard political intrigue plot. Some noble somewhere doesn't like how the King runs things. He thinks he can do things better. He gathers up his forces - folks with strong furies, another noble or two, one of the King's own best Cursors (spies), and all the dark-skinned savages you can shake a stick at - and starts plotting to take over the kingdom.Luckily, the king has a good subject in Amara, a Cursor just out of training. She knows all about the plot and has the mad skills to escape her teacher (a dirty traitor!) and the noble's best knights to warn the King and save the kingdom. But first she has to run into Tavi, entwine his plot with hers, fall in love with Tavi's widowed uncle, and participate in the Battle at Helm's Deep. You heard me.==The savages are coming! Let's go to this heavily fortified garrison and fight them. Yay, we beat some of them! This will be easy. Oh crap, there are now a million billion of them out there and only a few hundred of us. We are screwed. And there is no escape. No hope. No light. Oop, here comes Gandalf with the Rohirim - I mean Tavi with some other group of savages to turn the tide of battle and allow us to win the day.==Along the way some other stuff happens. The small-time bad guy (tm) rapes a minor character who is slutty and therefore deserves it, but not the major one who is not slutty, (a virgin, in fact) therefore we know he cannot touch her. He comes to a bad end, as we all know he will, because someone has to and neither the traitor Cursor nor the noble with aspirations will in this book because, drumroll please, it's Book 1 of. There's also some crap about noble savages and Tavi getting soul bonded to a girl who is so feisty that she will either end up being a Strong Woman (tm) or a banal piece of plot furniture in subsequent books.Another minor nit - names. Too many damned same enough sounding/spelled names to drive me to distraction.My last issue with this book is about how much stuff is described in painfully specific detail. There is so much detail that I couldn't really get a good image of what stuff looked like in my head -- if that makes any sense (and it might not). I felt bogged down in a lot of irrelevant detail, thus clouding my mental image. The description spilled over into the ridiculous when, in an early scene, Tavi is in the wilderness, being chased by a savage and his pet Big Bird, during a storm in which wild furies try to rend one into tiny pieces, and freaking out because his uncle might be dead. He finds Amara in the middle of all this and takes the time to notice the following: Her skin color, her 'generous mouth' (can we call a moratorium on this phrase, please?), the condition of her hair, her build, her striking features, the fact that she is not precisely lovely, her cheekbones, the shape of her nose, what she is wearing down to the item and the state of her clothing.I'm sorry, no.There were other moments like this in the book. Moments where the author decided to tell us some stuff despite the fact that the character whose view we are currently dealing with would not notice or think about or comment mentally on. This is the evil of third person limited - at least the way it is currently used. I can't totally blame Butcher for it, but I can be all snarky about it for a minute here.Speaking of snarky, I am being overly so, I suppose. The truth is that, despite these many flaws, I enjoyed the book. I'll probably even read the next one. I have to find out what happens to Tavi and his uncle and aunt and Amara and the King and whoever the heck else. There were unanswered questions! Can't have that.What is interesting and frustrating about this book is that it is a prime example of how it's not about what a book does wrong, but about what a book does right that matters. Enough is done right here that it overpowers the wrong. But damn, you'd think that someone who could create so much right could turn down the wrong just a wee bit more.What does the book do right, you ask? In broad strokes, the story is pretty engaging, even with its clich&eacute; bits. The writing, despite the overload of pointless description, is good. The characters are interesting for the most part. I found myself really caring for them. Tavi is likeable, which he really needs to be. Amara is deal-with-able. Even the uncle is kind of cool. If I had to say what one thing makes this book worth reading, it would be the characters. They save the book completely.So those are my thoughts on Furies of Calderon. I think Book 2 is out now, so I might try to get it through the library. Hopefully it will also do more right things than wrong things."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I am suprised that this novel has gained so many 5 star reviews.

Several sub-plots add lively interest: a plot to overthrow the king, a shady local's plots to thwart the law, and a young man's striving to change his life. A fascinating and unique magic system adds creative interest: at puberty, the valley people develop magical talents sympathetic to one of the five elements. These elements are also expressed as magical creatures that roam wild.The author did a good job of developping unique and interesting personalites for the main characters. The writing style and descriptions are well done. My only real problem is that this book is fragmented, split too many ways among too many characters: a young man, his aunt, his uncle, a government agent, and a spy. Butcher handles this better than most authors. Still, each time the book changed point-of-view, I was reminded that I was reading a story and thrown out of flow. Sometimes the new point-of-view could recapture my attention, but alas sometimes it could not.Lively entertainment, I would say, suitable for to lift your mood and enliven your afternoon."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"This book is pretty good. Your typical fantasy story. A young kid on the verge of becoming an adult wrestles with being different. At the same time, the world is coming apart. Evil forces are on the verge of destroying an age old empire. The kid is the only one who can save the day. He's helped by his motley band of... well... this is definitely nothing new.I guess why I might be tempted to give this book a half way decent review is that it is readable. What makes it unique is the 'Fury' aspect. Furies are 'spirits'. Everyone in this world has a Fury except for the main character, that kid I was talking about, Tavi. People use the Furies mostly for war it seems.This might be the first book I have ever read where I was saying \\"ok already, just die\\". There are 3 bad guys who are chasing the kid, a young lady and the kids uncle/aunt. By the time this book is over, every single one of them has been on the brink of death many many times, has narrowly avoided death, has taken part in a battle and been spared death... on and on. So at a certain point, your not sighing with relief at the close escape, but cursing the author, saying \\"Common now\\".I don't want to go on and on. Butcher is one of the most popular authors out there today. At my local bookstore, I swear there are a couple hundred copies of his books. I wanted to see what all the hype was about. Let me tell you, this is no where near the George RR Martin books. It reads more like that massive Robert Jordan series, 'Wheel of Time'. In fact, I might be too generous with 3 stars.The characters are ok. the plot is rehashed, the writing is above average, and the concept is (other than the furies themselves) old school. I wouldn't go running out to get a copy of this if I were you."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"The book is well-written and fairly fast-paced.

What the furies are and how they function are not clearly explained in the beginning so that the reader ends up attempting to infer much about them without ever having a clear picture of them. Many elements in the story are very illogical such as the romance between Bernard and Amara and Fidelias' betrayal. The characters have no great appeal and rarely experience any great internal conflict and their actions are very predictable. The overall conflict of good and evil is fairly basic and has no unique element to make the story fresh and colorful. Although Butcher uses the abuses against female characters to help his readers see the evil of the antagonists, he makes no similar effort to show the protagonists as great or likable."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"Jim Butcher is an awsome novelist but this book falls short in so many ways from his first series. The story behind the book is good and engrossing however, because it is put together in a very choppy manner it is just annoying to read. The entire book is disjointed and hard to read. I know Jim has always wanted to write sword and sorcery books but this great story is told so badly that I almost want to stear people away from it. You will tear your hair out as you just start to get settle with one character when WHAM! you are switched to another character for sometimes up to 4 chapters, at which time you just got into that character to be torn away. I found myself skipping large chunks of the book just to get to the interesting parts. With all this critism aside I still had to go out and buy the second book to find out what happens."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"Oh hell, I really wanted to like this book, Jim's first hardcover and all. S*I*G*H, but it does takes two to create a willing suspension of disbelief, and Jim just wasn't into it in this lame attemptJim stands as my living, breathing example of the Little Engine Who Could. Proof positive that art is 10% inspiration and 90% perspiration. Jim wanted to be a writer and put the time and effort into learning his craft, churning out reams of copy and working the system until he came up with a winner, 'The Dresden Files'. Now after writing a small pile of novels concerning Harry Dresden P.I., the world's only consulting wizard, Jim is anxious to expand the franchise and come up with another series. Nothing wrong with that; Maybe Jim's getting tired of ol' Harry, though you wouldn't know it by reading the last book 'Blood Rites' (which is chock full of the same well written, good humored mixture of action and adventure that has made the rest of the series so enjoyable).However, for those considering picking up Jim Butcher for the first time, this ain't the place to start. I'm not sure which book the Editorial Reviewers were reading 'cause The Furies of Calderon is trite, poorly plotted and written, and frankly not all that interesting. Maybe a really good editor could have saved it, but I'm doubtful. It reads as if Jim had intended to write a Young Adult fantasy, plotted it out that way, but then when it came time to fill in the blanks, tried to write it out in the same hard-assed style of The Dresden Files, with truly awful results.Young Tavi lives in this fantasy world where everyone has a companion elemental spirit (the usual - fire, air, earth and water) or two except him. The reasons for his lacking are perfectly obvious by the end of the book, although Jim has attempted to play it cagey by only sprinkling a couple of references to Tavi's 'mysterious' (mysterious only because Jim doesn't directly talk about it) past throughout the book, presumably to save this pulse-pounding d&eacute;nouement for the next book. He lives on the Frontier of the Empire, the Emperor is old, the only heir died in battle not far from where Tavi lives etc. etc. We also have the pre-requisite properly heroic, ex-military 'uncle', the plucky and courageous 'auntie', and by god, we even have the idiot retainer (d'ya think he may be More*Than*He*Seems, oh wonder, Wonder!). Gah! This tripe practically writes itself.Apart from the utterly predictable plot, the other major problem with the novel is that Jim doesn't play fair with his reader. There is practically no explanation of the 'rules' of this fantasy world; characters gain attributes (and lose them) with little rhyme or reason except to move the plot along. For example, Tavi's 'aunt', controls a water elemental which not only makes her formidable in battle, but she can also heal (I guess Jim's reasoning is the body is 90 odd percent water), read emotions, grow claws (once! But never again, although it would have been useful in a couple of later sections) and hey! She's even a great cook. Additionally, Jim indulges in a lot of sexist crap, reminiscent of John Norman's 'Gor' books of evil memory, mind controlling slave collars, rape, lowly females washing feet oh, it goes on and on. This is presumably to 'adult-up' the book. We even have noble savages, who eat their enemies (plot-wise presumably to indicate they're savages), but they don't have elementals, instead they 'bond' with various animals (including a sort of Moa, though apart from them and giant oxen all the other fauna is earth-normal). These are the stand in cannon fodder, oh but just perhaps it will all work out in the end. Jim obviously hasn't put a lot of thought into the 'rules' of this world, with the result that it's not at all believable.Although there are a few engaging scenes throughout the book, the aftermath of the Final Battle (you knew there was going to be a Final Battle, didn't you?), is so badly plotted and written that I just cringed for Jim. Get this: all the baddies have been suitably killed off (but quickly resurrected for the next book) and then the emperor floats down from the sky (literally!) and the hero's engage in a sort of Star Wars type of medals-all-around-even-for-the-well-meaning-buffoons ceremony played for yuks that is just so flat, so hackneyed, so - oh god, poor Jim! He's going to look back on this one and refuse to believe that he actually wrote it. He's really a much better writer than he shows off here. Give this turkey a pass and pick up the latest Harry Dresden novel."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"Mr Butcher, who has developed a very entertaining story with Harry Dresden, here does not convince.He does not because many of his characters here are cardboard, because his Latin mistakes are many and truly atrocious, as in Harry Dresden, and because later on in the series (have read four, so far) he will pad with useless and not entertaining sub-plots.I am amazed that a professional writer, who obviously has never touched Latin, would be so arrogant to use words which are neither here nor there, without using instead a knowledgeable pal.In the Dresden files he used e.g. \\"Amoracchius\\" for one of the swords, inter alia, obviously an invented word neither Latin nor Italian.Here he will challenge readers' patience with his tedious usage of \\"singulares\\", \\"legionares\\" etc.He may believe that adding an 's' to words makes it Latin...Even assuming that these are descendents from an Imperial Roman legion, no way they would have gone astray so much...Had he at least changed words in a predictable way, it would have been easy to explain as historical changes, but nothing of the kind was presented [in Romanian, for instance, the closest language to classic Latin, the group \\"qu\\" became \\"pa\\", as in quattuor (four) --> patru, aqua (water) --> apa, etc.]I wanted to like it. I could not."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I picked this book up on the strength of Jim Butcher's interview on The Dragon Page: Cover to Cover show #260. Of course, Butcher is famous for The Dresden Files, an urban fantasy/mystery series in which the protagonist sleuth is a freelance wizard. It is popular enough to have been turned into a television series by the same name. I'm not a huge fan of urban fantasy; almost every time I've tried to pick one up, I've never finished the book. Also, the TV series didn't wow me at all. So I was definitely intrigued when Evo Terra practically gushed about the Codex Alera, Butcher's epic fantasy series. I wanted to give the guy a chance.Mr. Butcher stated that the Codex Alera series came about from a challenge of a friend. They had been discussing the concept of taking bad ideas and making them into good novels through presentation and writing. This individual challenged Butcher to write a good novel from a bad idea. Butcher upped the ante and asked for two bad ideas, and these were the results:-- Lost Roman Legion-- PokemonTaking these two ideas, Butcher crafted _Furies of Calderon._ Which is unfortunately a pretty bad book. There are two areas in which this book is particularly unsavory: plotting and writing style.**PLOTTING**The plot of _Furies of Calderon_ is pretty cliche ridden. There is the boy: a young character with mysterious origins living on a small farmstead. This particular boy, Tavi, cannot use any of the elemental forces (the Pokemon influence) that fill his homeland. He wants to go to the capital city to study at university so he can make a name for himself as a scholar. Cue John Williams score and wonder who this boy's parents are.The other overly familiar plot points are rife. There is the female spy who uncovers the plot to overthrow the monarch. That's probably one of the most common plots of any fantasy novel. There is a \\"Judas\\" character. There is a group of invading savages. There's a dark, scary forest full of overgrown spiders. Tavi is able to point out flaws in the savages' legal system. The female spy is quite conveniently also nobility, even though it had never been mentioned until just the \\"right\\" moment. It continues ad nauseam.**WRITING**The writing style that Butcher uses here is pretty tedious. A lot the time, it is overly wordy. A lot of information is included parenthetically and can be repetitive. A great example of this appears on page 480:\\"She lifted her arm, gasping, and blocked the Marat's forearm with her own, halting the blade a scant inch from her throat.\\"And then just one sentence later:\\"Isana twisted, gasping, calling for Rill once again, hoping that the first Marat would remain incapacitated when she called Rill from him.\\"Both of these sentences are clunky. They could be streamlined easily. As it is, the reader has quite a bit to wade through. The parenthetical verbs especially could be cut. Much more interesting words than \\"gasping\\" could be used to provide action. Stricter editing would have been really beneficial.There's also some confusion about whether or not a certain character is a Citizen. On page 33, Tavi reminds his Uncle Bernard that he could have challenged for full Citizenship. On page 220, another character says that Bernard can't kill a Citizen on that Citizen's property. Bernard replies that he can on his own land, which implies some sort of Citizenship status. On page 363, yet another character reminds Bernard that he isn't a Citizen off of his own property. It would be so much easier to understand, at least in my opinion, if Butcher had made clear how the Citizenship system worked in this world.In conclusion, this book completely fails in what it was trying to accomplish. The ideas were hokey, the delivery was schlocky, and the story just doesn't deliver anything remarkable or original. There's a lot out there that is better on every count, and I intend to read that instead."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"All I can say is that I was truly dissapointed in this book. I have read fantasy/Sci-fi nearly all of my life and this was a waste of $8.00 and change. The Author seems to write like this is his first novel and he is trying really hard to throw every possible situation and character definition into 500 pages of dribble. The main character, if you want to call him that since the book is so choppy, is well built I suppose. But it also follows the same pat design of so many other GOOD novels by GOOD authors (ex: Eddings and Feist). I am not comparing those two authors to Butcher since that would be like comparing a kindergarten play to Broadway. It is even so embarassing that one of Butcher's place names is the same as Eddings in the Belgariad. I suggest to save your money and time by not purchasing this book."},{"Title":"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)","review":"I am a big Jim Butcher fan. I picked this up because I needed something to read while waiting for the next installment of Harry Dresden. I was hoping that Butcher's attempt at fantasy would be as well done as his Dresden series. I didn't like this book at all.1. Several people comment that the book starts out slow. Boy is that an understatement. That's like saying the Titanic had a minor mishap on her maiden voyage! This started out slow, remained slow throughout and then slowed down at the end. I just could not get into the story at all.2. I thought the attempt at world building was very poor. I'm sorry, but WTF is a \\"fury?\\" How are we supposed to know what these spirits are and the role they play in this world? Why do some people seem to be able to control elementals while others can not? WTF is a Windbane? Where do they come from? I kept going back to see if I missed a chapter early on that explained this new world. The author simply takes for granted that the reader knows and understands the logic upon which this world is built.3. As several others have mentioned there is nothing new or different in this fantasy. You have read about everything in this book. There aren't even any new twists. And why on hearth base this on the Roman Empire? It simply didn't make any sense.Life is too short and there are too many excellent books to waste time reading Furies of Calderon.

After three valiant attempts at reading it, I had to put it down. Within four chapters, Butcher throws two fistfuls of characters at the reader who are invested with innumerous cheesy magical powers, but this reader wasn't able to care about any of them. It takes a scorecard to keep track of all the characters and their gratuitous powers and a scorecard isn't supplied by the publisher. How did this get past the editors? So screw it. Save your money and skip this title. Butcher didn't care about the story or the reader in this one.

And I find it even more puzzling to see the beginnings of alliances between many Muslim fundamentalists and Christian liberals. What's up with that? This book helps explain it.First, the Christian fundamentalists and the Jewish liberals. Traditionally, Jewish liberals have been suspicious of Christian fundamentalists for many reasons: the most vocal Christians have generally defamed Jews, encouraged anti-Jewish violence, and engaged in missionary work that Jews have reacted very negatively to. In addition, views on social issues such as abortion, school prayer, and gay rights have generally been very different among these two groups. And Christian fundamentalists have been suspicious of Jewish liberals for some of the same reasons: differences on social issues as well as the hostility that they see on the Jewish side.Why is it becoming different now? The author explains that it is because both sides see a need to defend Israel. I think that explains part of it. But I think he overlooked something even more important: both the Christians and Jews are siding with Israel for the same reasons. That is, the constant Arab lies, the United Nations and European Union support for Arab terror, and the dishonesty of many in the media have angered both groups in the same way. And even upon further reflection, they both still see all these problems as serious threats to society as a whole.That's the easy part.The tough question, which Merkley answers superbly, is why we're seeing an alliance between Christian liberals and Muslim fundamentalists. Merkley shows that it goes far beyond any need to attack Israel.The two groups are strange bedfellows indeed. They have different religions, and their attitudes towards religion are very different. One group has mostly liberal values while the other is reactionary and intolerant. Historically, they have the legacy of Muslim invasions of Europe, the Crusades, and European colonialism. Why would liberal Christians support those who favor slavery, terrorism, totalitarianism, irredentism, mistreatment of Women, and intolerance of the rights of others in general? Why would fundamentalist Muslims even seek or accept such support?It certainly isn't any rational need to oppose Israeli behavior. As the author points out, \\"Israel's offence follows from the nature of Islam.\\" This alliance is the result of three factors: Muslim offence at the existence of Jewish rights in Israel, Muslim pressure on the Christians of the Middle East, and long-standing contempt of Judaism by more than a few Western Christians.Merkley shows that the effect of all this has been devastating to the Christians of the Middle East. The majority have fled the area. Most of those who have stayed have done so either because they supported Muslim terror against the Jews or because they were pressured into tolerating it. This has poisoned their relations with the Israeli Jews while not raising their esteem in the eyes of Arab Muslims.Merkley is at his best when he documents the reactions of all sorts of diverse Christian groups to the State of Israel. I strongly recommend this book. And if you want more, read Bat Ye'or's book on Islam and Dhimmitude next."},{"Title":"Christian Attitudes Towards the State of Israel (Mcgill-Queen's Studies in the History of Religion)","review":"I can't say enough good things about this book. In fact, I am going to buy several copies to give to friends, both Christian and Jewish. I'd like to give it to liberal Protestant friends, but sadly, having read the book I am older and wiser about the deep roots of liberal Protestant hostility to Israel (and Jews).I found the background on the World Council of Churches, the Vatican, and the Evangelicals really fascinating. Merkley is wonderfully frank and honest about difficult topics. I found him a trustworthy reporter. At times his exasperation shows, but on the whole he shows an admirable restraint.This book helped me understand some unpleasant interchanges I've had with people in my own community, for example the Presbyterian minister and the socially elite lady who works with Protestant missions in \\"Palestine.\\" I have been deeply disturbed by their moral indifference to Jewish life (the minister) and outright anti-semitic slurs (the rich mission lady.) It is always helpful to be able to put personal experiences like this in a larger political/historical context and understand them at a deeper level.On a happier note, Merkley gave me information I did not know about the theology and policies of the main Evangelical groups. I was especially interested to learn that the often repeated comment they are only helping Israel so that all the Jews will be killed in Armageddon is actually a lie promulgated by anti-Israeli Christians eager to alienate Jews from their one group of dependable support (Merkley says this in a much more measured way, but that's the nub). I have to say this also fits my personal experience - the several evangelicals I have talked to in my community have only quoted Bible about 'those that bless you shall be blessed, those that curse you shall be cursed' in explaining why they think supporting Israel is a good idea (in both senses of the word 'good.')I feel very grateful to Merkley for this book and I only wish it were more widely read."},{"Title":"Christian Attitudes Towards the State of Israel (Mcgill-Queen's Studies in the History of Religion)","review":"This absorbing work follows on from Merkley's 1998 masterpieceThe Politics of Christian Zionism 1891-1948. He believes Christian attitudes to Israel derive from deeply held theological persuasions that ought to be considered in the historical context of Christianity, Judaism and Islam. The first part reviews the historical elements that have always been present in Christian attitudes towards Judaism whilst the main body reveals the wide variety of Christian voices worldwide and particularly in the Middle East. Finally, he examines different Christian institutions and their theological and political relations to the Middle East. His arguments derive from verifiable facts and evidence based on the official literature of churches and organizations as well as interviews with spokespeople of the aforementioned and of the State of Israel and the Palestinian authority. Merkley engages boldly and wittily with this arsenal of fact and opinion, unafraid to take a stand, speak his mind and make a case for Israel.He chronicles the development of the attitudes of different strands of Christianity, including the Catholic and mainstream Protestant churches on the one hand versus Evangelicals on the other, whilst acknowledging that significant numbers of individuals in the first two groups hold personal convictions that correspond more closely with the second. Approved by the United Nations, the establishment of Israel in 1948 occurred in an environment of worldwide approval but even then there were opposing voices. These came from Protestant missionary groups in the Middle East as well as anti-Zionist Jewish organizations in the USA. Soon after the rebirth, the Catholic and mainstream Protestant churches started to shift to a critical stance. Formed a few weeks after this historic event, the World Council of Churches has a long history of enmity to the Jewish state. As the war clouds were gathering in 1967, the WCC remained quiet about the Arab World's bellicose rhetoric and threats of genocide. But immediately after Israel's resounding victory, it pounced with a sanctimonious condemnation of violence.Since then, the WCC has become notorious for parroting Arab and UN propaganda, culminating in its participation in the hate-fest at the 2001 UN Conference on Racism in Durban. Merkley lucidly exposes the reptile tongue of the WCC and the mass media, demonstrating the similarities with the anti-Semitic propaganda of the Nazis. He argues that the leaders of the WCC are a militant ecumenical elite far removed from the essence of theology and fully committed to political causes. He contends that Christian anti-Zionism is not just a form of generic anti-Zionism but that it draws from the same theological roots as the medieval European blood libels. In this regard, see alsoThe Resurgence of Anti-Semitismby Bernard Harrison. The Christian Left seeks to appease radical Muslim opinion about the existence of Israel, as liberal churches have allied themselves with a movement with which they have nothing in common. Merkley does not pretend to believe in either the meme of the religion of peace or the willingness of Israel's neighbors to live in peace with it. SeePeace: The Arabian Caricature of Anti-Semitic Imageryto understand why.As anti-Zionism gained momentum in the 1970s, more individuals with different convictions started leaving those churches as is evident from the declining membership of the mainstream denominations. And Christians Zionists became actively involved in the support of Israel and her people in the Diaspora. Those of a theologically more conservative disposition have shown themselves to be steadfast and loyal friends of the Jewish State. Organizations like the Christian Embassy in Jerusalem, Bridges for Peace, Christian Friends of Israel, the International Christian Zionist Center and CUFI are devoted to the welfare of the country by means of practical and political assistance. Chapter seven provides interesting information on the institutional variety of and theologies of Christian Zionism. Please note that most of them avoid proselytizing.Standing With Israelby David Brog is an informative read on the history and current composition of the movement whilstIn Defense of Israelby John Hagee andFuture Israel: Why Christian Anti-Judaism Must Be Challengedby Barry Horner explain the theological motivation.Merkley is uncertain whether the mainstream churches will move further in the direction of what he calls neo-Marcionism (SeeLost Christianitiesby Bart Ehrman for an explanation) in order to appeal to secular liberals, Islam and the Eastern churches or whether it will attempt Jewish-Christian reconciliation. On the Protestant side the signs are not promising with their divestment attempts, while things look more ambiguous in the Roman church in view of the militant rhetoric of Michel Sabbah, Archbishop of Jerusalem. Besides obvious reasons for standing with Israel like its adherence to the rule of law, commendable record of respecting the holy places of all religions, astonishing cultural and technological accomplishments and uninterrupted record of democracy, there is another reason why Christian Zionists are loyal to the Jewish state. It is, like the attitude of the other churches, rooted in theology, but quite overtly based on scripture. To its Christian friends, the rebirth of Israel represents the major miracle of the 20th century. It is a requirement of faith to seek the blessing of Israel above all other considerations; the existence of Israel is considered crucial to the survival of our Judeo-Christian civilization.Among the valuable contributions of this illuminating work is the refutation of myths, false perceptions and stereotypes fabricated by the mass media. As already mentioned, many Christian Zionist organizations have a strict policy of not seeking converts. They are not all fundamentalists or biblical literalists nor do they profess to know the sequence of events that will lead to the return of Messiah, and least of all do they want the Jewish people to suffer any more than they already have. Merkley provides abundant evidence that anti-Zionism flourishes on the Christian Left today, but further proof is available inThe New Anti-Semitismby Chesler andThe Deadliest Liesby Foxman. I highly recommend Christian Attitudes toward the State of Israel to all who wish to understand what is happening in this world of lengthening shadows. The book includes notes, a bibliography, references and an index."},{"Title":"Christian Attitudes Towards the State of Israel (Mcgill-Queen's Studies in the History of Religion)","review":"Paul Merkley is an academic historian, with a keen theological interest. He politely and disppassionately cuts through much of the smoke of official church statements and pronouncements. His strongest criticisms are often his generous use of [sic]!Merkley gives us penetrating insights into the main church groupings' attitudes towards Zionism and Israel. He documents the visceral hatred of Israel in the Middle East Council of Churches and how they managed, for example, to pursuade the WCC to sacrifice Coptic protests about persecution on the altar of Palestinian nationalism. He shows how when unity has been jeopardised in the WCC, anti-Semitic anti-Zionism has often stepped in to hold the carriage together.He describes the gradual decline of almost all liberal Protestantism, from headier days of remorse and amazement at Nazi atrocities, into a swamp of post-imperialist, anti-colonialist handwringing for the down trodden, which in the case of the Palestinians ignores their greatest needs, perpetuates their tragedy, bolsters their worst oppressors and remorselessly turns its fire on Israel.He sympathetically portrays the Vatican's modest ascent from actively inciting and participating in anti-Semitism, through its tortuous and frosty antagonism to Israel after the Holocaust, its amazingly late recognition of the state in 1994, to the bland and general apologies of John Paul 2 for past crimes.He reserves much of his warmth, though clearly not his theological agreement, for evangelical Christian Zionists, a movement he helpfully defines. He also documents the beginning of the Lausanne conference's neo-evangelical anti-Zionism and its heirs. My main criticism here is the lack of comment on pre-19th century Christian tradition. Historic evangelical expectation of Israel's return dates well back to the C16th and earlier, it is the anti-Zionists who have innovated.A fascinating and illuminating read for any student of Jewish, Christian and Christian-Israeli relations."},{"Title":"Christian Attitudes Towards the State of Israel (Mcgill-Queen's Studies in the History of Religion)","review":"While informative, this book seethes with prejudicial bias against Traditional Christianity in general and the Eastern Churches and Middle Eastern Christians in particular. It is a magisterial example of the kind \\"modernist\\" bias in Christianity that underpins what is called \\"Christian Zionism\\", which thinks in its heart of hearts that the basic Christian message that Jesus is the Messiah is Anti-Semitic. As a result of this belief, they have become the most radical of supporters of the Jewish State, to the detriment of the native Christian populations of the Holy Land. The living descendants of the first Christians are, in the eyes of the author and those like him, an embarrassing and inconvenient reality, whose existence must be ignored, or whose plight must be more conveniently pinned on their Muslim countrymen, despite these Christians' own near-unanimous insistence that Israel has been responsible for their destruction. When they point out this obvious, verifiable truth and remain steadfast patriots, they are then accused of being \\"Anti-Semites\\"! Much like Jewish critics of Israel must be \\"self-hating\\" Jews, the Christian Arab patriots who defend themselves and the land of Christ from foreign invaders must be Anti-Semites, and their Western sympathizers must be \\"liberals\\". But aren't the real \\"liberals\\" (if by liberal we mean someone who \\"won't take his own side in an argument\\") these Western \\"modernists\\", these \\"self-hating\\" Christian Zionists who are so wracked by guilt over their own hidden Anti-Semitic impulses that they support the Jewish state's war on the region's Christians - the only few Christians left to bear witness as \\"living stones\\" int he land where Christ walked?"},{"Title":"Christian Attitudes Towards the State of Israel (Mcgill-Queen's Studies in the History of Religion)","review":"This book documents how liberal Protestants in the U.S. who have reworked their theology regarding the Jewish people have allowed the prophetic voices of their churches to be hi-jacked by groups like Sabeel and the Middle East Council of Churches and other church institutions that have embraced what can be politely described as a Judeophobic agenda. These institutions have portrayed Israel's efforts to defend itself against enemies intent on destroying it as a Jewish assault on Christian sensibilities and the mainline churches cooperate in broadcasting this narrative. Merkley offers enormously valuable background and history to the conflict. It also provides insight into how putatively progressive Christians have remained silent about the the mistreatment of religious and ethnic minorities in the Middle East. A hugely important book that has not gotten enough attention. A must read for this interested in understanding Christian anti-Zionism."},{"Title":"The Fountain of Arethusa","review":"The Fountain of Arethusa is a great novel. It is about a priest in a small village. He is opposed by the local shop owner, Jacques, who opjects to the priest's understanding of sin and right living. Jacques is living and having children with a woman while his wife is ill.The story builds rather slowly, but it is well worth the read. A young woman who is crippled helps the priest but Jaques is setting a trap for the priest. In the village there is a murder and the priest is accused. I do not want to give more away, but suffice it to say that there are unexpected twists and turns. Through the novel I found myself pondering deep theological questions about honesty, confession, justice, and how to face evil. The ending is very compelling. My only concern about \\"The Fountain of Arethusa\\" is about the title. I am perhaps just missing it, but it does not seem to tie into the story.

I had no idea that tribes like the Pequots existed -- most tribal members with 1/64th to 1/128th Pequot blood at best and no living culture! This book is a real corrective to the sterotypical perception of tribes today. I just read it and urge everyone --Indian and non-Indian -- who cares about gambling and tribes to pick up a copy.Since I live in Connecticut -- I first heard Fromson on Colin McEnroe's radio show on WTIC -- and subscribe to The Hartford Courant, I read the absurd attack on the book by the head lobbyist from the Indian casino tribes that someone from Oklahoma -- most likely another Indian casino lobbyist -- has posted on this site. Well, here's what the author said in reply in last Saturday's Courant. I thought it explained really well the real agenda behind the casino lobby's attack on this work of investigative journalism.Here's what the author wrote in reply in The Courant last Saturday:I am the author of &quot;Hitting The Jackpot: The Inside Story of the Richest Indian Tribe in History,&quot; which tells the remarkable story of the reinvention of the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation and the creation of Foxwoods casino.My book is the first to take readers inside a casino tribe, show the gritty reality of such groups and reveal how they are created.Based on exclusive interviews with tribal members, confidential documents and interviews with key governmental and tribal advisers and leaders, &quot;Hitting The Jackpot&quot; raises serious questions about the proliferation of casino tribes with massive gambling operations in urban and suburban America.&quot;Hitting The Jackpot&quot; has received uniformly favorable reviews from the mainstream press, including The Washington Post, The Boston Globe and The Courant.Why, then, is an attack on my book published as an op-ed in this newspaper by Ernest L. Stevens Jr., chairman of the National Indian Gaming Association in Washington and a member of the Oneida Indian tribe [Feb. 15, &quot;Resilient Pequots Should Be Applauded, Not Criticized&quot;]?Stevens does not question a single fact in my book, yet he calls it &quot;a vicious and racist attack on American Indian identity in the 21st century.&quot; Nothing could be further from the truth.As one Pequot tribal leader wrote me in a letter dated Dec. 5, 2003, &quot;Thanks for your honesty and effort with this book.&quot;A second Pequot, the matriarch of another tribal family, telephoned to say how much she appreciated the book and to thank me for &quot;telling the truth.&quot;In truth, the Indian gambling lobby attack stems from the attention my book has attracted wherever Indian casinos are popping up.That is unacceptable to lobbyists like Stevens, who are paid to protect these lucrative gambling franchises.Such people try to pre-empt debate by cynically playing the race card.They seek to impugn the motives of anyone independently investigating casino tribes, Indian gambling and the social costs imposed on the public.They do not want to be held accountable. They do not want the citizenry to be better informed about this special interest and how it often works contrary to the public interest.Brett D. Fromson, SalisburyNuff said!"},{"Title":"Hitting the Jackpot: The Inside Story of the Richest Indian Tribe in History","review":"I was 80 pages into this book the first time I picked it up. And I don't even like gambling! While seemingly a factual account of the creation of the Foxwoods casino, Fromson's book is also superb America story. It opens with a historic battle -- very interesting -- and Fromson cleverly utilizes the sordid legal trail this is America's relationship with its indigenous people, as a way to trace how Foxwoods came to be. In fact, what is ultimately a story behind the best payoff in history -- nearly vanished Conn.-based Indian tribe cashes in to the tune of billions -- is also a document that testifies to social and cultural issues. While it is a must read for those interested in gambling, it is absolutely a must read for lawyers (due to the superb tracing of Foxwood's legal right to exist) as well those interested in American history and Native Americans. I'd advise college professors to give the book a whirl in the classroom. Given Fromson's financial writing background, this book is best describe as being in the genre of Michael Lewis (Liar's Poker/Moneyball). Factual history made interesting thanks to superb storytelling skills from the author."},{"Title":"Hitting the Jackpot: The Inside Story of the Richest Indian Tribe in History","review":"As a local and semi-frequent guest to Foxwoods I had to read this book. I couldn't put it down. Fromson realy makes you feel the emotion that is evoked from this true life account of the rise of the Mashantuckets from their near extinction. You feel excited for Skip when he wins (with great luck I might add) all of the legal battles, and you feel anger at how the &quot;minority majority&quot; handled their new wealth. I can definately say that I have a new outlook on the Mashantuckets...this book draws you in, makes you want to know more. Well written, and a must read for anyone who lives in CT (especially SE CT) or has heard of the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation."},{"Title":"Hitting the Jackpot: The Inside Story of the Richest Indian Tribe in History","review":"A good book on a fascinating subject. One of the things I got from this case history is that a few committed bureaucrats and lawyers can massage the system in such a way as to turn a couple hundred folks with a very tenuous link to the First Nations into fairly powerful and semi-rich people.I feel that the First Nations were the victims of a massive injustice and deserve any break they can get. What shocks me is that the Pequots who run Foxwoods are raking it in without really being victims of anything.Anyway, a fascinating book told in a pedestrian style. But one of the sloppiest editing jobs I've ever seen. Typos and repeated phrases are inexcusable in a pricey hardcover release."},{"Title":"Hitting the Jackpot: The Inside Story of the Richest Indian Tribe in History","review":"Hitting the Jackpot is an extraordinary tale, expertly pieced together and wonderfully told by Brett Fromson. How is it that one man, a bit of a boozer and adrift in his own life, could seize on his memories of his difficult grandmother - an irascible old woman, one-eighth Pequot Indian - and her possession of and passion for a nearly forgotten piece of land in Connecticut and, over a period of 20 years, lay legal claim to that small reservation, expand it, attract a motley group of distant relatives and friends to it, and in the process create a modern day Indian tribe and enormously successful gambling enterprise - Foxwoods - all out of thin air? Skip Hayward, working with idealistic but also brilliant lawyers, turned his gossamer-thin Pequot legacy into a uniquely American success story.In effect and thanks to the skill of their lawyers, Hayward and his relatives pulled a fast one. This was an artful manipulation, a slight of hand (made possible in part by 100 years of baked-in guilt over the American Indian experience) visited upon indifferent bureaucrats and contribution-seeking but inattentive politicians. Hayward, singular in his drive, creates a new Pequot tribe as a means to an end - to secure the land and develop a business. The members of this new tribe - many of them raised in the inner city and surprised to learn that they are \\"Indian,\\" - migrate to the reservation on the promise of free housing and easy money.Little is known about the original Pequot Indians. There is no inherited culture, no Pequot songs or dances passed down through the generations. One of the most telling moments in the book comes when members of the tribe are visiting the Polynesian Cultural Center in Hawaii and are asked to sing a traditional Pequot song. Fromson writes, \\"Instead, they sang \\"You are My Sunshine;\\" it was the only song everyone knew.\\"In the end, the Pequot tribal members are simply lottery winners who draw down huge sums of money but live aimless, dependent lives. It is an improbable story, a quintessentially American tale that is notable both for what Hayward and the lawyers accomplished and for the ultimate emptiness of that considerable achievement. As one tribal member says, \\"This tribe was brought together by money....Money is what this tribe is about. Let's face it. That is the reality. We are here because of the money. I am here because of the money. My family is here because of the money. That is what this tribe is about.\\"Brett Fromson has written a terrific, compelling story. Hitting the Jackpot is a fascinating read; it is also a sobering reminder to be careful what you wish for. While the fabulously successful enterprise that is Foxwoods - and the riches it has bestowed on this accidental band of Americans - looks an awful lot like the American Dream come true, one gets the sense that in this story we are not far, in fact, from the Trail of Tears."},{"Title":"Hitting the Jackpot: The Inside Story of the Richest Indian Tribe in History","review":"The rights and the plight of Native Americans have gathered a lot of public interest in the last two decades. But the growing prominence of Native American Indians has turned into a two edged sword in Connecticut.On the one hand, Indians are getting some long overdue justice. On the other hand, with the help of murky financial backers and questionable politicians, many American Indian tribes have turned to gambling to help them achieve the American dream. The result is not a pretty picture.Brett Fromson, a former Washington Post journalist with roots in Connecticut, is the latest to tell the story of the Mashantucket Pequots, one of the most successful Indian tribes in North America. Foxwoods, the Mashantucket Pequot casino in southeastern Connecticut has grown into one of the largest gambling establishments in the world.Alas the story, as Fromson recounts it, is a nightmare. In his book, Hitting the Jackpot--the Inside Story of the Richest Indian Tribe in History (Atlantic Monthly Press), Fromson describes how the Mashantucket Pequots evolved from a single descendant-- Eliza George, a frail old woman who lived alone on the remnants of a tiny reservation in Ledyard, Connecticut--into a sovereign tribe that had the backing of Connecticut politicians and Arab and Malaysian investors.Fromson's book reads like an indictment. He describes how the pervasive influence of money essentially corrupted an Indian tribe that had questionable historical origins to begin with. He tells how the Mashantucket Pequots and their backers flaunted the regulations under which the federal government is supposed to protect the interests of Native Americans.And, in an author's talk that he gave at the Kent Memorial Library on February 29, Fromson charged that the Bureau of Indian Affairs in the Department of Interior has evolved from an agency overseeing Indian affairs into a \\"corrupt\\" lobbying arm of Native American Indian tribes.\\"I think there is a (need) for the BIA to be challenged,\\" Fromson said in his talk at the Library. \\"I think you have a bunch of hacks who are in the pockets of the tribes. There is no accountability, and where there is no accountability, there is always an opportunity for corruption.\\"Most Americans believe that Indians got the short end of the stick in the first 300 years of American history. In the tradition of fair play that characterizes the American psyche, a large part of the American public believes the Indians should be given certain advantages to compensate them for the injustices they faced.But does that mean that remnant tribes or families with sometimes dubious Indian heritage should be elevated to a rarified sovereign status that allows them to live under a separate set of laws from the rest of the American citizens?Fromson writes that a system that was developed to help the Indians has been corrupted by lawyers, business developers and foreign money. The Mashantucket Pequots initially applied for recognition following federal guidelines, but the lawyers, with the help of Connecticut elected representatives (principally then Sen. Lowell Weicker and Rep. Sam Gejdenson), skirted the BIA guidelines and won federal recognition through an act of Congress. Fromson contends that the lawyers intentionally avoided the BIA process because the Mashantucket Pequots could not have met the BIA guidelines for federal recognition.So Congress was persuaded by old fashioned political horse trading to give the Mashantucket Pequots federal recognition-- and that political coup started a process under which the Mashantucket Pequots built a gambling empire. First an Arab bank put up $6 million to create an elaborate bingo parlor, and then a wealthy Chinese businessman from Malaysia, Lim Goh Tong, was persuaded to invest $60 million (under very favorable terms, including a percentage of revenue and the profits) to construct a huge casino on the Mashantucket reservation.The rest was history. Foxwoods came into being, and the Mashantucket Pequots soon became rich beyond their wildest dreams.Yet for the most part true happiness eludes the Indians. Intra-tribal feuds, some of them with racial overtones, have roiled the tribe. Skip Haywood, the grandson of Eliza George, who spearheaded the rise of the Mashantucket Pequots (with the help from two lawyers from Maine), was voted out as Chairman of the tribe, to be replaced by Kenny Reels, a black \\"Pequot\\" from Rhode Island, who himself has since been replaced.Members of the tribe who lived on the reservation were more concerned with their annual \\"incentive\\" awards and their BMW and Mercedes automobiles than with maintaining their culture, according to Fromson; many tribal youths were into drugs; violence broke out on the reservation, and the Connecticut State Police were told to stay off the reservation.Moreover, the Mashantucket Pequot culture does not really exist, according to Fromson. He describes how a huge $250 million museum was built at Foxwoods to celebrate the Mashantucket Pequot culture, but there is little Pequot culture in the museum. Rather the artifacts and exhibits were drawn from all over the Northeast (and beyond) and, at best, the museum celebrates the public perception of the North American Indian culture.Indeed, Fromson questions whether the current Mashantucket Pequot \\"tribe\\" is, in fact, an American Indian tribe.\\"We are the first tribe in American history to be formed around money,\\" says Bruce Kirchner who is a member of the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Council, as reported in the book.Writes Fromson:\\"There has been considerable public skepticism about the genealogical authenticity of today's Pequots. Writers have alleged that none of them descend from the original Pequots. These questions cannot be answered with complete certainty without an independent genealogical investigation and today's tribe will not allow such an inquiry for both political and privacy reasons.\\" Fromson himself questions whether the Pequots could demonstrate any tribal characteristics: In one of the rare moments of humor in the book, the author describes how, when tribal representatives were asked at a Native American gathering to sing a Pequot song, they sang \\"You Are My Sunshine\\" because it was the only song all of them knew.Fromson's book is not the first about the Mashantucket Pequots. The first book about the development of gambling in southeast Connecticut was Without Reservation, by Jeff Benedict, published in 2000. Revenge of the Pequots--How a Small Native American Tribe Created the World's Most Profitable Casino, by Kim Isaac Eisler, was published in 2001. Now we have Fromson's version of the history. All three books, in their own way, describe the same events, each with their own unique perspective.All three books also point out how destructive the evolution of Indian gambling casinos has been on the cultural and social structure of Southeast Connecticut. Where once there was a placid, rural environment, there is now a huge tourism industry, complete with huge traffic jams, crime and drug trafficking.Moreover, with their new found riches, the Indians have tried to buy up land and attach it to their original reservations. Fromson describes one incident where the Mashantucket Pequots were not successful in this regard, but he warns that they will probably be ultimately successful in expanding their reservation.Fromson's book is an instructive book, especially for the people of Kent and Northwest Connecticut. In this regard, Fromson is the first to make the link between the Schaghticokes in Kent and the other Indian tribes in Connecticut. As Fromson relates it, the Indian movement was sparked in the early 1970's when the head of the Schaghticokes, Irving Harris, tried to organize the Connecticut Indians. Harris was not successful, but he did bring the plight of the Indians to the attention of the United Auto Workers Union, who took up the Indian cause.In January of this year, the BIA gave recognition to the Schaghticoke Tribal Nation--despite gaps in its political and historical culture. Like the Pequots there are intra-tribal feuds within the Schaghticoke Indians, and like the Pequots, the Schaghticokes have plans to develop a casino--somewhere in western Connecticut, if they can find a community that wants a casino. Bridgeport and Waterbury are considered the most likely candidates for a Schaghticoke casino.There is an axiom that says the past is prologue. Let's hope that the recent past history of the Mashantucket Pequots is not the prologue to the development of the Schaghticoke Indians here in the Northwest Corner."},{"Title":"Hitting the Jackpot: The Inside Story of the Richest Indian Tribe in History","review":"Contrary to the assertions of its paid detractors, this book documents the destruction of the original Mashantucket Pequots, and illustrates their replacement with a \\"tribe\\" of people who would fail genetic testing to determine whether they had any Indian blood in them whatsoever. After documenting Mashantucket Pequot history, it tells the modern story of Skip Hayward, and how he conspired with a cabal of lawyers and lobbyists to establish Tribal Gaming in on the Mashantucket Pequot reservation in Connecticut. It documents how Hayward illicitly increased the tribal roles (with non-Indians) in order to obtain federal recognition, with the ultimate goal of establishing Tribal Gaming and striking it rich. It also tells the tragic tale of how the very non-Indians whom Hayward invited into the tribe ultimately turned the tables on Hayward and his family, driving them from leadership of the tribal council, and the abuses the new \\"tribe\\" engaged in. \\"Hitting the Jackpot\\" is a cautionary tale not only to the people of Connecticut and their politicians, but also to American Indians throughout the country who would pursue Tribal Gaming as a way to become rich.

STEVENS JR.I have been observing with dismay the publicity that has followed the publication several months ago of Brett Fromson's book &quot;Hitting the Jackpot: The Inside Story of the Richest Indian Tribe in History.&quot; As an American Indian and a member of a federally recognized tribe that also has a successful casino, I can no longer keep quiet about this book and its underlying messages.The book is, at its core, a vicious and racist attack on American Indian identity in the 21st century. That its author is also making the rounds as an expert on Indian tribes and Indian gaming is extremely distressing; and I suspect I am not the only Indian person out here who is deeply offended by the &quot;expertise&quot; that he is toting to his primarily non-Indian audience. The Mashantucket Pequot Tribe has proved to be an easy and - I also should point out - probably quite lucrative target for the author.The words &quot;genocide&quot; and &quot;holocaust&quot; come to mind when I think about what happened to the Mashantucket Pequot people - and other Eastern tribal peoples - following the arrival of Europeans to the North American continent. In the 1637 Pequot Massacre at Mystic, upward of 400 Pequot people, many of them women, children and elderly, were burned alive in their homes or killed as they confronted the English, who brandished both guns and swords. This is one of the most gruesome examples of the slaughter of Native peoples that became commonplace during the early years of this country.The Pequot Massacre was not an isolated incident that occurred among the tribes of the East Coast, although it probably ranks as one of the most horrific. I'm sure, though, that none of us heard about it even two decades ago, before the Mashantucket Pequots began their casino gaming operation in 1992.The Pequot people, like so many others, suffered greatly following that massacre. Many were sold into slavery and ended up far away from their homelands. As people do everywhere, they had to adapt to survive. But, despite the diaspora of the Pequot people over time, it is important to note that a few of them chose to remain on their ancestral land.Now, all these centuries later, the Mashantucket Pequot people have experienced a renaissance. And it is because of their financial success that they are now being attacked.Is it any fault of our brothers and sisters of the East Coast that they experienced the horrors of European encroachment well before any of the tribes west of the Mississippi encountered the white man? Too many of the East Coast tribes, their names remembered only as place names - for example, the Potomac and Anacostia tribes that once lived in the Washington, D.C., area - were either greatly diminished or decimated in the early days of this country. The Pequots, cut down as they were by massacre and forced migration, somehow managed to survive and to hang on tenaciously to what little they had left of their culture. They should be applauded, not criticized.It is shameful for Fromson to belittle a people like the Mashantucket Pequots for what they have lost and for what they are trying so hard to reclaim - their culture. Indian people all across the country have had to adapt their cultures to survive into the 21st century. This is nothing new. To think otherwise is to keep Indian people stuck in the past. This is one of the most prevalent stereotypes of all - ranking right up there with the still widespread belief that Indian people live in teepees, wear buckskin robes and ride horses. Of course, an even more contemporary stereotype is that all American Indians own casinos and, as a result, are rich.At the heart of all this, of course, is jealousy about a tribe's financial success. Indian gaming has provided a better life for many Indian people. Finally, a few of us are catching up to the &quot;American dream.&quot; However, there are those who would prefer to keep the Indian down. Don't tell me this isn't true. It was long the policy of our federal government. Only it didn't work. And today we have tribes such as the Mashantucket Pequots, who have overcome the odds.It is no fault of a people that they were almost wiped off the face of the Earth. We all should be celebrating the Mashantucket Pequot peoples' renaissance and not perpetuating these damaging stereotypes and myths about who is and who is not &quot;Indian.&quot; Only Indian people can do that for themselves.Incidentally, most Americans do not know that Indian people have long had to carry identification cards proving who we are. I can think of no other group in America that has had to prove their identity in this way.Ernest L. Stevens Jr. is chairman of the National Indian Gaming Association in Washington.

I also read other books on the subject, but found them to be either heavy on theory with very little practical info, or the original theory was oversimplified and hardly resembled Elliott's original ideas.As a university professor of mathematics, I often am faced with the challenge of teaching difficult concepts to an audience of varying abilities. I quickly realized that Poser's presentation of the material is a lot like my own presentation style: a careful balance between theory, examples (and non examples), and applications. This approach gives the reader a sense of accomplishment early on in the material and creates an excellent learning environment.I especially appreciate the way he helps the reader build a truly practical trading plan based on EWT. The trading plan is developed in Chapter 5 and then applied to various markets in Chapter 6.

He delivers on both counts.Poser eschews the mysticism some Elliott Wave authors revel in, and instead cuts right to the pragmatic applications it holds for traders and investors. He offers a straightforward approach to developing sound wave counts and reasonable alternative wave counts.The trading plan walk-through with complete examples, offer the new trader a solid foundation to build on and a professional-grade example to emulate.

Then I got the other book and the Red Sea parted for me and my trading accounted benefited greatly. So this was not a good book to learn elliott wave principle, in my opinion."},{"Title":"Applying Elliott Wave Theory Profitably","review":"I recently completed the CMT (Chartered Market Technician) exam process- this is a professional exam for technical analysis, consists of three levels. The third level has a substantial section on Elliott Wave. I have read other books on Elliott, but this book was in my opinion the best written. Mr. Poser made a difficult subject much easier to digest. The real strength here is in discussing what NOT to do when using Elliott Wave- by keeping these tips in mind you will find you can readily apply the techniques to charts from various financial markets.I highly recommend this book to anyone taking the CMT exam, especially those who don't use Elliott Wave in their trading and/or analysis."},{"Title":"Applying Elliott Wave Theory Profitably","review":"Poser has put together a very good book. He shows you how to use Elliott Wave without turning it into some sort of mystical religion. He does not say that there are times that you cannot trade with Elliott, but he does tell you what to look for when the patterns start to get sloppy. He also shows you how to do your research (and turn it into a trading or investing strategy) and very importantly shows the link between market psychology and the wave patterns. The book also explains how to use Elliott along with technical indicators and classic chart patterns.No book is perfect, and although Poser does give you detailed trading plans, and also presents some trading tips, I wish he would have made the tips a more consistent feature throughout the book. His clear writing style and clear depth of knowledge makes this an excellent choice for somebody who want to learn how to use Elliott Wave and why it actually works.In the end, the book is aimed at showing you how to use Elliott to trade, which is why this book is a buy for anybody interested in learning how to use the Elliott Wave Principle in their trading."},{"Title":"Applying Elliott Wave Theory Profitably","review":"Having read and reviewed a number of books on Elliott Wave theory, I found this one to be much more helpful to me than any of the others.I strongly agree with the author that Elliott Waves make more sense when considered in the context of other fundamental and technical information, the business environment, and key social circumstances. I found the way he described how to combine these data to be the most valuable part of the book.The issue of Elliott Waves or any other technical tool is that it is ambiguous what is going on at any point in time. Even after the fact, many technicians will disagree about what the charts show. So how do you decide what trade to make? This book contains many excellent detailed examples that will help you understand, and gives you a format to follow for the future. The essence is to find potential trades with much more likelihood of gain than loss . . . and a gain potential that is much larger than the loss potential as well. How do to that is well described here for stock indices, stocks, bonds, currencies, and commodities.What if you just want to better understand Elliott Waves? The book is superb in that dimension, as well. I found that I improved my understanding of how to apply Elliott Waves to stocks by looking at how they work in commodities more than I would ever have simply by looking at lots of stocks.Mr. Poser is a clear writer. The material is dense though. You are taken through detailed analyses of many charts. These discussions take time to think through, but are rewarding. I recommend reading the book in small bites. I reviewed about 5 pages a day, and found it worked well at that pace.I especially enjoyed the last chapter where Mr. Poser took a look at what may lie ahead for the stock market.After you finish this book, you should probably read something by Robert Prechter as well.After you finish this fine book, I suggest that you look for yet more technical tools to help you understand how to make better investment decisions. If you decide that rapid-fire trading isn't for you (it certainly isn't for me), remember that you can outperform 90% of all investors by putting your money into indexed mutual funds."},{"Title":"Applying Elliott Wave Theory Profitably","review":"Most of the literature on technical analysis focuses on easily compuerized techniques, such as moving averages, momentum divergences, volume/price comparisons, etc.The authors of these books advocate a mechanical approach to technical analysis, and stress the benefits of objective rules to reduce emotional errors. These techniques have become quite sophisticated, from examining the effect of various money management algorithms, to using out of sample data to test the ability of the system to trade in different conditions.I do not dispute that these techniques have substantial value for some traders. Yet, for all of this sophistication, I think most of this research is of limitted utility, for the simple reason that past performance has NO RELATION to future results. If a clearly definable system is discovered by a significant number of people, the markets inevitably change to render that system useless.Then, once the system is deemed useless by the majority, it's likely they will turn profitable again.Even system traders need to understand market psychology and logic in order to develop robust systems. This book will help them do it.Mechanical systems neglect the underlying psychology of market participants. In an environment where the only constant is change, a successful trader needs an underlying philosophy to guide him on what is likely to lead to profits NOW, as opposed to what has happened before. This is where Mr. Poser's book comes in.Poser teaches you that technical analysis is about understanding CURRENT market psychology. He does this through the framework of Elliott Wave theory. He also stresses the importance of other factors--including classical technical tools, computerized techniques, fundamentals, and intermarket relationships relate and enhance the interpretation of Elliot wave theory.He describes how to develop detailed trading plans that take into account these various factors. As someone who focuses heavily on price patterns and momentum indicators, this is a method that I had sort of stumbled upon independently, as I have gained experience trading the markets.It isn't mechanical, but it is clearly a logical and flexible framework for those up to the challenge of discretionarly trading."},{"Title":"Applying Elliott Wave Theory Profitably","review":"I've traded off and on for years now (Forex) and though I've done moderately well, it wasn't worth the anxiety I suffered watching each tick play out.I need to feel comfortable and confident with my trading. I also needed to know when to anticipate best entry/exit.This book not only allowed me to do that but it GREATLY decreased the size of my losing trades. No matter what, you will have losers but with this book you will know when your trade has taken a turn for the worst and get out quickly.Another huge advatage I gained by reading this book is that I no longer sit by my computer watching the ticks go by. I now enter a trade and forget about it. I check in every morning and evening to see if my limit or stop was hit and to review my charts a bit but that's about it.Charting has become entertaining rather than a task. It's amazing when you start seeing these patterns jumping out at you.Now I will also add here that Wave Theory alone is NOT enough.

I can honestly say that this book and Mr Poser's approach as depicted in this book has turned me from struggling trader to an excelling trader.For novice to expert I would highly recommend this book ( If I were a dictator I would force it on the people )because by using this book you are unlocking the secrets of the market forever.The way Mr Poser takes you through the trading plans and adds more and more evidence enables the average man to unlock his destiny and outperform many a portfolio manager!Thanks Mr Poser for this book , it has had a huge effect on the destiny of my trading career as well enriching my whole lifeAfter this book I know where I am in the market , why I am there in the market , where I am going in the market and believe it or not - even how long it will take me to get to where I am going in the market.A must read for every every trader."},{"Title":"Applying Elliott Wave Theory Profitably","review":"this book is well written and laid out beautifully. the author first explaining what each chapter is about; he slowly guides you along on the subject at hand -- how to use elliot wave theory profitably.he starts off by discussing how we should read the waves. the basics of each wave. these are discussed in a clear and concise manner.he constantly emphasises on the need to combine various factors like the economy, using indicators, reading crowd psychology etc, into reading the waves. the intersting thing about this author is that he is trying to teach how the reader should be 'street smart' in wall street...the next few chapters would see the author sharing some of his analysis to show you how to apply elliot wave theory profitably. this so that you can see how to apply what you've just learnt.in the final chapter, he tries his hands at doing some predictions using what he just wrote on the dow jones, the US$ and the nikkei.i'm giving only 4 out of 5 stars because i find some discrepencies in chart references. a few charts are not labelled as the writer referred to. causing some minor confusions. however, the content and presentation of this book is excellent. the best book on eliiot wave i've read."},{"Title":"Applying Elliott Wave Theory Profitably","review":"I am a CMT (Chartered Market Technician) -- for the exam process of the CMT, which is a professional exam for technical analysis that demands a significant amount of knowledge on Elliott Wave analysis, I had to read many books on this subject and it was difficult to ascertain a useful book on this subject; this book undeniably gives you a credible approach to Elliott Wave analysis. Indeed, in terms giving the reader an approach to any market (e.g. bonds, equities, commodities or currencies) this book is written in the most useful manner that I have read on this subject. In particular, it gives the reader a practicle methodology in approaching the markets so as to enable you, the practitioner, to break the market down within this type of analysis on a step by step basis, if you will, that is logical. I recommend this book without reservation!"},{"Title":"Applying Elliott Wave Theory Profitably","review":"Finally, a book on Elliot Wave that is easy to read and understand.Poser does a geat job of showing how to use Elliot Wave without trying to make it sound like you need to join a cult to do it.The book gives multiple trading examples (stocks,currencies,futures)and shows you how Elliot relates to other technical factors as well as market sentiment and even the fundementals.The book highlights some of the differances between short-term and position trading an there is a chapter on his take on how to use Elliot in more cyclial markets,such as bonds and currecies.Of course,there is the obligatory market forecast chapter as well.He not only provides a forecast of the U.S.stock market,but also for the Japanese Nikkei-225 and the dollar."},{"Title":"Applying Elliott Wave Theory Profitably","review":"I have always found the Elliott Wave Principle hard to explain and harder still to use in practice. I have read books by others like Balan and of course Prechter and Frost but Steve Poser takes a subject I struggle with and makes it clear and understandable with current real-world examples.

Happiest Baby taught me the basics of colic and how to soothe the baby. Your Fussy Baby gave a more indepth analysis of colic but most importantly made me realize one thing - lack of sleep and colic go hand in hand. Once I realize that, I started sleep training. The Baby Sleep Solution worked wonders for us.

I HIGHLY recommend both this book and \\"Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child\\" by Marc Weissbluth.We survived colic. Our son has slept in his own crib since he was born, and was sleeping 12 hours a night since he was several months old.I will never forget Weissbluth's motto, \\"Sleep begets sleep.\\"Do yourself (and your baby) a favor and buy this book. Skim the studies if you need to, but follow his instructions.By the way, he does not advocate \\"crying it out\\" all night long or anything. Everyone I know who are against a little harmless crying (as explained in the book) and strict schedules are still weary eyed zombies with problem sleepers at the age of four. Good luck, folks. I am enjoying my sleep-filled nights and my son is a well rested, well adjusted, happy child!I do want to mention that infants with extreme fussiness/colic DO NOT NECESSARILY grow up to be difficult children or poor sleepers. Quite the contrary! I did not agree with that aspect of the book."},{"Title":"Your Fussy Baby","review":"If you have a colicky baby, don't waste your time or money on this book. I only gave one star because the book might be helpful for the 80% of people with \\"common fussy\\" babies.

I had a baby who simply would not stop screaming, who was impossible to get to sleep, and who I spent the entire day rocking, holding, carrying. I had Weissbluth's &quot;Healthy Sleep Habits&quot; which is a very good book, but it was hard for me to figure out exactly what to do with my colicky, fussy child. I thought I was either an idiot or completely insane because I could not for the life of me recognize his &quot;drowsy cues&quot; - well, as I have gleaned from this new book, colicky babies often don't exhibit them or they are incredibly difficult to recognize.This book perfectly addresses everything we were going through. If I had had this book, I would have been less worried that things were going to go on this way forever. I also would have had a very clear plan of action for sleeping (&quot;Healthy&quot; does go over these things, but for me it was not clear and simple enough for my sleep-deprived, colic-crazed brain). At the time I had Sears's &quot;Fussy Baby Book&quot; and basically it said, &quot;this is the way your child is, you need to learn to deal with it.&quot; Not very comforting, and also not very accurate. Once my child was older, and I understood Weissbluth's sleep concepts better and my kid wasn't chronically overtired (from months of colic) he was no longer a &quot;high-needs child.&quot;Some people blast Weissbluth as that cruel &quot;cry it out guy&quot; but please read this book before you jump to that conclusion. He encourages you to respond to your baby, not leave them to scream from day one. He is a huge fan of breastfeeding. His approach is humane and child centered, but unlike Sears, it is also practical and does take into account what a parent needs in order to be an effective parent."},{"Title":"Your Fussy Baby","review":"I bought several books about fussy babies in an effort to help my 2month old newborn. We've had many bouts of fussiness from the time she was 2 weeks old.Weissbluth denies that there is any correlation between fussiness and the breastfeeding mothers diet as well as denying gastrointestinal problems. I strongly disagree and prefer Dr. Sears fussy baby books because he differentiates between the fussy baby and the hurting baby.My baby was clearly hurting and her cries told me so. Experimentation has led me to conclude that both my diet (which now excludes dairy) as well as acid reflux were overlapping issues causing her pain. By trying a new diet, we saw improvement with gas problems first and then later solved the acid problems with reflux medication. My pediatrician supported my instincts and now we have a much happier baby. She still fusses a little but no longer cries from pain.Some babies are just fussy and some are trying to tell you something. I'm glad I listened. The Dr. Sears book supported my feelings and filled in some of the gaps on things I needed to know."},{"Title":"Your Fussy Baby","review":"If you're looking for a quick fix to soothe your cranky newborn, this is not the book for you. That's because, as Dr. Weissbluth convincingly argues, colic (or extreme fussiness) is still not fully understood.Weissbluth presents the latest research on the problem, including theories on hormonal imbalance and disordered sleep, both of which may be related to \\"exterogestation,\\" the idea that all human babies continue to develop after birth in a sort of fourth trimester. After dispelling most of the popular myths about the causes of and cures for colic, he concludes that the only thing we know for sure is that most babies outgrow it by 3-4 months. Because simply waiting is not an option for most parents, and because, Weissbluth acknowledges, these babies are hurting and distressed, he also provides a list of methods that might work to soothe your child, including swaddling, rocking, music, encouragement of sucking and massage.This book was written with care and first-hand understanding in order to help worried parents understand and cope with their children's symptoms until they outgrow them, as well as to anticipate and prevent sleeping problems after the fussy months are over. Weissbluth had a colicky baby himself, and it is clear that he respects the toll that it takes on frustrated and sleep-deprived families.Weissbluth does NOT advocate letting babies \\"cry it out.\\" On the contrary, he urges parents to promptly respond to crying in young infants (as Sears does, Weissbluth acknowledges that you cannot \\"spoil\\" a newborn by holding, carrying, or rocking). His concern with older, post-colic babies (babies 4-months-old and older) is that due either to intense personalities (which correlate to a predisposition toward colic) or to the necessary coping strategies of families simply trying to survive the first three months of their child's life (strategies like always holding a child until he or she is in a state of deep sleep), healthy sleep habits may be harder to come by. Here, some crying at night and naptime might be unavoidable as parents let their older children develop self-soothing habits and learn to fall asleep on their own. Healthy sleep is as essential to a child's development as healthy food, and Weissbluth offers concrete advice toward that end.Most importantly, the advice works.My only misgiving about the book is its organization. A section on sleep before and after four months might have been better placed earlier in the book; at least, I found that to be the most informative part of the book and one that logically relates to the section dispelling myths about colic."},{"Title":"Your Fussy Baby","review":"After getting tons of advice from different parents, I read this book and began to apply his methods and believe it or not, it really works. People told me not to let my baby sleep alot in the afternoon so she would &quot;sleep good at night&quot; and that could not be further from the truth.I would not say that my baby is &quot;colicky&quot;, but she can be very fussy when she is over tired and that can be very trying on a new parent. She is a much happier baby and we're enjoying the heck out of her now thanks to Dr. Weissbluth. I can't wait to read his other books."},{"Title":"Your Fussy Baby","review":"This is a must read for all parents whose babies are colicky or extremely fussy. Dr. Weissbluth offers effective, sound advice that produces results. As a mother of an extremely colicky baby, it was a welcoming relief to find a book that directly addresses my issues, such as ways to soothe the crying, facts and fiction about colic, and how I can start healthy sleep habits even now.Dr. Weissbluth provided encouragement which eased the emotional rollercoaster of having a colicky baby. I pick this book up at least every other day for continuous support. I highly recommend this book. It has helped me, my husband and our baby TREMENDOUSLY."},{"Title":"Your Fussy Baby","review":"Dr. Weissbluth says a lot of things that make sense. He backs up what he says with A LOT of findings of different sleep studies. He seems open minded to different styles of parenting. He was spot on with a lot of things my baby was doing. The problem with the book is that there is very little organization to it. A lot of what he says seems to contradict itself. The constant comparison of \\"common fussiness\\" vs. \\"extreme fussiness/colic\\" is tiring and confusing to figure out which methods would work for your particular child. it spends about 90% of it's pages discussing different studies that have been done on sleep and MAYBE 10% telling you what you can do for your child. I just wish he had written a smaller, more organized book so I could actually understand what he was trying to explain."},{"Title":"Your Fussy Baby","review":"I adore Weissbluth's first book 'Healthy Sleep, Happy Child' and I bought this one hoping for additional insight since our second child had health issues and fussiness. My son was four months old and I wanted extra tools, insight & advice (in addition to what I got from Helthy Sleep), but was dissapointed. This does not diminish my trust in his advice I just found that this book isn't needed if you have already read the first one.As a cying mom, trying to sleep train her son I was very frustrated with buying a second book with the same information. Weissbluth gives excellent advice (our son now sleeps!) but I would suggest buying this book OR Healthy Sleep, Happy Child but not both, there is too much overlap."},{"Title":"Your Fussy Baby","review":"I LOVE this book. After weeks and weeks of faulty advice that I've been trying hard to follow only to see little to no improvement with my very fussy newborn, I am finally able to see why none of these \\"cures for colic\\" actually work. I highly recommend reading this. I find it helpful not just for the advice about what to do, but also just in terms of how to rethink the fussiness you're dealing with as not a disease that needs treatment but a normal -- if extreme -- pattern that many babies follow but will outgrow. I also love that it focuses more on the importance of sleep than on the many pieces of advice a fussy baby's parent will receive about addressing digestive issues. My baby has no problem with digestion but still has colic."},{"Title":"Your Fussy Baby","review":"This book is so reassuring and helpful for parents that have fussy or colic newborns. It is very informative and gives helpful tips. I also recommend the Happiest Baby on the Block DVD. These days will end, you just need some help to get through them!"},{"Title":"Your Fussy Baby","review":"Since I already bought Dr. Weissbluth's other book \\"Healthy Sleep Habits\\", I didn't actually need to buy this book too.

Not only does it feature two strong female characters who act without the assistance of male heroes, but the stories also read like straightforward adventure stories, rather than typically fantastic superhero adventures. The fact that Black Canary and Oracle exist in a superhero universe is almost completely incidental to these tales (guest appearances by other Batman characters Catwoman and Huntress notwithstanding). The fact that Oracle is a positive role model for the handicapped is just an added plus.Chuck Dixon's gripping plots and terse dialogue are ably assisted by a number of talented artists. Not only do they manage to draw realistically proportioned women, but they put those women in equally realistic, real-world settings.In a perfect world, there would be plenty of superhero comics that appeal to a broader audience than male superhero readers. In that perfect world, Birds of Prey would still be a shining example of quality."},{"Title":"Black Canary/Oracle: Birds of prey","review":"In this book, the girlfriend of the late Green Arrow, Black Canary, gets into and out of all sorts of adventures with the help of Oracle, the crippled, one-time Batgirl. It features the first issue of the comic Birds of Prey, as well as issues that include Lois Lane, Catwoman, Huntress, and Lady Shiva. The interaction between Black Canary, devil-may-care adventuress, and Oracle, the responsible Comissioner's daughter, is amusing. It's a good book full of fun. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys women in action."},{"Title":"Black Canary/Oracle: Birds of prey","review":"BIRDS OF PREY trade paperback explains just how different, yet similar both the Black Canary and Oracle are.

Just so you know, I collect the monthly comic as well. These two characters have something special and they compliment each other well.

That alone (plus the art work is excellent) is worth the price of this book."},{"Title":"Black Canary/Oracle: Birds of prey","review":"The beginnings of the Birds of Prey was a slightly meek one but its good to go back and see how it all started. The trade, written mostly by Chuck Dixon, was decent but seemed to serve more as a Black Canary story than anything else. While Oracle was present in each story she was never shown as indispensible. Huntress shows up in the last half of the book and is very clich&eacute;d. The women overall make a good team but the dialogue made them seem pathetic at times instead of empowered.

With no doubt this is quality and eye-opening information to know and to keep in mind. Yet Tannen's account also provokes widespread fear that people will no longer communicate with one another at the risk of hurting or misunderstanding others.I believe that we should all keep in mind cultural, gender, and ever age differences in using metamessages and communicating through body languages and facial expressions. People might choose to speak indrectly to avoid confrontation or be polite. Yet I don't agree with the fact that &quot;the more contact people have with each other, the more opportunities both have to do things in their own way and be misunderstood.&quot; In a way, Tannen is giving people (especially couples with problematic marriages), an excuse not to talk things out and express what's in mind and on their hearts.Conversations, if abiding all the rules and guidelines according to Tannen, will become manipulative. Everything becomes taboo in the household and people will only feel more isolated. People misunderstand others (in many occasions), because of unspoken bitterness, frustration, and shameful thoughts that don't want to be confronted. They let out frustrated emotions and blow out no small thing like &quot;Where do you want to go dinner?&quot; or some silly little argument that later on becomes fights. People will NOT be able to speak from the heart until they make a decision to be vulnerable and open. Think about why people feel frustrated - because they cannot be completely open about their lives. They are afraid to be confronted, challenged, and even asked how they are doing.Misunderstanding might play a little part, but you cannot solve relationship problem solely by casting the misunderstanding. Deal with deceit and fear in heart."},{"Title":"That's Not What I Meant!","review":"The basic information in this book is invaluable, but the Author's style resembles that of high school student. The book is written in a classic outline style (I'm going to talk about this now), it's impersonal and has cold examples.

Her tired attempts to provoke men into speaking like women. Continously, she propells the notion that men are liguistically-challenged because they don't follow her prescribed patterns of femme-speak.Ultimately, the book bottoms-out by the second chapter. everything else seems a sad reguritation of her previous books. If anything readers have learned about Deborah Tannen is her benign feminism and inability to understand men.Dr. Tannen should resort to her given occupation rather than marketing herself as an author.

The thesis of this book, that individuals should take advantage of metamessage concepts, results in deception. That there is an effect created by tone of voice, language style, speed of speech, etc. etc. cannot be denied. Those interested in communication, however, attempt to eliminate these effects, not take advantage of them. Tannen's information might be put to use to eliminate the dissimulation commonly encountered today, but the more obvious use is to encourage non-verbal misdirection. The most obvious example is our president. I have never seen such sincerity supporting a provable lie. Would that this area of expertise sink without a trace."},{"Title":"That's Not What I Meant!","review":"First, this book \\"That's Not What I Meant\\" is NOT the same as Tannen's later \\"You Just Don't Understand.\\" The latter is about male/female communications. THIS BOOK is about interpersonal linguistic styles.I found this one a revelation -- little differences in loudness, pause length in conversation, the meaning of \\"polite apology\\" -- make all the difference in understanding people from different cultures, or even from different families in your own culture.This book helped me at work, in travel and at home, and I can't recommend it highly enough.For some reason the two titles are hard to distinguish -- quite a few reviewers seem to be referring to the later book. Again, \\"That's Not What I Meant\\" is NOT primarily about male/female communication."},{"Title":"That's Not What I Meant!","review":"If you were to tell me a tiny yellowed 20-year-old plus paperback that looks like it came from a B-rated garage sale would impact me in a hugely profound way, I would have laughed and not believed it at all. Then I might have humored you and bought it for a nickel and thrown it away when I got home.Well I sure learned the lesson of the ages: Never judge a book by its cover!Deborah Tannen presents an incredible and insightful objective analysis of the subtle nuances of \\"linguistics\\". Linguistics is the \\"firewood\\" of speech communication. I never, ever, realized the peculiar mechanics behind a \\"normal\\" conversation, much less a conversation that deteriorates into a major misunderstanding or conflict. This book stands at the gateway as an incredibly informative toolkit that can be used to positively revolutionize communicating within any type of personal relationship.The very instant I began understanding differences in communication styles and other mechanical aspects of communication, I was able to reclaim ground lost to arguments, mistrust, fear, and anger. This book gave me a full toolbox to not only repair broken communication, but to also adapt my conversation style to effectively speak and listen in situations and with people I never thought I could be possible. I don't have to change the world to get them to understand me, I learn how to change me and the way I present myself to the world. And miraculously, the world understands.Just as an example, imagine that you and your spouse have been at odds about something very important to you. Instead of insisting that there's something wrong with her or him, and struggling to make the point over and over so they understand, you were able to reach into a toolbox and pull out a wrench, make a few adjustments, then suddenly it's like talking to a different person. That's how profound conversational style can effect another person. Here's the irony: if you think the loose screws were in your spouse's head, better think again. You use these wrenches on your own loose screws.I approached a conversational topic with a loved one that had been like dropping a lit match into a box of roman candles. Before I started this next conversation, I picked up a handy tool from Tanner's kit. An opportunity presented itself rather suddenly, and I \\"framed\\" my idea with three simple words \\"I'm being direct\\". The worried expression literally fell from her face, she looked me dead in the eyes and said with a smile \\"OK.\\" I paused and thought to myself \\"what just happened?\\" I had her undivided attention AND a SMILE. How hard can it be to talk about anything with a loved one who's smiling at you and giving you her undivided attention?She listened attentively with her eyes square looking into mine, and I did just as I said. I was unquestionably direct. Not only did I get her approval, she became enthusiastic and eager to join me with this endeavor. My head was spinning. \\"Wait? Did I just hear you right?\\" was my first thought, but before I could say anything else, she had my hand and was pulling me out of my chair to start moving with my idea.This book is amazing. Not only has it drastically improved my communication ability, it's also enhanced my observations and \\"feelings\\" about the state of mind of the person I choose to talk with. It allows me to make small adjustments to keep communication forthright and on target.If you've ever spoken the title of this book in exasperation, you need to read it!"},{"Title":"That's Not What I Meant!","review":"That's Not What I Meant! Is a must read for anyone, whether you are gregarious and get along with everyone or if you are constantly at the center of disagreements.This isn't a how to book to solve all your conversational woes. Honestly, I would never expect something so simple as a step-by-step guide for something as complex as conversation. Considering that, Deborah Tannen does an excellent job of showing just how complex a simple conversation can be and how things can go wrong despite everyone's best intentions.This is the only one of Deborah Tannen's books that I have read. And it is the perfect mix of all relevant conversations that most people encounter in their lives. From talking with teenagers to business conversations to gripes from long-time spouses.The result of reading this book has especially helped me feel more comfortable about my conversation skills. Before I read this book, I thought I was the only one that was no good at getting my intentions across clearly, but now that I have learned that confusion is inevitable I finally believe everyone that has said that I'm actually pretty normal and surprisingly flexible in my style (most likely because I was so hard on myself before). It also gave me some ideas on how to better get along with some of the people that I previously thought were too pushy or quiet etc.I just finished this book for the first time(I'm planning on reading it again) and I am still absorbing much of the content. But I already feel as if I have gained a new understanding of the past misconceptions-turned-verbal-fights that I have had with friends and family. I'm planning on giving it to my parent's to read (their conversational styles are very different and they get into a lot of needless bickering matches because of it).I think this book is a great step into metacognition (thinking about thinking) and becoming more introspective (Looking inside yourself) for the purpose of being conscious of things that are subconscious and that you take for granted."},{"Title":"That's Not What I Meant!","review":"This is a great book if you and your spouse are fighting over very minor things. Or if people take you the 'wrong way' when you say something."},{"Title":"That's Not What I Meant!","review":"Deborah Tannen's That's Not What I Meant: How Conversational Style Makes or Breaks Relationships (NY: Ballantine Books, c. 1986) addresses the totality of personal relationships; she suggests that all communication, to a degree, is cross-cultural. Thus the study of language--linguistics--may help us form and preserve more healthy relationships.Too often we assume that if we try to speak honestly and share our feelings, communication takes place. Unfortunately, we can be mutually unintelligible in our honesty! \\"The belief that sitting down and talking will ensure mutual understanding and solve problems is based on the assumption that we can say what we mean, and that what we say will be understood as we mean it. This is unlikely to happen if conversational styles differ\\" (p. 116).Unless we learn how to speak and listen accurately, we may never understand what others are actually saying. There's a difference, for example, between transmitting information and establishing an atmosphere of politeness, both of which may be accomplished through conversation.For the real \\"meaning\\" within a conversation resides in its \\"metamessage\\" rather than its apparent details. So we enshroud our words with signals, linguistic devices which serve as defense mechanisms as well as facilitate the frequently indirect messages we want heard. The tone of voice, the length of pauses, facial expressions, the use of questions, \\"ritual complaining,\\" jokes, teasing, all add texture to the metamessages of the most ordinary of conversations.Some of the most important metamessages which frame conversations deal with \\"power and solidarity.\\" Titles we use--Doctor, Professor--carry their own message. Whether or not we address a person by his first or last name sets parameters to what's sayable in a conversation. To try to establish solidarity, through the use of first names, where the relationships are clearly power-based, undercuts the legitimacy of the relationships.Thus, \\"Trying to be 'just folks' when you're not can seem hypocritical and provoke resentment when authority rears its head--for example, when a doctor insists that a patient or nurse follow his instructions about medical procedures. And teachers who encourage displays of solidarity find themselves squarely in the power camp when they have to assign grades or make decisions about placement\\" (p. 99). Parenthetically: my students seem to instinctively realize this. Parents must be parents! \\"Parents who try to talk or dress like their teenage children are often chided by the children for doing it all wrong. What the children may be objecting to, at heart, is that their parents are claiming membership in a group they don't really belong to--invokingunjustified solidarity\\" (p. 101). Similarly, the man who calls a female co-worker \\"honey,\\" imagining the word might establish solidarity with her, insults her--though his wife may find the term endearing.Tannen has a probing chapter on criticism: \\"The Intimate Critic.\\" Finally, she offers advice on learning to speak and listen more adequately, helping us think more clearly about the whole communicative process."},{"Title":"That's Not What I Meant!","review":"Looking for better ways to communicate?

Her ideas are well researched, easy to understand and apply.The Re-Discovery of Common Sense: A Guide to: The Lost Art of Critical Thinking"},{"Title":"That's Not What I Meant!","review":"More than one newlywed couple I've talked to describes the first year as a difficult and challenging time, and the insights that this book gives can make the difference between being able to work through the issues and just running in place.I read this book just after our honeymoon, and it was a revelation. Although both my wife and I had a wonderful relationship before we got married, we found ourselves having problems that neither of us understood after we wed. As I read this book I quickly saw that there were issues discussed that paralleled what we were going through. I loaned it to my wife, and now three years later we make it a point to add a copy to any wedding gift we give.Once you read this book, you may see the communication in your own relationships with a clearer eye. Of course, that assumes that you actually understand the text, instead of (as two reviewers here do) simply skim it for evidence of some preconceived political agenda. People who see Feminist conspiracies around every corner will completely miss the point of this book, which is too bad. I suspect such folks don't have much luck understanding the women in their lives either.A good example of the misreading that the Feminist-hunter did is in the claim that &quot;she propells the notion that men are liguistically-challenged because they don't follow her prescribed patterns of femme-speak.&quot; Yet the whole point of Dr. Tannen's book is this: While indirect communication (more common among women) is as valid as more direct styles (more common among men), it is the way someone who speaks in one style perceives the messages from a person who uses another that causes problems. What really made the book enlightening to me was the exploration of how context and meta-messages change that cross-style dynamic, and it helped me understand how my words could be misunderstood, how I might be misunderstanding the words of others, and why the exact same actions after the wedding could have totally different results than they did a week earlier.My only negative comment about the book is that Dr. Tannen not only doesn't give any advice on bridging the gaps in style, she even states at one point that such efforts are futile. People who use an indirect style, for example, will be offended by a direct discussion of communication styles, because they'll try to figure out &quot;what you're REALLY trying to say&quot;. In fact, once both my wife and I had read and discussed the book, we learned to clear up (if not always prevent) this kind of problem, and it made a huge difference in our marriage. A little less pessimism and a bit more guidance would have made the book even better."},{"Title":"That's Not What I Meant!","review":"This book does indeed have a narrow focus, but the subject of that focus--interpersonal communication--has far reaching implications in any type of human relationship. As was correctly stated by a previous reviewer, relationships often suffer from a variety of different problems, ranging from differences in personal habits, to differences in values, to differences in religious views, but that is more or less a given in any relationship, especially one in which people share a domicile. However, it is how those relationship partners choose to &quot;deal&quot; with their inevitable differences &quot;communicatively&quot; that will determine the ultimate success or failure of their relationship. Do they choose to disagree or argue endlessly? Do they insult each other, or call each other names? Do they try to talk over each other,or become violent? Or do they approach each other in cooperative manner, open to each other's different ideas and viewpoints, with a willingness to learn from each other?What Tannen does in this book is show how some of the common communication differences between men and women in relationships have their basis in fundamental differences in the way men and women perceive each other, and relationships in general. And furthermore, that these fundamental differences, often hidden below the surface, can have profound, and often negative, effects on all kinds of relationships throughout a person's life, unless they are brought into the light of day. In effect, what Tannen is trying to do is to get people to be more aware of how they &quot;habitually&quot; communicate, the possible reasons why they communicate in those ways, and how the things they say and do may affect others. In effect, her goal is to empower people to begin--perhaps for the first time in their lives--to really &quot;choose&quot; how they communicate in relationships--rather than being a slave to destructive habits relied on since childhood. I strongly recommend this book for both men and women in ongoing close relationships. Once you have read it, you will never see communication in your relationships in quite the same way."},{"Title":"That's Not What I Meant!","review":"This is my favorite of Tannen's books. It makes some simple but important points about why people have trouble communicating. They talk differently.My favorite comment was about people having different tolerances for pauses after the other person stops talking. For some people it is 10 seconds. For others it was nano-seconds. I wanted to encourage a quiet friend to talk. I found that by counting silently to ten after I finished talking before starting again, made him realize there was a gap to be filled there. An easy trick but I learned a lot from him and Tannen.This is the book to give to friends and relatives, rather than her others that beat the differences between men and women into the ground. Simple but with a sweet and useful message."},{"Title":"That's Not What I Meant!","review":"Deborah Tannen sure takes care of emphasizing her Ph.D degree in linguistics on the cover of every book she writes. And she has every reason to do that, since \\"That's Not What I Meant\\" is a book very influential and full of revelations about... talking.Through many (very many) examples of everyday talk, Tannen... oops, sorry, Dr. Tannen ;-) explains how something very small we said can turn a whole conversation upside down, bringing the opposite result of what we expected. Be it between friends, lovers, or even diplomatic ambassadors, she shows how the way we talk - anything from the tone we say a word to a single finger's gesture - can change completely the meaning of our talk, and gives advice and suggestions on how to talk better and have more successful communication with everyone around us.What I didn't particularly like about this book, is that Tannen is providing far more extensive examples of talk than she is providing explanations and solutions. She does explain things, and at the end, I did understand a lot of things I never really noticed about talking, but I certainly became a bit overwhelmed by the vast number of examples, and many times I couldn't focus on the main point.However, this still is a pleasant book, that is easily and casually read at any time of the day. Given its low price and the practicality of its conclusions, I'd recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"That's Not What I Meant!","review":"This book addresses a problem that is common in troubled relationships and offers some very good advice on how to deal with it. The only drawback that I really see is that the book addresses only that one problem in relative isolation, and troubled relationships often suffer from other problems as well. But, so long as you keep its somewhat narrow focus in perspective, and don't fall into the easy trap of believing that solving this one problem will make everything all right, it is a marvelous tool for improving communications in relationships."},{"Title":"That's Not What I Meant!","review":"Deborah Tannen comes from the point of view of a linguist which is not common in psychology-oriented \\"self-help\\" books.

Escoffier's book fulfills its mandate, but does much, much more. In a very small compass it describes the period 1900-1945, discusses the political and economic questions that took up much of Keynes' life, and paints a rather engaging portrait of the Bloombury group. It is also a surprisingly balanced biography of Keynes. Without wanting to denigrate the series, I fear that the rubric under which the book appears will frighten off potential readers who are neither queer nor under 20 years of age.That would be a mistake. Other than the massive three volume biography, and Heilbroner's witty synopsis of 40 years ago, there is a real paucity of good information about John Maynard Keynes, and an excess of misinformation, maybe even disinformation. This biography can be read in an afternoon, possibly at one sitting, yet it is good enough to recommend to anyone who wants to understand that political and monetary hopes and disappointments of the first half of the twentieth century. Escoffier is not afraid to call them as he sees them, but the result is surprisingly fair and balanced, even if I would not have phrased some things the way Escoffier did . His stress on exploitation as the hinge on which the Edwardian economy turned gave me pause, but it is not necessarily incorrect. So far as I can tell, Escoffier's views on a number of questions are quite different from those of Keynes, nor is this book a work of hagiography, which makes the overall fairness of the result even more remarkable. In short, I really do recommend that you read this book if you have any interest in any of its topics: Edwardian Britain, the Treaty of Versailles, economics, Bloomsbury, government finance (the Bush administration seems to be radically \\"keynesian\\" in a way John Maynard might not have approved), or being queer in the first part of the 20th century."},{"Title":"John Maynard Keynes (Notable Biographies)","review":"Escoffier(E)does an average job in analyzing Keynes's economics and politics for a young adult just starting out in college.There are some inaccuracies relating to Keynes's sexual orientation over his life span.First,Keynes,like his brother and sister,was sent away from home to board at schools and colleges where the instructors and staff were primarily gay men and women.In such an environment it should come as no surprise that he would adopt a similar lifestyle.Keynes was never gay.A more accurate description of Keynes up till 1922 was that he was gay/bisexual.Keynes met Lydia Lopokova in 1919.In 1922,he started to date her more and more frequently.They married in 1925.Keynes was straight from that time on.The best book on their relationship is \\"Lydia and Maynard\\"(1989).The publisher is Scribners.Escoffier presents no reliable evidence that Keynes continued a gay or bisexual lifestyle after 1924.Given the very negative reception to Keynes's marriage by his former male sexual partners,the evidence is overwhelming that Keynes went straight.The subtitle of this book,\\"Lives of Notable Gay Men and Lesbians\\",is somewhat misleading."},{"Title":"John Maynard Keynes (Notable Biographies)","review":"Although published in a special series, Jeffrey Escoffier's book gives a fair picture of the greatest economist of all times.He draws heavily on R. Skidelsky's first 2 volumes of his magisterial biography of Keynes (the 3rd volume was not published when this book was edited), but he summarizes excellently Keynes's life and work.Economically speaking, Keynes's core message is that in times of economic depression, governments should intervene in the economic process and boost people's income through public work programs. This stimulus is multiplied because part of the injected money is spent again and again.In his characteristic sarcastic style Keynes lambastes the \`love of the possession of money' as a disgusting morbidity. For him, thrift is a semi-pathological propensity. Enterprise is the creative force of the economy: the creation of goods that contribute to the pleasure of human interaction and aesthetic satisfaction.Keynes saw the gold standard as a barbarous, nave and unrealistic relic, surrendering the price level and the business cycle to the US Fed (holder of the bulk of the world's gold supply). Escoffier tells us that the gold exchange standard (use of convertible currency instead of gold as a reserve) was first adopted by the Indian government.Keynes's famous phrase \`In the long run we are all dead' has its roots in his probability theory. He stressed the political and ethical limitations of \`long-term' notions in order to justify policies that are harmful in the short run: \`Economists set themselves too easy a task if in the tempestuous seasons they can only tell us that when the storm is long past the ocean is flat again.'Ethically, Keynes was influenced by the philosophy of G.E. Moore: \`personal affections and aesthetic enjoyments include all the greatest goods we can image.' Keynes's life and loves were a reaction against the puritanical Victorian moral attitude. During a great part of his life Keynes was an active homosexual without the slightest guilt. He even had casual sex with male street prostitutes.His global view of mankind was elitist: \`Civilization was a thin and precarious crust erected by the personality and the will of a very few.'Jeffrey Escoffier's book shows us Keynes as an immoralist, sexually in the Victorian sense, and economically in the classical sense.Not to be missed.N.B. I do not agree with the author that Wittgenstein and Heidegger were the greatest philosophers of the 20th century. I believe Einstein, Heisenberg, Russell and Popper were much more important."},{"Title":"John Maynard Keynes (Notable Biographies)","review":"This book shows a new side of John Maynard Keynes -- one which is not particularly well known.

This is quite simply his essence-\\"The man Christ Jesus is the one giving himself\\" (1 Tim. 2:6). The eternal validity of his history on earth resides in this....The Eucharist is the sacramental form of this event, Christ's giving of himself to the Father and to men. It takes the form of a commemorative meal in which the usual secular significance of the bread and wine is withdrawn and these become bearers of Christ's gift of himself-\\"Paleontologist's Meditation:Fr de Chardin, a Paleontologist in the midst of an expedition out in the Ordos desert, China, in 1923 desired to share the Eucharistic offering on the feast of the Transfiguration, as a Catholic priest. Failing to offer the Mass, he turned to mystical meditation on the radiant presence of Christ in the universe. His thoughts dwelled, to experience his faith in the mystery of the Eucharist as the omnipresence of the divine Word, expressing his feelings in a cosmic hymn. \\"When Christ comes to one of his faithful, it is not simply in order to commune with him as an individual;...words extend beyond the morsel of bread ... to the whole mystical body of Christ.\\"The Mass on the World:In four paragraphs, 'The offering, Fire over the earth, Fire in the earth, Communion, Prayer,' the mystic unfolds his portrayal in enflamed prayer words, \\"Lord, lock me up in the deepest depth of your heart; and then holding me there, burn me, purify me, set me on fire, sublime me, till I become utterly what You would have me be, through the utter annihilation of my ego.\\" So the proud, defiant self-reliance of man in revolt against God could only be truly redeemed through a Christocentric 'kenotic act' of self emptying.Benson's Mysticism:The stories he recounts in the two central chapters, Christ in the World of Matter, and The Spiritual power of Matter, Pere Teilhard has called 'histories,' written in Benson's intimate style that left an impression on him, may have caused de Chardin to be suspect of Pantheistic tendencies. He alludes to St. Paul's expression, 'God being all in all,' which is strictly orthodox, to defends his temperament, even if he could not reconcile his yearnings with his Catholic faith. In the words of his biographer, Nicolas Corte, Pere Teilhard gives his daily offering, 'a cosmic function and planetary dimensions..,'Book's Impact:\\"A truly poetical essay,... at one and the same time mystical and realistic, religious and philosophical.\\" Sir Julian Huxley'The mystic, the poet use language in a way essentially different from that of the scientists,' in response to this claim, which applies very well to the author of these amazing devotions, M. Maritain, has pointed out that, 'the contrast between the poetical language of the mystic and the scientific language of the theologian, may lead to disastrous conclusions, when reading the former as though it were the latter.'"},{"Title":"Hymn of the universe (Perennial library, P 271)","review":"Tielhard de Chardin provides a lift to the soul...this book is a gift to the spirit.

It is NOT an operational history.This book is, quite simply, a monument to the men and ships that formed the backbone of the allied Escort fleet during the second world war.

Editors and contributors seem to have little knowledge of the theological reasoning behind Church teaching or the function of Chruch hierarchy.

This is a big surprise for me because Dr. Duke's book is wonderful.Dr. Duke (he has a Ph.D.) retired from the USDA where he worked as Chief of the Medicinal Plant Resources Laboratory for years. In retirement (he's age 72), he remains active in ReNuPeru, a medicinl herb garden in the Peruvian Amazon maintained by the Amazon Center for Environmental Education and Research. In other words, he has credentials in plant pharmaecology recognized by the U.S. Government.Dr. Duke owns a six-acre farmette in Fulton Maryland where he raises medicinal/food plants. I discovered Duke in a book on herbalist gardens entitled, THE HERBALIST'S GARDEN, by Shatoiya and Richard de la Tour. Both books (Duke and de la Tour) were reviewed by a local garden expert in the Washington Post. The Post article and the de la Tour book contain beautiful photographs of Duke's garden but alas he has included no photographs in his own book (why I gave it 4 stars).I've been growing and using herbs for over forty years (I drank Camomile tea and ate bean and barley soup in the 1960s), and I own a number of books on this subject. Dr. Duke's book on &quot;anti-aging prescriptions&quot; appeals to me because 1) I am older and the book meets my immediate needs, 2) the book is laid out by ailment or &quot;challenge&quot; not by herb. In othr words, I don't have to hunt for salient information.For example, if you're worried about cracking and peeling skin you can turn to Section 22. 'Smooth Skin' and read about the various approaches, techniques, etc. you might use to improve your skin's health. I discovered the flaxseed oil I have been taking for symtoms of menopause is exactly what I need for skin health but I should buy a variant that includes Borage or Evening Primrose oil.Duke has many helpful suggestions including eating what he calls the Paleolithic diet consisting of many servings of vegetables and fruits and fewer servings of meats, cheeses and other dairy items (I'm not eating grubs--nor does he recomend them). And, yes you've probably read about this diet--it's the official USDA recommended diet--but Duke's value-added information is the list of ingredient he pinpoints for health. He explains why prunes, plums and other dark fruit are good for you, and why beans other than soy beans make a difference. To begin your older years (50+) in good health, I recommend you read Dr. Duke's book and practice what he preaches."},{"Title":"The Green Pharmacy Anti-Aging Prescriptions: Herbs, Foods, and Natural Formulas to Keep You Young","review":"This extensive and voluminous work reveals nature's goldmine that can help us live a healthy life and explains how to maintain youthful looks and combat disease through the use of the right supplements and foods.Part One: Beautiful Benefits From The Garden Of Youth, deals with phyto-pharmacy, in other words the miracle substances found in fruits, vegetables and herbs.

As such, they abandon the \\"rational man\\" assumption of the traditional view of human beings and adopt a \\"desiring unconscious\\" model to account for the behaviors of humans. To them, desire exists prior to creation, knowledge, culture, law etc. and thus it is the motor of human action and history. Yet although it has a transcendental essence, desire is not immune to power relations. To the contrary, D&G; argue that power struggles take place exactly over desire, or its control. Thus, the primary aim of the philosophy of D&G; becomes the liberation of desire from external pressures. Put simply, everybody should be entitled to realize his/her desire so long as it is not harmful to others. This idea of liberation of desire leads D&G; to elaborate on the concept of immanence.Immanence or Liberating the DesireWittgenstein believed that most of the problems that we think of as \`philosophical' derive from confusions in thinking. He thus asserted that the first task of a philosopher was to clarify concepts. By contrast, Delueze believes that the task of philosopher is the creation of concepts. Consequently, Delueze developed \\"irrecuperable concepts\\" that escape previously existing systems of thought (p. 11). The concept of \\"immanence\\" is one of them.The heart of the philosophy of Delueze and Guattari (D&G;) can be seen as a challenge to the static and stable view of both human nature and social relations by the traditional (and dominant) social theories. As we have seen before (Thinking Space, 2000), Delueze offers a \\"methodology of continuity\\" whereby he argues that social life (and hence history) is composed of \\"becomings\\" (ands), not beings (iss). In line with that, D&G; maintain there is no \\"subject\\", but only a multitude of contradictory elements; thus, identity is but a changing bundle of unstable, context-dependent traits, which are sometimes contradictory.The idea of immanence (or immanent relations) is central to the above philosophy of D&G.; By immanent relations D&G; refer to the relations of which forms (not existence ) are independent of external forces and of which elements have a mutually dependent relationship. The essential component of such relations is that differing modes should mutually act upon each other and transform each other. When forces meet and interact, the relation that they construct affects their own nature and changes them in the process. As such, \\"becoming\\" becomes the prototype of an immanent relation [because immanent relations change the nature of all parties in that relationship, D&G; also call this process \\"double deterritorialization\\" (p. 38)]D&G;'s philosophy of immanence has important implications for social theory. First, the theorist is not some impartial observer surveying the plane of social relations, but is immanent within the plane (p. 44). This is similar to the classical problem of \\"participatory observation\\" in field research. D&G;'s point is that we all \\"participate\\" in our observations. Second, which is a derivative of the first, their philosophy of immanence leads D&G; to adopt a skeptic view on the possibility of knowledge. Because the observer is immanent within the observation, knowledge will always be unstable and contingent. Moreover, the mutually dependent relationship challenges our conventional dichotomous treatment of the social phenomena as dependent and independent variables. Thus, D&G;'s view is likely to lead one to a chaotic epistemology, for immanence means \\"what\\", \\"when\\", \\"how\\", and \\"why\\" become indistinguishable (p. 69-70).The driving motive behind D&G;'s going into such pain to elaborate on immanent relations was that D&G; sought a relationship that is not mediated by transcendental presuppositions. They resisted historical and cultural determinism by constructing a plane of immanence in a third sense. In their philosophy of immanence the human subject is constituted on the plane of given as a \\"result\\", rather than a \\"presupposition\\". For D&G;, the obstacle that prevents social relations from developing has always been the interest of some third party in the relation (p. 2). As a result, they desire to construct a social space where immanent relations can be produced. Such immanent relations, instead of acting out roles given to them by some transcendental third party, are capable of affecting, shaping, and changing any mediating factors. Thus, D&G;'s arguments on immanence and immanent relations can be taken as both an analysis of and an ideal for societal relations.I Desire, You Desire, We Desire... Oops!Good critiques as they are, to my reading, Delueze and Guattari's arguments on desire suffer from an ailment that is common to most postmodern thinkers: inconsistency. Primarily, the idea of desire as being a transcendental motive is irreconcilable with the idea of social relations as having an immanent character, because the way D&G; define immanence, by necessity, implies that desire also will be created, shaped and changed throughout the process of \\"double deterritorialization\\". And as such, desire will be a social construct. Thus, it cannot exist prior to social interaction. In particular, I cannot conceive the argument that \\"desire exists prior to knowledge\\", because there is no way for one to desire what he/she does not know (D&G; might argue that desire for \`food' is an asocial, and hence transcendental, one. But I guess the concept of desire -especially the way D&G; utilize it- means more than feeding oneself. As such, transcendental desires, if there is any, are exceptions; and rules are not constructed within the realm of exceptions). The desires for sex, security, power, status, money, etc. are all results of social interaction and based upon a \\"knowledge\\" which motivates a person to obtain them. Consciously or unconsciously, people desire what they have knowledge about.Secondly, the argument (or ideal) regarding the liberation of desire is either too nave or bluntly self-contradictory. D&G; contend that every individual should be entitled to materialize his/her desires in a way that is at least benign to others. Yet in a world of limited possibilities and scarce resources, a clash of desires is inevitable. In that situation we have two options: 1) The nave view: Individuals will willingly relinquish some of their desires for the sake of common good because of resource scarcity (but even in this \`highly unlikely' case the desire will not be \`liberated', but will only be \`liberated from humanly restrictions'. The \`restrictions of nature' are still at work, thereby making all individuals still \`repressed'). 2) The self-contradictory option: Everybody will try to materialize his/her desires to the extent possible and will try to resolve the \\"clashing desires\\" problem \\"by any means\\". This will inevitably introduce the issue of power which will eventually situate some people over others and thus result in the repression of the desires of some people, namely the \`losers'. Therefore, there seems to be no \`realistic' way to liberate the desire for anybody, let alone for everybody. Nature makes us repressed, and human beings make us more so. Maybe REM was right: \\"Everybody hurts!\\"The above critiques of D&G;'s philosophy of desire are not to mean that desire has no important place in terms of explaining human behavior. Rather, they were aimed towards dethroning desire from the privileged place that D&G; unjustifiably, and rather inconsistently, elevated it to. Einstein is reported to say that he could explain everything if he was given a constant/stable point of departure. Most social theorist are unfortunately in search of such constant points and some of them claim to have found one (be it \\"reason\\", \\"labor\\", \\"power\\", or \\"desire\\"). Yet such concrete-stable-transcendental points have a tendency to prove to be more \\"fiction\\" than real. It is for this reason that most philosophies start with self-delusions."},{"Title":"This is Rome - a Pilgrimage in Words and Pictures Conduced By Bishop Fulton J.

Rather than explicating Lacan, providing an interpretation of Lacan useful to those not willing to sift through the myriad volumes of Lacan's writings, Gallop instead focuses on proving how clever she is, how she can excise a text with the best of them. However, all her semantic exercises lead the reader nowhere. She clearly knows her subject matter, for which i assign two stars to the work, but the work itself is useless fluff. I can only assume Gallop wrote this to further her career at some univeristy. I wonder, however, when she was writing this, if a moment passed where she doubted if she even cared. I know i didn't. All those years of study, all that time disecting Lacan in French, and Gallop can do no better than this? Perhaps, though, that's Gallop's point. Since, according to Lacan, the unconscious is constructed by the Other as language, Gallop merely wishes to prove that the Other was ultimately responsible for this work.Potential buyer beware. You'd be better served to read any Slavoj Zizek work or Fink's The Lacanian Subject, both of whom provide incredibly insightful commentary on Lacan without trying to prove their own cleverness. Ok, maybe Zizek attempts to be a bit too clever, but he's fun to read. And you get something out of his work when you're finished."},{"Title":"Near Eastern Seals (Interpreting the Past)","review":"Collon's book provides an excellent overview of Near Eastern Seals.

I don't know how many people today could understand or comprehend a book written by Grace Livingston Hill. I own every book she has ever written. I have read them over and over. She tells about a time where Christ was the center of the main character's life. If he wasn't the center when the book started, he became the center when the book ended. There is poverty, hard times, better times, involvement in and out of church, generally a kind and wonderful old mother or father. They all have their tribulations and trials, but, they persevere and hold strong to their religious beliefs. They keep themselves apart from the things in the world that they consider \\"worldly\\" and not Christ like. These books are Christian romance books always with happy endings where the boy meets the girl and they get married. How many would fly today?

They unmask the lies and distortions the anticommunists have identifying Stalinism with communism. Read these speeches if you want to know the nuts and bolts, the strategy and tactics, and the way to organize, not for the past when these speeches were given, but for the our present where we need these ideas."},{"Title":"The First Five Years of the Communist International, Vol 1","review":"A deep political and economic crisis shook the world during the years leading up to and immediately following World War I and the Russian Revolution. Millions of workers and peasants were disgusted with the bloodletting of the war (made possible, in large measure by the betrayal of revolutionary internationalism by almost all the best-known leaders of the pre-war socialist movement).Millions were further angered by the rapacious, so-called &quot;democratic&quot; peace of Versailles, which saw the victorious allies fall viciously on the already war-ravaged economies of Germany and its allies.Many of these workers began to radicalize, inspired by the positive example of the achievements possible even in one of the most backward countries in Europe when the government of the Tsar was overthrown and replaced by a government of workers and farmers led by a genuinely communist party. They sought to build such revolutionary organizations in country after country to emulate the Bolshevik road to power.For its part, the Soviet Communist Party looked to politically organize these advanced workers of the world--knowing that by themselves they could not sustain indefinitely the work of building socialism in an isolated USSR without additional revolutionary victories.These advanced workers from around the world joined together to form the Communist International. These two volumes feature speeches and articles by Russian revolutionary leader Leon Trotsky prepared for the first five congresses of this new organization. These are the congresses that took place before the political degeneration signified by the rise of Stalin. Their relevant and helpful discussions can be a big boost to an understanding of the challenges facing fight-minded workers and farmers today.What economic and political conditions on top of the regular boom-bust cycles of capitalism give rise to a working-class radicalization? How do the economic concessions made by the ruling rich, which can slow down such a radicalization for a certain length of time, only contribute to the deepening of the crisis of bourgeois rule in the longer term?A particularly interesting aspect of these discussions is the debate over the shift in class relations that took place around 1921 when the immediate possibilities of emulating the Soviet revolution in Germany, Hungary, Italy and some other parts of Europe were supplanted by a new, though temporary, stage of capitalist stabilization. This period also saw the victory of fascism in Italy.The Soviet communists led a fight to shift tactics under these circumstances, urging the development of what they called the united front, an approach by which still-small communist parties could fight to win the allegiance of workers still looking to larger, reformist formations.Grasping the lessons of the weaknesses of the new communist parties and the defeats these contributed to was essential to moving forward in a sober and effective manner. The early history and development of the Communist Party in France is discussed in substantial length, offering great insights into the kinds of lessons in party-building the Russians offered to their co-thinkers around the world.There is also an important discussion of the deepening rivalries between Europe and America that characterized this period. These play an increasingly important role in world politics today, where economic and social conditions increasingly resemble those of the early 1920s that gave rise to the world depression of the 1930s."},{"Title":"The Ethics of Abortion: Pro-Life Vs.

I use the word \\"accurate\\" ...... not because I was there to witness her life but it was almost a carbon copy of my 25 year old life with a sex addict and how it left \\"black holes\\" in the lives of my four children. I digested this book in one sitting because it could also be my life she was writing about.She describes the downward spiral of the addict's personality ....... from charming to demeaningly destructive. The crazy making part is their using what I called, the \\"push-pull\\" method of snaring their victims back into their den, after reducing them to groveling nothingness. Any female who has lived with a sex addict can relate to all of her story. How they suck you back in with sex & promises and you believe it because you want to.It takes a certain type of personality to become a victim of a sex addict or a Narcissistic personality disorder person. It is a timid, shy, quiet, unsure of herself, female, who is unaware she is searching for the comfort zone of her (usually) lonely or abandoned childhood. Most sex addicts come with a touch of Narcissism and can sweep the victim off their feet with a promise of everlasting love.Some parts of the book were very hard for me to read because it stirred up memories that I thought had been long buried. She describes them so well. Especially the parts where the victim blames herself and keeps asking what she had done wrong and then she tries even harder. I am 80 years old & it's been 30 years since I was divorced from my sex addict husband but reading her story stirred up feelings that felt like it happened yesterday. The names \\"Sex Addict\\" and \\"Narcissist\\" were not really coined or commonly used until the 1980's. Back in the 1950's, when my life of confusion began, there was very little public information available. Of course, I totally thought it was my fault and suffered my shame in silence, just like the author described.My divorced sex addict husband recently died from alzheimers and his death has dredged up all the things that the author discribes. That was why I've been searching books for recent information but there is nothing new, just better labels and more accurately described information. There is one thing that leaves an abrupt question in my mind and that is \\"what happened to Ted?\\" Was he ever able to control his sexual urges? Did he ever stay with one woman? Did he make a crazy life for other women, as he did for Emma?This book was written nearly 10 years ago and I hope Emma has become the strong, self assured woman who has found the joy of life within herself. Good luck, abundant happiness and success to you. Thank you for having the strength to write this book."},{"Title":"My Secret Life with a Sex Addict - from discovery to recovery","review":"This book is a fascinating look at life with a sex addicted spouse or significant other. After dating a sex addict for 5 years I always wondered how bad his behavior really could be and I was in denial about how bad it could be. With all the confessions the author's husband made to his wife (Emma Dawson) you really get an inside look at the kind of behavior the man is really engaging in. I was absolutely shocked by the things the husband admitted to doing. After reading this I realized everything was probably much worse than I even realized. I knew my boyfriend was seeing other women from time to time but for the first time I entertained the reality that he could be seeing more than one woman in even a days time. This book is helping me to break away from a situation I have realized is unhealthy. For any woman who is involved in any way with a man who is sexually addicted, I recommend this book and also \\"Love, Infidelity, and Sexual Addiction: A Codependents Perspective\\" by Christine A. Adams as the two books you absolutely must read."},{"Title":"My Secret Life with a Sex Addict - from discovery to recovery","review":"Very well written true experience by the writer.

It is an inspiration for any woman who has ever found herself in a position of isolation and low self-worth due to being a \\"keeper\\" of the secret of addiction. You will experience a sense of community as you read Emma's story and feel the relief of knowing you are not alone. Emma has learned to value her experience and found a wonderful way to share that with others!"},{"Title":"My Secret Life with a Sex Addict - from discovery to recovery","review":"This book is short. I read it one day. I give Emma Dawson 100 stars for her courageously candid book. I can't give this book more than 3 stars because it does not really get to the heart of the addiction or recovery. At the root of any addiction (food, sex, gambling, etc..) is an emotional trauma. I did appreciate Emma's story, and yes it was difficult to read at times. Her husband's words were cruel and typical of the sex addict mentality. They are not his true feelings, he does not know what those are. The addiction clouds the mind of addicts making them very judgmental, unbalanced, irrational, and not the person you once knew. The fact that her husband's behaviors took a toll on her children is really key. Thank you Emma for bring ing this into the light! Many books never talk about the deleterious affects on the family. Incest and molestation are awful enough, but the father's attitude towards sex also confused and corrupted his daughters. That is such an important point. People need to leave these addicts to let them hit their bottom. They don't need to stick by them for the sake of the marriage. The addicts are not thinking clearly and are not safe! When they need a fix, they can even turn to their children. Sex addiction starts with childhood sex traumas, therefore keeping your children away from the sex addict is critical. I liked the book. Definitely agree self empowerment is the answer for all partners of sex addicts!! There is nothing that the other women (men) have that the true spouse does not. It is not a sex competition like so many spouses of sex addicts fear. It is really a compulsion to temporarily pacify a great pain within their soul or psyche (whichever works for you). Partners of these people have not much control in the situation. You can not convince them of anything, the drive for more sexual highs is very strong. The addict must want recovery for self. The addict has to want his/her life back. My favorite book on the subject to date is Lust, Anger, Love by Maureen Canning. I think that describes many stories like Emma's husband, and also the root cause of each story. It is unfortunate to see how traumatic situations create these sexual compulsions. All too often they are things parents think of as \\"loving\\" or \\"disciplining\\" or in some way proper parenting... but it is damaging to the child. Also I recommend the book, Because it Feels Good by Debby Herbenick PhD. This book is full of research on satisfying sex and fulfillment. Again and again it shows that it is the deep connection and bond between the two lovers that creates the satisfaction. It also gives tips for self discovery, activities to boost sex life, and intimacy building ideas. It reminds you what true sexual intimacy and connection is... and guess what... its not like a porno film!!"},{"Title":"My Secret Life with a Sex Addict - from discovery to recovery","review":"If you are currently involved with a sex addict this book will help \\"fortify\\" you. Sex addicts love to blame and point the finger making you feel crazy and awful. The book will also verify that the lying and blaming game being played on you by your spouse is the sex addicts version of AA's for every finger you point at someone else you have four pointing back at yourself. If you are looking for healing I don't think you will find it in this book. But you will find a wake-up call. I gave 3 stars because I found the attempts at \\"self help\\" questions at the end of each chapter kind of a lame throw in. 5 Stars is perfection. That said, the book is well worth the read."},{"Title":"My Secret Life with a Sex Addict - from discovery to recovery","review":"I saw that there were 5 - 5 star reviews of this book and they all seemed to say similar things - it's written from the experience of someone who was married to a sex addict and gives great information for those who might suspect they are etc. I know I'm married to a sex addict but this book was very difficult for me to read and not helpful at all. I was hoping to get some great advice and hope. This book made me think things might be going on that probably aren't and just made me depressed more than I already am. Maybe from the standpoint of someone who specializes in therapy for those recovering from being married to a sex addict the book is helpful but it was way too depressing with way too many details for me (her husband was actually quite cruel in my opinion). Just a warning to someone suffering the affects of being married to a sex addict and is looking for some therapy and hope in a book - I wouldn't recommend this book."},{"Title":"My Secret Life with a Sex Addict - from discovery to recovery","review":"I was expecting it to be a little more story like boot so biography like.

Though part of the low estimation is reasonable (and some of the works in this era testifies to this opinion), many of them are still readable and interesting. And \\"The Law and the Lady\\" should be classified among those neglected pieces.Probably the first full-length novel featuring female detective, the novel follows the story of heroine Valeria, who marries Eustace happily in the opening of the book. However, she discovers behind the happy marriage a terrible secret, which involved an unsolved murder case in her newly-wed husband's past, and soon she realizes that her husband is not exactly what she thought. To clear her tainted (and his) family name, Valeria single-handedly embarks on a job of amateur detective.To fully relish the story, you have to remember several things: one of them is that the book is partly inspired by the real-life case of Madeline Smith, who, it was alleged, disposed of her lover with arsenic. Collins made use of this well-known, sensational case, changing the sex of the accused, and he deftly challenges many concepts embedded in morally strict Victorians. So, when Valeria appoints herself as a detective, her \\"job\\" (in Victorian society in which ladies are supposed not to work, with the possible exception of poorly-paid governess) starts to have another meaning. Collins, on the one hand attacking the insufficient laws of Scotland, which give its unique \\"Not-Proven\\" verdict to the accused when the jury cannot decide whether or not he/she is guilty, also challenges the morally rigid Victorian ideas about male/female concept. This is not to say Wilkie Collins is a feminist; but considering he never married (but, it is generally agreed, had two mistresses), his unique ideas about contemporary males and females are reflected in this seemingly starange work.And as a detective novel, \\"The Law and The lady\\" has still power to entertain us. Though its beginning part is a little shaky because of implausible situations, the book gradually gets you into the thrilling adventure of Valeria, who overcomes all the barriars on her way to the truth. Though the fact that Collins' best work(s) is \\"The Moonstone\\" or \\"The Woman in White,\\" this book is enjoyable. shows some version of Victorian ideas about the roles of males and females.By the way, it is argued that the first fictional female detective (including amateur) is also created by Collins in his short story \\"The Diary of Anne Rodway.\\" (1856) This short can be found in most of the collection of his short stories. But if you know another contender for the first female PI, let me know."},{"Title":"The Law and the Lady (The World's Classics)","review":"Valeria meets Eustace, a man who seems to have few friends and lots of secrets. They fall passionately in love and are soon married. On their honeymoon Valeria finds out that Eustace married her under an assumed name...and that he was never acquitted of the murder of his first wife. Eustace immediately leaves her to protect her from his shame and disgrace.Her happiness crumbles, but she steadfastly believes in his innocence. She makes it her life's goal to prove he did NOT murder his wife, to clear his name. But if he didn't murder his wife, then who did? Women were not supposed to investigate these matters in those days, so she faces lots of opposition, even from her friends.Valeria is a wonderful, strong female lead and the reader can't help but cheer her on in her battles. Along her journey she meets some eccentric characters that brighten the novel, such as Major Fitz-David - a 'major' flirt, and the brilliant, eccentric disabled man named Dexter.I loved this book. After Part One I could NOT put it down...I needed to find out how it ended.It's hard to say anything bad about this book. The only negative to me was reading the views of society at the time. Women and disabled people were not treated with the respect they deserved, and it bothers me to read that. However, Valeria fights against those stereotypes and I greatly enjoyed her small victories.This book has a little of everything...mystery, suspense, insanity, secret diaries, romance, etc. If you enjoy books like Jane Eyre and The Woman in White, you'll probably love this book too."},{"Title":"The Law and the Lady (The World's Classics)","review":"Wilkie Collins is most famous for his classic mysteries, &quot;The Moonstone&quot; and &quot;The Woman in White.&quot; Both were influences to 20th century mystery masters like Dorothy Sayers. In &quot;The Law and the Lady&quot; first published in 1875, Collins focuses on the plight of Valeria Woodville who unwittingly marries a man previously tried for poisoning his first wife. Evidence and testimony could not convince the jury of his guilt or innocence, and an unusual Scotch verdict of &quot;Not Proven&quot; is handed down. He assumes a new name and conceals his tainted past when he marries Valeria. She, however, proves to be a very perceptive and resourceful woman who discovers the truth on her own. Unshaken in her love, she vows to clear her husband's name and reputation in order to secure their future happiness.*** In his signature works, Collins often frustrates the reader's patience with his lengthy narrative style. But &quot;The Law and the Lady&quot; moves along surprisingly well. Despite some ridiculous and dated perceptions about the sexes (Collins frequently has characters and Valeria herself remark that she's &quot;only a woman&quot;), Valeria's actions prove she's admirably keen and the one to get things rolling.*** Collins should also get points for introducing the outrageously campy, scene-stealing characters of the lunatic genius Misserimus Dexter and his devoted, but moronic cousin Ariel. Missing both his legs, Dexter scoots around either like the &quot;new centaur&quot; (half-man, half wheel chair) or on his hands like a &quot;frog&quot;. It's this added element of circus freakshow that effectively ruffles the otherwise creaky Victorian setting."},{"Title":"The Law and the Lady (The World's Classics)","review":"One of Wilkie Collins' lesser known works, THE LAW AND THE LADY is nonetheless a gripping read! Valeria's quest to acquit her husband of the murder of his ex-wife is top-notch Collins. Like token Collins' detective novels, the reader is taken deeper and deeper into the psychology of his characters. Meserimus Dexter is one of Collins' most frightening characters. His mental degeneration within the novel's gripping pages will leave you breathless. Valeria's involvement with the unstable Dexter is some of the most suspenseful reading you are likely to find in modern literature. Highly recommended to any Collins' enthusiast, or anyone looking for a great read."},{"Title":"The Law and the Lady (The World's Classics)","review":"No, it's not &quot;The Woman in White&quot; or even &quot;The Moonstone&quot;, but it's still an excellent story! Collins has created another wonderful strong heroine, and this heroine is out to solve a mystery. Valeria Woodville's husband was tried for murder, and she is determined to prove his innocence, once and for all. During her investigation, she meets Miserrimus Dexter, who is perhaps the most fascinating character Collins has ever created. He certainly makes Count Fosco of &quot;The Woman in White&quot; look like a pussycat! He's the most enigmatic character -- just when you think you have him figured out, you realize you don't know anything about him! Ariel is another fascinating character study. She is worthy of pity, but pitying her is like pitying a pit bull; she turns violent at the drop of a hairbrush. Valeria herself is an interesting subject; she defies everyone, determined to prove her husband's innocence, but towards the end of the novel, she begins to behave a bit erratically. I won't say any more; you'll have to read the book to see what I mean. This is a great novel to curl up with on a rainy night, or maybe on a lazy summer Sunday afternoon -- sometime when you won't be likely to be interrupted, as you won't want to put it down until Valeria Woodville solves the mystery!"},{"Title":"The Law and the Lady (The World's Classics)","review":"Great mystery.

Wilkie Collins novels are all great!"},{"Title":"The Law and the Lady (The World's Classics)","review":"As a general rule I rarely enjoy the novels assigned in classical literature classes but I can usually appreciate the work for its merits. I was pleasantly surprised by The Law and the Lady because it is very readable, the first hurdle in making an assigned piece of literature more than just required text.Though it is tame by today's standards, Collins presents the relatively new concept of the &quot;amateur detective&quot; and even goes so far as to make his protagonist a woman, very unusual (and almost scandalous) by Victorian standards. To make the novel acceptable in the time it was published, Collins is very careful to temper his progressive ideas with plenty of references to Valeria Macallan's feminine weaknesses and multiple uses of the phrase &quot;only a woman&quot; but he constructed a foundation that scores of female writers and characters have built upon. Keep your eye out for parallels to the classic &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; story and how Collins treats the gender role-reversal of Valeria and Eustace.All in all, not an unpleasant book to read if required to do so. Experienced readers will recognize that, despite its faults, The Law and the Lady was very provocative when written and really jump-started the genre of female P.I.s that is so common and popular today. Valeria could be considered the great-grandmother of Kinsey Millhone or V.I. Warshawski."},{"Title":"The Law and the Lady (The World's Classics)","review":"When I was a kid, I was obsessed with Nancy Drew. Not because of the characters or the plots (which even at 9 years old I knew were hackneyed), but because of the stuff -- secret passageways, crumbling old maps, Spanish lace shawls, whispering statues, jewel-encrusted automaton birds, antique lockets with hidden inscriptions . . .This book is the direct ancestor of that genre, although it was ostensibly written for grown-ups, not for kids. Collins seemed to have dreamed up the melodramatic plot and plucky female detective as an excuse to create fantastical settings filled with wondrous objects. It's a Gothic cabinet of curiosities, and utterly delectable.Here's a little sample, taken from a passage in which our heroine is searching an old gentleman's library for clues:\\"On the upper shelf there appeared, in solitary grandeur, one object only -- a gorgeously-bound book. . . . The binding was of blue velvet, with clasps of silver worked in beautiful arabesque patterns, and with a lock of the same precious metal to protect the book from prying eyes. . . .\\"Being a woman, . . . I opened the book, without a moment's hesitation. The leaves were of the finest vellum, with tastefully designed illuminations all round them. And what did these highly ornamented pages contain? To my unutterable amazement and disgust, they contained locks of hair, let neatly into the centre of each page -- with inscriptions beneath, which proved them to be love-tokens from various ladies, who had touched the Major's susceptible heart at different periods of his life . . . \\"Ah, bliss. And truly, this is not even the best of it. There are pages and pages of descriptions of the most outlandish objects, whose presence is the books seems designed merely to delight and entertain.A bit of a warning: If you are looking for literary merit of the sort found in The Moonstone or The Woman in White, you won't find it here. But if you'd like to channel your inner Nancy -- and go back to the days when a mystery novel meant creaky old staircases, dusty old books and delicious hidden treasures -- this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Law and the Lady (The World's Classics)","review":"The Law and The Lady, while not nearly as sensational or well-known as The Moonstone or The Woman in White, is widely accepted as the first story to feature a female detective. Valeria is not an official police detective-she is a woman who is determined to prove her husband's innocence of a murder charge. There is no great danger here, no wildly violent criminals or intriguing settings, and a superficial reader might find the book rather boring, especially after reading some of Collin's other efforts. However, the story not only boasts Valeria, a woman fully as determined as the first man to climb Mount Everest (and facing obstacles, in their way, almost as difficult as that gentleman surmounted) but Miserrimus Dexter, a brilliant but unstable fellow with the misfortune of being born without legs. The battle of wits between these two revolutionary characters is a fascinating look into the Victorian mind, where societal norms compete for a search for justice. Collins had an abiding interest in the marriage, divorce and property laws of England and of Scotland and the issues raised by these laws form plot points in several of his novels. The Law and The Lady in particular revolves around the unique Scottish verdict of Not Proven, Scotland allowing three verdicts in a criminal trial-Guilty, Not Guilty, and Not Proven (which some have interpreted to mean \\"Not Guilty, but don't do it again) and Collins uses the \\"Scotch verdict\\" to show how a person's life can be tainted by such a verdict, where a person goes free but is under the stigma of not being adjudged innocent. The verdict of Not Proven is still available in Scotland today, and there is vigorous debate on the advisability of allowing a person to go free with a blemish on their record. The Law and The Lady is an in-depth look at how that verdict may affect a person and their family. Don't miss it."},{"Title":"The Law and the Lady (The World's Classics)","review":"The Moonstone is considered WC's best mystery novel. However, lately I've started reading Wilkie's lesser known works. The Dead Secret was extraordinary, and once again a Collins novel has captured my heart.In The Law and the Lady, newlywed, Valeria Woodville discovers that her husband married her under an assumed name. Neither her husband or his friends or family will speak about the deception bestowed upon the unsuspecting bride. The only thing Valeria's mother-in-law discloses is that she pities Valeria and will speak no more on the subject.Eustace Woodville, actually Eustace Macallen also will not reveal the reason for marrying Valeria under an assumed name. The topic is so painful to him that he abandons his bride rather than reveal the dark secret from his past. He leaves England and begs Valeria to forget him for her own good. Valeria does no such thing!The Law and the Lady is a detective novel, an excellent one, in fact. Valeria takes it upon herself to discover the secret that forced her husband to lie to the woman he so deeply loves and then abandon her rather than reveal the secret from his past.Slight spoiler coming up....Valeria's sleuthing reveal that Eustace Macallen was accused of murdering his first wife. A scottish court gave the verdict \\"not proven\\" He was not convicted of the crime, but the jury was unable to find him innocent. Eustace convinced himself that the scottish verdict would forever haunt his second wife, and she would always wonder if he actually did murder his wife.Valeria's belief in her husband's innocence never wavers. She is determined to prove her husband's innocence, even when friends and family advise that not even the best lawyers money can buy could ever change the \\"not proven\\" verdict.The Law and the Lady is the perfect novel for those who enjoyed The Moonstone or just enjoy detective novels. If you like this novel, make sure you read The Dead Secret, another excellent WC mystery novel!"},{"Title":"The Law and the Lady (The World's Classics)","review":"This is the second novel I read this year by Wilkie Collins. After first reading one of his most celebrated works, Woman In White, I ordered this one. Although, I didn't like it as much as Woman In White, I did feel it was a good solid, entertaining mystery.

It is by far one of the worst pieces of literature I have ever read, and I read a lot of books.I found there was no suspense to the writing, since from the beginning, the reader was able to suspect what the outcome was going to be, and was proven right by the time you read the last paragraph. I personally found the book boring to read, because I guessed what the outcome was going to be, and every chapter confirmed my suspicions. I found the plot development to be very poor, with stereotypes imbedded in several characters, especially the main character.I don't wish to give away the ending of the book completely, but I will say this much-- when you base your whole plot on a madman, is there any plot at all? The author uses his &quot;villian&quot; as a crutch, using the character's lunacy as an escape route for any unbound plot threads.I personally recommend you don't waste your time on this book, if you're looking for a some good classics, try &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; or &quot;David Copperfield&quot;."},{"Title":"Invention Mysteries (Invention Mysteries Series)","review":"If Paul Niemann's name seems familiar to you, it's probably because you've read his syndicated column, Invention Mysteries, in your local newspaper. His book of the same name is a collection of his first 47 essays (with illustrations by Kevin Cordtz, whose drawings sometimes resemble Jack Davis' work in MAD and various EC comics), and they are terrific reading.If you ever wanted to know about the various incarnations of the bicycle, the real creator of the World Wide Web, or if Rube Goldberg actually invented anything, then this is definitely the book for you. It features the stories behind the inventions we all know and love, like the telephone, golf, windshield wipers and bulletproof vests. There are also pieces that dispel popular rumors about various inventions (and their inventors) and ones that delve into patent law and how it came about.This book is filled with fascinating and often humorous stories that will appeal to trivia hounds and people interested in knowing more about the world around them. After reading it you'll feel a little bit smarter and maybe even want to invent something of your own.

From the man who lost out on the patent to the telephone because he arrived at the patent office two hours after Alexander Graham Bell and kept better notes of his invention, to the left-handed revolutionary genius of Leonardo da Vinci, to common myths concerning inventions and inventors (including the fallacy that most patents are profitable - less than 2% are estimated to be).

He also is able to cut through the garbage and to discover what is real and what is important. He put these talents to use at Machu Piccu to the benefit of historians but more importantly to fill-in a most important part of the history of the native Peruvians. It reconnects them with their pre-spanish culture.In many ways this book is the non-fictional version of the Celestine Prophesy, except for the disappearing part. Westerman seems very keyed-in to the origins of things.This book answers the question everyone has asked since it was found in 1911 by another amateur archeologist, Hiram Bingham, why weren't the Spanish told of this mountain city? It is the point of origin to the first Inca.Westerman takes us through the other important sites and tells how they relate to Machu Piccu. It makes for great reading and is a real-life adventure not to be missed.The discovery can be seen and visited. When you get to Machu Piccu, just ask to see the Westerman Caves. It's worth the trip.I only wish that this had more and larger photos. Otherwise its a five star book."},{"Title":"The meaning of Machu Picchu","review":"Having just spent 5 days in Abydos with the author,I was intrigued to read his previous publication.This book is an excellent read and full of new and interesting pictures of Jim and his adventures there.It is providing fresh insights into the ways of the old master builders !Thanks Jim."},{"Title":"The meaning of Machu Picchu","review":"This is a very nice book, well laid out, with some good information about research that was done in the Condor area of Machu Picchu.

Machu Picchu has been a mystery as to the reasons for its existence since its discovery by Western Civilization in 1911.James Westerman visits the city and finds he has an interest in the City and the area. He does some research and finds several things that seem to tie into a real explanation for the construction of this place so isolated from Western Civilization.He then writes a book about the City and his discoveries. Its high quality pictures and easy reading make it seem that things just fell in to place for him with just a little effort. While it is not likely that it just fell into place, and that lots of hard work and difficulties are unreported, it does make the story flow well.I would get this book if you want a story that gets the reader involved in Machu Picchu and the process and the discoveries that James Westerman made. If you have a friend that is or wants to be an amateur archaelogist then this is a definite must buy book."},{"Title":"Splendid Legacy: The Guide to Creating Your Family Foundation","review":"This book is a wonderful tool for any trustee whether new or seasoned.!!!It is splendidly laid out and easy to navigate.Every possible problem has been addressed and solved for the family planning to start a new foundation.Along with that, there is information that can vastly enhance those who are newly appointed to longstanding boards of old established family foundations.I was very impressed with this book and plan to suggest our foundation buy copies for all board members, associates and staff members.Best regards,BonnieHerbert H. and Grace A.

The laws and procedures have changed a great deal since that time and Fairstein was personally involved in many of the changes. The book is, of course, slanted a bit to favor her office, particularly in its canonization of D.A. Robert Morgenthau, but these attorneys do deserve credit for streamlining the system to handle the victims more sensitively.

This book shows that activists of color are extremely dedicated to fighting pollutants in their community. This book stresses that a disproportionate number of communities of color have been targeted for toxic wastes sites, etc.; so it is not environmental classism, but specifically environmental racism. This book does a good job in showing how Blacks, Native Americans, and Latinos are equally engaged in fighting this tragedy. This book may be too simplistic for longtime activists. For non-scientists like myself, many of the chemical compounds mentioned and stuff like that went right over my head (figuratively, of course). Still, this helped me learn more on the topic and is a good starter book. I think this book can help bring progressives across color lines together."},{"Title":"Confronting Environmental Racism: Voices from the Grassroots","review":"Robert Bullard, whose work on environmental justice has really made \\"local\\" struggles for a cleaner environment much more visible in academic literature, along with Benjamin Chavis, Jr., a Church activist working to organize and support local struggles against environmental racism, have put together a very readable collection. Chavis and Bullard, open up a forum for other grassroots activists to participate in ongoing academic discussions of the environment and the detrimental effects of waste industries and environmental pollutants on minority and poor populations. CONFRONTING ENVIRONMENTAL RACISM is a nice collection of essays that incorporates the important voices of the individuals who are in the frontlines of change. The one thing I would have liked to see more of is accounts from a broader geographic region.

Why? Because she creates believeable characters and absorbing settings, and her books are more than just the mystery that's a segment (sometimes, as in this case, a small one) of the plot. Unlike the chilling &quot;Cry Of The Owl&quot;, this novel is more about Theodore and Ramon than it is about the murder that it opens with. This isn't a wild ride, edge-of-your-seat book. Instead it lures you in by making you care about the characters. Highsmith seems almost to forget about the murder, in fact, and explores these two men, and their relationship, at some depth. The mystery is paid attention to...but the novel ends on a note that implies maybe it isn't as neat as the characters think. If you're looking for an out-and-out mystery, or a suspense thriller, &quot;The Cry Of The Owl&quot;, an equally good book, is probably more for you. But if you like psychodrama, definitely pick up &quot;A Game For The Living.&quot;"},{"Title":"A game for the living","review":"This is my first encounter with Patricia Highsmith, and I've very favorably impressed and looking forward to reading another of her novels immediately. Not being really conversant with the \\"who done it\\" genre, if indeed that is her genre, I can only compare her to Georges Simenon. There is the same intense concentration and a similar interest in the psychology of people at cross purposes. She does a fine job with the third-person introspection of her leading character, Theodore Schiebelhut, a well-to-do Swiss artist living in Mexico. There is an unusual feel not only to her character developments, but to the picture she paints of the upper middle class lifestyle of Mexico in the fifties with their easy privilege amid a restrained carnival atmosphere. Yet there is never a sense of unreality or of anything fake or pasted on. Highsmith doesn't reach for effects nor does she contrive. She carries the burden of veracity very well while giving \\"reality\\" an original twist that is hard to define.Theodore, the contemplative Protestant is contrasted with Ram&oacute;n, the fiery Latino Catholic, both lovers of the same woman who is found murdered as the novel begins. I was able to guess who did it fairly early on, although I am not sure why. Highsmith produces some red herrings en route to a neatly packaged conclusion, but plays fair at all times. Note worthy is the easy-going, yet savvy police inspector Sauzas. The tension between the sin-filled Catholic Ram&oacute;n, and the nearly agnostic Theodore is nicely developed and maintained. The feel of the Mexican hotels and the easy Mexican lifestyle is vividly rendered while the contrast between the well-to-do and the poor is presented in a straightforward manner.

I wonder how long it will take folks to figure this out (and to start putting many of her long-lost books back in print) -- esp. since she is cleverly disguised as a suspense/thriller writer (and she is a darned good one); but she's equally interested in exploring the complexities of modern life, with its alienation, widespread atheism, and deliberate cruelty. &quot;A Game for the Living&quot; is something of a whodunit, but also a beautifully realized tour of Mexico at mid-century, plus a flawless character study of two men who are polar opposites, one of whom commits himself to friendship with the other, despite the distinct possibility that the other man murdered the girl they both loved. It's a deeply moving portrait of friendship, and another great read from Miss Highsmith's collection."},{"Title":"A game for the living","review":"I devoured all Patricia Highsmith's &quot;Ripley&quot; books with the appetite of an ice-cream addict, but haven't found some of her others to be as satisfying. Highsmith seems to have certain themes that carry through most of her work: rich expatriates enjoying high living, artists and the art community, and wary, suspicious friendships between men. All these elements are found in A Game For the Living, which is set in Mexico. There's a gruesome murder (of course) and a lot of searching, mysterious clues, false leads, etc. Still, the book seemed in part to be a mere Mexican travelogue, as though Highsmith had made a trip to Mexico City and Acapulco and then put plenty of street names into her book just to prove she'd been there. Especially near the end of the book, the exact descriptions of the two main characters' moves in Acapulco are just too thorough and boring to make literary sense. At times you may wonder why the characters are putting themselves in so much danger, with the blessing of the police - it's unrealistic. Still, if you enjoy being taken into the fearsome, yet fascinating world of Highsmith's imagination, you'll get there through this book. It's just that you'll spend part of your trip on a dull tour bus."},{"Title":"A game for the living","review":"This is my first encounter with Patricia Highsmith, and I've very favorably impressed and looking forward to reading another of her novels immediately.

(And I do consider myself one.) But even then, this really isn't her best work. While it has the distinction of taking place in Mexico, its plot is strange and meandering. It contains probably a short story's worth of events, with a lot of extraneous filler. Aside from a few interesting ruminations on the difference between Catholics and Atheists, the story would have benefited from a faster, more concise pace.This is also the first of Highsmith's books I have read where there is an actual mystery involved. (In most of her books, we know who committed the crime and are often inside his or her head.) But in \\"A Game for the Living,\\" there is a lack of urgency to discover Lelia's killer, even for the audience. We never get to meet Lelia -- she's dead from the very first chapter -- so it's hard to be as emotionally involved as her two lovers are.Despite this, \\"A Game for the Living\\" does contain many other Highsmith trademarks: an unusual love triangle, a nearly-emotionless main character, and an ending that is (supposed to be) shocking and brutal. I don't feel like she really nailed the ending this time, although the very last line of the novel puts the whole thing in perspective."},{"Title":"A game for the living","review":"Patricia (&quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot;) Highsmith has written many wonderful psychological thrillers. After having enjoyed many of these I had high expectations of 'A Game for the Living'. Sadly, I was disappointed.Unlike Highsmith's successful formula of writing tense thrillers about accused murders undergoing extreme apprehension about being caught, 'A Game for the Living' is a simple whodunnit-type murder mystery. It involves the murder of a &quot;loose&quot; young Mexican woman, and the friendship of her two lovers as they try to locate the killer. I found the story to be banal, with no suspense build up. It is hard to imagine this book was written by Highsmith.Bottom line: skip this book, buy one of Highsmith's (much) better works such as 'The Blunderer', 'Strangers on a Train', and 'This Sweet Sickness' (..to name a few)."},{"Title":"A game for the living","review":"Patricia Highsmith was a novelist of unique skill - an author capable of creating questionable, oft times immoral characters that readers still root for. In \\"A Game for the Living\\" Highsmith explores the psychology of those caught up in a grisly murder case. It is not her best work by far but it shows the intelligence and depth that has trademarked all of this enigmatic author's works.Theodore, a transplant from Germany, returns home from a painting trip only to discover that Leila, his lover, has been brutally raped and murdered. His thoughts immediately turn to Ramon, his friend and Leila's fellow lover, since he has a quick temper and has threatened to harm her in the past. Yet Ramon is innocent even when he confesses to her murder (due to his deep rooted Catholicism and his need for atonement). Theodore wants to find her killer, especially when he starts receiving crank calls with no one on the other end and when his house is broken into late one night. Theodore knows that there must be a connection with these events and Leila's murder. Working with the local police captain, Theodore tracks down as many clues and suspects as he can to solve the case.Oftentimes it seems as if Highsmith is not going to fulfill the story's goal - that the murderer will remain uncaught and that the bizarre friendship between Ramon and Theodore will continue to spin puzzlingly on. And perhaps that would have been better than the rushed ending the author gave this novel, with its fortuitous events and unseen confession. Readers will play the same game that Highsmith's characters do as they try to solve the mystery of Leila's murder. \\"A Game for the Living\\" is an intriguing thriller that picks up pace near the end but lacks much of the pizzaz and elan of her other works."},{"Title":"A game for the living","review":"It seemed that Highsmith was interested in exploring the psychology of the two main characters -- Theodore and Ramon -- and their unlikely relationship. To do so, Highsmith packaged a murder mystery around the two. As a result, something is lost both in the mystery and the exploration of the characters.The two men are vastly different. Teo is a wealthy German, reserved, cool, an artist. Ramon is a poor Mexican workingman, fiery, tempramental, a devout Catholic, a furniture mender. And they happened to share the same woman, who has been brutally murdered.Told from Teo's point of view, the bulk of the book grapples with Teo's suspicion of Ramon as the killer and his efforts to understand his friend's mental state, which is, at best, somewhat shaky. They travel through Mexico together, trying to chase down suspects of the crime.But ultimately the book fails to deliver. It never attains the level of tension that Highsmith usually brings to her books with austere prose and the exploration into the psychology of brutally flawed protagonists.But, still, it's better than 95% of the mysteries out there. It's not a great place to start with Highsmith, but it's a interesting if not enthralling ride on the Patricia-train..."},{"Title":"The Small Book","review":"The comment above is not made lightly- I was a drunk for 25 years and made several attempts to quit, but could never understand why AA didn't work for me. Everything I ever read on alcoholism was AA oriented, and I thought the only way to quit was to spend the rest of my life in smoky church basements telling my problems to strangers. This book was the voice I'd been looking for, that let me know that there were other ways to think about alcoholism. I don't mean to knock AA because it has helped so many people. But it just didn't work for me. Reading this book was like turning a light on my Beast within. If you want to stop drinking and get control of your life, please try this book. It worked for me."},{"Title":"The Small Book","review":"This book has done more to save my son, who has been a drug addict for the last 10 years, than all three of the rehab clinics and AA meetings combined.

It is a great book for anyone, whether you are an addict or not."},{"Title":"The Small Book","review":"skip this one folks, Trimpey's just gathering his thoughts here. quite alot of what's in this book he omits in the later, &quot;Rational Recovery&quot;(the book). the whole jist of R.R. is A.V.R.T. (addictive voice recognition technique). the Small Book has yet to fully develop this concept as his later work does, and it contains too much &quot;rational-emotive&quot; blah, blah... that I don't believe is needed, i.e. A.V.R.T. supercedes it. his book &quot;rat. rec.&quot; is in my opinion definately worth the $."},{"Title":"The Small Book","review":"Like the person from Anchorage implies, The Small Book has been superseded by Trimpey's book, &quot;Rational Recovery...&quot; Trimpey has disavowed The Small Book, because he added new concepts and abandoned others (e.g., the Rational Recovery system no longer has support groups). In fact, Trimpey states on his website that he wishes he could pull The Small Book from publication, but he is powerless to do so. Buy the Rational Recovery book instead."},{"Title":"The Small Book","review":"This book SHOULD have been a classic, and should have filled in all the gaps that 12 step programs like AA don't or can't deal with in regards to addictions. Unfortunately, the &quot;rational recovery&quot; system is almost entirely defined by being what AA is NOT, and is almost entirely dependent on AA to justify it's methods and approaches. It's slightly melodramatic dramatization of the &quot;awesome power of the human intellect&quot; to overcome all problems is extremely question-begging; it might work for Vulcans, but it hardly acknowledges the reality of the human experience. It's snorting dismissial of such concepts as the unconscious, etc. is annoying, imprecise, and pompus. While the book does have some good advice and descriptive metaphors for the addiction/recovery process, it's &quot;just grow up&quot; shtick wears thin. Overall, I found the book's rational-emotive system to be shallow, imprecise, pseudo-scientific, and trite. The book is interesting in its rather phobic reaction to the &quot;irrational&quot; aspect to all life, and the authors seem to have a big complex about psychology in general. The arrogant and cutting tone of the text really just hides a hollow, airtight core rife with circular logic and clever half-truths. Still, it IS worth a read as an alternative to AA and 12-step, and will make you think about taking control of your own life. If nothing else, the book DOES remind us that we own our own souls and are NOT powerless! This reclaiming of our own power is the most valuable aspect of The Small Book."},{"Title":"The Small Book","review":"Trimpey spends too many pages talking about how bad AA is. His AVRT method replaces AA's Higher Power with &quot;the Beast&quot;, a demonized personification of &quot;the addictive voice&quot;, which is hardly a new idea, and should be familiar to anyone who has been to church or AA meetings. He does provide some good advise on how to stop drinking and some sound cognitive principles for disputing the irrational thinking that leads to drinking, although it seems that he has since rejected the &quot;rational&quot; parts of his own book, which does not leave much. What is good in this book gets lost in the virulence of his attacks on AA. Many of his arguments against AA have merit, but he could have left out several chapters and let people make their own judgements about AA. Those needing help don't need to &quot;take sides&quot;, they just need help. Read this book if you want to read a one-sided attack on AA, but if you want to get and stay sober, read Ellis and Velten's When AA Doesn't Work for You."},{"Title":"The Small Book","review":"I recommend this book above the later book (\\"Rational Recovery: The New Cure for Substance Addiction\\"). Trimpey may consider it his \\"albatross,\\" but it has much useful information about social support and Rational-Emotive Behavior Therapy, all of which he later disavowed when he chose to make AVRT the totality of his approach. (Just because the \\"beast\\" can sometimes be clever enough to misuse the principles of REBT doesn't mean that REBT is worthless in recovery).As a counselor, I am also obviously not pleased with the whole \\"treatment is dead\\" and \\"Counselors are tools of the 12-step establishment\\" arguments on the RR website, and in the later book. That attitude is not yet expressed in this book. When Trimpey abolished Rational Recovery groups, he also made a unilateral decision that no one can benefit from the mutual help process. I think that was a mistake, but he's entitled to his opinion since he owns the name. Luckily, there are other non-12-step groups.AVRT is powerful, but not everyone can use it as their sole channel of sobriety, as Trimpey now claims. Some people can use his \\"crash course\\" and recover entirely on their own; but many cannot, and experience continued relapses while trying. They can benefit from social support and counseling. They also deserve a choice, which was Trimpey's original position in \\"TSB.\\" Unfortunately, he has since renounced that position and maintains that only AVRT works and everything else is evil.This book gets at a fundamental truth about addiction, namely that addicts can never trust their own minds again when it comes to the substance. It also includes valuable material on self-worth, coping, facing the messes that one has created, and other topics that are glossed over or eliminated from \\"RR.\\" It also has less ranting about the evils of 12-step programs than the later book, though it had a significant amount as it was.This book can be a tool in the recovering person's toolbox. It isn't the whole toolbox by any means, but can be very helpful. However, I would not recommend it to a person who is experiencing success and satisfaction with 12-step support, as they will likely feel attacked. That's too bad, because I've spoken to people who were happy with AA and still understood what I meant when I talked about \\"that voice.\\""},{"Title":"The Small Book","review":"The BEST book I have come across in the subject of recovery from addictions.

This book puts into words what some of us have always known about getting and staying sober. Many people get and stay sober without 12 step programs by just making a decision to stop being selfish and start living right and then doing it. This book puts that into perspective and provides tools to support that decision. Don't get me wrong, I know that 12 step programs work for some people and that's great. But for others the commitment to a 12 step program is too much, too rigid, too time consuming, or otherwise just doesn't work for their situation. I know a lot of people who have gotten and stayed sober without ever attending 12 step meetings and this book lays out what they've done.

Every page boasts a Fleknovian progress of worthies from John Aylmer to Thomas Yalden.Skelton, Marlowe, Elizabeth I, Shakespeare, Dustin Griffin, Milton, Johnson, G. F. Parker, Michael Dobson, Jean Marsden, W. B. C. Watkins, Margreta de Grazia, Rene Wellek, and even great author Routledge, whose Critical Heritage is much lauded, and that's just on the first page.Lynch does for periods what he does for authors: The Middle Ages, antiquity, modernity, epochs, other ages, present, past, historical periods, historical objectivity both subjective and arbitrary, decades, centuries, millennia, undifferentiated flux, years, days, cultural movements, predecessors, us, them, now, and then. The \\"ever-new sense of now\\", \\"a series of thens\\", declarations of modernity, Western periodization, Florentine scholars of the fourteenth and fifteenth century, classical and Christian models, six ages, four monarchies, an ancient, a middle and a modern. Dark Ages and modern enlightenment. The modern world and glorious antiquity. The \\"modern\\" age, a new era. And that's just part of page two.The remainder of the page and the two pages that follow include Francesco Petrarca, Biondo, Villani, Ficino, Erasmus, Valla, Jacob Burckhardt, Wallace K. Ferguson, Schlegel, Winckelmann, Ruskin, Sismondi, Johnson (again), Michelet, Pater, Symonds, and Hazlitt.Despite this erudite incipientia, Lynch recognizes the futility of producing such ballasted tomes by throw-back humanists of ages past, from those such as Erich Auerbach, W. J. Bate, Ernst Cassier, E. R. Curtius, P. O. Kristeller, Blanford Parker, and Frances Yates.In their place, Lynch has produced a professional book, par excellence. He and his book are very much products of their age. They are modern, safe, and slick. You won't find him troubling himself with ideas. You can't charge him with thought.His acknowledgements are a marvelous example of the form. And no one will reproach him for his footnotes.Lynch leaves no stone unturned. By cobbling together every minor character to have jotted a note in the eighteenth-century, Lynch gives us his eighteenth-century. And for that we are grateful. Better to burrow underground than to soar on extended wing. For as the time for ideas has past, should we hope for anything more?"},{"Title":"Lost in Wonder: Rediscovering the Spiritual Art of Attentiveness","review":"According to Esther de Waal, in the words of William Wordsworth, many of us have become \\"dull of sight,\\" or as Wordsworth's original draft framed it, \\"dull of soul.\\" To help counter this spiritual malaise of unawareness and inattentiveness, a dullness of sight and soul which manifests itself in the paradoxical symptoms of busy-ness and lethargy, de Waal has written her latest book, Lost in Wonder: Rediscovering the Spiritual Art of Attentiveness.The author is well prepared for her task. A prolific Anglican writer who is married to the former rector of Canterbury, de Waal is best known for her books about the Benedictine and Celtic traditions, and the spirit of those two Anglican lynchpins pervades Lost in Wonder. Using the image of the Celtic peregrini, who set off in their small fragile boats to go where the wind of the spirit took them, de Waal offers Lost in Wonder as a retreat for those living either in the midst of relentless activity or in a void. To that end, she focuses on the themes of harmony and balance, the light of the Transfiguration, the discipline of seeing, the relationship between our inner and outer lives, and the creation of an interior space, a cloister, in which to be silent and pray.Lost in Wonder is filled with insight, wisdom, gentle humor, and good advice. I especially appreciated de Waal's suggestion early on to carry a magnifying glass at all times to help recover the gift of vision and to add an extra dimension to the way we look at the world. And like all spiritual masters, de Waal provides opportunities for the lectio divina by ending each of her nine chapters with selections from the early Fathers, the Celtic saints, holy men and women of the Middle Ages, seventeenth-century Anglican mystics, the Psalms, and writers as diverse as Bonnie Thurston, Basil Hume, Brother Roger of Taize, Thomas Merton, Ann Lewin, Alice Walker, and Edwin Muir."},{"Title":"Lost in Wonder: Rediscovering the Spiritual Art of Attentiveness","review":"The author Esther de Waal says in the introduction that much of this book is about seeing - recovering the ability for vision, and becoming generally more aware. There has been a veritable explosion of retreat-going in North America, with monastic communities and imitators of such offering evermore hospitable facilities for those seeking. But do those seeking know what they are seeking in these retreats?'Lost in Wonder: Rediscovering the Art of Attentiveness' is fully in keeping with a Benedictine sense of spirituality. The very first word of Benedict's rule is Listen! - a call to attentiveness. In examining the connection between the inner and outer life, de Waal recounts many of her own experiences, as well as the poetic and spiritual writings of others related to the subject. From such authors as Pablo Naruda, Julian of Norwich, Thomas Merton, and many others, the practices of prayer, reading, and meditation are brought into relationship to mysteries such as light and darkness, silence, and mystery itself.Each section has both narrative and prayer/reflection pieces. The narratives include stories, ideas, and examples, deepening the understanding but also leading the reader to more meditative states in the ambiguity and unresolved nature that is inherent in mystery. The prayers and reflections come from a wide variety of sources, including psalms and other biblical passages, saints, poets and mystics past and present.De Waal introduces familiar practices, such as journaling, in a new light, showing how many of the daily practices and potential practices we already have can be modified to yield new value. De Waal also introduces a sense of sacred to everyday architecture and space, transforming the simple act of walking around into a worshipful and special experience.At the end of this wonderful volume, de Waal provides brief biographical sketchs of 'Fathers and Friends', a phrase borrowed from Merton that describes the companions we carry along the way in our spiritual journey.Prepare to be inspired."},{"Title":"Lost in Wonder: Rediscovering the Spiritual Art of Attentiveness","review":"Esther de Waal has the uncanny ability to create in the reader the experiences she is writing about.

While the writing style is questionable, and I don't agree with all their beliefs Elsie Dinsmore was a very popular girl in the 1800s. During that time, Martha Finley was the second most popular author after Louisa May Alcott.This book, the sixth in the series, is not one you'd want to read without reading the previous five. After reading those books you'll find that Elsie is married to her father's best friend, Edward Travilla, and they have five children-Elsie, Eddie, Vi, Harold and Herbert. This book begins with the announcement of another child, Lily. Of course, in the previous book there was no mention that Elsie was pregnant and it seemed to me like a stork had come and dropped the baby on the arms of Elsie's mammy and somehow Elsie had become sick. Martha Finley's ignorance on pregnancies is one of the many things that tick me off about these books.However, Lily is not a healthy baby and so the children go to Elsie's friend, Lucy's, house for the summer. Because only the Travillas can behave well in these books (and there is no mention of any discipline that Elsie might have done to contribute to the good behavior), Lucy's children are treated like brats. While at Lucy's house, the younger Elsie comes upon the older Elsie's old tutor, Miss Day. A good fifty pages or so is devoted to charity bestowed upon Miss Day and her daughter.The Travillas go back to their estate, Ion, and six uneventful years go by, but we learn that seven-year-old Lily is still ill and the two Elsies and Edward have gone up North to see if anything can be done to save their daughter.

Personal identity is a perplexing and hot area in contemporary philosophy; and not only perplexing but also great fun. Compared to this, there are remarkably few textbooks on this important research. In fact there had only been two notable textbooks on personal identity until this one has been published: one by John Perry (which, in my view, concentrated too much on the history of personal identity rather than to contemporary theories), and one by A.O. Rorty, which was great in its time, but now obsolate.Does this book carry out its aim? I have to say not. Some of the writings are too well-known for everyone, others are brutally cut, and others just don't meet the standards to get in a textbook. I find it most easy to comment the texts piece by piece.1.Introduction. This one annoyed me. I simply don't care about the theory of personal identity, especially not in 70 pages, which could have been filled with two contemporary texts.2-4. Williams', Nozick's, Parfit's and Lewis's contributions: These are great texts, and are classics of the topic. The problem is that they are too well-known to everyone, and - most annoying - all of them are excerpts except Williams's one. I hate excerpts; I don't like when someone else decides which parts of the text are important. Hence, these texts are useless for reference: you have to get the original ones.5. Korsgaard (excerpt): Korsgaard argues against Parfit and says that persons are unified agents; so she wants to replace the 'Humean' concept of persons with a 'Kantian' one. She takes a so-called practical not metaphysical point of view. Thogh there are some good ideas in this article, I think it's unjustified to suppose that there is a sharp borderline between the practical and the metaphysical questions of personal identity. One cannot handle metaphysical problems by simply neglecting them.6. Unger: He argues that fission (when an imagined person splits in two like an amoeba) is worse than ordinary survival. I think his arguments are not sound, but - since, of course, it's an excerpt from his book again - the reader cannot judge.7. Sosa: This is a cutting-edge chapter in this book! Sosa defends the so-called 'neoconservative view' that personal identity - strict, numerical identity - does matter (Parfit believes it doesn't.) Unfortunately this is an exceprt again, a good one, nonetheless.8. Martin: A solid writing again. Martin argues against the neoconservative view described above. He introduces a new thought experiment which is immune to objections posed against the 'fission case'. I think he fails to prove his thesis, but the paper is still insightful and clever.9. Schechtmann: An excerpt again, and in my view, it's not very good. Her approach resembles Korsgaard's one: looking at the practical, everyday concept of identity instead of the metaphysical problem. I think she goes in the wrong direction, and misuses identity for cases which are proglematic only for her.10. Johnston: He argues against Parfit's reductionism: the thesis that a person is nothing over and above his his brain and body. Johnston writes clearly, but this article is quite complicated and sometimes is hard to follow. I think that he begs questions about important issues.11. Parfit: In this newer (1995) paper Parfit defends the view elaborated in his Reasons and Persons. There is nothing really new here except an interesting classification of kinds of reductionism. Yet worth reading.12. Olson: A very clear and cutting-edge peper. Briefly, it's a short summary of the arguments presented in his great 'The Human Animal'. If you want to know animalism better, you should read that book anyway, but this article is a good introduction. Olson is animalist, so his approach is radically different from anyone else's in this textbook. He thinks that psychology is irrelevant to personal identity at all.13. G.Strawson: I admit that I can say nothing about this long article because I don't understand it. Strawson sketches a new picture of the self but that's all I learnt from this text. It's very ambiguous and is simply beyond my cognitive limits...All in all: there are some good articles in this book, but they are not new. And there are new ones, but they are (with some exceptions) not good. Furthermore, this book doesn't show the width and scope of contemporary debates on personal identity, because it's desperately biased in favour of psychological theories. If you search for a good introduction to contemporary debates on personal identity, this book is not for you."},{"Title":"And that's the way it was...

By Dawn's Early Light","review":"I bought this as a friend asked me the question, since I am a former Marine sniper, if I ever had to shoot AWOL Americans. My first response was surprise, my second was just how would you know where they were and if you did, why not just pick them up; and third, no, never was asked or ever heard of such a thing.Well this book I bought on his recommendation and the fact I wanted to study what I spent two straight years of my life doing and have a very large Vietnam library of everything from SDS and protest stuff to things like this book.While the Author makes note up front that his book is a 'novel' he points out that is only for legal reasons, that he has lived with this secret all his life and against everyone around hims wishes he is publishing his expose anyway.The writing, the story ... just isnt believable. He points out he joined the Air Force because he wanted to go 'fight' in Vietnam, with few exceptions like pilots and chopper crews, that is not where you would look to go and fight. Then he tells of a 24 day I think boot camp in which the first day he ran for nine straight hours and was selected to work, right out of boot camp he is selected to work with the CIA and taken to DC and kills some Colonel on the streets of DC as a test.Bottom line ... says his last assignment in Saigon around 73 was to go into the city and point blank take out AWOL servicemen, totalling over 900 out of supposedly 1200? Authenticity ... there are many questions but he refers to people in the Air Force as soldiers, which is one of many things that doesnt speak of one intimately involved. Because of my friend I gutted through and read this book but unfortnately can't recommend it."},{"Title":"And that's the way it was... By Dawn's Early Light","review":"I know Trent C. Young very well. We attended Bowie Senior High School, he being a few years back from me. Right after the fall of Saigon (1975), while I was still a member of the USAF Trent told me accounts of how he was a Security Policeman attached to the OSI and came up from underneath floors and made amazing arrests involving large drug caches. A year or two later his brother Ronny came to visit. Ronny was good people. I shared my conversation with Ron and he set me straight. Trent was never more than a gate guard and base patrol.I did my four years in the USAF, then after 20 years with the Metropoilitan Police, Washington DC returned to the Air National Guard as a full time employed Technician. I spoke to Trent on the phone a few yuears ago and after he mentioned he had written a book I read the outline. I visited to Andrews AFB MD office of the OSI and related what I knew, which they checked on the Internet.Bottom line....they never heard of him.It's a great story Trent, and it is a novel. It would make a great movie. But it never happened.Oh, I did speak with my eldest son about the possibility of a screenplay. The answer is no.

That did happen."},{"Title":"The Stilwell papers","review":"In 1948, a year before the Kuomintang was chased out of China, but when the outcome was not in doubt, the widow of Vinegar Joe Stilwell published his papers from the war. Probably no indictment of any government's policy has ever been published that was so powerful and so timely.Nobody paid much attention.By that time, nothing much could have been done, and even in 1942, when Stilwell was appointed chief of staff to either Chiang Kai-shek or the Nationalist Army of China (it was never really clear which), China was beyond hope.That, however, didn't stop Stilwell from trying.He was, as these papers show, the most remarkable man to wear Uncle Sam's uniform in those days, as good a judge of men as Marshall, as daring a battle leader as Nimitz and as thoughtful as Spruance. Unlike those three, he could write a better than passable poem when the mood struck him.Theodore White, later a best-selling policial analyst, but then a reporter in the China-Burma-India theater, put Stilwell's miscellanceous papers together shortly after his death. White says they are not an intimate diary, but in fact they are. No diary of any high commander of any nation during the war, that I know of, is more intimate.Also included are several short papers -- some just incomplete drafts -- in which Stilwell attempted to explain to the politicos what was going on. These are remarkably well formed considering their brevity. Stilwell could not have known how Churchill demanded of his staff that position papers be limited to a page -- a crippling necessity for the top managers in a world-circling conflict -- but Stilwell was, obviously, a top-notch manager.Lord, how he hated Peanut (Chiang) and despised the Limeys!In one ruminative paper, written for himself and not others, he concluded that the prime consideration of a military commander in war was character. This was a very American thing to think and not so very original for a man who was young in the 1890s. American writers like William Dean Howells reflected on character obsessively in the Mauve Decade. The norms of that sort of character were captured on the stage in 1916 in a once-popular, now forgotten play, \\"The Man from Home,\\" by Harry Leon Wilson and Booth Tarkington: Shrewd, tough, never laying all his cards on the table when playing with sharpers, smarter and more worldly than he looks.Barbara Tuchman's \\"Stilwell and the American Experience in China\\" provides more background and was written to draw lessons for a people and a government that were blundering about foolishly and ignorantly in Southeast Asia. Hers is an excellent book, but though she tries, she does not capture the spirit of the man half so well as he does himself. Today, the American people and government are again blundering foolishly and ignorantly around Asia, making the same dumb mistakes that Stilwell was pointing out in 1942-44.\\"The Stilwell Papers\\" is a book as thoroughly forgotten as Wilson and Tarkington's \\"Man from Home.\\" Both deserve a second chance.None of the American commanders of the 21st century, in Washington, Iraq or Afghanistan, comes up to Stilwell's belt buckle, but we can readily imagine them saying what Stilwell said about the Chinese Nationalists in January 1943: \\"These people are hard to help.\\""},{"Title":"The Stilwell papers","review":"A man of no pretense and extreme bravery who played a key role in the China- Burma- India theater of World War 2. He refused a chance to fly out of Japanese offensive action in order to lead- that is to say walk out of Northern Burma to India with responsibility for a polyglot group including Americans, British, a contingent of Burmese nurses, and a few others numbering about 100. He led his group across mountain ranges with inadequate supplies, staying ahead of the Japanese, marching his group at a standard (Army) pace of 105 steps a minute, fording rivers such as the Chindwin, one of 4 principal Burmese rivers which empties into the irrawaddy. This all at an age of 59 or thereabouts. He lost not a single life in this arduous slash through the jungle and mountains. He was a favorite of Gen George C Marshall and Sec'y of War Stimson. He was key in developing the means and methods for the Allied return starting in late 1944.My review is inadequate to characterize this relatively unsung hero of WW2. Should you have further interest in this remarkable man's life I encourage you to read Barbara Tuchman's \\"Stillwell and the American Experience in China\\" and follow it with this book. Both are page turners,and instill pride and admiration for Stillwell as America's top General in the CBI theater."},{"Title":"The Stilwell papers","review":"The Stillwell Papers represent an important insight into problems the United States had with depending upon Chinese Nationalist Leader Chiang Kai-Shek.Although &#34;Vinegar&#34; Joe Stillwell certainly writes from a first-person &#34;in your face&#34; sort of way, his papers do reveal just how frustrating it was for the U.S. to have such an &#34;ally&#34; as Chiang Kai-Shek. (After all, the Stilwell Papers do come from diaries, personal notes to his wife, and, surprisingly, even some doggerel type poetry, there is no reason to doubt that at least one authentic view of Chiang came out of World War II.) Subsequent scholars like Barbara Tuchman may have given greater &#34;balance&#34; but I have not yet read her account. That comes next in my study of Chiang Kai-Shek as a &#34;Questionable Ally&#34;."},{"Title":"The Stilwell papers","review":"Having read a number of books on China during WWII, there is no doubt that different stories are being told about what occurred between Gen. Stilwell, Gen.Chennault, and Chiang Kai Shek. I have my own opinion, but that is not why I read this book. I read this book because I admired Stilwell's toughness and humility. This book doesn't disappoint in describing that aspect of his personality.Stillwell uses numerous slang and catch phrases that can be difficult to understand at times. Yet at the same time his slang is very humorous and a pleasure to read.Gen. Stilwell also had views that can be construed as un-American. Stilwell notes himself that he admired the communists over the Generalissimo's KMT. However his doctrine may not be as sinister as it appears. He saw the corruption in the KMT, and he saw(at least what was in his mind) the communists being the party of the people. In hindsight it can be safely said that he was deceived by them.The book isn't extremely detailed in describing life in China at this time, but the book is an easy read, and I couldn't help but have admiration for Gen. Stilwell's soldierly qualities and being a man's man. You can't help but \\"root\\" for him, a man the \\"average Joe\\" could look up to."},{"Title":"Elementary Odyssey: Teaching Ancient Civilization through Story","review":"David Millstone must be a great teacher.

Millstone does just that in this book and I'm so glad I stumbled upon it. His students are so lucky to have him."},{"Title":"A New Era","review":"A New Era was a very interesting book! This book provides coverage of Kasparov's championship defense against Vishy Anand, as well as his two matches against Deep Blue. The difference between this book and other books on the matches is that it is written by one of Kasparov's team, master Mikhail Khodarkovsky. This means that it includes much inside information about how Garry was feeling through the matches as well as fascinating insights into how their team prepared for each game and the general strategy of match play.Kasparov is a very common hero for chess players not just because he is perhaps the greatest player ever but also because he often shows his emotions both on and off the board. He is a passionate person, as exhibited by his play as well as his views on politics and other topics. This book illustrates this aspect as he goes through the emotional ups and downs that comes from playing at the pinnacle of the game.The games themselves were fascinating. I also have read Patrick Wolff's account of the 1995 World Championship match as well as Pandolfini's book on the second match against Deep Blue, so I had some background on the games. It is interesting to compare the feelings of Anand in Patrick Wolff's book (he was one of Anand's seconds) with that of Kasparov's during the same match.My only criticism of the book is with regards to the analysis. It is detailed and includes Kasparov's own preparation and analysis. However, at times I feel it could be over the heads of less than advanced chess players because there is little commentary. However, I felt I could enjoy the games overall anyway. However, I don't think this detracts too much from the book overall as I felt the strength of the book was Khodarkovsky's perspective as an inside person in Kasparov's life.If you are a fan of Kasparov's, you would do well to read this book. If you are a fan of chess, I also highly recommend it."},{"Title":"A New Era","review":"For chess players it's a very useful account of Kasparov's matches with Anand and against Deep Blue. However, the style is very dull and, although fluent, it is obvious that the author's first language is not English. Some analysis is presented in this book but not in any useful way - neither in depth for the expert nor descriptive explanation for the novice.In stark contrast to the quality of writing, Dominic Lawson's book on the Kasparov-Short match, End Game, is a much more enjoyably read as an account of a world championship match, although it lacks any chess analysis.Khodarkovsky also seems unable to have his own opinions on the matches and appears only to present Kasparov's point of view. He often drones on how intelligent and wonderful Kasparov is, without there being any relevance to the story. There is also a lot of criticism of IBM's behavior in the second Deep Blue match but no attempt to get a perspective from outside the Kasparov team. This is understandable if he wants to remain as a trusted aide for future matches, but it doesn't make for enjoyable reading.These criticisms of style and approach aside, the book is very worthwhile to the chess player as it gives the world champion's perspective on one of his title matches and also on the most important man-versus-machine games ever played."},{"Title":"A New Era","review":"This review is combined in my other reviews and writing and can be found on my web site www.gabrielfalco.comThis book gives a chess player detailed information on how computer chess programing can be applied to ones personal game and thrilling account of the matches between Gary Kasparov and Deep BlueAcademia Made Magically Intuitive Real Time ReviewBy Gabriel Falco Copyright 2008 www.gabrielfalco.comThis review is written in the first person and will be updated bi-weekly.I was delighted to begin reading this book but disturbed that some the ideas memorialized in the pages were ones that I have begun writing a white paper on titled \\"Fly by Wire Economy\\".Obviously the book is great and this is more of a narrative and \\"slight of internet\\" to get you, the reader of this review to take a look at me; a self declared Black Swan (there is also a video of a black swan on my web site)Nassim Nichols Teleb has an extraordinary ability to reinforce the meaning of academia-speak by context.

I think the author also invented a new literary device by giving us a series of eleven different stories about eleven different characters, all named Michael Missing. It was a way of giving us eleven different perspectives on the same person, though, and the stories were all riveting. But lots of anger, sex and very bizarre relationships. Not your typical read to say the least."},{"Title":"The Actual Adventures of Michael Missing: Stories","review":"This is another successful book put out by Lish in his days at Knopf (where this title was first published), and bears traits common to much of the work he championed: dynamic sentences, compact rather than loose prose, and a focus on voice rather than story. These stories are full of energy and a kind of muted, cynical rage. The characters are quickly but insightfully drawn, and there are many repeated types: the frustrated loser, the jaded thug, the desperate, abused wife/girlfriend. A pretty dark book. But there are plenty of humorous moments, and the rhythm of the prose and snappy dialog pulls you through everything almost too quickly to be weighed down by the subject matter. The final story is a masterpiece, a coming-of-age story that I'd put toe-to-toe with the best of Barry Hannah's tales told by rotten, but somehow forgivable unfortunates."},{"Title":"The Actual Adventures of Michael Missing: Stories","review":"This scary collection is risky to read too (you may not like where Hickins settles his gaze), but sublimely worth it -- don't miss it.

The stories span all sorts of different times and different genres, from thriller to drama to comedy to historical to sexual. I'm not really sure if it adds up to anything- the tone is very inconsistant from one story to the next- but the stories are individually riveting.

Its not that this book didn't have these things, but it didn'thave enough of them. In a sentence this writer should not have done short stories. His story reaches a quick climax but it doesn't seem to be resolved. For example in the firststory a 19 year old with his wife are traveling to Florida. However the 19 year old is sick of life, a little crazy, and is has a gun. At this point the story has got my attention. Whenhe reaches his destination he finally goes off the edge and kills someone. To not have to take the punishment he flies to Canada. So I'm thinking wow how's he going to live inCanada when he has no connections and not much money. I turn the page and that's the end and a new story is starting. Maybe short stories aren't for me but that ended way toosoon. Overall I didn't really like this book.

There were some dull stories I'd heard ideas about before, &quot;Green Thumb&quot; being one I recommend you skip over, (it reminded me too much of &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot;) but overall, it did contain a huge amount of new, fresh stories."},{"Title":"THE WORLDS OF CLIFFORD SIMAK.","review":"Clifford D. Simak's _The Worlds of Clifford D. Simak_ (1960) is a collection of a dozen good Simak stories published between 1954 and 1958. One is from _Infinity_, two are from _Astounding_, and nine are from _Galaxy_. Two stories (\\"Idiot's Crusade\\" and \\"Founding Father\\") are chillers. One (\\"Death Scene\\") is bittersweet. But the tone of most of the stories is that of gentle humor.Probably the best-known story in the collection is Simak's Hugo-winning novelette, \\"The Big Front Yard\\". It's the one about the Yankee handyman and trader who begins to notice strange goings-on in his house. And then there is a discovery made outside his front door that proves great for the handyman, his dog Towser (Simak stories frequently feature dogs), and his retarded assistant. I have read this story over half a dozen times over the years, and it still holds up well.Two other stories in which the \\"little guy\\" emerges triumphant over the forces of bureaucracy are \\"Operation Stinky\\" and \\"Green Thumb\\". The first is the one in which the little skunklike alien tricks the Air Force brass. The second involves a county agent who investigates unusual holes and soil samples appearing in his territory-- and forms an alliance with some alien plants. (There is a dog in this story, too.) \\"Idiot's Crusade\\" is still another tale in which the little guy wins. But this time, the results are horrific rather than comic.Four stories-- \\"Honorable Opponent,\\" \\"Founding Father,\\" \\"Jackpot,\\" and \\"Lulu\\"-- involve humans who go out into space and run into some strange situations Out There. The first story is about the Army brass who must meet the teddybearlike aliens who have whipped them in battle to discuss terms of surrender. The second tale is about delusions planted in the mind of a spaceman that begin to take over his life. The third is about a spaceship crew (not, shall we say, like that of the _Enterprise_) that discovers that it is better to travel hopefully than to arrive. And the fourth is about the lovesick ship's computer with a taste for soppy poetry.Three stories in which Earthmen make alien contacts that are not to their advantage are \\"Dusty Zebra,\\" \\"Carbon Copy,\\" and \\"Neighbor\\". The first is about a boy who finds a way to trade with denizens of a parallel word and about his father, who is too clever for his own good. The second dramatizes a real estate scam that backfires on the agent. The third (_another_ story with a dog!) is about the alien who literally has a way to keep people down on the farm. This story is marvelously told, but it always bothered me a bit. It describes what amounts to a benevolent dictatorship.\\"Death Scene\\" is the most unusual tale in the book. Suppose that everybody could see exactly twenty-four hours into the future. The story is about an elderly man who _knows_ that he will shortly die-- and how he and his family quietly prepare for the event. The tale is so beautifully told, it seems almost petty to point out the flaw in the story: Not everyone will die quietly, painlessly, peacefully, or in dignity.Simak has often (and accurately) been called an author of pastoral science fiction. \\"Neighbor\\" is the purest pastoral piece in the book, since it deals with a spot of country isolated from the rest of the world. But there is a \\"small town\\" feel to many of the other stories as well. Aliens in these stories may be a bit strange, but they are usually benevolent-- just plain folks. Simak's world is a world in which many problems can be solved by dickering, playing chess, going fishing, or swapping drinks from a bottle. It's a world that I enjoyed visiting. I suspect that you will like it as well."},{"Title":"Mission Earth Pb Vol 10","review":"Ugh, I made it to Vol. 10!

Thinking his teacher, Mrs. Quirk, resides at school (as all teachers do, of course), the main character imagines how Mrs. Quirk and the other teachers spend the hours when they're not teaching: trash patrols conducted by Mr. Crumple the custodian, exercising led by Miss Whistle the P.E. teacher, and listening to stories read aloud by the librarian, Mr. Peruse. Teachers' meals are made from cafeteria leftovers, staff have pillow fights, and pajamas and inflatable bedding are secretly stored in the locked bottom drawer of each teacher's desk! The main character's imaginings are challenged though when he begins seeing Mrs. Quirk doing everyday activities around the community. In the end though, he wonders if the other teachers will become suspicious of Mrs. Quirk's \\"secret\\" life away from school.This is an engaging story that is sure to delight any elementary school-aged child with a good imagination. It would also be a wonderful springboard for an imaginative writing activity about what certain people (e.g. teachers, firefighters, grocery store clerks) do when they're not officially on-duty. I cannot wait to share this book with my third graders!"},{"Title":"Iranian F-14 Tomcat Units in Combat (Combat Aircraft)","review":"This is a book that provided additional information on Iranian F-14s, a topic that is rarely covered. Cooper and Bishop provided perspectives from Iranian pilots, views that are essentially ignored because these neither fit general military analysis, Iraq POV, nor the official Iranian government positions. Anyone who studied or read air combat accounts knows that, there are always uncertainties on air combat records, whether it's due to propaganda or fog of war. You usually have to look at stories from different sides to get a more complete picture. Therefore, Cooper and Bishop's efforts are greatly appreciated, even if they are not verifiable or totally correct (and with obvious Iranian pilot bias - not necessarily a bad thing if you know that upfront).Having said that, I'd like to provide some additional info in response to Mr. Forczyk's review (even though I'm not military intelligence officer like him). The attitude from Cooper stems from the fact that he and Bishop's works are often belittled and ridiculed by others, including US military aviators. This bounds to make a person unhappy, especially when there are declassified US government documents to support some of his claims. Although Mr. Forczyk raised some reasonable doubts, such as no independent verification of these accounts and no details explaination about sources, I think he forgets that this is supposed to be an original work with first-hand sources. It's hardly surprising that this account is different from the Iranian government's account, since there is politic involved (FYI, Bishop and Cooper's work appears to be banned or at least unwelcomed by Iranian government). Saying \\"These are the same guys who lie to the world every day about their nuclear program, isn't it?\\" doesn't make much sense. What does Iranian government's nuclear program and propaganda has anything to do with the words of pilots their government dislike? Having contacts with former Iranian air force pilots (some no longer in Iran) is not the same as \\"pretty cozy with the Iranian Government\\", I don't think that's a right assumption.Furthermore, I think it is a big jump to say that F-14's superior performance in Iraq-Iran war is impossible because otherwise Iran would have won by aerial bombing. The way Iraq and Iran used air power is very different from US traditional thinking (especially the post Desert Storm type). Air power simply isn't a decisive factor in Iraqi and Iranian minds, Saddam didn't say \\"Air Force has never been a decisive factor in the history of wars\\" without reason. During the Iraq-Iran war, Iraq perfected the underground and passive defense. Able to shoot down enemy aircraft in some air combats doesn't guarantee that you have impressive SEAD capability, and Iran certainly did not have US technology advantages displayed during Desert Storm. Mr. Forczyk forgets that Iran and Iraq both used Ballistic missiles to bomb each other's cities, that didn't have any cease fire effects. So why should F-14s, F-4, and F-5 with limited load and no PGM able to achieve greater results, given the air defense threats? Given these questionable assumptions, I think Mr. Forczyk's two stars is a bit unfair to the authors.In sum, I'd say this book is certainly worth a look for anyone interested in F-14 or Iraq/Iran war, even though you may not accept all of its views. I give this book 3.5 stars - One for stuffing a lot of interesting info in a small book, one for interesting/rare photos, one for originality and going into a relatively untouched subject, and another half star for its potential value (if most content prove to be true...)"},{"Title":"Iranian F-14 Tomcat Units in Combat (Combat Aircraft)","review":"(Updated 8/2/2009) When I looked at this item in July 2009 it was unavailable, but copies were going used for over $70.00. I pleaded for Osprey to republish the book. Now, in August 2009, new copies are available again. Thanks, Osprey & Amazon!The information in this book simply isn't available elsewhere. If you are looking for narrative descriptions of the Tomcat in action, then you will find more examples in this book than anywhere else. I can remember that even in the 1980s the U.S. Department of Defense took the position that it was doubtful that Iran could field any airworthy F-14 Tomcats due to the unavailability of replacement parts. This book completely refutes that statement. According to this book, Iran fielded combat-ready Tomcats for at least 20 years after the United States cut off suport following the 1978 revolution. The Tomcat performed a crucial role in the air defense of Iran throughout the various Iran/Iraq conflicts, serving not just as a fighter but also as an ad-hoc AWACS platform.During a trip last year to the Davis-Monthan aircraft boneyard outside of Tucson, Arizona, I saw that all of the non-museum Tomcats are being sliced up to make sure that Iran can't get parts. This is a shame, and it's like closing the barndoor after the horse has escaped. Iran developed a domestic avionics industry in large part to produce domestically the spare parts needed to keep its Western-bloc aircraft flying. For all its anti-Israel rhetoric, throughout the conflicts with Iraq, Iran kept a backchannel trade with Israel for parts and expertise that were withheld by the United States, but as time went on support through Israel became less and less necessary. (As I was writing this update 8/2009, I did a quick web search. Apparently there have been recent confirmed sitings of Iranian F-14s in the air, seeming to confirm to a degree that Iran is able to produce or procure the parts they need despite the US ban.)I want to add one final thing. The author uses pseudonyms to refer to the various aviators who contribute their stories. Presumably, everchanging political winds in Iran make it impossible to get the participants to talk with attribution under their real names. Unfortunately, that makes it difficult to verify any of the combat narratives in the book. The reader can choose to believe them or not."},{"Title":"Iranian F-14 Tomcat Units in Combat (Combat Aircraft)","review":"The Grumman information film on the F-14 program for Iran is on Youtube. Many younger readers are shocked to learn Iran was so close a U.S. Ally that it was the only other nation other than the USA that got this plane. The story of these planes and men are proof of the need to seperate religion from politics. In the Shah's time the Iranian Air Force (IIAF) was so potent Saddam Hussien would have never dreamed attack Iran. At the time the planes were bought they were a huge source of resentment for their cost among Iranians but the Shah believed and was proven correct, Iran was encircled by threats from the then Soviet Union and Arab States and felt the planes were a necessary evil. This book has many rare pictures and it is a must read for any Tomcast fan. I think it should be noted the Shah's eldest son Prince Reza Pahlavi and heir to the throne and qualified fighter pilot asked in 1980 to be allowed to go home and defend Iran. Khommeni turned him down of course. [...]"},{"Title":"Iranian F-14 Tomcat Units in Combat (Combat Aircraft)","review":"I purchased the Kindle version for my computer.

Certainly analyzing the contradictory and often ridiculous military press releases by the Iranian and Iraqi Governments or ill-informed media accounts at that time would provide little useful material. However, aviation enthusiasts Tom Cooper and Farzad Bishop, armed with \\"excellent contacts in Iran\\" and with former Iranian fighter pilots abroad, feel that they have the necessary information to write an accurate history of the Iranian F-14s in the 1980-88 War. At first glance, this volume in Osprey's Combat Aircraft series seems pretty exciting, given the paucity of information upon this still-relevant aircraft. However, readers who reflect upon the lack of bona fide sources provided and the difficulty in extracting military information from a repressive society like Iran may walk away with the conclusion that something is pretty fishy here.For some reason, the authors leave the most telling statement until the last few pages: \\"It remains unclear exactly how many air-to-air kills were scored by IRIAF [Iran Air Force] F-14s between 7 September 1980 and 7 July 1988, as Air Force records were repeatedly tampered with during and after the war, mainly for political, religious or personal reasons. This has led to considerable confusion.\\" The authors of this volume claim that Iranian F-14s had 159 \\"confirmed kills\\" during the Iran-Iraq War, but admits that a post-war conference in Tehran said that the F-14s only scored 24 \\"confirmed kills\\" with 6 other \\"probables.\\" The authors also admit that other sources suggest numbers somewhere in between 30 and 150, which is a pretty huge range of discrepancy. The authors provide an appendix with a breakdown of all \\"confirmed\\" Iranian F-14 kills; according to this table, Iranian F-14s shot down 50 of Iraq's 285 fighters (17.5%) in the first three months of the war, for no loss of their own. The authors also claim that one Iranian F-14 shot down four Iraqi fighters with a single Phoenix missile! Sorry, if you want to try and make claims like that, you had better have more than \\"Major Ali's word on it.\\" These are the same guys who lie to the world every day about their nuclear program, isn't it?Throughout the volume, the authors make the repeated claim that the US military was in a state of denial about the true performance of Iranian F-14 fighters, but that they have the unvarnished truth from some unnamed, former Iranian pilots, somewhere, sometime. I kept wondering - as I'm sure many readers will - who are these authors and how did they get this information? Farzad Bishop's bio states that he is an Iranian-born aviation analyst with \\"unique personal experiences and encounters\\" and that Austrian-born Tom Cooper has established \\"excellent contacts with many informed sources in Iran.\\" This means that these guys must be pretty cozy with the Iranian Government. Given the difficulty of Westerners acquiring reliable military-related information from within the Islamic Republic of Iran, these authors owe the reading public more of an explanation of how this data was acquired. Researchers will find this work virtually useless since it lacks any kind of references, other than a \\"wink, wink...we got this information on the sly from sources that cannot be revealed\\" or \\"Major Ali told us...\\" At best, this volume is more like military gossip, than military history. At worst, this volume might be a conduit for Iranian Government-sponsored disinformation.If one accepts any of the number of kills provided, one wonders why the Iranians let the war drag on for eight grueling years if they had such an awesome weapon. If a handful of F-14s could shoot down nearly one-fifth of the Iraqi Air Force in the first few months of the war while on the defensive, what might they have accomplished on the offensive? Why didn't the IRIAF use its F-14 fighters to escort F-4 and F-5 fighter-bombers and bomb the heck out of Baghdad every day until Saddam asked for a ceasefire? While the IRIAF lacked heavy bombers, even their aircraft could carry sufficient bombs to cause considerable havoc in downtown Baghdad. Simple answer: they didn't because they couldn't.This volume also has a subtle but considerable anti-US bias. While the authors never mention the cause of US animosity toward Iran - the 1979-1980 Hostage crisis brought about by Iran - they suggest that difficulties in acquiring spare parts for the F-14s was caused by US pique or neglect. The authors make a number of silly claims about US Navy ships assisting Iraqi air strikes that seem to come straight from the Iranian Propaganda Ministry. Furthermore, despite that fact that hundreds of American technicians were in Iran to support the F-14 program in 1976-1979, the authors seem to have made no effort to interview Americans about the performance of Iranian F-14s. The authors constantly suggest that the US military under-rated the performance and ability of Iranian F-14s, but ignore the fact that US Air Force AWACS were probably tracking most air combat over the Persian Gulf during the war and probably had as good a picture of air combat results - if not better - than the Iranians themselves. The disinformation content in this volume surfaces when readers are supposed to trust unnamed Iranian sources more than radar plots and intercepts of \\"cockpit chatter.\\" When all is said and done with this volume, the actual contribution of the Iranian F-14s in the Iran-Iraq War is unclear."},{"Title":"Iranian F-14 Tomcat Units in Combat (Combat Aircraft)","review":"The author has tried to shed light on a great story but has failed to provide evidence for his claims. Though I do not doubt the performance of some of the IRIAF units in 1980s, it is not enough for the author to just state stories/gossip as fact. Can not recommend this book if you're seriously curious about F-14 combat stuff with the Iranians."},{"Title":"Iranian F-14 Tomcat Units in Combat (Combat Aircraft)","review":"F-14 Tomcats remain the mainstay of the IRIAF today and pose a serious challenge to anyone who plans an air strike against Iran. The book gives a nice operational record of the type in Iranian service with many photos and personal stories of heroism, triumph and sacrifice. The IRIAF of the 1980s was initially decimated by the mullahs but the F-14 fleet kept enough of its skilled personnel to give the Iraqis a bloody nose. \\"Shah's pilots\\" returned to duty en masse after the Iraqi invasion (pardoned by the revolutionary government) and used the F-14 in a most professional way scoring numerous kills. The author overturns some myths about the F-14s, like that the American technicians sabotaged the AIM-54 missiles or that the lack of spare parts reduced the number of available aircraft to a mere handful. The Iranians not only put the F-14 to use as a pure air to air fighter, but they used boldly the AWG-9/AIM-54 combination scoring kills from extreme ranges like 56, 64 and even 100 km! In one case an AIM-54 hit destroyed three (!) Iraqi jets with its blast and there were cases where single F-14s engaged eight or more enemy aircraft in dogfight and prevailed! The main problem was the TF30 engines which caused more losses than the enemy fire. Of course the lack of published records does not help to verify the total number of kills achieved by the IRIAF F-14s but they must be several dozens given the superiority of the type over the Iraqi MiGs and Mirages. It is doubtful though whether the IRIAF Tomcats remain as potent today and how many AIM-54 missiles are left in stock, but surely their pilots and technicians know the F-14 well and have even made some improvised corrections to it."},{"Title":"Iranian F-14 Tomcat Units in Combat (Combat Aircraft)","review":"In his review, R. A Forczyk (Laurel, MD USA), unwittingly notes the cause of US animosity towards Iran as the 1979 Hostage Crisis. However, he fails to mention that the source of hostage crisis is indeed the 1953 CIA coupe against the democratically elected and legal government of Iran. In fact, it is this unwise, and shortsighted effort by CIA only a few months after a Republican was elected into the office, that set the stage for terror in the Middle East in the coming years. R. A Forczyk conveniently ignores the undeniable facts of our current history. The reality is that the Iranian Air Force outperformed their Iraqi and non-Iraqi/Arab counterparts inspite of all adversity and inspite of lack of spare part and munitions for their aircrafts. No other Air Force could have acheived the results acheieved by the Iranian Air Force. It shows the depth of creativity by Iranian Air Force personnel demonstrated and documented by this book.

Pankau, CLI, CPP, DABFE and his contributions to the private investigation profession, and was saddened to learn of his recent passing. Mr. Pankau has written some books of value regarding private investigation. Unfortunately, this is not one of them.This book contains little in the way of actual techniques/procedures and the vast majority of this book's resources are completely outdated. 55 of the book's 178 pages are dedicated to a breakdown of the digits of a social security number. This, like most of the other information in this book, could be easily found via a simple Internet search.In addition, the forms and checklists are far from comprehensive. As always, I encourage all investigators to make their own customized forms and checklists, rather than rely on those composed by others.I purchased this book for under $15.00 and was still disappointed. Spend the full $35.00 list price and you'll probably feel much worse.If you're interested in information regarding asset investigations, I highly recommend (emphasis added) \\"How To Do Financial Asset Investigations\\" by Ronald L. Mendell, BS, CLI (ISBN: 039807044X). For information regarding basic (emphasis added) locate and background check information, I highly suggest purchasing \\"The Complete Idiot's Guide To Private Investigation\\" by Steven Kerry Brown (ISBN: 0028643992). Brown's work is also a must-have for anyone entering or attempting to enter the private investigation profession. Brown's text is half the price of Pankau's and contains much more content and much more comprehensive, pertinent, and up-to-date information.As always, check with your local library or bookstore to see if you can read/review this or any title before deciding to make a purchase. This method has effectively allowed me to make the most of my investigative library budget.I hope you found this review helpful.

It was full of insights into life in England during the second world war. It would appeal to fans of British mysteries."},{"Title":"Green for Danger","review":"3 1/2 stars.This edition is the Carroll & Graf 1989 hardcover version of this book, (dark blue book club binding with a green dust jacket, 172 pages), which features a two-page Preface by H.R.F. Keating (The Perfect Murder (Inspector Ghote Mystery)), and a five-page Introduction by Otto Penzler (The Best American Mystery Stories of the Century (The Best American Series).)The setting for this mystery is early World War II small-town England and revolves around six murder suspects (this is not a spoiler as we're told this up front), three of whom are physicians and the other three being V.A.D. nurses. The first murder transpires in the operating theater and the medical team initially sees the fatality as nothing more than an anesthetic death; however, local police Inspector Cockrill soon unearths a number of possible underlying motives for what turns out to be a clear homicide, committed by a resolute killer.The backdrop of the diminutive Heron's Park military hospital, its staff trying to function during a period of extreme rationing and while German bombs and \\"doodlebugs\\" (V-1 Buzz Bombs) rain down on everyone (and which is why there are so many emergency surgeries), generates a potentially savory ambiance. Christianna Brand's evocation of multiple love angles throughout the story somewhat additionally benefits the overall tale. The author pretty much challenges the reader to guess who the killer is and I must confess that I was successfully decoyed, even though I typically unmask the killer(s) in a timely manner better than half the time.In both the Preface and the Introduction one encounters the hackneyed allusions to Christie, Sayers and others - but, (as is clearly elucidated in Penzler's Introduction), this mystery tale is not a \\"Golden Age\\" type cozy murder, which I think a lot of mystery enthusiasts might anticipate since the book was originally published in 1944. Here we have more of a contemporary Ellery Queen-type detective mystery and the story therefore lacks many of the Edwardian devices which a number of us devour with such great heartiness, such as we find in the writings of the Grand Dames and in some of the writings of the more renowned male mystery authors such as Doyle and Upfield (Mr. Jelly's Business.)While this story is generally a good one I still felt that Brand missed the chance to inject the savory wallpaper and the colorful principals into this account that cozy murder fans fancy so much. Brand's characters come off as utterly human, demonstrating few personal eccentricities. There is little literary expansion of their respective backgrounds and so we don't get to know them all that intimately. Everything is on the table here and the sub-plots manifest little more than window trimming.Another cumbersome aspect of Brand's story is that these suspects are not of a single household (family members, servants, and guests) as we so often encounter in the classic British mystery - as a result, it's tough for the reader to grasp a mental image of each principal, an actuality which may have been employed by design. In other words, Brand launched a new era of British mystery, and one which departed in style from its much-beloved predecessors.My only direct criticism of the work is chiefly in regard to the lengthy and tiresome chatter (dialogue) between the suspects as to who among them could have committed the murders. Inspector Cockrill's tactic to pressure his prime suspect into a confession by having these folks all tailed round the clock is equally grueling for the reader. To be precise, this tale drags in places.In summary, my view is a subjective one but it's still a perspective which is shared by many of my peer readers. I didn't feel that this story effectively compared with the superlative art of Christie, Sayers, Tey, Marsh, and all the others which gave rise to the \\"Golden Age\\" of the traditional British mystery. If Brand's writing does compare at all to an earlier writer, I would have to say that Austin Freeman's mysteries are candidates, ergo:The Mystery At Number 31, New Inn. I would normally not attempt to make a point of Brand's approach to the detective novel had this particular book not been lauded as one of the great mysteries of all time.

I would normally not attempt to make a point of Brand's approach to the detective novel had this particular book not been lauded as one of the great mysteries of all time. Therefore, I'm going to recommend this one only to fans of the more contemporary mysteries."},{"Title":"Green for Danger","review":"This is one of the undoubted masterpieces of classic mystery fiction. At least 3 mystery classic collections have chosen it as a top book; I know no other book so chosen. (These are: Bantam Classic Mysteries, from the 1960's, introduced by Anthony Boucher; The Mystery Library, from the 1970's UCSD, with introductions and other features, including one by the author; and the Bantam Mystery collectio, hardcovered from early 1980's by Bantam Books, also with an introduction). Brand writes a clasically constructed tale, with definite victims and murderer (and sleuth). It is full of atmosphere, suspense, and finely constructed fair play. MUST NOT be missed by classic mystery fans."},{"Title":"Green for Danger","review":"Born in 1907 in Malaya, Mary Christianna Milne Lewis worked as everything from a governess to a nightclub dancer before discovering her niche as an author with the novel DEATH IN HIGH HEELS. Although she is now best known as the creator of the \\"Nurse Matilda\\" stories for children, by the time of her 1988 death she had written seventeen mystery novels; while not as well known in the United States as the works of Agatha Christie, Dorothy Sayers, and Nygio Marsh, they have remained popular in England and Europe and are often considered classics of their kind.Published in 1944, GREEN FOR DANGER is generally regarded as Brand's best work. Set in an somewhat impromptu English hospital at the height of the Blitz, the story opens with the unexpected death of a patient during what should be a routine surgery--a death which draws the unwilling attention of Brand's re-occuring detective Inspector Cockrill, who is more than willing to dismiss the idea of foul play until one of the nurses involved in the surgery is found stabbed to death on the same operating table. As the investigation evolves, it becomes clear that the killer must be one of six involved with the unexpectedly dead patient, a situation which allows for considerable tension as the story progresses.Although the plot is remarkably clever and the characters extremely well drawn, GREEN FOR DANGER is particularly famous for its medical setting. Brand presents the surgical proceedures of the era with tremendous clarity and readability; few have equalled her presentation, much less bested it. The novel's war-time period also adds considerable interest to the story and is equally central to the work. These two elements interlock for a fascinating read from start to finish.As already noted, Brand's novels are not particularly well-known outside of England and Europe. This is a pity: she is a witty, surprisingly ironic writer who knows how to spin a classic English mystery. Fans of the genre who come to her works for the first time are sure to be delighted.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Green for Danger","review":"Christianna Brand is one of the lesser-known lights of Golden Age detective fiction, which is a shame, because she has enough talent to be far better-known. This mystery, set at a military hospital during World War II, is one of my favorites. Brand knew her stuff when it came to military hospitals, and the details really serve to ground the plot; she knows exactly how the wards would have been laid out, how much medicine the patients would have been given, who did what, who went where... and, of course, there were the usual vagaries of the war: bombing, cramped shelters, black-out. The mystery itself is interesting. I think the story wouldn't have been half so powerful if she had taken a more minimalist approach, which is yet another reason to love her-- every detail matters."},{"Title":"Green for Danger","review":"Another book that can be read over and over, and one that the reader will enjoy even more after seeing the wonderful movie starring Alistair Sim as the detective. Set in a remote hospital in the English countryside during WWII, it's cleverly plotted and fun. A great way to be introduced to Ms. Brand's other entertaining reads."},{"Title":"Green for Danger","review":"A mystery who dunnit set in a World War II military hospital in England. Brand has a very similar style to Agatha Christie, she is a very accomplished writer in the genre in her own right and does not suffer in comparison with such elevated company. I am reluctant to spell out too much of the plot other than to say it revolves around the Doctors, Nurses and Patients. After all the point of mystery novel reading is trying to fathom out the real evidence from the red herrings yourself and I would hate to rob a potential reader of the fun of trying to solve the crime. I didn't figure it out myself until it was laid out before me by the detective at the end of the book. A worthwhile read from an excellent writer of murder mystery."},{"Title":"Green for Danger","review":"First published in 1944, this is the second in Christianna Brand's novels featuring the chain smoking Inspector Cockrill (first book in the series isHeads You Loseand probably her most famous mystery, being made into a movie with Alastair SimGreen for Danger (The Criterion Collection). The novel is set during WWII in a military hospital. Brand herself was living near such a hospital, where her husband worked, during the blitz and brings much of her experiences at that time into this novel. She was told the best thing she could do for the war effort was to carry on writing and bring much needed foreign currency into the country, so donning her tin hat and dodging the bombs, she completed this book. Although WWII crime mysteries are virtually a genre unto themselves these days, this is very much the real thing and you can feel the authentity of experience in every line.The novel is set at Heron's Park in Kent, a former childrens sanatorium, now a military hospital. The main characters are Gervase Eden, who ran a successful Harley Street practice before the war, Jane Woods, who was a successful dress designer (Brand ties this in nicely with a previous novelDeath in High Heels (Brand, Christianna)), Esther Sanson, a young VAD with a hypochondriac mother, Mr Moon, a local surgeon, Dr Barnes, a local anesthetist, Frederica Linley, a young VAD and Sister Marion Bates. These characters are tied together by secrets, relationships and by becoming suspects when an old man, Joseph Higgins, dies in the operating theatre. There seems no plausible motive to kill the harmless elderly man, who in peacetime was a postman. However, as Cockrill is called in to investigate, what could have been an accident becomes obviously a case of murder.I am so glad that Christianna Brand's crime novels are now available on kindle and hope she reaches a new audience. Her books are excellent, fast paced and with an exciting plot and great characters. This is a vastly enjoyable mystery, with a real sense of place and time. If you wish to read on in the series, the next book isThe Crooked Wreath. If you are a fan of Golden Age Detective fiction and like a good 'whodunnit', then you will certainly enjoy Christianna Brand."},{"Title":"Green for Danger","review":"How delightful! After much reading of dark and sinister Nordic mysteries...GREEN FOR DANGER. It's a melodramatic yet farcical mystery with shades of late restoration comedy (think Sheridan's \\"The Rivals\\") and humour in time of war (think M*A*S*H) adding a dash of detective-in-rumpled mackintosh (think Peter Falk's Columbo).Brandt's murder mystery, first published in 1944, is set in England during WW2 at a manor turned military hospital. She begins the novel like a playbill: listing the cast of doctors and nurses (and suspects) through their acceptance of service letters.The comparison to \\"The Rivals\\" and farce comes early in the novel. Brand uses word blunders and intentional misspelling to accompany her use of language and colour to spice up her mystery. While the first victim's wife, Widow 'iggins, is a poor Mrs. Malaprop, the author creates many simple errors such as \\"syren\\" suits and \\"animiles.\\" Yet other 50 cents words are spelled correctly: two in one paragraph - lugubriously and encomiums. She also employs use of such Britishisms as Box and Cox, Chalk and Cheese.By Chapter 2, almost all the principals have nicknames. We have Woody, Freddi, Barney, Don Juan, and plump, little Major Moon showing \\"funny, little schoolboy expressions.\\" The patients also have nicknames: the oldest is \\"Pop,\\" the tallest is \\"Lofty,\\" the shortest,\\"Tich,\\" and the bald is \\"Curly.\\" Even Detective Inspector Cockrill earns his childhood nickname of \\"Cockie.\\"Colour is dominant and offers a few red herrings. Many examples of the colour green serve as clues. Both patients and medical personnel wear long green gowns - some have green masks. The centre cylinder on Barnes' anaesthetic trolley has a green-coloured and dangerous cylinder of carbon dioxide. The operating theatre is a \\"shining green place,\\" \\"a hot. green room.\\" The very title of the mystery GREEN FOR DANGER is self-explanatory.Sentimentalism also abounds. There are goodly examples of sentimental romantic attachments (shades of a less subtle Hot Lips and Frank pairing in MASH) but the one that pleased this reader was the hospital security guard's dismay over Joseph Higgins obituary stating erroneously that Higgins has Given his Life for Others in an air-raid. (This obit error is also a valuable clue!)And Brand doesn't forget the double gallant aspect of restoration comedy. Remember the end and re-read the setting of the last paragraphs. Eden calls Woody a gallant person. Gay and gallant. Major Eden, the former Harley Street surgeon, has been all along a gallant of the Captain Absolute variety. Their tryst occurs amidst a sentimental setting: the paragraph that begins \\"The apples were young and green upon the boughs...\\""},{"Title":"Green for Danger","review":"I am an absolute nut over Agatha Christie and Dorothy L. Sayers, and I've read a number of their contemporaries as well such as Marjory Allingham and Ngaio Marsh. I thought I'd mined the entire Golden Age Detective story authors, and then I discovered Christianna Brand! Her Inspector Cockrill is a marvel, and this book definitely deserves to be rated as her masterpiece. It has a complex and intriguing plot, with a delicious sense of humour woven in between the pages. The novel takes place in England during the Blitz, and the setting is a country military hospital. You'd think they'd have enough natural deaths in such a setting, but it appears that a murderer is loose in Heron's Park hospital. Brand works with a small group of suspects (6 only), but even with that it's not easy to figure out. And small chain-smoking, dishevelled Inspector Cockrill is a gem. Need to read more of these!"},{"Title":"Green for Danger","review":"For anyone who likes a good old-fashioned mystery; this book even has illustrations. The focus is on Whodunit and not the detective's dysfunctional life or menangerie.

The futility of war is quite apparent, but as in other wars what choice does one have. All wars boil down to the same basic premise, kill or be killed. We're served up as cannon fodder all for the greater good.This is a great book, easy to read and hard to put down."},{"Title":"The Cross of Iron","review":"Willie Heinrich was a highly decorated enlisted soldier in the German Wehrmacht. He was a member of the famous Tank Destroyers (Panzer Jaegers) on the Eastern Front. He survived his ordeal, and a decade later he wrote a highly acclaimed novel, \\"The Willing Flesh\\". It's English translation was renamed The Cross of Iron. Sam Peckinpauh, 22 years later, adapted the novel into a film which became a cult classic. Some regard it as the finest World War Two film of its generation.Heinrich and his main character, Rudolf Steiner, served in the ill fated 17th Army. This army group was activated as part of Army Group South, and it participated in the battles of Southern Russia. After getting as far south as the Caucaus Mountains in the autumn of 1942, it began a long retreat into the Kuban in December of that year. Hitler refused to allow the 8 division that made up this army group to retreat into the Crimea until well after the 17th Army was cut-off from the rest of the German Army. The 17th Army and its 65,000 soldiers eventually surrendered in late 1943.It was against this backdrop (April 1943 to late October 1943) that Cross of Iron takes place. The hero (or anti-hero) is Sergeant Steiner. He is a grizzeled, burnt out platoon sergeant. The novel opens up with the platoon cut off from the rest of the company. Steiner is is not only unflappable, fearless, but he is also outstanding in his field craft. The rest of the platoon is litterally lost without him. He disappears for hours only to show back up again with plans on how to get back to friendly lines. The entire novel follows this templete. Steiner is the anti-hero. He's a great soldier, but he hates his profession. The battle scenes are intense and straight forward. There are no histronics and melodrama. The novel is totally void of sentimentality. Heinrich uses dialogue to give the plot and characters depth, but without the speechifying one sees in novels of earlier eras (think Tolstoy).I think a reader will find the novel interesting but at times ponderous. There are only so many times a writer can depecit the horrors and intensity of battle without falling into repetition. I think it is obvious that Heinrich attempts to show the war on the Eastern Front for what it was. And in this sense I think he failed. Perhaps something was lost in translation. But Heinrich tries too hard to be the kind of existential writer that was all the rage in the 1950s. He delves too much into his minimalist prose and he ends up creating characters that are not complete. In real life it is very rare to find an outstanding soldier and leader who harbors the kind of existential despair and hatred that Steiner holds. The stress of combat is just too demanding to allow for the kind of navel gazing one finds in Steiner. In reality, the average German soldier continued to fight with the kind of skill and hardness on the Eastern Front that is today legendary. Heinrich himself was one of them.On the other hand, there are times that the character Steiner is very compelling. The opening and ending chapters bear this out. It is in the middle of the book that one finds problems. Steiner cares deeply for the men he leads. But he also hates his men for their neediness. This dichotomy eventually plays itself out in the movie adaptation (which differs greatly from the novel); but, it is never complete in the novel. Do read this book and judge for yourself."},{"Title":"The Cross of Iron","review":"If I did, I would go back and recoup the time I spent reading this book. I read the Forgotten Soldier by Guy Sajer in high school and still have the book. Much like this book, the line is blurred and controversial on whether the account is based on reality or the imagination of the writer.I have to come down on the latter rather than the former. The book just does not read true based on what 35 years of reading about the German Wehrmacht has taught me.The tactics of the German squad was based upon the light machine gun. It was the center of the squad, the Landsers were there to support it and protect it. It was the basis for fire and movement. It would lay down fire, the Landsers would maneuver, then it would move forward and so on. What I read in the book, read more like American tactics and doctrine of the day.There was way too much philosophical banter between the officers and men. Please...Yes, yes, it fits into the great discussions of the day, the righteousness of or futility of war. The powerlessness of men caught up in it, them being displaced by it, torn from loved ones, blah...blah...blah. What hatred there is displayed in the book is reserved for the Soldaten's own officers, not for the Soviet Ivans. I hardly think this would have been the case given the nature of the war at the time. The US in Viet Nam, yes, the Wehrmacht in then mid 1940's, hardly.It does nothing to impart to the viewer the real nature and deep seated hatreds that fueled the war in the East. It actually looks pretty benign to me. The main character is afforded two trips off the front line at a time when we are being told that Gotterdammerung is only one major attack away. I hardly felt anything for the characters, and can see now, why the Sam Peckenpah movie based on the book had characters introduced and had a completely different ending. The book would have flopped hopelessly on the screen as written.I realize it probably lost something in the translation (I hope that was the cause). I found it disconcerting and annoying to have russian weapons referred to using American slang: Tommy gun was universally used to refer to the Thompson Sub Machine gun, and not to the PPSh-41, the drum fed weapon used by the Soviets.The book is berift of any technical jagon that would lend it just a smattering of reality to the book. No mention of the K-98 for instance. No mention of the type of russian tanks that always seemed to be lurking just inside the woods or behind the hill, like some primieval beasts but never revealing themselves.The Soviet war machine is presented in the book in the Cold War form, the brobdingnagian bear, undefeatable, a veritable boogeyman. The truth is probably different based on what we know now: Seven Soviet Ivans died for for every one of Hitler's Soldaten. The Soviets were poorly led, their lives wasted by Stalin, Zhukov, Chuikov who promptly buried the magnitude of the frequent defeats. The Wehrmact was still capable of inflicting horrendous casualties on the attacking Soviets even into the closing days of the war fighting in the streets of Berlin. Time and outright false accounts that pass for history of WWII have probably obscured the truth about the Eastern Front. A titanic struggle it was, but the Soviets army was and has always been a paper bear. It served both sides interests for it to be so up until the day the curtain fell and we could see just how rotten an organization it has always been.Taking all this into account, the book is a fanciful novel at best with little of it based on historical fact."},{"Title":"The Cross of Iron","review":"This is one of the most poorly written books I have ever struggled through. The plot plods, the characters are wooden stereotypes the philosophical discussion is asinine (and endless) the action scenes are dull and the dialog sounds like something from a schoolboy comic from the 50'sCharacters act, react and speak in a fashion divorced from ant kind of reality, but this is not in any way interesting, just more bad writing. Mr. Heinrich may have been there but I guess not everyone is cut uout to be a writer. A rare case in which the movie is far better than the book.Or maybe it's just a really bad translation."},{"Title":"The Cross of Iron","review":"Willi Heinrich's Cross of Iron addresses the challenges facing German soldiers on the Eastern front during World War II. Some of these trials are physical; the novel begins with a German platoon stranded miles behind the Russian lines, without rations or adequate weapons, and progresses through brutal sieges and shattering assaults. Under the strain of mental exhaustion and the extreme stress of combat conditions, the platoon's commander, non-commissioned officer, Rolf Steiner, must make critical decisions for his men to survive. More compelling than the substantive difficulties Steiner and his men undergo are the psychological problems that war imposes on those who fight. The soldiers' reactions to these problems, ranging from bleak acceptance of what seems inevitable to an unquenchable ambition for advancement, provide the impetus for a plot line that centers on the unremitting hardship of war.Heinrich writes in understated, direct prose designed to relate events that are inherently dramatic without pretension or histrionics. Coming suddenly, without warning or prejudice, death is documented rather than lamented: \\"The earth exploded. The blast knocked him backwards and he lay staring up at the sky\\" (257). Dialogue becomes the author's outlet for addressing the important questions raised by the book's events. Hardened by the experience of relentless combat, the soldiers scathingly scrutinize both motivations for combat and human nature itself. The infantrymen's reactions to the deaths of their comrades carry a particular significance. In one instance, two soldiers remark upon the death of a companion in markedly different ways. Private Kern finds a cause for anger as well as lament when Pfc. Dorn, \\"the professor,\\" dies, blaming not the enemy but the war: \\"This miserable war - just to kill like that - a man of his learning\\" (258). Expressing an indifferent fatalism, Corporal Kruger responds, \\"You think any of you are going to make out better?\\" (258).One of Germany's great novels of World War II, Cross of Iron tells of a world without reason. Heinrich's antagonist is not human; death, an indiscriminate and omnipresent force, drives the action and torments the reader's emotions. As this work shows, war supercedes such fixtures of humanity as God, patriotism, heroism, and morality; the necessity of survival renders them peripheral."},{"Title":"The Cross of Iron","review":"Unlike so many of his fellow German veterans, Willi Heinrich elected to relate his WWII experiences through his outstanding novel, The Cross of Iron. The book deals with the German withdrawal from the Kuban Peninsula. This is one of the far flung fronts that comparatively little has been written.Heinrich's protagonist is Sgt. Steiner, the veteran platoon leader that has seen more than his share of combat and knows how to achieve an objective and keep his men alive. He is the cynical sort of heroic soldier, who does his job not for medals or politics, but to keep himself and his men alive for one more day.Heinrich's Landser are a great cross section of Germans from the young replacements to the grizzled veterans to the true Nazi. Into his group arrives Cpt. Stranksy, who has been in the occupied West and seen virtually no combat, yet is foaming at the mouth to win his Knight's Cross as befits his status as a member of the Prussian Officer Class. His motivations are purely self-serving and contrast sharply with Steiner.Heinrich portrays the German officer class with fairness and realism. Officers like Kiesel and Brandt represent the best characteristics of German officers and Stransky and Triebig show the dark side of that same group. And of course Steiner and his men aren't that far removed from Bill Mauldin's Willie and Joe slogging it through Italy.The book is at its best during Steiner's Platoon's efforts to escape a Soviet occupied factory. It is riveting reading and as frightening as any horror movie. And in truth what could be more frightening than knowing that you are being hunted by an enemy that wants to kill you with extreme prejuidice.Heinrich brings the reader into that factory and into the dark woods of the Kuban peninsula. He succeeds in making the reader see Steiner and his men, not as Nazis, not as German Soldiers, but as men trapped by circumstance in the most awful of situations.And finally, he creates in a Steiner, a man that we can all respect and root for. We want Steiner and Kruger and Schnurrbart to make it back to their own lines. But war is war and Heinrich does not hold back its punches. And in the end the best anyone caught in the cataclysm of war can hope for...is a trip into the light."},{"Title":"The Cross of Iron","review":"I loved this book very much, and think that like others have said, it is comparable to All Quiet on the Western Front. Furthermore, I think it surpasses AQWF in terms of exploring war and the people involved, especially from the German/Nazi side. It's harsh and crude at times, with descriptions more direct than poetic. Perhaps many would be put off by the fact that it's written from the Nazi perspective, but the truth is that 'Nazi' is more a description of an ideology that not all followed, rather than a term for the foot soldier who is simply fighting to save his life and what he may believe at first to be the survival of his country."},{"Title":"The Cross of Iron","review":"...P>A far better book than Guy Sajer's THE FORGOTTEN SOLDIER, the characters are richly developed; everyone who serves in the military for any length of time eventually encounters a Captain Stransky - a man bent on \\"spriritual domination of his battalion.\\" Sympathetic to the German soldier, but not the Nazi cause, this is a gripping and honest portrayal of men at war, with many surprise turns along the way."},{"Title":"The Cross of Iron","review":"It is a great book, much better than the movie. It showed the brutal side of war and human darkness. I was totally absorbed by it. In fact, I finished in 2 days. However, after I finish it, I am a little bit disappointed not only by the ending, but also the auther's gloom portrait. Definitely the author made his point on the hopelessness and waste of the war. But frankly speaking I was looking for a more upbeat picture.Anyway, a great book!"},{"Title":"The Cross of Iron","review":"This novel, written by a veteran of the Russian Front, gives us through the eyes of his main character insights into the German army of the Russian front in gritty and realistic detail.This is not a thumbs up and cherio type novel but the graphic bitter story of survival written by a man who was there.I read this novel while in High School and found it most insightful into the German army of WWII as well as the hell of war. My father's experiences in Korea were undoubtedly similar."},{"Title":"The Cross of Iron","review":"Published in 1956, this is one of the first, and certainly the best, war novels that captures the horrors of war from the German perspective. This book introduces the reader to what life was like as a German Infantry soldier as the Russians began pushing the Germans back in WW2.Author Willi Heinrich writes with such authority and realism because he fought on the Russians. The war on the Eastern front was a savage, brutal war, with both sides literally taking no prisoners. Millions fought and died on both sides. Vivid, realistic, Heinrich depicts how war de-humanizes everyone. There are no winners, only a few survivors. To fight when there is no hope, the despair and all human emotions are shown to the reader. Heat, cold, hunger, rage, rape, boredom, sacrifice, slaughter to name but a few.It is no understatement to put this book in the same class as other great war novels such as The Naked and The Dead, Catch-22, Slaughterhouse 5, The Thin Red line, the Red Badge of Courage. I found this book to be amazing in its ability to put you there, to make you feel these emotions. That's what great authors do. To read this is to get a glimpse of a side of WW2 that most do not know about. Highly recommended. The movie was excellent as well."},{"Title":"The Cross of Iron","review":"Cross of Iron sets the standard for WWII East Front fiction. I first read it maybe 25 years ago and have reread it twice since -- and I rarely reread a novel.

Steiner must go down as one of the greatest charaters of WWII fiction.If you read no other novel of WWII on the Eastern Front, you must read this one.Read this novel and get a real sense for the desperate fighting of the Russian front.Take note -- as ususal, the movie is no substitute for a well written novel."},{"Title":"The Cross of Iron","review":"In a powerful way the book reminds us: Countries / governments go to war.

Practically every code example uses features that haven't been discussed yet.&quot;Pay no attention to that wizard behind the curtain!&quot;Fundamental constructs like if, while, and for are in chapters 7 and 8, but advanced features like I/O and exceptions are in chapter 6. Primitive and user-defined data types are in chapter 4, but arrays are in chapter 11. Chapter 6 is titled &quot;I/O and Exception Handling&quot; but byte streams and character streams are in chapter 9. Relational and boolean operators are two chapters after all the other operators. Spent 2 pages in chapter 2 talking about the &lt;param&gt; tag, then didn't even mention getParameter() in chapter 12 when writing applets is covered.Inheritance is glossed over in 4 pages. AWT visual components have 6 pages waved at them. The author is able to explain FlowLayout, GridLayout, and BorderLayout in less than a page each. Even more amazing, is his ability to explain GridBagLayout in the same amount of space. Discussed Events before Components, and the very first example of an event listener is an anonymous class (with no attempt at an explanation).Likes using variable names that start with a capital letter. Likes intermixing two different styles of curly brace instanceof, event adapter classes, inner classes, anonymous classes, overriding, overloading, Java's character data type, character literals, &quot;functions&quot; in Java (as a flow-of-control construct), repaint(), protected, abstract, command line arguments, parameter passing modes, the default/implicit toString(), polymorphism.In spite of the author's very limited success at covering legitimate introductory topics, he tackles many buffering, measuring fonts, threads, exceptions, GridBagLayout, deprecated event handling.Quotable quotes -&quot;Everything in Java is an object&quot; [p39]&quot;Be careful when using the &gt;= and &lt;= operators. The order of the symbols is critical. Switching the symbols will result in an error.&quot; [p105]&quot;In almost all cases, your last element [in an array] will have a subscript one less than the real total.&quot; [p184]&quot;Interfaces are class-like groups of methods that work with your own program much like an 'assistant program'&quot;.

Out of seven people in the class, I was the only one who was just barely able to figure out how to actually create and execute the programs that the book had us do - and I consider myself a rather good programmer. I was barely able to get myself through the book's terrible examples and descriptions through the use of another Java programming book that I had, online resources, and an uncle who works for Sun. Everyone else had no clue what to do, so I ended up teaching them how to program in Java.The examples that this book uses first consist of copying a program out of the book and compiling it and watching it run, and later they change to copying a program off of the included disk and compiling it and watching it run.Furthermore, concepts that you need to complete some of the problems aren't covered until a chapter or two later; we had to create a program that would get characters out of a string in Chapter 9, and the book doesn't cover the charAt() function that the program needed until Chapter 11! It was just by luck that I flipped ahead in the book and discovered it there.I don't think that I would have minded the deficiencies this book contains if we didn't have to pay so much for it.I told our teacher about this and he put me in charge of finding something else to use for next year's class when I'm gone.

The research progress is surveyed in tenchapters grouped into four thematic parts.The first block consisted of four chapters anddeals with fullerenes in solid state. It is openedby a short survey from C. S. Sundar on positronannihilation spectroscopy and its applicationto electronic structure, defect properties andphase transitions of fullerene solids. E. J.Ansaldo then discusses muon spectroscopy ofpure and doped fullerenes. A comprehensivechapter by Z. Klencsar and A.

Sueki and dealswith applications of radiotracers and nucleardecay phenomena to metallofullerenes. The chapterpoints out high sensitivity and extremely lowdetection limits of the measurements.Radiation chemistry of fullerenes and theirderivatives in solution is surveyed in the fifthchapter written by K.-D. Asmus and D. M. Guldi.The chapter treats redox processes and radicaladdition reactions of pristine fullerenes,fullerenes in heterogeneous guest-host complexes,and functionalized fullerenes.The third thematic block covers various aspectsof the composition of fullerenes and endohedralfullerenes. G. E.

That same year, more people died from falling down stairs than from drug overdoses.From a strictly political point of view, this was a sensible move. It created a threatening enemy out of whole cloth, and this phantom menace allowed Nixon to run a strong &quot;Law and Order&quot; campaign and push the race buttons of white voters. Nothing galvanizes support like the specter of an invasion, and in this case, the invasion would be of middle class, white, America by anti-establishment youth and black culture. The Drug War behemoth was empowered and allowed to run completely out of control when federal and local law enforcement agencies gained the power to seize the property and assets of drug &quot;suspects&quot; without those suspects ever being charged with, much less convicted of, any crime.Dan Baum's book is thoroughly researched and documented, and he doesn't hide behind smoke screen of feigned objectivity."},{"Title":"Smoke and Mirrors: The War on Drugs and the Politics of Failure","review":"The book Smoke and Mirrors is a history of the War on Drugs launched by Richard Nixon and that continues to this day. It is very critical of the War and shows the faults of the War and its negative consequences on American society.The book does not bash just Republicans and the right wing. In fact Baum makes it clear that Nixon's drug-policy was actually not that bad and certainly better than what was to come. Baum also makes it clear that Democrats jumped on the bandwagon and supported the War on Drugs just as much as the Republicans.I was for legalization of marijuana before reading Smoke and Mirrors and now I have even more faith in legalizing marijuana. While I was aware of many things Baum mentions, I did not realize how much the Supreme Court has eroded our civil liberities via the War on Drugs. If you want an engrossing read while learning something useful, this is certainly a book to read."},{"Title":"Smoke and Mirrors: The War on Drugs and the Politics of Failure","review":"Through over 200 personal interviews with 175 people connected with the &quot;War On Drugs&quot; Dan Baum has created the most informative and correct account of the drug war that is availible to man. Nowhere else will you find how the government has targeted drugs as a cheap way to stay elected. Never has the government caused such a false sense of fear then with drugs.&quot;Smoke And Mirrors&quot; is one of the best books I have ever read. No matter how you feel about the drug war, it is worth your time to review this text. You will be outraged at how much injustice has been dealt, and how the &quot;War&quot; as been often racially biased.Even if you see drugs as the ultimate evil that plagues our society and is the root of all our problems, it may be because the true facts have never been given until now. By reading this book, you might discover what has been hidden for so long, and see why the government has been so eager to cover up any positive drug notion (ex. Nixon commissions study to find effects of marijuana. They find no significant health detriments, see medicinal value, and reccommend legalization. Nixon discredits study and brushes it under the rug. Later gets reelected on anti-drug platform. $16 billion spent on the war last year.) Please think, and then read this book. I guarantee that it will be time well spent."},{"Title":"Smoke and Mirrors: The War on Drugs and the Politics of Failure","review":"In this book Baum traces the great American anti-drug crusade back to 1969, the first year of the Nixon administration. In that year more Americans died of choking on food than from the effects of illegal drugs. But drugs, which were a relatively minor public health problem, became the object of a massive legal, political and cultural offensive against the phenomena known as &quot;The Sixties&quot; - and this offensive has gone on ever since.Many of the voters who supported Nixon - and later Reagan - were outraged by the high crime rate among blacks and equally outraged by black political and social activism in the sixties (even though the activists were not the sort of blacks who were likely to commit crimes.) These voters were unwilling to spend more tax money to lower the black crime rate by ending poverty. They wanted something that would, in their minds, punish blacks collectively.The federal government could not attack the sort of crimes that were the object of realistic fears, such as burglary, since these were purely a local matter. However the federal government could go after drugs since they were shipped across state lines.White House staffers looked over a sociological study that showed that a high proportion of heroin addicts committed theft. They came to the conclusion that heroin addiction caused theft - for money to maintain the habit. The author of the study protested that this was not indicated by the data. But the government anti-drug wizards insisted - by attacking heroin, we will lower crime in general and (unspoken but understood) since a high proportion of heroin users are black, we will punish all blacks symbolically.Voters for Nixon and Reagan were also often outraged by white youth who grew their hair long and protested the Vietnam war (these two actions were often seen as identical). To attack these youth symbolically the government went after Marijuana, which many of them smoked. Marijuana, which has not been shown to cause a single death, was lumped with the far more dangerous heroin and cocaine. All of them were to be considered simply as &quot;drugs&quot;, equally bad. The &quot;drug problem&quot; was seen as so severe that it was worth doing away with the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution which prohibits searches and seizures without a warrant. Baum's book gives many examples of bizarre injustices in drug law enforcement.Baum says that the heroin and cocaine problems by themselves would not be enough to justify the huge increase in police powers.&quot;Marijuana,&quot; he writes, &quot;...is politically the most important illegal drug...without the Marijuana ban, the country's &quot;drug problem&quot; would be tiny. There wouldn't be 10 million regular users of illegal drugs in the United States, there would be 2 million.&quot;In the fall of 1996, not long after Baum's book was published, the voters of California approved a referendum legalizing marijuana for medical purposes. Baum wrote in the Rolling Stone that this was the biggest victory that the forces opposing the drug war have had so far.However, Baum's book is not yet out of date. Under the Democrat Clinton, more people have gone to prison for drugs than under the Republicans Reagan and Bush. Baum's book provides many eloquent quotes and statistics for activists against America's ferocious drug laws."},{"Title":"Smoke and Mirrors: The War on Drugs and the Politics of Failure","review":"This extremely well-written journalistic book sheds new light on the War on Drugs. The War on Drugs begins as a campaign ploy and ends up a national hysteria. Although it is harder on Republicans and Conservatives in general, the Democrats become equally complicit in their run to &quot;look tough.&quot; The Democrats sell out to the national hysteria and cause as much damage as the Republicans. It depicts a nation gone crazy, which even now is just beginning to recover."},{"Title":"Smoke and Mirrors: The War on Drugs and the Politics of Failure","review":"Smoke &amp; Mirrors has less to do with drugs than it does with the true casualties of the long-fought War on Drugs -- the many civil liberties that all of us have lost, especially in the last decade, as federal policy has amassed greater and greater powers in the hands of police and prosecutors to conduct their skirmishes and campaigns and the human consequences of these changes.Dan Baum deliberately and meticulously delineates each law, court challenge, or policy change that strips away protections that were rightfully placed there by the Constitution and the courts. Baum points out the many rulings and precedents that have taken away rights for individuals only suspected of criminal conduct. Many readers will be shocked to learn that they no longer enjoy some of these rights that we have long taken for granted.This not a dry book about legal precedence and maneuvers, however; each new onslaught is placed in context by how it affects the people most harmed by them. The names, faces, lives, and families of the persons we have been taught to see as faceless moral failures filling our prisons for such heinous crimes as selling hydroponic equipment to someone who then used it to grow marijuana.For instance, Baum tells about an African American landscaper named Willie Jones traveling from Nashville to Houston to buy shrubs who made the mistake of buying a plane ticket with cash. That bumped him into a drug courier profile and the ticket agent received a reward for reporting the person to authorities who confiscated his cash. Travelers, fitting drug courier profiles, mostly people of color, can be required with impunity now to undergo X-ray examinations, full cavity searches, and to defecate in buckets upon demand before they are allowed to continue on their journey.Mandatory federal sentences for drug crimes place minor non-violent criminals in crowded federal prisons for longer sentences than armed robbers, rapists, and murderers. Federal attorneys are encouraged by policy to re-prosecute criminals who have already served time on the same charges in state prisons. Search warrants can be obtained for drug searches based on hearsay from unnamed informants. School children no longer have rights against search and seizure while in schools. Warrantless searches are allowed now without the permission of the suspected individual. Spot checks to search vehicles are allowed and are becoming more common on our highways.The most odious of these recent infringements however involve civil and criminal forfeiture laws that now make it legal to arbitrarily confiscate the property of someone only suspected of a drug crime. These laws have turned drug investigations into money-making ventures for law enforcement departments around the country. Some even have budgets that rely heavily on property confiscations -- cash, cars, land, homes -- from those suspected of drug crimes -- even if they are not convicted. Drug defendants have their assets frozen and confiscated before their trials.Baum relays the tragic tale of Donald Scott, a man who owned a ranch in Ventura County in California. An L.A. County detective, Gary Spencer, who probably coveted the land for confiscation, obtained a search warrant based on false statements that he had spotted 50 marijuana plants growing on the property during aerial surveillance. The ranch owner was shot to death by Spencer during the raid. The ensuing search uncovered nothing illegal, let alone any evidence of marijuana. No-knock provisions of recent laws that allow police to enter without knocking or identifying themselves for that matter have created this deadly scenario too often in recent years.Mandatory sentences for crack cocaine have turned the War on Drugs into a de facto race war that imprisons a higher percentage of its citizens, especially African American men, than any other country in the world.Drug use and its prohibition was pressure cooked from a health issue handled by medical and social professionals into a law enforcement issue where policymakers became obsessed with punishment and little else. Over time, the issue of drug use was transformed by policymakers from a social ill with root causes into a failure of character among an increasing percentage of the populace.The onslaught of detail delivered by Dan Baum in Smoke and Mirrors has a chilling effect for readers who may never have had a drug-induced experience in their life and may not have paid any attention as the rhetoric that was cooked up as a sexy political issue in the Nixon years became rehashed and heated up through the Reagan and Bush years to a fever pitch. But as Baum clearly explains, the blame is bipartisan. Democrats and Republicans alike have climbed over themselves to enact harsher laws and regulations and the fervor has not abated in recent years just because a Democrat was elected President.This documentation may be Baum's greatest accomplishment as he parades each federal infringement on individual rights that have been whittled away to prosecute a war on drugs.Baum has raised questions that for too long many were too afraid to articulate. He has asked them well, he has asked them of the right people, and he has elicited candid and clarifying answers. This book contains the results of 175 conversations with policy makers who through the years have set these forces into motion and with many innocent victims of those policies. In fact the only person who declined to be interviewed for the book was William Bennett, the drug czar who now makes his fortune in print and as a speaker charging hefty fees as the arbiter of moral virtue.As with any truth telling that draws a sword against the dragons of popular myth, this book obviously took great courage to research and to write. There is an overwhelming sense upon completing this book that there should be those among us with courage enough to seriously question the direction and damages of national drug policies.We have lost too much already, as this misguided domestic policy disguised as a jihad has pilfered public coffers, diverted attention and resources from serious violent crimes, destroyed careers, reputations, and property, and taken a precious toll of innocent lives on both sides of the law."},{"Title":"Smoke and Mirrors: The War on Drugs and the Politics of Failure","review":"Excellent review of major events and social issues that have shaped the &quot;War in Drugs.&quot; While Baum is openly critical of our nation's policy, he backs his points with facts, rather than anecdotes. Unlike other authors in this genre, Baum does not portray the nation's leaders as purposely perpetrating evil on its citizens, knowingly perpetuating the War for their own benefit. Rather, he shows that underneath the utter failure of our drug control policy lies errors in judgement and poor political choices--foremost among them the choice to view drug addiction as a moral evil rather than a neuropsychiatric disease. Furthermore, Baum's scholarly, analytical tone prevents this book from seeming like most others: a bitter, indignant plea for marijuana legalization. An excellent excellent history and summary."},{"Title":"Smoke and Mirrors: The War on Drugs and the Politics of Failure","review":"I first heard the author describing how he conducted his research for this book: he went and talked to the actual people who designed and implemented the various policies that make up the WoD. It sounded like a relatively balanced view of how we got here. Well, it is. I just find the conceptions and motivations of the drug warriors incredibly frustrating (and evil). Then only negative about the book is that its span ended in 93-94ish, leaving out some the egregious violations of our civil liberties. Read the book, and become active in the fight for sanity and freedom!"},{"Title":"Smoke and Mirrors: The War on Drugs and the Politics of Failure","review":"This book draws in a compelling, readable, fact-based way the history of America's War on Drugs. It show how the drug war became the pretence for an assault on civil liberties (specifically, the 4th and 5th amendments) and a broad expansion of federal criminal prosecutions.The book is extremely readable, though the story is seldom linear. The history consists of a series of short pieces, connected only by the chronology. Certain &quot;characters&quot; recur in this story -- mostly villains and victims ... not a lot of heroes here!If you're interested in this topic, it's a great place to start."},{"Title":"Smoke and Mirrors: The War on Drugs and the Politics of Failure","review":"Factual book. Baum is a journalist. This book is a collection of 20 years of DOCUMENTED interviews. I always pondered why lawyers were in charge of the list of drugs that are controlled instead of doctors or chemists. In all this is not the book of a radical- this is a book of fact. It is scary, funny and terribly sad. It made me learn to ask of our government the question, &quot;What motivates the other side, the evils, that you protest?&quot;"},{"Title":"Smoke and Mirrors: The War on Drugs and the Politics of Failure","review":"Each year illicit drugs claim the lives of at least 450 Australians. In WA alone, heroin overdoses have cost more than one life per week so far this year. Politicians, health officials, the police and community in general are struggling to devise a solution to this drug menace.American journalist, Dan Baum, in 'Smoke and Mirrors', has convincingly shown how NOT to approach the problem. Drawing on extensive research in the US, he begins his account after President's Nixon's election in 1968 and traces the ultimately futile War on Drugs through to the early phases of the Clinton Administration. Baum takes the reader through a series of case studies, anecdotes and interviews with key players in the drug war, and repeatedly exposes the cynicism, folly, ineptitude and sometimes racism of politicians and bureaucrats in trying to cope with drug use and abuse in society. Always in the background and, for Baum, at the heart of the problem, is the hitherto unchallenged policy of prohibition which Baum makes clear is seriously flawed in both practice and principle.The cost of this unswerving campaign is staggering by any account. During the Bush years alone, $120 billion was spent on the Drug War. In addition, there has been the enormous cost in terms of human rights violations and crushed civil liberties, best documented by Baum in the harassment, imprisonment and occasionally shooting, of \\"harmless potheads and the generally peaceful growers who supply them\\".The much-vaunted War on Drugs had its genesis in the turbulent 1960s when the counter-culture - as manifested in the massive Vietnam War protests, rock music and alternative lifestyles - reached its zenith. For Nixon, marijuana was a potent symbol of such \\"decadence\\" and its use was vigorously opposed primarily for this reason - not because of its pharmacological properties. Indeed, Baum makes clear that the Drug War has generally had little to do with drugs per se and a lot to do with crude political opportunism.Seizing upon the issue of drugs to target political opponents, the Nixon White House went as far as to enlist television producers in the anti-drug fight through popular cop shows and sitcoms such as Mannix, Mod Squad, Hawaii-Five-O, Mission Impossible and My Three Sons. What they didn't expect, from another quarter in the entertainment industry, was Elvis Presley's unsolicited arrival at the White House in 1971 complete with a nickel-plated .45 automatic as a gift for the President. Elvis virtually begged to be co-opted into the White House's anti-drug campaign but seemed just as keen to souvenir another police badge of which he was an avid collector. The supreme irony, noted by Baum, is that the \\"King\\", a legendary dopehound, was a credentialed Special Assistant in the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs when he died in 1977 of what was essentially a drug overdose.By the mid-1970s when Jimmy Carter was elected President, drugs had all but disappeared from the political radar. A more enlightened drug policy was adopted even if it was orchestrated by politically naive advisers. A Presidential Commission on Marijuana, stacked with conservatives, made the embarrassing recommendation in 1970 that marijuana be decriminalised, a step which Nixon refused to consider. In fact, he blamed the Jews for wanting to liberalise America's drug laws.However, the War on Drugs was resurrected with a vengeance when Ronald Reagan took office in 1982. Within a short space of time there were savage cuts to drug prevention and treatment, and a boost to \\"hard\\" drug enforcement bodies, eg. the Coast Guard, FBI and the increasingly powerful Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). More significantly, draconian mandatory minimum sentencing laws were passed leading to a doubling of the prison population during the Reagan years. The ideological shift saw the leadership of drug policy taken away from doctors and scientists, and passed to untrained, inexperienced and emotionally motivated parents. As a consequence, the drug war was sharply directed at teenagers and those who allegedly fostered their habits such as makers of drug paraphernalia. It was hardly surprising then, that a full 83% of Americans surveyed in 1986 believed it was proper to \\"dob-in\\" to the police family members who consumed drugs. One teenage girl in California who did so, soon afterwards found herself placed in foster care as a ward of the state while her parents faced 3 years in gaol.The arrival of cocaine then its derivative, crack into the drug mainstream in the 1980s - both largely media beat-ups according to Baum - fueled wild speculation. By then, anti-drug rhetoric was reaching fever-pitch as evidenced by bizarre and hysterical pronouncements from those in the forefront of the drug debate. One prominent Congressman wanted to exile drug offenders to remote Pacific islands. William Bennett, Reagan's top drug czar and himself a chain-smoker, suggested beheading drug dealers while one of his high-ranking colleagues ventured the opinion that \\"homosexuality seems to be something that follows from marijuana use\\". Former LAPD chief, Darryl Gates, proclaimed that \\"casual drug users should be taken out and shot ...\\". Even Nancy Reagan, who framed the naive slogan of \\"Just Say No\\" to drugs, weighed in to the debate on recreational drug use. Brimming with indignation, she declared that the casual drug user is an \\"accomplice to murder\\".Meanwhile, those dissenting voices critical of the War on Drugs often remained one step ahead of drug enforcement authorities. Baum recounts several amusing instances of citizens who turned the tables on officious bureaucrats and ridiculed the po-faced anti-drug zealots. For example, when urine-testing became widespread in American workplaces, wily entrepreneurs started selling pre-bottled, drug-free urine through mail-order catalogues. A drug legalisation advocate embarrassed the McDonald's hamburger chain by pointing out that its plastic coffee stirrers were being used as cocaine spoons. McDonald's promptly recalled the offending items amidst great embarrassment. And when drug-sniffing dogs at airports were nabbing traveller's with large cash deposits, procedures had to be re-evaluated when it was discovered that minute traces of cocaine are present on up to 96% of all US currency bills.In the concluding stages of Baum's account of the unwinnable War on Drugs, he points to the growing chorus of law enforcement agents, public health experts, judges, academics, influential newspaper editors and a few brave politicians who have begun to question the cost-effectiveness of prohibition and unswerving commitment to zero tolerance of drug use. Although he doesn't flag any alternatives to these failed policies, Baum makes it clear that the longstanding taboo of discussing any policy other than total prohibition, needs to be lifted.Baum ends his highly readable and entertaining book with a telling quote from (non-inhaler) President Bill Clinton who stated in 1992 that, \\"The definition of insanity is doing the same old thing over and over again and expecting a different result\\". All politicians, please take note."},{"Title":"Smoke and Mirrors: The War on Drugs and the Politics of Failure","review":"This is one of the best books written on a subject that too many Americans are not adequately aware of. I just finished it over Christmas and I couldn't put it down. This is a book about hysteria and social manipulation. About greed, extraordinary deceit, and lust for power and control. The Drug War is of the same evil thatbrought the world the Nazis and other murderous, intolerant regimes. The same propaganda techniques are utilized. &quot;There must be one public opinion for all.&quot; said Hitler's propaganda chief,Dr. Joseph Goebbels. Indeed. For those who feel that honest discussion and debate is missing on exactly what the drug war is accomplishing and where it's heading---this book will provide a lot of answers. It is extremely hard hitting and right on the mark. An excellent piece of work that will upset and amaze you, illuminate you and hopefully move you to demand a more sane, rational, and honest policy on drugs."},{"Title":"Smoke and Mirrors: The War on Drugs and the Politics of Failure","review":"Anyone who has been touched by the drug war -- and this really includes all of us -- should give this book a chance.

Very helpful to read index of character to keep track of whose who."},{"Title":"Smoke and Mirrors: The War on Drugs and the Politics of Failure","review":"This book should be required reading for anyone interested in the current mess that is our criminal justice system. It is insightful, scathing, tragic, and always entertaining.Don't believe the review on this page that claims the book is a hatchet job on the Republicans-- Dems and the &quot;liberal&quot; press don't get off easy here either. The author clearly is no fan of Bill Bennet, but his thesis is not an attack on conservatism. If you're a conservative and don't care for unchecked government spending, the transfer of state powers to the federal government, or government seizure of private property, I urge you to read this book and draw your own conclusions."},{"Title":"Smoke and Mirrors: The War on Drugs and the Politics of Failure","review":"Not often does a book manage to be thoroughly depressing, and irresistibly gripping at the same time. Dan Baum pulls it off with style here.In the face of Baum's soberly marshaled evidence the core thesis of the book becomes indisputable: the never-ending War on Drugs is a political ploy both parties are wedded to because fear gets votes, and makes a marvelous rationale for bigger bureaucracies, more government spending and deeper intrusion into the lives of the usual suspects.Baum shows that nobody running this \\"war\\" could imagine drugs will disappear from American life, but pretending to hold off hordes of pop-eyed, drooling perverts has morphed from a good scare tactic for the Silent Majority to an absolute requirement for anybody who aspires to elective office.He debunks claims that outlawing marijuana keeps kids away from heroin and cocaine so thoroughly you can't escape sharing his conclusion: marijuana's illegal because there are a lot of voters who'd like to outlaw being weird, lazy or unkempt; because catching pot growers, dealers and smokers creates a lot of jobs; and (he doesn't say outright, but you can't help figuring) because legalizing marijuana would be the thin end of the wedge that might take all the profit out of the cocaine and heroin industries.What I found much more disturbing than the cynical futility of our drug laws--which hasn't really been news for decades--was the catalog of Constitutional rights we've lost to make things easier for the lawmen.By the end of this book, it's hard to resist the conclusion that the '60s not only failed to revolutionize American politics, but provoked a current of revulsion against the supposed abuse of Constitutional protections--especially the Fourth Amendment--that has segued seamlessly into the Patriot Act and Guantanamo. Anybody for a police state?"},{"Title":"Smoke and Mirrors: The War on Drugs and the Politics of Failure","review":"First some things to mention about the focus of this book:1. Baum spends more time talking about how the relationship between state, federal and local governments was modified in the pursuit of drug prohibition. Less time is spent talking about the stretching of tax laws to fit around drug charges.2. There is no discussion of the way that similar drug prohibition laws in Latin America have caused several governments to nearly collapse. (Similar books, like Gray's \\"Drug Crazy\\" actually did just that and his whole book was 120 pages shorter than this book.)3. The book covers a period of about 20 years, and it does so exhaustively. On the one hand, I thought that that made the book drag on endlessly. But on the other hand, if one really wanted to get an idea of the political controversies of moment at various times, then this book does that very well. Even if reading a blow-by-blow of the political currents of some time was not all that interesting, at least someone got around to documenting them all. The sheer mass of the number of references cited and interviews given by the author demonstrate a yeoman's work.Good points of the book:1. This book can be read in many ways. One way is as a case study of how governments can engineer mass hysteria in order to find issues on which elected officials can ride to re-election. Another reading might be as a discussion of public policy (there was a decent amount of data here about how many people were killed owing to drug use, though the author stopped short of a cost-benefit analysis). Lastly, the book could be an example of mass hysteria (something like the Dutch Tulip craze). One gets the impression that even though drug policy worked out the way that it did, there is no reason that it could not have worked out differently.2. The author was very even-handed. Since the period of time that was under analysis covered several presidencies, the issue was portrayed neither as specifically a Republican issue nor a Democratic one. In fact, the author said at the very beginning of the book that Prohibition could mean very different things to people of very different political persuasions.3. The book also hinted at the practical problems of choosing policymakers. He gave several very germane examples of the very wrong people making decisions about medical issues (i.e., people who were not trained as physicians).4. There was a good bit of documentation of people turning the issue into a religious crusade, but no extended discussion of the reasons thereof.5. I really enjoyed the index, documentation, organization and dramatis peronae.Bad points:1. Boring, long winded.The book can be read out of order without much loss (after all, there are so many names and dates that it is impossible to remember them all).Overall, this book was worth the secondhand purchase price."},{"Title":"Smoke and Mirrors: The War on Drugs and the Politics of Failure","review":"The book came in record time, and was exactly as described.

I loved it.... it was unbiased and covered all the facts."},{"Title":"Smoke and Mirrors: The War on Drugs and the Politics of Failure","review":"Giving in to his worst impulses, Dan Baum has written a book that could set back the effort to bring some measure of rationality to this nation's drug problem by at least thirty years. His choice of a &quot;dramatic&quot;, novelistic approach to the subject demands that he fill the stage with good and evil characters which he does in a very heavy-handed way, choosing to start the story with what is now a political &quot;stock character&quot;, the evil Richard Nixon, essentially creating the war against drugs out of whole cloth for political gain. How convenient. No need to address the excesses of LBJ and his great society programs (war and a big enough give away to buy some measure of support from the domestic groups who bore such a disproportionate share of the load &quot;on the ground&quot;). No need to assess the impact the lunatic Ramsey Clark had on the common sense of justice, decency and fair play. Just trot out Nixon, a Satan ex machina , and the whole thing is clear (at least to someone who wasn't an adult at the time) Baum then peoples his stage with a long line of characters, all conservative and best described as evil, or blundering or both to carry the sad story forward. Notable by their absence are the democratic congresses that enthusiastically supported every bad idea put forward and even pushed for more extreme measures. Missing too is the public, whose fears, ignorance and misapprehensions are the real &quot;villains&quot; for anyone who needs to see villany in order to pay attention to this problem. The overall impact of Baum's approach is to turn the reader away from the few nuggets of solid analysis contained in the book (a beautiful debunking of the notion that marijuana is a &quot;gateway&quot; drug, for example). Too bad, as is clear to me that Baum is capable of writing something that could make a difference"},{"Title":"Smoke and Mirrors: The War on Drugs and the Politics of Failure","review":"This book will not change one person's mind. Sticking to anecdotes, eschewing statistics and analysis, Baum strives to create an atmosphere of sinister conspiracy. But the simple fact that political spinmasters were involved in creating and selling the drug prohibition policy does not hopelessly discredit it. After all, politicians had to sell the Civil Rights Act, the New Deal, involvement in WWII, emancipation of the slaves, and everything else the government's ever done.Like most people who'd be motivated to seek out a book on the War on Drugs, I am sympathetic to Baum's general idea-- the War on Drugs goes too far, and a little treatment would sure go nice with, or maybe even in place of, locking up tons of people, many of whom are black. But to those of you looking for a balanced, informative overview of the history of the drug war, keep moving. This ain't it."},{"Title":"Smoke and Mirrors: The War on Drugs and the Politics of Failure","review":"Smoke and Mirrors is replete with anecdotal blurbs about the war on drugs which Dan Baum frequently uses as bases to make many sweeping assertions about the drug war that simply aren't true. For example, in chapter 12 Dan Baum discusses a 1982 Supreme Court ruling in Illinois vs. Gates which upheld the validity of a search warrant wherein the probable cause to obtain the search warrant was based in part on information contained in a letter from an anonyomous source. Dan Baum grossly exaggerates the implications of this ruling and wildy asserts that &quot;...nothing now prevents people from inflicting a legal police search on their unwitting enemies simply by calling in a phony tip to the authorities.&quot; (Page 184) Nothing could be further from the truth. The police still need to corroborate information from sources before obtaining search warrants. Dan Baum's hyperbolic style of writing could leave uninformed readers with the impression that the drug war has destroyed the Bill of Rights. Drug dealers don't have a civil right to sell illicit drugs. When drug dealers are caught and succesfully prosecuted, they deserve lengthy prison sentences so that my civil right to be free from the crime they spread can be realized."},{"Title":"The Bloody Crucible of Courage: Fighting Methods and Combat Experience of the Civil War","review":"I agree with the reviews written by Epops, Billmilwee, and John Howard and won't belabor the points made by those reviewers. I will just say that, as a long-time student of the Civil War and someone with some knowledge of weaponry and things tactical, I found this long-winded work marginally worth the read and price. One annoying thing not noted by others is the number of typos and sentences with grammatical errors (paperback, Carroll & Graf Publishers). So, not only did the author not engage the services of a good editor, he and the publisher didn't even hire a proofreader. This is not the hallmark of scholarly work.I gave the work two stars only because it does contain some interesting and useful information, albeit buried in superflous material and verbiage. I think I'll keep it but doubt I'll make much reference to it. I hope someone else steps up to the plate and authors the volume this should have been.In short, if you are at least somewhat knowledgeable as to Civil War weaponry and tactics you should save your money and shelf space; its a mud march of a read with little to be gained."},{"Title":"The Bloody Crucible of Courage: Fighting Methods and Combat Experience of the Civil War","review":"Most Civil War historians devote themselves entirely to the late unpleasantness and completely lack a larger tactical context for the war. As a result, most works parrot the same tired old ideas - \\"Napoleonic tactics used beyond their time\\" and \\"the first modern war\\". Brent Nosworthy has studied tactics of the entire gunpowder era, producing unmatched works on the18th Century and the Napoleonic era showing the complex inter-relations of combat arms and highlighting the importance of the psychology and motivation of individual soldiers. Now, he has given the same sort of treatment to the Civil War. He discusses the European developments in weapons and tactics in the first half of 19th Century. He shows the underappreciated increased lethality of the new combination gun-howitzers with longer range and exploding shells. Discussing the debate on infantry tactics, he shows not only the increased accuracy of rifled muskets - but also the less well publicized negative effects of their slower muzzle velocity - in addition to the constants constraints of battle, fear and smoke. He shows that some visionaries in Europe foresaw - too early - the effects of new infantry weapons, but he also shows that skeptics, particularly in Britain, did exist. He shows that \\"Napoleonic tactics\\", when written by participants in the Civil War, actually meant tactics developed by Napoleon III, an innovator in artillery technology and infantry tactics, including the use of a gymnastic pace to minimize time under enemy fire. In discussing cavalry, Nosworthy shows that cavalry attacks in the 1859 Italian War had been disrupted by long range artillery fire the likes of which had not possible in Napoleon's time. Nevertheless, he shows that cavalry could and did successfully attack infantry during the Civil War. By 1864, however, when cavalry had the training and experience to do so, there were earthworks and other factors preventing it. In his excellent chapter on grand tactics, Nosworthy shows that imitation of Jomini's reactionary line-heavy formations made Civil War combat less decisive than Napoleonic combat, in which columns allowed greater maneuverability and co-operation with cavalry. Despite some flaws (see other reviews), overall this is the best book on Civil War tactics yet written, and will make you think of Civil War combat in a whole new way."},{"Title":"The Bloody Crucible of Courage: Fighting Methods and Combat Experience of the Civil War","review":"The author's mastery of the subject is unquestionable, and his research is beyond reproach. Nevertheless, the book is plagued by poor organization and repetition. Nosworthy tried to organize by topic, chronology and theater of operations, but the result is a meandering mess that does touch and go landings on the same territory again and again and again; e.g the recurring discussion of the effectiveness of rifle muskets. Consolidation of topics would have made more sense. Spelling errors are numerous, and there are no signs that any editorial work was done on the manuscript. None at all. The book could easily be a third shorter without deleting a single fact. The lightest of editorial hands could have shaped up the author's shortfalls in style. Much more work would have been needed to compell him to develop his ideas in a systematic manner and ensure that his supports really added up to his conclusions, much less arrived there in a timely manner. Its hard to believe that anybody looked at the final chapter before the book got shoved out the door. It might be reworked to connect with the rest of the book, but, as published, it is almost incomprehensible and a bonafide embarrassment to the publisher. The author's fatigue - to the point of mental fog - rises almost palpably from the last ten pages. Much of the conclusion is really a misplaced forward rather than a summation. The long slog to that conclusion is unecessarily delayed by masses of tangential information, such as European tactics during the 1860 and 1870s, that ought to have been relegated to appendices. Even an historical work has to consider pacing, at least in the last third. It's a shame to see what is clearly a first draft rushed to publication. That said, I would put down money for a revised edition purely for the information content, which is first rate."},{"Title":"The Bloody Crucible of Courage: Fighting Methods and Combat Experience of the Civil War","review":"This is actually the first review that I've ever written on Amazon, but I felt compelled to share my reading experience regarding \\"The Bloody Crucible Of Courage\\". Anyone at all interested in the tactical aspect of mid-19th century warfare (note that I didn't specify simply \\"American Civil War\\") simply needs to read this book. I've been a fan of Mr. Nosworthy's work for a while, ever since I stumbled across his treatment of Napoleonic tactics in \\"With Cannon, Musket and Sword\\" and I credit him with turning me on to the work of some of the new, statistically-based military historians like Paddy Griffin and Joseph Bilby, who also delve deeper into the reality of 19th century warfare. What makes this book so interesting is that through the author's extensive research, he does not fall into the trap that many Civil War authors do by treating America's conflict of the early 1860's as the be-all, end-all of military thought and technology of the second half of that century. Being an antique firearms buff, I've often wrestled with some of the questions that Mr. Nosworthy so ably answers. After a day at the range with my P-53 Enfield, I couldn't help but wonder why everyone in a Civil War battle wasn't killed within two minutes of contact. I also couldn't believe anyone would be \\"stupid\\" enough to order a bayonet charge against a line of similarly armed men. Was the Civil War the first \\"modern\\" war, a precursor to the Western Front? Or was it a Napoleonic anachronism fought by tactically incompetent officers leading technically incompetent troops? In my mind, Mr. Nosworthy adequately addresses these questions and the answer I extracted was simply \\"it depends\\". What year? What theatre? What side? What arm of service? The evolution of both armies, as well as the tactics and weapons used is explained in an engrossing and non-American-centric manner that captures the state of military affairs as seen through the eyes of French, British, Prussian, Union and Confederate officers. One of my favorite parts was the epilogue, where the author addresses something that I've felt for a long time, namely the tendency for \\"moderns\\" to judge their predecessors in an arrogant light and to superimpose current values on men who wrestled with their own problems in their own way in their own time and arrived at effective solutions for very real reasons. No, the bayonet wasn't a useless appendage. No, the saber wasn't for show. Yes, the effects of the rifle-musket were, on average, more telling than its smoothbore predecessor, but tactics had already been developed (in the 1850's) to deal with it and many officers were well aware of what could be expected of these new weapons and what could not be expected of their men. In summary, this book is a tour de-force and my only hope is that the author , with some future writing, can bring us through the end of the 19th century, and maybe up to WWI, as he so effectively has with the 18th Century (\\"Anatomy Of Victory\\"), Napoleonic Wars (\\"With Cannon, Musket and Sword\\") and now this book."},{"Title":"The Bloody Crucible of Courage: Fighting Methods and Combat Experience of the Civil War","review":"Nosworthy studies Civil War tactics and weaponry, particularly in their connection with earlier European practice and in their theoretical development.This study has some interesting points to make, particularly that under some circumstances attacks, including sabre charges, were highly successful -- an argument that goes against the oversimplified idea that Civil War defenders always got the upper hand. Nosworthy seems to emphasize Union sources, especially in his discussion of cavalry attacks which cites no Confederate successes at all, but uses some Confederate accounts as well throughout the text. At times he seems a bit trusting of single primary sources, particularly memoirs, but overall the use of sources and the arguments are convincing. Another intriguing discussion centers on the massive amount of lead that had to be fired to cause a casualty, and the reasons why that was the case.The book does rather little to address soldier mentalities and the physical experience of battle -- some material is discussed but not as much as expected. I was also disappointed with its lack of discussion of any intelligence-gathering activity -- particularly when analyzing the cavalry, it seems strange to leave out scouting and the screening of army movements, as well as raiding. Perhaps Nosworthy felt these activities were beyond his battlefield-centered scope.Overall, this was a useful and pleasantly un-positivist study. It might have benefited from clearer organization and maybe some editing of its considerable length."},{"Title":"The Bloody Crucible of Courage: Fighting Methods and Combat Experience of the Civil War","review":"This is the only book I have found that gets into the details of why Civil War battles were fought the way they were. I always thought it seemed ridiculous that two armies would march in a line and just maul each other, but this book explains the logic and evolution of these tactics. Also, other Civil War books frustrated me because they just assume you know all the little details about small arms, artillery, and field works. This book just doesn't tell you about what they are, but how they were developed over time.Unfortunately, I have to agree with another reviewer--the book is very dry because Nosworthy seems to repeat the same information over and over again. For example, he explains the Civil War rifled musket shortcoming of low muzzle velocity over and over again in the book, as if we had not read the previous chapters. It is a shame it so dry, because I think more books like this are needed."},{"Title":"The Bloody Crucible of Courage: Fighting Methods and Combat Experience of the Civil War","review":"Brent Nosworthy has written a long overdue presentation of what many studentsof the Civil War have been trying to do in their own minds is:How and Why didthe military operations happen the way they did.Much has been written on theMen who fought the War but here we can better see what they had to work withand how theory turned into practice.I think this book will be one of the mostimportant studies ever written on Civil War Combat."},{"Title":"The Bloody Crucible of Courage: Fighting Methods and Combat Experience of the Civil War","review":"As the title of this review says, I thought the book was generally pretty informative. The author certainly used some primary source material from obscure encounters in several different theaters of operations to bring home to the reader information not generally read by, I would hazard, even most avid Civil War buffs. I think the review that \\"Epops\\" wrote on February 12, 2006, sums up this work as well as any that I read on this forum.If I had to add a comment though, I would say Nosworthy's incorporation of more obscure engagements adds quite a bit to his thesis by demonstrating the trends in Civil War combat down to even the least significant of encounters. However, unless one is well read in the very battle studies that Nosworthy cites in the conclusion as being fine additions to the academic body of research concerning his topic of battle tactics in the Civil War, I think there is much more he could have added to his narrative, from the more well-known battles alone, that could have gone a long way to bolstering his thesis for not only the avid historian but also the novice."},{"Title":"The Bloody Crucible of Courage: Fighting Methods and Combat Experience of the Civil War","review":"I purchased this book for use in teaching a college level class on the Common Soldier.

Americans relish this conflict as a national rite of passage, yet seldom has a war been so venerated, with so little known about how it was actually fought. There have been countless books on this subject, yet few provide any solid picture as to how troops actually fought, with what methods, and how their weapons performed in the bloody crucible of combat.This is a book that the study of the Civil War has long awaited. Yet, its acceptence may be hard for many devotees to accept. The American Civil War has cherished many myths and ideas, which, when taken out of their isolaoted context and compared with other conflicts of the time may seem less significant. This will be hard for many Civil War fans to swallow at first, but if they are to emerge with a greater understanding of this conflict, they must allow their beloved topic to be studied out of its box. This is something which the subject has long demanded, and which many the so-called experts in the field have been unable to do. Here Mr. Nosworthy has carefully studied the Civil War in comparison with contemporary wars of the day to provide a comparative analysis. We learn how the military studies of Jomini actually distorted how Americans perceived true Napoleanic tactics. Jomini was a conservetive French military writer who drew upon aspects of Napoleanic tactics to support his own views. The results across the Atlantic in America was a bizarre hybrid of columnar and linear tactics which would make the Civil War so difficult to compare to other conflicts. In fact if we look at the grand tactical elements of many of the Civil War battles we might be surprised to learn how un-Napoleanic they actually were. Jomini was more an advocate of 18th century linear warfare, where control of the entire line of battle was essential. This satisfied his conservetive ideas well, while to appear modern he threw in a few columns of the Napoleanic Wars just for good measure! we tend to look on civil war battles as more or less linear engagements, or heavy skirmish lines where prolonged firefights dragged on for hours. Nosworthy shows us that columns were indeed used, though not the flexible smaller ones of the Napoleanic period. Civil war troops were frequently deployed into columns of regimental width, arrayed along successive lines. Many battles saw this employment, yet this is something which has gone over the heads of most Civil War historians. American officers, following more or less the Jomini principles, added their own variations by tending to deploy early in most engagements. Civil War troops might march into battle in column, but they were generally formed into line. Still, these tactical distinctions so long ignored by many, are brought to the fore here for the first time.Nosworthy is also careful to interlace primary accounts within his text to provide first hand accounts of how formations were used. This goes to show that such information was always there, but was never examined in this light before. Many contemporary journals are also used to show how current debates of the time discussed the issues at hand. These have long been ignored by most historians of the conflict. Instead, most secondary works have concentrated on troop movements, commanders decisions, and some general descriptions of how bloody some of the battles were. Our fuller understanding of how grand tactics played themselves out on the battlefiled have been largely ignored by these historians. Nosworthy further explains that in order to understand the nature of Civil War combat we must see how military matters stood abroad. This is something most have been unwiulling or unable to do. We learn for example how many American historians have wrongly attributed Napoleanic tactics to Napolean I, instead of to his grandson Napolean III who was a contemporary of the Civil War. References to Napoleanic tactics at the time were intended to mean this, but over the years Americans became confused over which Napolean was actually concerned! This subtle, but vitally important difference has been lost on generations of Civil War historians. We must remember that French military doctrine and style were vital until the eclispe of the Second Empire by the Prussians in 1870. The wars of Napolean III in Moracco, Italy and the Crimea had profound influences on American military thought. This has largely been forgotten in most studies today. In their desire to make the Civil War a purely \\"American\\" expereince, many American historians simpy overlooked these important facts. They have continued to do so today.Nosworthy attempts to break the Civil War down into various parts so that we can see the variations that existed. He creates for us an anatomy of Civil War combat. This has not been done before to this extent here. We learn how combat differed in the Eastern and Western threaters of the war, we also see developments in ironclad technology, artillery, cavalry and infantry. We even see how ilregulars like Forest and Moseby conducted their hit and run battles. All of these aspects are discussed clearly, in one single volume, without bias, and without the legends and lore of the Civil War distorting matters. This book also dispels many myths about combat in the Civil War. Infantry firefights generally took place at much shorter ranges than we have been lead to believe. We learn that rifled muskets might not have been the sole reason for increased casaulty rates. Most Americans, unlike their European counterparts, were more familar with firearms because of the frontier style of life many had adopted in the Southern and Western parts of the country. In combat this translated into more accurate fire whether with rifled or smoothbore muskets. The stresses of combat often profoundly influenced how weapons performed as oppsed to the testing ground. Few studies have taken this into account. The bayonet, so often lauded as the decisive weapon of the war, was in fact more a pyschological threat than a physical one. There is a big difference between a bayonet fight and a bayonet charge. Many Civil War memoirs often don't make the difference. The former was very rare, while the latter more commonplace and almost never resulted in actual combat between opposing troops in open ground. Such careful reading into these accounts enables us to perceive details that were never considered before.The final summation shows us that Europeans did not discount the Civil War, but simply saw it as one of many conflcits of the period. Many of the so-called firsts of the war which American historians are so proud to point out had in fact taken place already in earlier conflicts. The use of Ironclad technology, rifled muskets, railroads, etc had already occured by the time of the Civil War. The subsequent development of Prussian tactics employing skirmish lines supported by small mobile columns would revolutionize future tactics and provided a tactical flexibility that was unknown on the Civil War battlefield.The final conclusion of this book is that the American Civil War needs to be studied outside of its own little box if it is to have any significant place in the evolution of warfare. Some readers may find this hard to swallow, but it is so. This book should take its place along side the lenghty tomes of Mcpherson, Sears, Foote et al. By reading this book you will get a better understanding of the Civil war than has yet been provided to date on the nuts and bolts of the conflict. Highly recommended for serious Civil War buffs, re-enactors, wargamers, and all who want to get a better understanding of how the Civil War was really fought."},{"Title":"The Bloody Crucible of Courage: Fighting Methods and Combat Experience of the Civil War","review":"Brent Nosworthy describes himself as an \\"independent\\" author. He is also a Civil War re-enacter. In writing this book he has made an original and informative contribution to the historical analysis of the American Civil War.Nosworthy covers a wide range of subjects, many of which I hadn't previously understood, such as why some units in the early days of the war called themselves \\"Zouaves\\" and wore funny red uniforms. It seems that the uniforms, the training, and the tactics of Zouave units were patterned after the special units developed by the French for fighting their wars in Algeria. The uniforms were quickly discarded when it became clear that they made excellent targets in the open fields and woods of Northern Virginia, but Zouave training and tactics continued to influence American military thinking throughout the war, and continue to do so to some extent even today.He explains the origin of the term \\"Napoleon\\" for the bronze 12 pounder field artillery piece favored by both sides. It was named after Napoleon III, not Bonaparte. He explains how the ballistic pattern of the Minie ball influenced battlefield tactics, why generals on both sides were reluctant to use field fortifications until the very end of the war, and the rationale for using wool uniforms winter and summer.Interesting as such details are to students of the Civil War, Nosworthy's use of first-person accounts to illustrate his points is the most effective aspect of the book. Nosworthy's re-enacter experience serves him well in these sections. He is able to convey the actual experience of the soldier on the battlefield with terrifying effect. One marvels at the willingness and ability of men to undergo the experience of Civil War battle just once, let alone repeatedly, as the veterens did.He places the Civil War in the context of European military thinking of the time. It is significant that the Crimean War and Napoleon III's invasion of Italy occurred just before the Civil War, since Napoleon's Zouaves made their reputation as \\"shock troops\\" in those wars, particularly at the battle of Solferino. French military science was of the highest prestige in that period, and French military manuals were translated and used at West Point. The French debacle in 1870 changed all that, of course. The outlines of this evolution are well-known, but Nosworthy relates these general developments to the specifics of weapons and tactics in a highly illuminating manner.In spite of the many good, even great, things about this book, it has several serious flaws.Nosworthy has insufficient control of his material. He often loses focus and becomes repetitious. There is a lack of discipline and logic in the book's organization. He is argumentative at times, assuming the unbecoming role of \\"debunker\\". He is especially obnoxious in the final chapter, which is a rant against his fellow military historians, as though he is in some kind of competition with them, rather than in a cooperative search for the truth.He goes to great lengths to prove his thesis that Civil War battlefield tactics weren't much different from those of the smooth-bore period, but he does not succeed. Why, if that were the case, were the frontal assaults of Pickett's Charge, Kenesaw Mountain, Cold Harbor, and many others, such disasters? He says himself that as the war progressed, troops on both sides tended more and more to entrench their positions almost immediately at the start of a battle. Why was this, if not because of the increased lethality of the rifled musket and Minie ball at long range? Is there any doubt that had the Americans at Bunker Hill been armed with rifled muskets the British regular troops wouldn't have been able to form up their lines to begin with, let alone to eventually throw the colonials out of their trenches?His prose rivals that of the best when describing the experiences of men in battle, but when expressing his personal opinions his language becomes pompous and verbose, as though he had read one too many 19th century memoir. The unevenness of his writing is the most noticeable symptom of his lack of professional training. A good editor could have helped him with this.He tries to create a new term, the \\"rifle musket\\", using it repeatedly. George R. Stewart, Bruce Catton, and William McNeill were content with \\"rifled musket\\", in which \\"rifle\\" assumes the adjectival form with the \\"-ed\\" ending. Nosworthy himself writes of \\"rifled artillery\\", so why create a compound noun \\"rifle musket\\"? It's an unnecessary distraction.He seems to think \\"nonplussed\\" means \\"unperturbed\\" or \\"stalwart\\", rather \\"perplexity\\", its true meaning. Again, a good editor could have saved him from this embarrassment.Any Civil War \\"buff\\" will find this book, in spite of its flaws, well worth reading. It's a good book. A good editor could have helped make it a great book."},{"Title":"The Bloody Crucible of Courage: Fighting Methods and Combat Experience of the Civil War","review":"I will start out by admitting a personal interest in Brent Nosworthy's \\"The Bloody Crucible of Courage: Fighting Methods and Combat Experience of the Civil War\\". For several years I have aided Mr. Nosworthy in researching this book and by reading various drafts as it evolved. He delved deep into standard material such as personal memoirs and the Official Record's (CD-ROM searches in those 100,000-plus pages proved of immense value in the course of the research, allowing for a completeness of inquiry simply not possible before), and also into seldom-used sources such as \\"Scientific American\\" and the Fall River, Massachusetts, \\"Manufacturer and Farmer's Journal\\" for a mid-Ninteenth Century perspective as he examined weapons technology and tactical theory, implementation, and evolution.It is no wonder that Joseph Bilby says: \\"This is a landmark work that establishes a new standard of excellence. No future Civil War campaign or battle study will be written without extensive reference to The Bloody Crucible of Courage.\\" Gordon Rhea states it \\"deserves an honored place on the shelf of every Civil War scholar and buff.\\" And Paddy Griffith writes;\\" The Bloody Crucible of Courage\\" is indeed the book we have long been waiting for! It is essential reading, not least for the wider European perspective that it casts upon a war that has too often in the past been viewed through very parochial spectacles. And beyond that refreshing historiographical perspective, this work also offers us a truly magnificent quarry of facts, explanations and pertinent interpretations that every student of the Civil War will surely want to keep constantly at hand.\\" Often I take such dust jacket blurbs with a grain of salt, but this is one case where I will gladly support the opinions expressed.This is not a dry, encyclopedic recounting of weapons specifications or tactical minutiae of how the third sergeant should move when a company changes from line of battle to a column of fours by the left flank. Rather, it is a highly readable work that ranges far and wide across infantry, artillery, cavalry and even naval forces, exploring how combat was really conducted and how that came about, looking at the roots of the weapons and tactical systems in Europe as well as in the US, and following the lengthy and often heated debates that were waged during the 1850's and well into the war over these matters. These discussions are illuminated by numerous battlefield examples of the use of these weapons and tactics, vividly described. Probably no such debate was more crucial than that over the best shoulder weapon to be issued to infantry: rifled versus smoothbore, muzzleloading versus breechloading. And contrary to modern assumptions, the choice was not at the time altogether straightforward and obvious, even given the experience of recent European wars. One of the intriguing elements that arises from Nosworthy's analysis of these matters is that he tentatively concludes that, for reasons still not entirely understood, in general American troops appeared to achieve better results (i.e., inflicted higher numbers of losses) than their European counterparts, whether using smoothbores or rifle-muskets.This book has been a long time coming. The very first time I contacted Brent Nosworthy, whose name I knew from his excellent book on Napoleonic warfare, was to ask him whether some day he might write a similar one on American Civil War tactics. Little did I know where this simple question would eventually lead. \\"The Bloody Crucible of Courage\\" is a book I am proud to have helped in any fashion to come into being. There has never been a comparable work published about the Civil War, and I am confident that it will do much to shape our future perceptions and study of that conflict. It gets my highest recommendation."},{"Title":"The Bloody Crucible of Courage: Fighting Methods and Combat Experience of the Civil War","review":"In writing the &quot;Bloody Crucible of Courage&quot; Mr. Nosworty undertook a comprehensive study of interrelated subjects that are not well represented in the plethora of literature on the War. While presenting a large amount of carefully-researched and well-documented information, the author has not written a good book.Content is of major importance in any book, but presentation, balance, accuracy and many other factors affect the quality and value of the work. It is in these supporting factors that &quot;The Bloody Crucible...&quot; falls short.The subtitle of the book &quot;Fighting Methods and Combat Experience in the Civil War&quot; is inaccurate. It would have been far more accurate to to have subtitled it &quot;Fighting Methods and Combat Experiences of the Union Army in the Civil War&quot; for the text is so heavily weighted toward the Union Army that the reader is left wondering if there were significant differences in the Confederate approach or if the conditions under which the Confedrates fought or cultural differences led to other methods. There is little comparison or contrast between the two armies or between the Eastern and Western theaters. This reader felt short-changed. A notable example is the short shrift given to the Confederate cavalry of the early war years. There appears to be a bias toward the Union that is not appropriate with the historical perspective we now have.The bias is reflected in the anecdotal material which is so filled with accounts of stunning Union victories and routs of Confederates that a reader could be hard-pressed to understand how the war lasted four years. Perhaps his personal military experience influences the author to take regimental histories and first hand accounts at face value. To put this type of material in perspective I suggest he at least reread &quot;Battles and Leaders...&quot; and consider the self-serving nature of much of the material therein.In the Introduction the author criticizes Ian Drury and Tony Gibbons for not using anecdotal material in their excellent &quot;The Civil War Machine&quot;. In the &quot;Crucible...&quot; he gives a vivid demonstration of the hazards of doing so by presenting the reader with:(1) Large--in my opinion excessive--amounts of anecdotal material (2) Anecdotes too lengthy for the minor points they make, and (3) Anecdotes not sharply focused on the point.The overall impression is that the anecdotes are being used as filler. In fact there is so much material that is not clearly related to the theme of the book that it appears the contract called for 650 pages and that's what they were going to get.The penultimate chapter &quot;Tactical Development in European Warfare 1859-71&quot; and the final chapter &quot;Conclusions&quot; which is primarily devoted to &quot;The Impact of Systematic Biases on Military History&quot; and &quot;What Must be Done' exemplify material that is far away from the theme of the book.A great part of the value and utility of a book like &quot;The Bloody Crucible...&quot; lies in careful editing to focus the book on its subject and to repair or remove those sentences and paprgraphs that don't work. This book would have benefitted greatly from one more time through. I often found myself rereading turgid or confusing material to get the sense of it. I was not always successful.Equally important is the attention to such things as foot- or endnoting and indexing. The endnote system in this book uses no numbering system and thus no number on the page where the note applies. It is obviously cheaper to produce the book with this system, but this system is hard to use and does not lend itself to additional expository or anecdotal material that breaks the flow of the text. It is not a system worthy of serious historical writing. The index contains errors--a serious fault and one that can easily be corrected by attention to detail. Index errors seriously degrade the books use as a reference. The overall impression is that rushing the book into production was more important than producing a book of high quality and utilityThis book will gather dust, unlikely to be reread or frequently referred to."},{"Title":"The Bloody Crucible of Courage: Fighting Methods and Combat Experience of the Civil War","review":"This volume is like the Powder River-an inch deep and a mile wide. While the author has evidently done a large amount of research from a very impressive bibliography, the text, and many of the conclusions, don't match the effort that was quite obviously put into this book.There is a lot of good information in this volume, but it appears to this reviewer that the author was attempting to be all things to all readers and enthusiasts. That, coupled with some glaring errors and critical information left out leaves the book crippled.The artillery section, for example, is very poorly done. Information in the section(s), such as ammunition, the reference to French artillery practices in the Napoleonic period, tactics, and the problem with identifying Henry Jackson Hunt (who would become the artillery chief of the Army of the Potomac) giving him three separate entries in the Index, all contribute to the impression that the research done here was superficial at best.Further, while the excellent Artillerist's Manual by John Gibbon is referenced, the equally excellent, and necessary, Ordnance and Gunnery by Benton and Field Artillery Tactics 1864 have not. Other excellent artillery references, such as The Guns at Gettysburg and Sound of the Guns by Fairfax Downey have not been referenced which would have enabled the author to develop his artillery sections in the book to an acceptable and accurate level of scholarship.Emory Upton has only been mentioned in passing, and his comrade in arms, David Russell, not at all. Upton was arguably the best tactician produced by either side in the conflict and his absence is striking. He and Russell were responsible for the superb night attack at Rappahannock Station in November 1863, the first successful night attack of the war. Further, Upton's famous assault at Spotsylvania in 1864 is barely mentioned in passing. Seems to me that these innovative and successful tactics should have been presented for discussion and review along with some of the other examples the author focuses on.Further, James Wilson, the famous Union cavalry commander whose horsemen rampaged in the South late in the war and defeated Bedford Forrest gets no mention in this text.The excellent Time-Life Civil War Series doesn't appear to have been used as source material, while such dubious works as Attack and Die have been. While the Time-Life Series is a secondary source, it is an immense study, full of primary source material contributed by an excellent team of Civil War historians.While a noble effort, this work falls short of its intended objective and contains too many errors to be used as a standard reference. This is the same situation with the authors two other works, The Anatomy of Victory and With Musket, Cannon, and Sword, which is unfortunate."},{"Title":"The Bloody Crucible of Courage: Fighting Methods and Combat Experience of the Civil War","review":"I am not a Civil War buff and haven't read a ton of military history, but I really liked this book. It was very well written and explained the tactics and weapons used in the context of what other countries were doing around the same time. I read another review that said this was \\"dry\\", and I guess it is if you are looking for heart-tugging emotional stories about the soldiers' lives. But if you are looking for a clear and revealing overview of how soldiers prepared and fought on a technical level, without the usual Civil War pretense or bombast, this is very enjoyable and informative."},{"Title":"The Bloody Crucible of Courage: Fighting Methods and Combat Experience of the Civil War","review":"This is a book that is ambitious--to provide in one volume a comprehensive picture of Civil War combat, including (page x) \\". . .the full spectrum of both the fighting methods and the combat experience during the entire Civil War.\\" The volume also explores tactics across the various arms of the military (e.g., artillery, cavalry, and infantry) as well as developing military technology (torpedoes, ironclad war ships, rifled small arms and artillery, early \\"machine guns,\\" breechloaders, repeating rifles, and so on). In the end, Nosworthy says of the book (page xiii): \\". . .not only must it examine how troops prepared and trained for combat, but it also has to take a detailed, structured look at the techniques, practices, and tactics that were actually used during the bloody crucible of battle.\\"The early part of the book examines developments before the outbreak of the Civil War, such as rifled small arms (and the debate over what the consequences would be for battle tactics), the move to rifled artillery (and the possible implications for combat), origins of ironclad vessels (and, again, the implications for naval tactics). Much of this unfolded on the European continent; Nosworthy does a nice job of relating how military figures debated what the implications of these developments might be for actual combat situations.Part II outlines the early Civil War, including discussion of the daunting challenge of training a host of raw recruits (on both sides of the conflict), the crazy quilt assemblage of artillery and muskets available to units, and the evidence of poor preparedness of troops and officers exemplified by First Manassas/Bull Run.Part III focuses on infantry and cavalry, including tactical doctrines developed by European and American military leaders (e.g., the work of Jomini who tried to derive lessons from Napoleon's military exploits). Chapter 12 is interesting, as it depicts the reality of battle from the perspective of the troops involved. The following chapter relates in detail the learning curve of soldiers as they campaigned. Chapter 15 is especially fascinating, as it outlines various perspectives (originating in European military views) on infantry tactics.And so on.The concluding Part (Part VII) assesses lessons learned, from the impact of the rifled musket to the bayonet (myth and usefulness) to the effect of repeating rifles and military doctrine in Europe up until the Franco-Prussian War.The book is not written in a felicitous fashion and there are some questions one might raise. As another reviewer notes, the author continually misuses the term \\"nonplussed.\\" The author spends time speaking of the mounted arm of the military, including the development of mounted infantry. However, he does not mention Wilder's brigade until the very end, even though his command was one of the best exemplars of this. Despite difficulties, this work provides one of the best discussions of (as the subtitle of the book reads) \\"fighting methods and combat experience of the Civil War.\\""},{"Title":"The Bloody Crucible of Courage: Fighting Methods and Combat Experience of the Civil War","review":"As a long-term Civil war buff and miniature wargamer, I found Brent Nosworthy's &quot;The Bloody Crucible of Courage&quot; to be thought-provoking and stimulating, forcing me to relook at some of my long-held perceptions regarding Civil War combat tactics. As with his previous work om the Napoleonic period, the author carefully examines the wepons, tactics, and combat methods. Often, authors who tackle this subject tend to take a strictly North American viewpoint, isolating ACW events, strategy, and battlefield tactics to a nationalistic perspective. Mr. Nosworthy properly examines how global military tactics and international advances in weapons and killing power significantly influenced Civil War thinking (well beyiond the trite and conventional comments often seen that Civil War officers used Napoleonic tactics). Nosworthy correctly points out that the mid-19th Century American officers were much moire in tune with more recent tactivs being used in Europe and elsewhere (perhaps reminiscent of Napoleon in spome aspects, but certainly not to the extent that other writers have claimed).As a tour guide and frequent speaker at Gettysburg, I am so tired of the cliches that Pickett and Lee were trying to recreate some grand assualt at Borodino or Waterloo on Day 3 at Gettysburg. Brent Nosworthy helps keep the Civil War in its proper context, and offers some fresh ideas that are well-worth strong consideration.A must read for any serious Civil War enthusiast!"},{"Title":"The Bloody Crucible of Courage: Fighting Methods and Combat Experience of the Civil War","review":"This tome is an essential supplement to anyone reading about the military side of the American Civil War. Nosworthy's eleven years of research into the nature of Civil War battle experiences produced a comprehensive look at what went on on the battlefields of that sanguinary conflict. You will have a much deeper appreciation of the logistics, technology, challenge, and fighting doctrines underlying any narrative of battles. You will understand their often more sophisticated European roots, and why they would be adopted in America. Nosworthy's views are informed by his research for earlier books on pre- and post-1763 (Napoleonic) battle tactics. You won't learn much about any specific Civil War battle, for this is a book about the development of the three arms (plus naval ironclad river warfare) during the 1850s and 1860s, with only pieces of actual battles used as examples. Its coverage is too vast for a short review.Particularly interesting are his fact-based explanations for certain \\"obsolete\\" practices that \\"inexplicably\\" continued right through the war, like the preference for the smoothbore Napoleon gun-howitzers despite rifled cannon, the sabre charges(!) that finally swung the advantage to Union cavalry, and the running debate about the power of smoothbore muskets versus the long range of rifled muskets versus the official dislike of repeating arms. His analyses are enlivened by soldiers' anecdotes of battle experiences and clarified with illustrations and charts. He makes a good point of the dangers of historians' overspecialization.Nosworthy points out that the typical single-axis line-of-battle attack formations pre-set by most Union commanders (rather than deploying from multi-axis columns as was exemplary French practice) guaranteed high casualties on both sides of the fight, due to lack of concentration or surprise--until the late advent of entrenchment made the defense superior. I think his account of the appalling LACK of training for volunteer officers and men points to an underlying reason such simple, bloody, pre-Revolutionary War tactics were often employed--tantamount to human wave attacks that belie the so-called American respect for life (e.g., Lee's Gettysburg or Hood's Franklin). Too few officers seem to have understood anything about aiming, maneuvering, and flank attacking (exceptions like Cleburne's target practicing, Jackson's \\"foot cavalry\\", Forrest [feint-and-envelope], Grant and Sherman [hit-and-slide]. It didn't help that the theoretical war manual copied from the French by the supreme Union commander, Henry Halleck, almost ignored any but line formations.I do have a few complaints. Although the book seems to be organized chronologically by arm (infantry, cavalry, artillery), many key topics are interspersed in sub-chapters unmentioned in the Table of Contents. Some topics are chopped into early, middle, and late sections as well. An Index helps, despite an emphasis on names rather than topics. People identified early may reappear hundreds of pages later only by surname (who?). Not unexpectedly, Nosworthy's examples draw disproportionately on ineptly handled battles on the eastern seaboard rather than from the innovative West (mid-continent), presumably because they were more frequently described by the more numerous Washington-based press. Nosworthy's writing style veers from excruciatingly detailed to slap-dash, these unsettling shifts perhaps due to the varying amounts of source material (listed chiefly in end-notes). Copy proofing is execrable: word perfect but style- and grammar-challenged."},{"Title":"The Bloody Crucible of Courage: Fighting Methods and Combat Experience of the Civil War","review":"Whether or not one agrees or disagrees with Brent Nosworthy's conclusions in The Bloody Crucible of Courage is not the point. What Civil War enthusiasts must appreciate is that if you want to understand the study of Civil War tactics, if you want to know the state of the question about the rifle revolution, you must read this book. If you do not read this book, you can not be an informed participant in the current debate.Do I agree with all of his conclusions? No, but this book has made me reexamine the subject and ask new questions. More research needs to be done before we can reach more conclusive answers, but that new research must deal with the issues raised in The Bloody Crucible of Courage."},{"Title":"Catholics, Politics, and Public Policy: Beyond Left and Right","review":"This book provides a framework for political analysis by Catholics who may be confused and perplexed by the current American political scene. This book is aimed toward liberals and conservatives, Republicans and Democrats, libertarians and Catholics of all other political persuasions. The one short-coming I saw in the book is the lack of a concluding chapter - but that is probably the authors' intention. The authors intend to give a framework for decision-making by Catholics, but give very few answers beyond those few \\"unambiguous teachings on particular moral questions (abortion, theft, and living wage, for example).\\" [pg x]What was very surprising for a person who believes himself well-informed about political issues was the authors' ability to show how policies that seem not to be related are in fact closely interrelated. A just economy fairly addressing issues of poverty, healthcare, and education lead to secure families spanning across the generations, racial and ethnic pluralism, and protecting the environment and the sanctity of life.As an example on why being a Catholic is being neither a Republic nor Democrat, liberal or conservative, consider Chapter 9, \\"Consistently Defending the Sanctity of Human Life.\\" Republicans and conservatives generally defend the sanctity of the life of the unborn ardently, while Democrats and liberals generally object to the death penalty while defending the right to choose. The Catholic response to these issues is consistent - life is sacred regardless whether it is the beginning of life in the womb or the end of life as an octogenarian - and everywhere in between. Period. End of the story for abortion, euthanasia, the death penalty, and physician assisted suicide.This book was written before the United States and the \\"coalition forces\\" invaded Iraq, but gives a structure for a Catholic to analyze that action - and the analysis, at least in my opinion, is not favorable. The \\"just war\\" doctrine has been a fundamental position for Catholics since articulated by Thomas Aquinas in his Summa Theoligicae. As the authors say [pg. 199], \\"Fighting a war against terrorism is just, but there are still significant moral limits in how we go about fighting it.\\" Have we crossed those limits by invading Iraq which, after we have failed to find weapons of mass destruction and have found information that Saddam Hussein did not participate in the 9/11/2001 attacks, shows no signs that it imposed an imminent danger to the United States? Have we crossed those limits with the prisoner abuse recently making the news, which seems to have derived directly from the President's and Defense Secretary's decisions to hold prisoners of war without regard to the Geneva Convention, and American citizens without regard to the due process of law? As the authors also say: \\"The threat of terrorism does justify more vigilance, including considerable inconveniences and even some loss of privacy for Americans, but these must be balanced against civil liberties.\\"As stated, my biggest complaint is that there is no conclusion to this book. The authors do not tell us what to think, or in most cases what they think. They do not give us answers to the questions:Is it right for a politician who passionately believes that abortion is wrong and in the sanctity of life to also believe it wrong to criminalize abortion? Should a bishop announce that he should be denied the sacraments?Is it right for an economy to adopt the requirements for a just economy (fair wage, universal healthcare, environmental protection) and therefore put it at a disadvantage against other economies that fail to adopt these measures?One thing that the book does appear to make clear is that there are no bellwether issues. A single issue candidate (\\"I want to outlaw abortion\\") must be weighed with the other issues that are important to Catholics. \\"You cannot navigate by one star alone.\\" [pg 7] This book is an important read for Catholics and others who want to understand political issues from the perspective of Jesus' second commandment - to love your neighbor. As the authors say, \\"As followers of Christ and citizens of a democratic regime, we bear responsibility for justice and the common good.\\" [pg 4]"},{"Title":"Southeast Asian Urbanism: The Meaning and Power of Social Space","review":"Southeast Asian Urbanism is based on the results of over two decades of field research on cities and towns of Thailand, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore.

It's not a representation of the Goldhagen debate in Germany, but a thinly disguised apologia of Goldhagen's book &quot;Hitler's Willing Executioners&quot;. First, a number of critical reviews of Goldhagen's work that have appeared in other German newspapers than the weekly DIE ZEIT are ignored or have been deliberately omitted. For example, the historian Hannes Heer wrote a piece for the daily 'die taz' titled &quot;The Great Tautology&quot; that pretty much trashed Goldhagen's book. Second, and more disturbing, several well-argued and balanced appraisals of &quot;Hitler's Willing Executioners&quot;, that appeared in scholarly journals in time for a possible inclusion in this volume, are conspicuously absent. The reviews by Juergen Matthaeus in &quot;Zeitschrift fuer Geschichte&quot;, Reinhard Ruerup in &quot;Neue Politische Literatur&quot;, and Dieter Pohl in &quot;Vierteljahreshefte fuer Zeitgeschichte&quot; give Goldhagen credit where credit is due, but they also reveal repeated inconsistencies, undocumented assertions, and a selective reading of the primary sources and secondary literature. In all, this edition is a disappointment. For an overview of the Goldhagen debate it relies too heavily on statements by non-specialists and brief articles from a narrow range of newspapers."},{"Title":"Unwilling Germans?: The Goldhagen Debate","review":"This book collects some thirty essays and other materials on Daniel Goldhagen's controversial 1996 book, &quot;Hitler's Willing Executioners: Ordinary Germans and the Holocaust.&quot; Not every piece the reader might want to find is included here, but more than enough is presented to familiarize the reader with the chief objections to Goldhagen's theses raised by scholars and journalists, as well as the lines of defense offered by his supporters and Goldhagen himself.

Goldhagen's main thesis is that the Jewish Holocaust was not a secret project of the Nazi elite, but was perpetrated by hundreds of thousands of ordinary Germans motivated by murderous Anti-Semitism. Though it sounds obvious that Anti-Semitism would be the prime mover in this horror, a body of scholarship holds that either 1) coercion within the totalitarian state, or 2) careerist ambitions in competing and poorly defined bureaucracies (the &quot;structuralist&quot; thesis) are mainly responsible. Articles are reprinted in chronological order, tracing the arc of the debate from near-universal condemnation of the thesis in Germany, to a grudging acknowledgment of its importance in light of the book's hugely enthusiastic popular reception.Though dry and necessarily somewhat redundant, this collection offers a good introduction to various Holocaust theories, along with revealing insights into the psychic burdens and vulnerabilities of modern Germans."},{"Title":"Unwilling Germans?: The Goldhagen Debate","review":"I found this book a useful counter-balance to the Goldhagen book.Goldhagen makes the point that eliminationist anti-Semitism was ingrained in German culture.

Responding to a violent disturbance, Batman and Robin bust up a room full of thugs and discover that the son of a South American Diplomat/drug lord has raped a woman. As a diplomat, there is nothing that can be done and he is due to go free; Robin starts to resent the \\"justice system\\" for its lack of fairness. He is finally driven over the edge when the woman is found to have committed suicide, closing the investigation for good. Robin takes off ahead of Batman to go after the diplomat's son and from there ends any certainty of Robin ever being a \\"good-guy\\" again. What truly happened is never revealed, but when Batman finally arrives, the diplomat's son has taken a 20 story dive to the streets below. Robin says he fell......and Batman doesn't press the issue.The story is concluded in #425, with the diplomat seeking revenge for his son's death, kidnapping Commissioner Gordon and threatening to kill him if Batman does not surrender Robin to him.

Though Liszt dominates this book, other characters from that era -- such as Tausig, one of the most talented pianists who ever lived, and whose life was tragically cut short at 30 -- also come alive. Amy Fay, a candid observor with a lucid prose style, brings to life a bygone era, when the old 19th-century ideals of European culture were in full flower, and music was perhaps the most beloved art form of all. All music-lovers should read this book."},{"Title":"Music-study in Germany","review":"Amy Fay was a young and determined American piano student whose quest for a concert career impelled her to travel to Germany, the center of European musical culture, in the 1870s. Miss Fay's delightful memoir of her years in Berlin and hamburg is illuminated by her charming and ingenuous personality and her passion for good music. Her tantalizingly brief period of study in the conservatory of Carl Tausig ended by the master's untimely death, she sought other teachers, and succeeded in obtaining an introduction to Franz Liszt. Her first-hand descriptions of the playing of Liszt, Clara Schumann, Joseph Joachim, Anton Rubinstein, the aging and eccentric Herr Wieck, and other figures of nineteenth-century music are a delight to read, as are also her sharp observations of German manners and Americans abroad."},{"Title":"The dog, the fox, and the fleas","review":"A cute story where a fox delivers as promised.

Standing atop a stone pyramid, one imagines what these mysterious jungle cities would be like with a bustling population and wonders, why did they all disappear?Here's a book that combines an explanation of this archeological mystery with a modern day medical thriller, a fast-paced tale about a deadly virus unleashed at a Mayan dig site that threatens to wipe out humanity while our smart young heroes race around the Yucatan to find a cure. There's adventure, romance, science, and just the right amount of sex, drugs and violence. It's the perfect beach novel for a Caribbean vacation - or for reading in the backyard wishing you were on a Caribbean vacation.This book will appeal to a wide array of readers, from techie to touchy-feely. Think Andromeda Strain meets Against All Odds (and thinking cinematically makes sense, as it would make a great movie). The characters are well-drawn and engaging, from bumbling Mexican cops and mercenary thugs to dashing treasure hunters and brilliant scientists. Author Larry Baxter brings believability and humanity to the entire cast, as he weaves a suspenseful, edge-of-your-seat tale that's exciting and informative. Both a trip back in time and a glimpse of a frightening possible future, The Mayan Glyph is a wild ride indeed."},{"Title":"The Mayan Glyph","review":"Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and KritiquesWhat would happen if an ancient virus were accidentally released in today's society? It would wipe out life as we know it, changing the world. This book tells the story of \\"What if?\\"A group of archeology students from the University of Texas are in Uxmal, Mexico, about to make the biggest find of the century. What they don't realize is that it will be the end of them as well. In the opening of the tomb of an ancient Maya king, they realize a deadly virus, the very one which killed the Maya culture over a millennia ago. The virus quickly wipes out the entire excavation party, and starts to spread; affecting everyone they came in contact with.What the team unwittingly released is the deadliest disease to ever affect mankind. Now a team of experts comes in to try to find the cure for the virus, before it wipes out the entire state of Texas, and eventually the world. While one group is in Texas, trying to attack the disease at the place of its outbreak, another group is in Mexico. For they had found a Mayan glyph, which identifies what is presently called the \\"Austin virus.\\" Therefore, if they identified the cause, maybe they found a cure as well.This book is full of adventure, mystery, suspense, and even a little bit of romance mixed in. An eclectic cast of characters takes part in finding the cure. There is Dr. Gary Spender, is running the operation from Texas, where he is trying to get a handle on the outbreak. Then there are Dr. Robert Ashley and Dr. Teresa Welles, who are racing through Mexico, trying to find the Maya record of the \\"Black Tongue\\" disease, and hopefully their cure as well. But those are not the only players in the drama. One will also find drug smuggling, tax fraud, and dirty cops.This is a story that packs a full punch, dragging the reader in, capturing them in the intricate plot. This reviewer started the book with doubts as to whether or not she'd enjoy this book. Surprisingly enough, 10 pages into it, one becomes engrossed, finding every spare minute available to see what will happen next. Mr. Baxter does a remarkable job of portraying the tension and the emotional roller coasters the characters are riding. One will gasp with dismay, scream at the irony of the characters finding what they have long searched, only to possibly lose it all if the cure is not found.This is one book definitely worth the time to indulge in it. This reviewer was engrossed and impressed with the talent imbued in this book. One will be eagerly anticipating his next novel.Kelley A. Hartsell, November 2003.

The disease spreads to the hospital staff. CDC enters the fray seeking a panacea while more people die.The airborne virus that eradicated most of the populace of the Mayan Empire in the latter half of the ninth century has returned. However, what was a relatively localized pandemic is much more dangerous to humanity, as modern transportation provides this virus with easy access way beyond Austin. The United States government leadership discus how to contain the pathogen, but unless a cure is quickly found, the only response is to draw a line above Texas and isolate everyone to the south with full military at the containment front. Millions will be condemned to a horrible death.Dr. Spender of CDC discusses the disease on a video conference with Boston based Dr. Robert Asher. Soon Asher learns that the starting point of the spreading epidemic was a research team in the Mexican jungle. Asher, accompanied by Mayan scholar Teresa Welles, visits the epicenter hoping to learn how some Mayans survived. Concurrently, the virus has spread to Mexico.This exciting thriller provides an intriguing spin to the end days of the Mayan Empire that alone hook readers to learn more about what happened.

Forget all those politically correct, gender-biased relationship books - the ones your wife or girlfriend gives you to read (hint, hint: you have a problem communicating). The author, Gary Freitas, has written a witty, irreverent, and brutally funny book, Relationship Realities: An Emergency Survival Guide for Men. It not only tells you what women want, but dares to ask: What do men want? Regarding the latter, he says, \\"The answer is unpleasant and should probably be kept secret.\\" (See page 196.) This small but memorable book, with many outrageous charts and tables, guides men through each stage of a relationship. On trying to pickup women Freitas suggests, \\"Never accept \`entourage' status. In the great web of life you will be an E. coli in the small bowel of a woman, unless of course it's your destiny to be a tapeworm.\\" Through the persona of the BAD Dudes, this book smartly and insightfully examines dozens of topics such as: men's fear that in future Nuremberg trials they will be accused of being \\"good husbands,\\" as part of state sanctioned human rights violations known as \\"marriage.\\" And \\"How does an older man convince a 19-year-old girl that he's a \`previously owned luxury vehicle,' when all she sees is a \`Rent-A-Wreck' who is six months away from being an abandoned vehicle?\\" Freitas says, \\"You will learn all of this and more. I promise.\\" Topics are wide-ranging - from \\"Fifty Ways to Dump a Date,\\" to the hazards of \\"Dating Beautiful Women,\\" to the \\"Advantages of Being a Rich and Handsome American God seeking out mail-order catalog relationships.\\" Freitas is not afraid to take on what he calls \\"The absurdity of relationships between the genders today.\\" He provides men with a primer on the \\"Cycle of Collapse\\" by women, their attraction to bad men, and expounds on why \\"Relationships are a test about the structure of reality that men cannot pass.\\" He says: \\"The BAD Dudes want the test dumbed down so even clueless Dudes can pretend they have a relationship.\\" Freitas believes that both men and women will enjoy this unique book. It began as an \\"Attempt to join an already on-going humorous dialog between men and women, and became a plea for sanity.\\""},{"Title":"Theatre street;: The reminiscences of Tamara Karsavina,","review":"Tamara Karsavina (1885-1978) starts by telling us of her childhood in pre-revolution Russia, in turn of the century St. Petersburg. Her father was also a dancer, Platon Karsavin, and the account of her childhood gives us a rare insight in middle class life of that epoch. There is a detailed description of life in the boarding school and the Imperial ballet. She writes with great tenderness about life at school and about one of the teachers, Christian Petrovich Johansson. In those days he was already in his nineties, a Swede who had turned grumpier with the years, but was one of the greatest teachers in the history of the school. It is with great pride and joy I read that she attributed so much to my compatriot! During the revolution and its aftermath, Karsavina remained in Russia till the bitter end. Then, she too, with her English-born husband and small son, decided to leave. The family escaped through the North of Russia on an English vessel - the famous ballerina and her husband on the crew list as stewardess and purser respectively. Safety was at last in sight in England where they made their home. The last sentence of her account is beautiful: &quot;That night we arrived in Middlesbrough - The Maryinski and Theatre Street left behind for ever, these were the footlights of a new world&quot;. Anyone who has ever been to grimy Middlesbrough can only compare with the glitter of old St. Petersburg. The book was originally published in 1930; in the revised edition of 1981 there is an added chapter on Diaghilev which Karsavina wrote in 1947. This beautiful volume with its evocative illustra- tions would really merit 10 stars, but as five is the highest accolade, I have to limit myself. Maybe the finest dance biography written this century."},{"Title":"Theatre street;: The reminiscences of Tamara Karsavina,","review":"An absolutely enchanting book, encompassing so much. A funny and lyrical story of a farouche young girl who grows into a great artist. An intimate and fascinating portrait of Russian life before and after the Revolution. And for the lover of ballet history, a treasure: first-hand accounts of training in the Imperial Ballet School, the Maryinsky theater in the time of the Tsars, the early years of the Ballets Russes. She was in the center of one of the most volatile and important periods of art, and she reminisces of her collaborations with Diaghliev, Chaliapin, Nijinsky, Stravinsky, Cocteau, Picasso, Bakst, and many more."},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"Heard about MacDonald for years and finally read one of his books. I will be reading a lot more of him. Travis McGee is a memorable character."},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"The other positive reviews capture Travis McGee's personality and MacDonald's style, social comments, and storytelling skills well enough. What very much struck me is MacDonald's portrayal of sexual mores of early '60s America. McGee is disdainful of the young women (coeds, flight attendants) who took \\"Sex and the Single Girl\\" to heart (and their working-class peers, waitresses and beach bunnies), although that doesn't stop him from hooking up along the way and giving terse reviews of the sexual characteristics of most of the women he meets. (Though he pointedly refuses to take advantage of one young woman near the end of the book). Still, he seeks sex combined with emotional commitment, and does find it, despite his (and the reader's) expectation of ensuing pain.Whatever McGee's faults regarding women, he is a saint compared to villain Junior Allen. MacDonald deftly reveals greater and greater depths of Allen's depravity. The label \\"serial rapist\\" is too pat--how Allen physical and emotionally overwhelms and dominates his victims for months on end is the most chilling part of the novel."},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"The conventional wisdom has it that John D. MacDonald deserves high marks for the way in which women characters are treated in the Travis McGee series. I must take issue with that particular idea. It's not difficult to detect a certain hostility to women running through the series. This hostility reaches its peak in The Long Lavender Look (entry #12) where the female characters are all dumb bunnies, hookers or psychopaths. In The Deep Blue Good-by, Travis comes to the aid of two women who have been victimized by the same malevolent man, Junior Allen. Allen had insinuated himself into the lives of these two ladies by using sex as a means of controlling them. In both cases, the relationship starts off as forcible rape (I'm not making this up) and rapidly proceeds to involve frequent, rough, consensual sex which lulls the women into some sort of docile funk rendering them helpless and easy to take advantage of.Because we all know that women are children whose ability to reason is extremely tenuous. All it takes is a steady dose of sex, the rougher the better, to turn them into unthinking zombies. To state the obvious, that attitude is offensively sexist even by the standards of 1964.McGee's moral code sets him apart from the conventional protagonist inhabiting similar works of fiction. We learn in The Deep Blue Good-by he has no problem whatsoever in applying torture to someone just to get information the person on the receiving end of the torture may or may not have. This tendency toward brutality recurs again and again throughout the entire 21 book series, though at times it may be tempered. In fact, in The Girl in the Plain Brown Wrapper (entry #10), Travis attempts to save the life of a craven murderer only to be prevented from doing so by a police officer who has seemingly temporarily taken on McGee's God like role.The Deep Blue Good-by introduces Travis McGee along with many of the series' familiar trademarks. The Busted Flush, Miss Agnes, The Alabama Tiger, etc. (Though friend, neighbor and sometimes partner Meyer is nowhere to be found.) Another staple of the Travis McGee series introduced in The Deep Blue Good-by is McGee's frequent musings on a host of topics from the mundane to the most profound. Many readers love this aspect of the series and claim it's the main reason they read the books. Others find it tiresome and perceive it as too much self-indulgence on John D. MacDonald's part. I guess it comes down to a matter of personal taste.Once you get past the misogyny inherent in the premise and the disquieting brutality displayed by the protagonist, The Deep Blue Good-by is a pretty good crime/action-adventure novel. The narrative flows very smoothly and the ending is exciting and unexpected. All in all, a successful start to a long running series which has brought enjoyment to millions."},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"The Deep Blue Good-By by John D.

Now, while waiting for \\"A Tan and Sandy Silence\\" to arrive, I went back and read it again. It was even better the second time around. The first read, I ripped right through just to see what happened. With MacDonald's writing this was easy to do. The second time, I slowed it down and really soaked it all upWhat makes this book so good, I my eyes, is that there is so much packed into to the comparatively short work. First, and foremost, there's Travis McGee himself. He describes himself as a beach bum, but in truth he's more the \\"knight\\" that he so disparagingly calls himself. He doesn't like to get emotionally involved in his work, but he always does, and it take it's toll. Trav's reaction to the events at the end of the book really stuck with me. (Side note, (to all the claims of sexism): McGee may always be out \\"saving the weak-willed women of the world\\", but, at least in this book, Travis is saved/redeemed in the end by one of those women he set out to save.)The other characters are spot on. I felt they all rang true, like somebody I could have known. I'll admit, that I have never known anyone like \\"Junior\\"(the villain). But because all the other characters seemed real, his nastiness was easily acceptable.Second, I loved the philosophical ramblings. They seem almost thrown in at random, but they are never really distracting from the story. I enjoy these because, whether or not I agree with them, they do make me stop and think. That in itself, forty plus years later, lifts this book above the average \\"pulp\\" novel.The last thing I really liked about this book was the simple descriptions of interesting things I'll never really know about. From the \\"Busted Flush\\"(McGee's houseboat) to the streets of Fort Lauderdale to fencing gemstones in NYC. All the little details drew me into the story and have kept me coming back for more.All in all, I would say that this book, and some of the others in the series that follow, are some of the best books I have ever read. They made me feel, and hit on many levels. I just can't praise them highly enough."},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"I recently overheard someone saying how much they enjoyed the Travis McGee books so I searched out the first-in-the-series at my local library. The copy I ended up reading was about the most worn out, dog-eared, common pocket book you can imagine. Some how it was quit fitting. The Travis McGee character is unique and appealing to probably both men and women readers. Kind of a Han Solo guy but wiser and more mellow. The author's writing style is more inventive and engaging than typical; the pace varies from silky-smooth to rapid Rainman word association. Creative with word combinations. Maybe not always grammatically correct (?) but the intended feeling and description shines through every paragraph. Interesting plot. A unique villain easy to despise... you can't wait for him to get his comeuppance. You'll have to read it to see how it unfolds."},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"One look at Cathy Kerr you could tell there was nothing life hadn't done to her.

I was hooked immediately and cannot put one down once I've started it. Sleep? Who needs it? MacDonald's Travis McGee is who we'd all really want to be given the chance to live any way we want. His commentary on Florida's growth, environment and people were decades ahead of their time. A natural follow up to Travis McGee is Carl Hiassen's crazy characters. While they don't have quite the same feel of honor as McGee and most aren't even likeable, they're all from the same swamp and are great reads."},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"JOHN D. MACDONALD IS THE BEST WRITER OF THE TYPE OF FICTION. I WAS VERY GLAD TO RECIEVETHIS BOOK. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS DEALER."},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"This is the first of 21 books John Dann MacDonald wrote featuring Travis McGee, a sometime detective who comes out of retirement when he needs money to pay the bills for his modest houseboat in Florida. When Travis is on a case the houseboat is often rigged to detect unwanted visitors. Seldom is the unflappable McGee caught off guard on his boat or anywhere else, for that matter.I've read all twenty-one books in the McGee series, at first not in order, but later systematically until I reached the last mystery, The Lonely Silver Rain. These books are a guilty pleasure. Sure, you could be doing something better with your time, but Travis McGee beats 80% of everything on TV. If you pick up one of these novels before bedtime, you might easily find yourself sleep deprived.Travis McGee is a knight in tarnished armor. I think we like him better for the fact that, like us, he has lots of faults; but he is true to his friends and when he gives his word to a client, he is not afraid to put himself in harms way to resolve the case. Like Sherlock Holmes, he has a bit of the bloodhound in him and relentlessly follows the trail of clues and leads until the action packed end of the story.Murder and mahem are an integral part of every Travis McGee mystery, but also thoughtful conversation with his economist friend Meyer and with McGee's own best friend, himself. He is a loner who is happy with his own company. He lives comfortably in the present until necessity or his own good will prompt him to act.The magic of all the Travis McGee books is that we think we know him, we like him, and we are delighted to be taken along on his travels when he is on a case, but we are just as satisfied when we evesdrop on his quiet conversations with Meyer and learn something of the McGee philosophy. Disagreeing with McGee, not often enough probably, is part of the fun. I was disappointed when I put down the last mystery, but I know that, like the Sherlock Holmes mysteries, I'll come back for a second reading.The second reading was as enjoyable as the first. In The Deep Blue Goodbye McGee almost meets his match with the always smiling, treacherous, and completely evil Junior Allen, who has stolen a bag full of precious gems from Cathy Kerr, whom McGee befriends and decides to help recover her property. Bad things happen to the good people McGee is trying to protect and his best efforts fall short of his goals and expectations. In a McGee mystery, things do not always work out for the best, just as in life. Twists and turns and unexpected surprises are in store for the reader who picks up this first of the Travis McGee series of books."},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"I've recently started re-reading this series - this time in order. While it's true you don't have to read the books in order, it does make sense to do so. Like all other mystery series, the author will refer to things (good/bad/whatever) that happened previously. Unlike others, John D. MacDonald will refer to them in passing & not rehash the whole story. If you want continuity, start here.It's especially important to read this one, and the next - Nightmare in Pink - first. What happens in this book is referred to many times - as far ahead as Girl in the Plain Brown Wrapper. Possibly further, but I haven't gotten that far yet."},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"This is a great book! John MacDonald is an amazing author who creates very vivid and easygoing characters. Travis McGee is my hero. MacDonald puts a unique spin on life and makes a very accurate portrayal of Florida in his story. A must read for any mystery lover. It's very easy reading and besides, Jimmy Buffett read the whole series so it must be good!"},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"I love these books. Travis McGee is one of all-time great fictional wise guys. He's witty, and pretty resourceful. The Florida setting makes a great backdrop and the books are full of action. The McGee brand of private eye was a masterstroke on the part of MacDonald. McGee is just a seemingly innocent beach bum that makes his money stealing money from those who have previously stolen it from someone else.In this opening book of the series, McGee takes on an ex-con that stole some goods belonging to a friend of a friend of McGee's. That's all you need to know of the plot. The real enjoyment of these books are the journeys McGee travels.There's a funny stream of misogyny that runs through this series that I have to comment on. McGee's exploits with women are much in the vein of James Bond, but MacDonald, I think, seems uncomfortable with the fact, because McGee is always rationalizing his behavior and the author's sympathies seem to be with him. One way or another, McGee always has some deeper reason as to why his constant use of various women is actually doing them a whole lot of good. Travis McGee is the sensitive womanizer. Now, I've never met such a person, but if one existed, I think that he'd spend the majority of his time on the analysts couch. This is just the first book, but when you're ten or twelve deep into the series, you'll no doubt laugh as McGee says something like, &quot;All the women mean something&quot; after one dies the sudden, yet requisite, death.Anyway, these books are fun and their goal is to entertain, and they do just that. If you read one or two, there is a good chance you'll read all of them sooner or later. I usually take one on vacation."},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"As you know by the previous reviews, this first book in the Travis McGee series, MacDonald paints a brilliant story with a magnetic appeal. The characters are interesting and the storyline flows like a mountain spring. We lost a fantastic American author when John D. passed away, but he left his mark on literature. I've many of the McGee books on the shelf and enjoy picking up and rereading due to the truly great writing style of MacDonald."},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"The time has come to explore the masterful works of this author. When MacDonald introduced Travis McGee to the world in \\"The Deep Blue Good-By\\" 47 years ago, did he envision 20 additional novels revolving around this same character? Could he have imagined Hiaasen, White, Corcoran, Morris, or Dorsey, patterning their literary efforts after this knight in a dented, rusted, squeaky suit of armor riding a sway-backed and tired steed into battle against the forces of evil? They did/do just that because McGee is everyman, at least the courageous, morally upright, defender of the weak occasionally falling from his horse, sometimes losing battles but never the war, that all males above the age of puberty dream of becoming. If this review appears to be reverential, it is. Although McGee books represent only a fraction of MacDonald's prodigious output, far more than 30 million of these books have been sold, a solid testament to their significance. Despite references to green stamps, this book is remarkably au courant and a joy to devour."},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"For some reason there's a gap in my reading history for John D. MacDonald's fine fiction, especially the hugely popular Travis McGee mystery crime novels. So you can't call me an expert witness in this case, but a friendly one on this his first in the Travis McGee series.I had read something in the series before--I think it was the Pale Gray one (the Travis McGee titles always contain a color)--but did not remember what an astute judge of character ol' Trav is... and how he teeters so on the edge of cynicism when it comes to sociological observations.For example, after Travis assesses his soon-to-be client--\\"The world had done its best to subdue and humble her, but the edge of her good tough spirit showed through.\\"--he launches into a broad internal diatribe on the world as he knows it:\\"I am wary of a lot of other things, such as plastic credit cards, payroll deductions, insurance programs, retirement benefits, savings accounts, Green Stamps, time clocks, newspapers, mortgages, sermons, miracle fabrics, deodorants, check lists, time payments, political parties, lending libraries, television actresses, junior chambers of commerce, pageants, progress, and manifest destiny.\\"With MacDonald I feel in the presence of greatness, and I'm thrilled to have 20 more Travis McGee books to read for the first time....For my complete review of this book and for other book and moviereviews, please visit my site [...]Brian WrightCopyright 2007"},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"My 2008 New Year's resolution (I made only one) was to read MacDonald's Travis McGee series for the first time, and in order. So I just finished this first title and can hardly wait to get to the next book. Travis McGee is somewhere between Parker's Spenser and Burke's Robicheaux, philosophically speaking. McGee is as much a knight-errant as Spenser but has the half-cynical, half-hopeful view of the human race as Robicheaux. For years I was told that the McGee books were hopelessly chauvinistic, politically incorrect to the nth degree. I was lied to. If anything, given that the book was first published in 1964, McGee's world view is more advanced than many of today's men AND women. And the frank (but never graphic) sexual context has a rare honesty and respect for both sexes that is too often missing in today's fiction. That aside, the storyline is riveting without being sensationlist. The characters are deftly drawn, and the pacing is swift without leaving anything necessary unsaid. This book is both classic and a keeper, it invites the viewer to re-read for those moments when McGee steps back from the action to talk intelligently but not clinically about his world. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"According to rumor, when John MacDonald first debuted Travis McGee in 1964, he submited five novels at once. Ritual considers The Deep Blue Good-by as the true first novel, although there is little evidence that would favor any of them. All can be read independently, and all are excellent reading.McGee makes his living by retrieving things that are hopelessly lost and tasking a hefty percentage off the top. This funds his idyllic existence on the Busted Flush, a housboat in Lauderdale. As McGee puts it, he is tacking his retirement in chunks spread over his life rather than all at once. When Chookie McCall, a friendly dancer tries to get McGee to listen to the probelms of one of the women in her dance troupe McGee's first reaction is to say no. But his sense of chivalry betrays him, and he finds himself drawn into the story of Catherine Kerr, who suspects that her estranged husband ran away with a nest egg that her father left for his family before he went to prison and to his death.Soon McGee, the Busted Flush, and a Rolls Royce pickup truck named Miss Agnes are out hunting for Junior Allen and the mysterious treasure he is suspected of taking. What McGee discovers soon enough is that Allen isn't just a crook, he is a true socipath. The story begins to take ugly turns and we quickly find out that even white knights can get very dirty.

Like a good woman, you never tire of them."},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"I first read the Travis McGee series years ago, and now they seem to be popular again. Maybe it's the Tea Party Environment seeking an independent lifestyle with limited government. Travis McGee is a \\"salvage specialist\\" who recovers assets for people, getting involved in investigations to find the assets. He works for cash - this is all unreported income that he keeps in a secret compartment aboard the Busted Flush, his houseboat that he won in a card game. He tries to minimize his contact with the government. He has various aquaintances in the Florida marina where he moors the Busted Flush. One is known for having the world's longest running house party.This is probably the best place to start, or restart, the series. The series came back to mind when one of the members of the Sue Grafton Forum brought it to the surface. While not an actual PI (that would involve getting a license from the government), Travis falls into that category of independent investigators who have no partners and no employees. I was disappointed when the character Sharon McCone formed an actual agency and became part of the establishment. I think characters like Travis McGee would drink Drano before they would join the establishment, and their independence is what makes them attractive - perhaps appealing to people's deep down desire to run off and join a circus."},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"This was my first MacDonald book, and all things considered, it was an O.K. book. It is a traditional American mystery with a hansom, smooth talking, tanned Floridian (Travis McGee)as the hero of the story. It was a quick read and I recomend it for any fan of crime fiction.However, the book falls short for a few reasons. First, I find little originality in the plot. Right from the beginning of the novel, when the problem was introduced, I had no doubt how the story would conclude. Sure enough, I was right. To me, it seemed to be a generic, open-and-shut mystery novel with little real suspense and no plot twists like I would expect in a good mystery.Secondly, I'm no feminist, but the overt machismo in this book got tiring. All of them women in this novel were helpless victims throwing themselves at Travis Macgee, who always did his best to help out the poor little ladies. I understand that this was written in the 1960's when these sorts of things were not as important. That notwithstanding, I still got a little sick of his constant portrayel of men as the saviors of women.But please, don't just take my word for it. I may have given it three stars, but it seems like most people give it five stars. There are obviousley a lot of people who really like this novel. I just am not one of them. Go out and read it for yourself."},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"Fifty percent is better than nothing.At least that is what you are desperate enough to take if you hire Travis McGee as a 'Salvage Consultant', to recover something lost that may just be of dubious legality. (Not sure what he will do if it is a racehorse, woman, or parrot, however).Here, a friend asks him to help out another friend, both of whom are female dancers, and he reluctantly agrees, ending up in a sordid plot involving some treasure recovered in a now-jailed husband's army days, and a violent man (think rape and murder) trying to get his hands on it. Along the way, there is plenty of seedy Florida, broken women, and biffo.If you like this sort of adventurer with booze and broads style of thing, not much doubt you will find this enjoyable. Good stuff."},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"John D. MacDonald has a tremendous sense of style, a keep eye, and a catchy turn of phrase. Read this story with a highlighter in hand to mark off the brilliant lines because they are wonderful.He has some misogynistic tendencies -- females in his books are weak creatures to be rescued with no common sense and easy to render compliant and stupid via excessive sex, a phenominon males are immune to. That may be a product of when he was writing. The story is worth reading despite that.Overall, an engaging work, a clever story, and a delightful light read."},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"Written in 1964, this novel shows its age. Here is a list of things that caused me to pause (not good for a reader of a thriller). The same novel written today would not have these things:1. Travis McGee is setting up a house-boat party of \\"four gentlemen and six ladies.\\" Sounds good to me, BUT (page 4): \\"No drunks, whiners...no dubious gender...\\"2. Said to be funny (page 166): \\"Where does responsibility stop? Do you buy a cripple a shoeshine box and send it out into the traffic?\\" Send \\"it.\\" That \\"it\\" is a person!3. Note the old use of \\"gay\\" as happy or fun loving. Page 27: \\"...the things left hidden from all the gay companions.\\"4. My, how the times have changed. Travis is worried about staying over night to protect an abused and psychologically damaged woman. \\"Will anybody make any trouble about my staying here?\\"5. Measurements for women have gone the way of Edsils (page 38). A woman's measurements were important when I was a boy in the 1950s and 60s. Now read this: \\"Sheilagh Morraine had a sweet, true, ordinary little voice, wooden gestures and expressions, and an astouding 42-25-38 figure...\\"6. Here's a great line about Cuban radio in 1964 (only five years after the communist revolution): \\"Voice of the land of peace and freedom and brotherhood. No commericals. Nothing left to sell.\\"Now for something else. The bad guy was always beating up women--even in the daytime. Not that such things don't happen, it just seemed over the top. Also, the women were traumatized not because of rape, but more because of the sex acts themselves. Page 73: \\"Oh, I will not do that!\\"The nature of these acts was never made clear, but hinted at, as if the author thought some acts were damaging in their own right. That hasn't translated well from 1964.Here's another attitude problem that Travis Magee (author McDonold) displays about women. Too much violent language (page 269, end of story). \\"The damned humble, docile, forgiving woman. I wanted to beat her. I wanted to do some ugly thing that would destory that mute earnestness, that anxiety to please me.\\" This leads to another problem. All the women in the story are as weak as the one portraryed here.So much has changed--FOR THE BETTER!!!"},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"While the writing was excellent, the material lacked interest for me. For a thriller/action/mystery there was very little sleuthing and very little action. Three-quarters of the book dealt with seven broken women coming to Travis McGee for a word of philosophy and sexual healing. This was a treatise on women's self worth, as explained through the cavalier Jimmy-Buffet lenses of Travis McGee."},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"My 2008 New Year's resolution (I made only one) was to read MacDonald's Travis McGee series for the first time, and in order. So I just finished this first title and can hardly wait to get to the next book. Travis McGee is somewhere between Parker's Spenser and Burke's Robicheaux, philosophically speaking. McGee is as much a knight-errant as Spenser but has the half-cynical, half-hopeful view of the human race as Robicheaux. For years I was told that the McGee books were hopelessly chauvinistic, politically incorrect to the nth degree. I was lied to. If anything, given that the book was first published in 1964, McGee's world view is more advanced than many of today's men AND women. And the frank (but never graphic) sexual context has a rare honesty and respect for both sexes that is too often missing in today's fiction. That aside, the storyline is riveting without being sensationlist. The characters are deftly drawn, and the pacing is swift without leaving anything necessary unsaid. This book is both classic and a keeper, it invites the viewer to re-read for those moments when McGee steps back from the action to talk intelligently but not clinically about his world. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"According to rumor, when John MacDonald first debuted Travis McGee in 1964, he submited five novels at once. Ritual considers The Deep Blue Good-by as the true first novel, although there is little evidence that would favor any of them. All can be read independently, and all are excellent reading.McGee makes his living by retrieving things that are hopelessly lost and tasking a hefty percentage off the top. This funds his idyllic existence on the Busted Flush, a housboat in Lauderdale. As McGee puts it, he is tacking his retirement in chunks spread over his life rather than all at once. When Chookie McCall, a friendly dancer tries to get McGee to listen to the probelms of one of the women in her dance troupe McGee's first reaction is to say no. But his sense of chivalry betrays him, and he finds himself drawn into the story of Catherine Kerr, who suspects that her estranged husband ran away with a nest egg that her father left for his family before he went to prison and to his death.Soon McGee, the Busted Flush, and a Rolls Royce pickup truck named Miss Agnes are out hunting for Junior Allen and the mysterious treasure he is suspected of taking. What McGee discovers soon enough is that Allen isn't just a crook, he is a true socipath. The story begins to take ugly turns and we quickly find out that even white knights can get very dirty. MacDonald's mystery storys are more often roller-coaster rides than quiet journeys, and The Deep Blue Good-by is no exception. McGee is noble defender, tough guy, and patient listener as the circumstances require.

MacDonald's initial \\"Travis McGee\\" novel mixes lurid treatments of sex and violence with fascinating philosophical observations about life in America in the 1960's. An engaging reading experience, the novel is also pretty dark, as- be warned- not everything turns out well for our man McGee and the people in his sphere.Of particular interest was the fact that, for a novel originally aimed at young men who purchased adventure paperbacks from drugstore spinner racks back in the 60's, \\"The Deep Blue Good-By\\" is populated mostly by women characters, and nicely fleshed out ones at that (pun slightly intended). Seriously, it was enjoyable to see nuanced, complex female characters, who weren't just there to hang on the arms of \\"salvage specialist\\" McGee during the course of his adventures (not that one or two don't do that a little).I also liked the contrast between the beautiful Florida locales and the dark doings going on there, as Travis McGee tries to recover for his client Cathy Kerr a treasure her late father brought back from World War II but was then stolen by a devious acquaintance of her father. That acquaintance was Junior Allen, who turns out to be quite a memorable villain, first romancing Cathy to find out where the treasure is hidden, then horribly victimizing Kathy and several other women once the treasure is in his grasp.The philosophy in the book comes from McGee's frequent internal pronouncements (about once per chapter) on whatever aspect of American life is getting under his skin at the moment. Though sometimes a little tiresome, most of McGee's little monologues are kind of interesting, though one has to wonder what adventure readers of the 60's- who probably just wanted a fast-moving story- thought of all the mini speeches that frequently back-burnered the plot for a few minutes.Anyway, I'm glad this thriller fan is finally taking on the \\"Travis McGee\\" novels, and look forward to the second book in the series, \\"Nightmare in Pink\\"."},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"Twenty some odd years on I've decided on a second go through of the Travis McGee stories. I enjoyed the pacing of The Deep Blue Good-by. It starts out thoughtful, McGee studies his clients, and we get details on the brutality of a Mr. A.A. Allen [Junior]. We learn a bit on who McGee is and why he lives out on a boat taking in some early chunks of early retirement.About halfway in I knew McGee and Junior were on a collision course but, before I realized it, MacDonald had hit the gas, and from there out it was just a sprint to the end. Before it all started going to hell, with me furiously flipping pages to keep up - there was a little time to enjoy some of the Florida setting. The best Florida writers have a way of putting me back down there. MacDonald's description of a sudden afternoon rain storm did just that. Travis McGee is the predecessor to a lot of today's leading man tough guy types, and might just be the best of them too."},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"I began reading the Travis McGee series back in high school, around the time teachers were assigning Bronte and Wharton. I was informed that the paperbacks I was reading were no more than \`trash' and a far cry from the so-called literature I should have been reading. Needless to say, given the choice between the flawed but noble Travis aboard his houseboat, the Busted Flush, or Ethan Frome's angst, my attention remained in Bahia Mar, a fact that was clearly reflected in my grades. To this day I still believe teachers would have more enthusiastic students if they were to assign John D. MacDonald, and there is more within those pages about life, right and wrong, and how a talented writer can weave moral lessons and biting social commentaries seamlessly within exceptional storytelling and high adventure.Through the twenty one Travis books the world changes and MacDonald captures the moments, through Travis's eyes he offers insight into those changes like a cautionary time capsule. But don't read this and think this substance in any way lessens the white-knuckled page-turning aspects of these thrillers because they are just that, thrillers in the finest sense. And this book is the perfect place to start, so dive in. These are books to be treasured, books to be read again and again."},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"I have been reading older mystery/detective novels for the last year and quite naturally that would lead me to the legend, John D. MacDonald's Travis McGee. THE DEEP BLUE GOOD-BY is the first in the series, from 1964. It is still outstanding eve after all these years. I will certainly go ahead and read some more in this series."},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"To many modern readers, even modern mystery readers, the name of John D. MacDonald is almost unknown, and even those who've heard of him may not have read him. MacDonald died over twenty years ago and only had one really successful movie adaptation of his works, Cape Fear (based on his book The Executioners). Yet MacDonald was not only really good, he was also a big influence on many current writers. On my copy of The Deep Blue Good-By, the authors praising MacDonald are some of the biggest in fiction, including Stephen King, Dean Koontz, Sue Grafton, Donald Westlake, Robert Parker and Carl Hiaasen.Of the seventy-plus novels that MacDonald put out, the ones that stand out is his one foray into series fiction, the Travis McGee novels, and The Deep Blue Good-By is the first McGee novel. McGee lives on a houseboat called The Busted Flush in Fort Lauderdale, where he enjoys his retirement in bits and pieces: whenever he runs low on money, he takes on another job.What type of work does he do? He describes it as salvage work: for people who've lost things that cannot be retrieved through normal means, he will get the things back for half their value. As the story begins, he is living the comfortable life, but that ends when he is convinced to help a dancer named Cathy Kerr, who's convinced that a hidden family fortune was stolen by Junior Allen, an ex-con who was in prison with Cathy's father. Few do villains better than MacDonald, and Junior Allen is definitely a piece of work, leaving a trail of physical and emotional pain in his wake.At the time The Deep Blue Good-By was written, John MacDonald was churning out books pretty quickly (often several a year). At times, the haste shows, but the opposite is also true: it is an indication of MacDonald's skill that even at his rapid writing pace, he could still produce quality work. If you've never tried John MacDonald, this is a good place to start."},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"John D. MacDonald's protagonist Travis McGee describes himself as a \\"salvage Consultant\\". He recovers misappropriated or stolen items from various miscreants. He lives a quite casual lifestyle on board his house boat, the Busted Flush, docked in Ft. Lauderdale. Like Nero Wolfe, he works only when his bank account runs down. Unlike Wolfe, McGee is active, and in good physical condition. He views himself as a romantic who is happy to jump in and help a pretty lady recover what was inappropriately taken from her, and help her through her problems. He doesn't hesitate to cook and clean for a lady if she needs the help.In spite of his strong desire to right wrongs and his frequent philosophical observations, many readers will not look upon Travis as a deserving hero. He charges his, generally attractive, female clients fifty percent of what he recovers, i.e., considerably more than would a malpractice or wrongful death attorney. He has no hesitation in using intimidation, or even torture, to get the information he wants, or planning for the death of his opponents. He is relatively promiscuous, generally not hesitating to engage in one night stands, or have sex with a variety of women in the course of a few days. These encounters are often portrayed as almost medicinal for his bedmates. For those who admire a hard-boiled detective, with questionable morals, who doesn't hesitate to do whatever is needed to set thing right and get the truly evil villain, Travis McGee is the perfect hero. For others he is clearly an antihero. The story is, as much if not more, about McGee's character, than the unfolding of the plot. McGee's approach to problems reveals an unflinching man of action rather than a strategist, whose lack of detailed planning often gets him into trouble.Although this book was written in 1964, about forty-five years before this review, the moral questions of if and when torture and intimidation might be acceptable are debated in earnest. However, for Travis McGee there is no debate, if it helps him get the 'bad guy' its okay.MacDonald usually writes in short direct sentences with the occasional multiline one. His characters tend more to caricature than fully dimensioned individuals. His plot here is more action than detection, and its precedes in a straight forward manner with the occasional philosophical, social, or sexual aside.The author has a marvelous way with a phrase. His writing is often pithy, humorous, insightful, and always well-constructed. He doesn't \`numb down' his vocabulary as many popular writers do, and even successfully educated college graduates will occasionally turn to their dictionaries.MacDonald has a strong fan base, and its clear that if hard-boiled characters are your interest McGee is one of the best. I usually lean more to clever detection than antiheros, so I was surprised to find this book kept my interest throughout. This is a quick, easy, and well-written novel that draws you in from its first sentence, \\"It was to have been a quiet evening at home.\\""},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"The first in the John Macdonald \\"Travis McGee\\" series, this book sets the stage for the rest of the series. You get to know a little about McGee, and get a good mystery story. It's a little \\"dated\\" now for younger readers, but I think most adults who like mysteries would enjoy \\"The Deep Blue Good-bye\\", along with the rest of the Travis McGee series."},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"This is the first of the Travis McGee books and quickly establishes why they have been so popular for so long. From the opening page the atmosphere is totally relaxed as we are welcomed aboard Travis' houseboat, The Busted Flush. Travis works only when he has to, which means, just before he runs out of money. The rest of the time he spends lazing around the Florida waters, living the good life.He is coaxed into action by the bad-luck story of a friend of a friend and quickly and professionally gets to work coming to her rescue. On the way, he acts as a knight in shining armour to a second woman who desperately needs help, going above and beyond the call of duty, firmly entrenching him as a helluva nice guy.This book was written almost 30 years ago, yet it is fresh enough to make one believe that it is set in today's world. It's an excellent introduction to the world of Travis McGee and has certainly whetted my appetite for more. Travis McGee is the ultimate laid back hero who carries his flaws as humbly as his talents."},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"This was my first John MacDonald novel and I enjoyed it, but it wasn't fantastic.

Enough of the PC apologists."},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"I loved reading John D MacDonald's books during the 1960s, 70s, and 80s. The Travis McGee books are my all-time favorite series. In this genre no one comes closer to to being a real, multi-dimensional person than McGee. He sees himself as an aging knight with a rusted, bent lance charging after bad guys who are sometimes only degrees worse than himself. He senses his own shortcomings but strives, not always successfully, to overcome them in pursuit of morally bankrupt crooks.The Dark Blue Good-bye is the first in the Travis McGee series of more than twenty books. McGee is a \\"salvage\\" expert living on a houseboat and taking his retirement in chunks while he's young enough to enjoy it. When his money runs low he accepts \\"salvage\\" cases: returning something of value (valuables, money, peace of mind) to victims whose legal remedies are ineffective. This means being as cunning and unscrupulous as the thief -- and a degree smarter.In this book McGee is after a crook who stole a hoard of jewels from a woman whose father hid them on their farm without her knowing it. The father acquired the jewels in black market trading during World War II. By pretending to love the woman while he searched for the jewels, the thief both mentally and physically abused the woman, robbing her of not only her jewels but her self respect. McGee is out to retun the jewels to the woman and also some part of the victim's self respect. He finds other victims of the abusive thief along the way.McGee's normal arrangement with his clients is to split the recovered loot 50 - 50 since the victom's would get nothing without his intervention. Even here, he wonders if he's being almost as morally bankrupt as the thief in taking such a large share.My ratty old McGee paperbacks have small print and have turned yellow with age. It's a pleasure to have these new Kindle ebooks to read. Being able to adjust the print size to read comfortably is a wonderful bonus. Besides my Kindle Paperwhite, I also read on my IPad and my Android phone. It's great to be able to pickup where I left off regardless of which eReader is handy."},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"One of his best..

John and his wife were close friends with my in-law's, and when I lived in Sarasota Florida I had dinner with John and his wife regularly. An extremely interesting man. So you see I am prejudiced. But none the less the writing has been an example for the rest who have continued and expanded on the form. And his character Travis McGee came along at the right time to capture a generation. I for one am glad to see this series come back in print and be available thru the new technology, because my old paperbacks are begining to become very hard to read. And I also noted the new introduction by Lee Childs, thank you."},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"I have just begun, for the third time, John D MacDonald's Travis McGee series.

Today, I realized that McGee was very much like Jack Reacher, and when I read that Lee Child had written the introduction for the latest release, I thought it very fitting. Travis McGee was a 60's Jack Reacher. Love them both and am looking forward once more to reading the whole series."},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"\\"Home is the \`Busted Flush,' 52-foot barge-type houseboat, Slip F-18, Bahia Mar, Lauderdale.\\"Is there any address in American literature so readily identified? Probably not. It's the home of Travis McGee, \\"knight in tarnished armor,\\" and central character of the over-20 volumed series by John D. MacDonald.With quite a following of readers around the world (my first McGee was while vacationing in Torremolinas years ago and needing something to read while soaking up the Spanish sunshine and absorbing the sangria deliciosa!), MacDonald's hero, along with his sometimes bizarre assortment of friends, enemies, and hangers-on, goes from one adventure to another. Each of the McGee books contains a color in the title, easily recognizable. And it's not purple prose either! MacDonald, a best-selling novelist for years, has more than just a storyline to carry his books. Certainly, McGee is his principal concern. He's \\"retired\\" most of the time--he only goes back to work when he sees he's running out of money. He'd rather stay aboard his houseboat and entertain his friends that work. He claims he's taking his retirement one day at a time!\\"The Deep Blue Good-by\\" is the first in this series, published in 1964. It is amazing, too, that in reading it here in the year 2000, the book still stands as relevant now as it was then. McGee, as usual, finds himself befriending and then helping out Cathy Kerr, who has come to him in desperation. Her misfortune has been to meet up with Junior Allen, \\"a smiling, freckle-face stranger\\" with depravity on his mind and a more odious person you don't want to meet. There is also something about missing inheritance. McGee is unable to resist and from the moment he accepts the challenge, the reader is glued to the pages.MacDonald's style is terse (some would say Hemingwayesque--one of MacDonald's favorite writes, incidentally) and moves rapidly, a pace easy to keep up with but one that if you blink, you might miss something. But who wants to blink when MacDonald is on a McGee crusade! The author's knack for piercing characterization, his ability to capture the landscape and atmosphere of \\"Lauderdamndale,\\" and his penchant for a good story make this first episode one not to be missed. True, the McGee books ordinarily don't have to be read in sequence, it's still a good idea. Over the course of the series, naturally, an affinity toward complete understanding of Travis, and his good friend Meyer, keeps readers truly involved.\\"The Deep Blue Good-by\\" is a \\"hello\\" to a great series!Billyjhobbs@tyler.net"},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"After reading all of John D. MacDonald's Travis McGee books, I would say that The Deep Blue Good-By is the best way to meet the greatest character of the detective-story genre. Imagine the best qualities of Hammett's Continental Detective Agency Operative and Sam Spade, Chandler's Philip Marlowe, and Cussler's Dirk Pitt combined with a unique personality that is impossible not to love. MacDonald's characterization is unmatched in almost all authors I have read, and his story-telling skills are amazing. But most impressive are his social commentaries voiced by McGee in interior monologue; nearly all the nigh-cynical observations voiced by Mcgee were true in MacDonald's time as well as ours. If you love a good story, regardless of whether or not you like mysteries, you will love this book. One word of caution, though-- once you read this, you will be hopelessly addicted to the world of Travis Mcgee."},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"This is the first of the Travis McGee books and quickly establishes why they have been so popular for so long. From the opening page the atmosphere is totally relaxed as we are welcomed aboard Travis' houseboat, The Busted Flush. Travis works only when he has to, which means, just before he runs out of money. The rest of the time he spends lazing around the Florida waters, living the good life.He is coaxed into action by the bad-luck story of a friend of a friend and quickly and professionally gets to work coming to her rescue. On the way, he acts as a knight in shining armour to a second woman who desperately needs help, going above and beyond the call of duty, firmly entrenching him as a helluva nice guy.This book was written almost 30 years ago, yet it is fresh enough to make one believe that it is set in today's world. It's an excellent introduction to the world of Travis McGee and has certainly whetted my appetite for more. Travis McGee is the ultimate laid back hero who carries his flaws as humbly as his talents."},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"This was the first in the beloved Travis McGee series. Buy Deep Blue Goodbye. Then buy Nightmare in Pink. Now you are on your way to reading one of the best book series ever written. John D. Macdonald is my favorite fiction author for many reasons: his social commentary, characters, storylines, ...Deep Blue Goodbye gives much, and leaves you wanting more. Thank goodness there are so many good works by this author.But don't take my word for it. Read the entire T. McGee series!"},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"I read the entire series as they came out starting 40 years ago, and am now listening to the unabridged audiobooks with delectible slowness.If you are lucky enough to be reading reviews to contemplate starting this series, you have a wonderful journey ahead of you. I think Travis McGee, along with Nero Wolfe, are the two best (albiet very different) characters ever in the mystery/crime genre.Since it is now 43 years since this book was published, you will be astounded at the amazing contemporary nature of the books.This is one of the more complicated plots with as many characters as any story in the series, perhaps as befits the first one written. It is a great story, but as MacDonald hits his stride around the third or fouth book in the series, the plots simplify, the number of characters goes down, and the depth of each charcter intensifies.You can read other stuff about the plot, characters, et. al. The purpose of this review is to tell you that when you finally get to the 21st book in the series, The Lonely Silver Rain, you'll be writing a review like this and be looking forward to your second visit to The Deep Blue Good-by as you start the adventure all over again."},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"Got started with the Travis McGee series 20 years ago. Didn't read them in order, but suggest others do. My favorite is The Green Ripper, and thought the only one a little lacking was Freefall in Crimson. But just want to say, when you finish all the McGees, go immediately to his other novels and short stories. Some are clunkers-- Man of Affairs, Border Island-- but some are unbelievably great novels of the crime/\\"pulp fiction\\" genre. The Empty Trap; April Evil; On the Run; The Girl, the Gold Watch and Everything; Linda (found in Border Town Girl), and on and on and on. Also short stories-- Good Old Stuff, More Good Old Stuff (Seven not as good) and the sci-fi-- yes, that's right-- sci-fi stories from very early in his career are in a collection, too. They're hit and miss, but mostly hit. For me, MacDonald and Steinbeck capture so much about this country."},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"\\"Home is the \`Busted Flush,' 52-foot barge-type houseboat, Slip F-18, Bahia Mar,Lauderdale.\\"Is there any address in American literature so readily identified? Probably not.It's the home of Travis McGee, \\"knight in tarnished armor,\\" and central character of theover-20 volumed series by John D. MacDonald.With quite a following of readers around the world (my first McGee was whilevacationing in Torremolinas years ago and needing something to read while soaking up theSpanish sunshine and absorbing the sangria deliciosa!), MacDonald's hero, along with hissometimes bizarre assortment of friends, enemies, and hangers-on, goes from one adventureto another. Each of the McGee books contains a color in the title, easily recognizable. Andit's not purple prose either! MacDonald, a best-selling novelist for years, has more thanjust a storyline to carry his books.Certainly, McGee is his principal concern. He's \\"retired\\" most of the time--heonly goes back to work when he sees he's running out of money. He'd rather stay aboardhis houseboat and entertain his friends that work. He claims he's taking his retirement oneday at a time!\\"The Deep Blue Good-by\\" is the first in this series, published in 1964. It is amazing,too, that in reading it here in the year 2000, the book still stands as relevant now as it wasthen. McGee, as usual, finds himself befriending and then helping out Cathy Kerr, whohas come to him in desperation. Her misfortune has been to meet up with Junior Allen, \\"asmiling, freckle-face stranger\\" with depravity on his mind and a more odious person youdon't want to meet. There is also something about missing inheritance. McGee is unableto resist and from the moment he accepts the challenge, the reader is glued to the pages.MacDonald's style is terse (some would say Hemingwayesque--one of MacDonald's favoritewrites, incidentally) and moves rapidly, a pace easy to keep up with but one that if youblink, you might miss something. But who wants to blink when MacDonald ison a McGee crusade! The author's knack for piercing characterization, his ability tocapture the landscape and atmosphere of \\"Lauderdamndale,\\" and his penchant for a goodstory make this first episode one not to be missed. True, the McGee books ordinarily don'thave to be read in sequence, it's still a good idea. Over the course of the series, naturally,an affinity toward complete understanding of Travis, and his good friend Meyer, keepsreaders truly involved.\\"The Deep Blue Good-by\\" is a \\"hello\\" to a great series!"},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"This is the first in the popular, long-running Travis McGee series of thrillers, first published in 1964. The next three in the series are Nightmare in Pink, A Purple Place for Dying, and The Quick Red Fox. There are 21 in total.McGee is not exactly a private detective; he is a retriever of lost things. A friend describes his work thus: \\"if X has something valuable and Y comes along and takes it away from him, and there is absolutely no way in the world X can ever get it back, then you come along and make a deal with X to get it back, and keep half. Then you just... live on that until it starts to run out.\\"My interest in the crime and detective genres has mostly been in the earlier stuff, especially the 19th century, so this came as quite a shock: intense, brutal, sexual. The villain isn't trying to take over the world or unleash nuclear catastrophe; he is mostly an abuser of women. But it is the second greatest achievement of this novel that by the end this comparatively \\"small-time\\" bad guy has taken on nearly mythic proportions, becoming almost demonic in his evil vitality and seeming indestructibility. The memory of him will linger like a bad taste long after most world-destroying movie villains have faded. You will fear meeting someone like him in real life, and believe you could.The greatest achievement of the novel is of course its hero and narrator, Travis McGee. He's one of those highly intelligent, perceptive, tough, compassionate, opinionated, independent heroes with an eye for the ladies, who have an eye for him right back. What sets him apart from the herd is his great narrative voice, at least equal to that other great first person detective Philip Marlowe. In many novels description seems a necessary evil, but the descriptive passages here are a delight, and would be well worth reading in themselves even if there wasn't an intense, exciting, sweaty-palmed thriller attached to them. Like all the best writing, his is concise, precise, and able to find just the right detail to establish a character or place."},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"Sit back and relax. Start at page 1 and take the ride of your life with Travis McGee. This first book in the series is an excellent starting point for first-timers because all the ingredients for the McGee stories are here-a lady in distress, a stolen &quot;treasure&quot;, and a brutal unrelenting villain. MacDonald had a talent for involving you so deeply that you find yourself going back to re-read passages that hit you hard the first time. Junior Allen is a perfect villain--A force of nature motivated by greed with an ever-deepening bent towards sexual brutality. This book contains storytelling so vivid that you feel the punches with McGee. This book, along with Donald Hamilton's Death of a Citizen, is the perfect example of the 50s-60s Fawcett Originals."},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"I'm an avid reader of mysteries and I thought I had a basic knowledge of all the prolific writers (even though I haven't sampled all their works). But when a friend recommended John D. MacDonald's Travis McGee series, it wasn't even on my radar screen. I started this series with the first book, The Deep Blue Good-By, and was completely blown away!Travis McGee is a combination of a Mickey Spillane and a Dashiell Hammett character. McGee is a beach bum who lives on the houseboat, cruises chicks, enjoys the good life, and does as little work as possible. When the money runs out, he acts as a modern day Robin Hood-helping those who have been swindled recover their losses (for a percentage, or course). But what makes McGee so much fun is that he is a lovable rake with an astute sense of the world and the people around him, which sometimes borders on brilliance. Having attending the University of Pennsylvania, Syracuse and Harvard, MacDonald is no slouch, either. Some of McGee's musings include:\\"A woman who does not guard and treasure herself cannot be of much value to anyone else. They become a pretty little convenience, like a guest towel.\\"and\\"A man with a credit card is in hock to his own image of himself.\\"The plot is fast paced, and will keep you turning pages as quickly as possible. And while McGee seems to solve at least part of the mystery, the ending isn't entirely happy. The Deep Blue Good-By is definitely a book with an edge. While written in the early 1960's, this story could have been written today except for the absence of cell phones and computers.The only reason I gave The Deep Blue Good-By four stars instead of five is that at 144 pages, it is just a little light. But I am happy to have discovered this entertaining series, and have already started the second book, Nightmare in Pink."},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"'Deep Blue Goodbye' is the first of many Travis McGee mysteries, and it's my first John MacDonald novel. And as I explain below, it will probably be my last John MacDonald novel.Our story takes place in south Florida circa 1960. Travis McGee is supposedly one of those lovable rogues that women adore and men envy. He works privately in collecting stolen items for those not wanting to involve the law, and retains 50% commission. In the 'Deep Blue Goodbye' he finds himself working for a woman who is trying to regain stolen articles of her deceased father, who in turn had stolen them himself during WW II. The mystery itself unwinds nicely if fairly conventionally. The author doesn't break new ground here; I got the feeling I've seen this all before on television or as a composite of other mystery novels I've read.A so-so story can often be redeemed by fine writing and/or characterizations. But other than capturing a good feel of a Miami long forgotten, MacDonald's literary skills are just average. I found the Travis McGee character to be especially contrived. MacDonald was probably looking to develop him as an 'enigmatic' character. I simply found everything about him to be phony, perhaps as some alter ego of the author.Bottom line: certainly passable entertainment, but nothing more."},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"This is the first Travis McGee book I have read, and it will likely be my last. The writing style is pretty good, but I find myself unable to care about the McGee character. I would not want to be him, as he seems to be living an empty, going-nowhere life. His lack of morals, especially related to sex, turns me off."},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"Like the title of this review says \\"I'm hooked\\".Travis McGee is the best find I've had in fiction in years.Sort of a blend of Parker's Spenser and Cussler's Dirk Pitt.McGee's that cool.A great, thoughtful read with great incite into life and a few shocks to keep things fresh.Junior Allen (the bad guy of the book more or less) is absolutelychilling. A true picture of the human predators that do exist in real life. Not the \\"mine is an evil laugh\\" stock bad guys you find in most fiction.This was my first MacDonald book but, far, far from the last."},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"I really enjoyed reading the whole Travis McGee series in paperback years ago ... and would love to add the whole collection to my Kindle .... but alas, they are not on Kindle. Maybe someday? I would love to revisit this character and all his adventures. I sincerely hope they are added to the Kindle list!"},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"It's been a few years since I've read about my home in Florida and John D. has hit this one out of the park. An absolute page turner with one of the best Florida authors of all time. If only we could all be self-described beach bums. A great story, well-developed characters with great observational humor about life in Florida. It's so funny how things haven't changed here since John first published this book in the 60s.I feel like I went backward because I first read more recent authors and worked my way backwards to their influencer. If you enjoy John D. novels (and you haven't already read the following authors), you might want to check out Carl Hiaasen'sStar Islandfantastic former columnist for the Miami Herald;Pineapple Grenade: A Novelby Tim Dorsey, a demented lunatic but incredibly talented and humorous author; and Randy Wayne White'sChasing Midnight (Doc Ford)from south-west Florida. I would also suggest an up-coming authors out of central and south Florida. One I've been reading recently isBig Fat Chanceby Matthew Olech. Interesting read and worthwhile."},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"I messed up a long time ago. I began reading MacDonald's McGee series but did not do so in any order, nor did I record which ones I'd read. So now, though I'd love to pick up the ones I missed and read them, I can't recall which ones they are. In any case, every one I've read in the series of 21 volumes are true page turners. McGee is not a formal detective...he's more of an erstwhile private investigator who takes care of the terrible fixes his friends and acquaintances get themselves into. I happen to live in Florida, indeed in the backyard of where McGee kept his Busted Flush so I often notice landmarks and such. Often, writers are condemned or at least rebuked for inserting social or moral commentary into their fiction. And most can't make it work---it comes across as stiff and stilted. However, MacDonald pulls it off admirably. In fact, I've come to value Travis McGee's commentary almost as much as the racy adventure. McGee is not portrayed as a particularly moral person. In fact, at times he seems more like a playboy with a standard of morality he's set up independently of God or anyone else. However, his thoughts about life are fascinating and extremely insightful at times. In any case, I've read a lot of MacDonald's other novels, and, for the most part, I think the McGee series is his best stuff. Just don't do what I did. Record which of the 21 books you've read and read them all the way through to the Lonely Silver Rain. Have fun."},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"Why do I read such pulp fiction page-turners? I don't usually, only MacDonald, and I hear Dean Koontz reads him too - that is enough for me. Actually I think he should be studied for writing style in literature classes. This is another good one with damsels in distress and McGee to the rescue, and philosopher MacDonald expounding on all kinds of things you would not expect to be in pulp fiction. Very enjoyable and I even learned a few new things. I agree with Koontz, well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"After consistently seeing John D. MacDonald plugged as an influence and inspiration by so many present-day authors (particularly one of my favorites, Randy Wayne White), I finally decided to see what all the fuss was about. (Sidenote: I even caught an interview with Karl Rove of all people in which he said that both he and George W. Bush were big fans of the Travis McGee books.)THE DEEP BLUE GOOD-BY is the first in MacDonald's extensive Travis McGee series. McGee is a war veteran and beach bum who lives in Ft. Lauderdale aboard a houseboat ('The Busted Flush') that he won in a poker game. When he needs money he takes on jobs helping people retrieve things that have been lost or stolen, and in return he takes a cut, sort of like a PI but a little less legal. (Kind of reminds me of F. Paul Wilson's Repairman Jack.) DEEP BLUE is a first-person narrative, tough-guy-with-a-good-heart-helping-damsels-in-distress story.I particularly liked MacDonald's use of setting. I grew up in South Florida a little bit later than the time in which this book is set, so it was neat to read a story set there in the early Sixties and see how it has and hasn't changed. Also, I enjoyed McGee's internal monologues, particularly the ones about Florida and how it can be such a strange place.On the down side, I found the story a bit on the formulaic and predictable side -- if you've read a lot of Spillane, Hammet, Chandler, Ross MacDonald, etc, you'll probably think so, too. Also, I thought the dialogue sounded dated (even taking into account this story was written forty years ago), like dialogue in 1930s and '40s movies. It just didn't sound natural, didn't sound like how real people talk, to my ears, and I read lots of old books and watch lots of old movies. The dialogue sometimes made the characters into caricatures.Still and all, worth reading if you like crime thrillers, or if you like Florida fiction -- definitely any fan of Carl Hiaasen or Randy Wayne White needs to read some John D. MacDonald if they haven't already, if nothing else to see where these authors got some of their inspiration."},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"John D. Macdonald has created the most wonderful character in Travis Magee. I have read his adventures over and over again, starting in the 70s. In The Deep Blue Goodbye Macdonald has created possibly the worst villain in his series. A sociopath, at times he seems unbeatable, and you'll be sitting on the edge of your chair until Trav triumphs again and gets the girl, albeit temporarily. Each book in the Trav Magee series are well worth reading, as are all of the other books MacDonald wrote."},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"I was a little suspicious of this, being that it was written in the sixties, and I'm not such a big fan of that period, but MacDonald's writing is timeless. I am now a huge Travis McGee fan. He writes very well, and gives just enough character development to keep you interested without going overboard. He also carves a mean plot line with lots of twists and turns.Take a chance on this one...you'll be like me...aching to read the rest of the McGee series."},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"I have read all twenty-one Travis McGee novels and all are great. The Deep Blue Good-By is especially significant because it was the first. John D. MacDonald has shaped one of the most memorable detectives (eh, salvage consultants) in American fiction.McGee's philosophical sidebars and general commentaries on topics ranging from bikers, to bikinis, to beer, to sunsets give this character a depth that can not be found anywhere else. The storylines, however unrealistic, seem realistic. McGee does not always do the right thing. But who does. That's why we relate to Travis. When MacDonald died he took Travis McGee with him. But oh what a glorious ride it was."},{"Title":"The Deep Blue Goodbye","review":"Excellent story, neatly crafted characters. Classic details .....This was the first of the series that I read, now I am hooked....The ramblings of McGee about life, love and society are priceless. His sexual escapedes are so subtle,that you have to read back 2 pages to see if he got lucky or not...most times he did ...that was 1964....can you imagine what Trav would be involved in now! Great reads, we miss JDM, Travis will be continued soon, maybe not in name but in spirit and style and values ....welcome back TM"},{"Title":"Zanesville Stoneware Company: Identification & Value Guide","review":"It was with pleasure that I received and read the first pass on the history of this long misunderstood pottery company. Although the author makes a good attempt to document the history he falls a bit short. Many followers of this pottery know the confusion regarding the business relationship between Zanesville Stoneware and Francis Duggan of The Old Pot Shop in Norwalk, Connecticut. Rans had the chance to set the record straight that Zanesville made all the Old Pot Shop marked pots but either chose not to or did not fully understand the relationship. Although this is perhaps the most important aspect of the history for the collector it received a mere short paragraph. The pictures are sufficient and good if one considers that this is the only resource other than original catalogs, but more time spent with lighting would have gone a long way. Good book for the pottery lovers shelf but one that will undoubtedly be improved upon some day."},{"Title":"Zanesville Stoneware Company: Identification & Value Guide","review":"Great publication that reflects the brilliance of Jon Rans and his collaborators.One of the best pottery chronologies ever written considering that most of the records of this company were lost in a couple of trajic fires.Some of the pictures could be of higher quality and the layouts of the pictures vs. discriptions is a little confusing."},{"Title":"Zanesville Stoneware Company: Identification & Value Guide","review":"I am pleased to be associated with this Zanesville book. We are all indebted to Jon Rans that his hard work overcame some unforseen challenges. So, I trust Rans will follow up with a further encylopedic sequel to this real heartland story of history, people, commerce, art and industry during periods of massive cultural changes in America."},{"Title":"Life Like Dolls: The Collector Doll Phenomenon and the Lives of the Women Who Love Them","review":"Just for Dr. Robertson, this review is gonna ramble...This is the kind of book that makes serious anthropologists cringe. This is the kind of book that makes the &quot;hard science&quot; scientists make jokes about social &quot;scientists.&quot; I appreciate Dr. Robertson's attempt to appeal to the largest possible readership in order to sell the book, but, unfortunately, wandering around in the middle just made the book tedious, repetitive, rambling, poorly presented, and way too generalized. Instead of scientific conclusions (or even, methods) Dr. R. makes huge sweeping generalizations about what his little computer-generated statistics tell him! I was embarrassed for him. I understand that students were major contributors, so maybe I should keep that in mind. Congratulations, you can all say you are &quot;published&quot; contributors on your resumes now, through the kindness of Dr. Robertson. But, leaving the students out of it, Dr. Robertson often wandered off the subject (Porcelain Collector Dolls) into other areas and kinds of doll collecting, sometimes seeming to imply that other kinds of doll collecting are just as weird and demented as PCD collecting. Maybe so, but other kinds of doll collecting should have waited for another book, instead of muddying the water in this volume, generalizing, summarizing, pontificating, and just making the book an exasperating trial to read. That said, I do think the subject is a fascinating one, and I think the manufacturers would be even more fun to study! When I first started working in antique and vintage doll repair, my first response to the PCD's I saw in doll magazines was the same one Dr. Robertson most often encountered outside of the PCD collecting &quot;world:&quot; Eeeee-ee-eew; nauseating; weird! Who could be collecting these dolls? Well, now I know who they are, and that could have been summarized in an essay. After checking out some of those dolls at doll shows, I began to think about their usefulness in the Los Angeles area carpool lanes. Hmmm...might be worth the investment, but would I be strangely compelled to keep buying them?? Have a trunk full? More in carseats in the back? I doubt it. I don't exactly fit the &quot;profile,&quot; and don't collect PCD's, although I am the &quot;right&quot; age and I do have a few other kinds of dolls lying around the house. I've never felt the &quot;empty nest&quot; syndrome (who first made that up, anyway?) -- I was thrilled when I finally had more time and a spare room to use for my avocation repairing dolls. I also think it's telling to note that the most often quoted sources in the book are both very out of date; why Dr. R. used studies from 1896 (Hall and Ellis) and Freud, who isn't even in the bibliography, and who no one takes seriously anymore anyway, is really beyond me. I was mildly entertained by Dr. Robertson's discussion of &quot;hyperreality,&quot; but it was just one among many concepts he was handing out as scientific fact. It's fine to hypothesize and speculate, but he forgot to tell us that the WHOLE BOOK is a hypothesis with a lot of speculation thrown in! This is what my mathematician husband calls &quot;telling stories!&quot; God help anyone who believes this information hook, line, and sinker! The frequency charts in the appendix were really disappointing and will go over the heads of most readers; why didn't he just use bar graphs? Chapter 8 was the best, most organized, and most interesting section in the book; I wish I'd read it first and saved myself a lot of time."},{"Title":"Life Like Dolls: The Collector Doll Phenomenon and the Lives of the Women Who Love Them","review":"this was a horrible book first of all i just turned 14 and i have been collecting porcelin dolls since i was 5 years old and this idiot is trying to say that doll collectors have mental problems...this book really distured and upset me when i read it lkast year and it made every one who know that i collect dolls think that i have pervesed tendencies if i could give it 0 stars i most certainly would"},{"Title":"Life Like Dolls: The Collector Doll Phenomenon and the Lives of the Women Who Love Them","review":"Doll collecting is a fun, enjoyable, innocent, creative, and time-honored hobby.

The area of focus, however, is on baby, or child like dolls, and I have little interest in these. As it was published in 2004, I was expecting more about fashion and icon dolls, but there was almost nothing. The author also concentrated his efforts on what he referred to as PCDs, meaning porcelain doll collectors. There are many other mediums available and currently in use in the manufacture of collector dolls, which makes them more durable and more versatile, but this was barely mentioned.It seemed like this book was written by someone or persons who had no personal appreciation of doll collecting, and the material seems dated. I would have liked to see pictures and interviews with collectors, maybe even a chapter on designers.The author made vague illusions to fear of dolls, but otherwise, the information within the book was informative, and did seem accurate, albeit, somewhat dated."},{"Title":"Life Like Dolls: The Collector Doll Phenomenon and the Lives of the Women Who Love Them","review":"This book occupies a strange position between popular nonfiction and academic writing: It's a well-researched, careful study of porcelain collectors' dolls and the women who collect them, but it's written in a way that is very personal and immediate. It caused me to look at my own collecting behaviors in a new way. The conclusion could reach further, but otherwise I found the entire book surprisingly fascinating. If you're interested in anthropological research, women's studies, consumerism, toys, dolls, human evolution, geriatrics, family studies, or art, then consider this book. It will start you thinking, and you'll never flip past the doll ads in magazines again without taking a close look."},{"Title":"Mr. Emerson's Cook","review":"I just returned from the first day of the NCTE conference in NYC where I attended a session on using picture books in the secondary classroom in conjunction with American classics. Judith Byron Schachner was in attendance and read her wonderful book in a mellifluous Irish brogue. This book is not just for young children. It is a terrific way to introduce high school students to Emerson and Transcendentalism."},{"Title":"Mr. Emerson's Cook","review":"Annie Burns arrives in the U.S. from Ireland and immediately takes the job of cook in the Emerson house in Concord, Massachusetts. At first she's not so sure about working for a philosopher who would rather watch sunrises than taste her homemade pies. But after she writes a questioning letter to her mother, she receives a reply that stirs her imagination. Soon she succeeds in enticing Mr. Emerson to eat what she puts on the table.Author Judith Byron Schachner is a descendant of Annie Burns, and it's evident she tells this story with love and respect. The text is Transcendentalism in its most basic form. The illustrations are colorful and lively. Teens and adults can relate to the nuances of the plot, while the younger set can study the animals that appear in every scene. The chickens are wearing the booties that Thoreau made for them, and the cats are as playful on these pages as their breed can be in real life. A successful foray into the world of the Concord authors!"},{"Title":"Fairways: Inspiration for the Golf Enthusiast","review":"There's not too many people who don't like golf. And there's certainly many people who need improvement in their spiritual life. &quot;Fairways&quot; appeals to those people. Ken Abraham is not a golf expert, but certainly knows quite a bit about the bible and how we can grow closer to Jesus. He draws some great analogies between the great game of golf and god. The book is broken up into about 100 segments of 2-3 pages each, which is perfect if you wish to break them up into daily devotionals. His basic premise in all his segments is that while golf can be a frustrating game, it can also be extremely rewarding with the right kind of work ethic and patience, much like our relationship with god. It's truly rewarding reading and has greatly enhanced my life and has made me more at peace with myself. If you're a golf fan, don't hesitate to buy this book!!"},{"Title":"The Pagan King","review":"This was a good book. I had to debate long and hard over that statement. It's great adventure and intrigue, quite realistic for the most part, I was impressed with the fact that this in not Fantasy. The problem with it is how much licence the author took with Arthur's rise to power and his reign, as compared to most other versions. Of course that's good and bad. If you like Jack Whyte, you'll like this book, if Marion Bradley wrote your favorite version, you probably won't."},{"Title":"The Pagan King","review":"...while the info on this book seemed interesting, it was, unfortunately not. The premise for the book is Arthur, or Artyr, is a Welsh rustic, who with Merlin's, or Merdin's help struggles to attain the throne of his father, King Vortigern. It had a very good plot and surprising twists to the story, with occasionally some good dialogue between the major characters. In this rendition, Mordred, or Modred is not Arthur's bastard son born of incest with his sister, instead Modred is Arthur's half brother and not at all a bad sort of guy.However, the text tended to run on and quickly became tedious. Some sentences comprised entire paragraphs and frequently made the storyline hard to follow. The action scenes were few but those were the best parts of the book, numbering about three to four in total. I wanted to give the book a fair chance and stuck with it till the end. I would not advise it for those who like an interesting and fast paced King Arthur novel.To quote the author, Edison Marshall, at the end of the book, \\"I write precisely what I want to write with no thought of the audience.\\" Perhaps he should of thought of the audience and gave us something more palatable..."},{"Title":"The Pagan King","review":"I'm rather enamored of adventures and historicals and, among my favorites, are tales of the Dark and Middle Ages. So when I noticed this one, a re-print of a book by Edison Marshall, who wrote many tales in this vein back in the fifties, I rushed to order it. Unfortunately it did not live up to my expectations. It's a decent enough interpretation of the Arthurian legend, offering a realistic reconstruction of how the tale might have originally arose, based on the older Welsh elements. And the prose, especially at the beginning, really wowed me as it seemed rolling and poetic and fresh. But the tale, itself, finally bogged down, being laden with flat and lifeless characters and a predictability which, combined with the dull players, caused me to want to give up on the book half way through. But I didn't surrender to that impulse, primarily because I wanted to do this review (not a great reason to finish a book, I'll grant you). In the end this tale did not soar as I'd hoped it would and the lively, fresh writing with which it began became staler, along with the tale it was telling. Even the Arthur character never fully became clear, remaining a somewhat unsympathetic bumbler to the end, not at all convincing as king or hero. If you like adventure or Arthurian material you might find that this one suits you. But clearly it didn't work for me though I must admit, I'm a harder sell these days than I used to be. Three stars for the workman-like quality of the prose. Othwerwise I'd have rated it lower.SWMThe King of Vinland's Saga"},{"Title":"The Pagan King","review":"Arthur the warrior who became a king who became a legend has haunted me all my life.This book by Edison Marshall is hard to find - it's more than fifty years old.But look for it.It tells the story of Artos the Welsh farmboy & his climb to Kingship. This is as good an approximation of Arthur the Briton's life as you're likely to find, told as the Welsh might tell it.Artos is a boy filled with doubt & as he matures into a warrior & finally a King he retains that part of being a boy inside him.The serpentine Vortigern is his father & Mordred (Medraut) is his brother. Both seek to kill the young Artos & preserve their hold on the British throne ...... & fail.There is no Guinevere, & no Camelot, & Merlin is not the Merlin of Disney's Sword in the Stone.Edison Marshall ends Artos' story with these words, \\"The Watchman of the Ages sounded his great bell.\\"But in fact Artos' story hasn't given up the ghost. Mark Twain tried to catch him in A Connecticut Yankee, TH White came close in The Once & Future King, Lerner & Lowe set Arthur to music in Camelot.They all came close.But after 50 years & more, this evocation of Arthur's story is one of the best."},{"Title":"The Pagan King","review":"This is the stupedest Arthur, the most arrogantly ignorant hero, the worst character a writer can create.

I would recommend because of the darling artwork."},{"Title":"Mindless Selling","review":"I was hoping for techniques to help me move beyond the areas in which I always seem to get stuck - stalls, put-offs, long sell cycle, no budget, disinterest, etc. Instead, I found that these events continue to plague me because of me; my discomfort talking about money, self-limiting beliefs, what Kurlan calls Non Supportive Buy Cycle and my tendency to become emotional. Well, it's been several months since I devoured this life changing read and my results illustrate the impact that this book had. I have shortened my sell cycle, increased my margins, eliminated the stalls and put-offs, my sales are up 432% over the same time last year. I have not incorporated a single new technique but I have dramatically changed the way I think about selling, my part in the process and my expectations as to what should happen. No longer do I feel like I am resigned to wait for outcomes because I now control my own destiny. Thank you Dave Kurlan!"},{"Title":"Mindless Selling","review":"This book reveals great insights on the hidden weaknesses that truly hold salespeople back. In fact, I would call the ideas revolutionary for the sales industry. What I cannot understand is why the author didn't get a ghostwriter or at least hire an editor for his writing??? There are mistakes everywhere which makes the book choppy and difficult to read. One has to figure out what Kurlan is trying to convey to understand his ideas.

The information is rehashed and nothing revelating even for someone who has been in sales for less than a year. It is hard to believe that Kurlin is even in the selling business.

I literally went back quickly through the chapters to see if I missed something. I thought maybe I slept through the \\"good parts\\". There are no good parts.I very rarely feel completely cheated when I read a book on sales. They usually rehash some tried and true sales techniques, but I usually come away with some new ideas.After each page I kept telling myself I would find a new idea and to not give up on the book. When I got to the end of the book I was mad at myself for listening to myself.Waste of Time."},{"Title":"Mindless Selling","review":"This book was so bad that I tossed it into the trash. Mr. Kurlan borrowed terms and sales techniques from Sandler Sales Institute and proceeded to sprinkle them throughout the book, only giving credit to David Sandler on page 72. Kurlan then fails to explain any of the terms; mirroring, bonding and rapport, dream book, softening statements or let the reader know that these are not his creations. The book is conclusionary in all aspects and ends with such trite sentences as Mindless Selling is to be at peace. Mindless Selling is to be (sic) competetive (page 78). Besides unable to spell as well, he ends the book with quotes that make no sense. Dwight Eisenhower is quoted, \\"We sell peace, knowing that peace is the climate of freedom.\\" Underneath the quote, Kurlan then writes that you must be at total peace with yourself, gives no hint how, and then recommends that you read Dr. Herbert Benson's book to find out. Save your money and time or go buy a Sandler book that at least describes Sandler's sales system."},{"Title":"Study Smarter, Not Harder (Self-Counsel Business Series)","review":"I bought this book for my younger brother who is a freshman in high school.

I read the book myself to help my brother out, and I found it beneficial for myself as well! It is an easy, quick read. The principles are simple and easy to apply to your own life to make changes little by little.And what Kevin Paul talks about in this book makes sense! I am especially impressed by all the evidence and research he mentions that supports his suggestions in learning. And I know I tend to be a skeptic. And with the little time that I have, as a medical student, this was well worth it.I definitely believe that everyone has \\"genius potential.\\" Schools and teachers are realizing that there are multiple intelligences. However, it seems that our education system has not uniformly embraced this fact and adjusted the system in a way for our students to better learn.In sum, Learn how to learn for high school, college, medical school, law school, a new skill for your job, for a career change! With all exponentially increasing amount of information that is out these days, learning how to learn will be one of the most important skills to have in this day and age.So, Before you read any other study book, READ THIS BOOK!

Thanks to Kevin Paul, i managed to score straight As for my PMR(a very important exam for 15-year-olds in Malaysia). The exam was in October, but even in May, i was still underprepared. Truthfully, i lost the momentum to study, and i fooled myself by pretending that the exam was 'at the end of the year',little did i know that it wasonly 5 months till October. When i bought this book, (with hope that it would motivate me), it really made me realize how important education was. The study tips and techniques that was shown in the book, gave me hope that it was still possible for me to excel in my exam. Right after i finished reading this book, i planned a study schedule for myself, and did everything that Kevin Paul advised students to do. I discovered the miracles of Mind Maps and realized how it had made studying FUN for me, as well as increasing my understanding in a particular topic. I made coloured note cards, and used colourful pens to memorize important terminologies. I also used the power of the subconscious mind by reciting affirmations to myself five times a day to increase my self-confidence and truly believing that 'I Can Do It!'I am still practising what i have learnt from this book. Now that i enjoy studying, i don't mind sacrificing hours of my free time to learn new things because i know studying can be FUN when i study the SMART way, not the HARD way!Thanks, Kevin Paul, you're truly a blessing to me!"},{"Title":"Study Smarter, Not Harder (Self-Counsel Business Series)","review":"The book concentrates on the psychological techniques of better studying. In essence, the optimum psychological state for studying involves getting into a \\"relaxed intensity\\" state of mind.

Although the author does provide some helpful tips, he wastes a lot of space stating the obvious, repeating himself NUMEROUS times, and filling the margins with absolutely useless random quotes whose purpose is only to consume space and make the book look larger.This book is for the novice and for those who believe everything they read. The author is only marketing the lure of good study skills, he doesn't actually teach them to you. One may think the book looks nice, big, inviting, and there are many pages.

The real task is to figure out better ways of integrating new material with the knowledge you already have. Until reading Study Smarter, Not Harder the best I had come across was Kenneth Higbee's Your Memory. Higbee is excellent on mnemonics and has a very nice chapter on study skills. Kevin Paul takes the opposite tack, having very little on memorization but much on the study environment, the psychology of the learner, and specific approaches to various methods of study.

Friar has translated the massive Odyssey by Kazantzakis and skilfully reproduced the complex metre of the epic.

Starting in August 1967, she records her thoughts, her life and her research into her family history every day for her daughter's benefit.She comes from Mecklenburg, a province on Germany's Baltic coast. She was born on the weekend when the Nazis came to power in 1933 (echoes of The Tin Drum, except Gesine grew up). She grew up during the Nazi dictatorship, then the communist dictatorship. Somehow, she escaped from East Germany through Czechoslovakia and Frankfurt to reach her permanent residence in New York.Her thoughts (sometimes they are clearly diary entries, other times they seem more glimpses into her consciousness) take us through several points in 20th-century German history. We see the land-baron Junker society of eastern Germany, tottering amid worker and farmer uprisings in the desperate years after World War I; her father gets caught in the struggles between socialists, communists and nationalists as the Nazis take power; religious figures suffer in the lawless Hitler regime.At the same time, she observes her surroundings sharply: the upper West Side neighborhood in which she lives, the daily dispatches of America's Vietnam involvement, courtesy of that &quot;friendly aunt, the New York Times,&quot; her ambivalent quasi-romantic involvement with alcoholic weapons engineer &quot;D.E.&quot; The English title is slightly misleading: Gesine Cresspahl relates stories relevant to her life each particular day, rather than stories of what happened on each day in history. &quot;Days of the Year&quot; would be a better translation than &quot;Anniversaries.&quot;I read the first of the four &quot;deliveries&quot; of this novel on the recommendation of a German in-law; he said he thought it the most engrossing work he's read. I agree: the descriptions of the long-gone pre-1945 German society are fascinating, and Gesine is a striking narrator, as much for what she tells you about herself and her observations as what she does not. I read it very slowly (in German, 6 pages a night with my dictionary beside me), and never felt like giving up. Having finished volume one, I intend to continue my slow march through the 1,200 other pages to find out how Gesine left the Democratic Republic and to see if we find out anything more about Jacob, the mysterious father of her child.The style is very down-to-earth. While Johnson (like Grass) may be trying to tell us something deeper about how Germans should handle their intimidating history, the message is subtle and not given at the expense of the interest in sheer narration."},{"Title":"Anniversaries: From the Life of Gesine Cresspahl","review":"\\"Anniversaries\\" is a tetralogy, and only two parts are translated into English. Thats a little unfortunate because it certainly is one of the most complete description of german history immediately before and after World War II. I also find it the most subtle and terrifying description of how the Nazis took power in Germany. I read all four parts in German and find that the first two parts are the best ones, so that you do not miss too much by not having the last two at hand.Johnson tells the story of Gesine Cresspahl, who was born in Eastern Germany and now lives in New York with her 10 year old daughter. The book is structured like a diary, with an every day entry from August 1967 to August 1968. But it is not really a diary, because it is not her who writes the entries. Instead she \\"gave the right\\" to the writer to write down her thoughts, conversations and experiences during these 365 days. This style is somewhat similar to James Joyce' Ulysses, but certainly not directly comparable.But the diary does not only refer to Gesine's life in New York, but it also refers to important experiences she made during her childhood and youth in pre-and post war Germany. In that way, Johnson contrasts Gesines life in modern New York to her childhood in rural Eastern Germany. He draws a huge panorama of 4 decades, starting with the raise of the Nazis in Germany, continuing with WWII, Soviet Occupation, beginning of the Cold War, modern life in US and the racial tensions of the 60's and ending with the Massacre in Prague in 1968.It certainly is a major task to organize so much material, and most books choosing such a wide focus do fail completely (for example \\"Middlesex\\"). Not so \\"Anniversary\\". By using the diary-structure, Johnson really manages the huge amount of material quite well and keeps track of all the major and minor storylines without loosing the reader.The book starts a little slowly, introducing us to the Cresspahl family living in a little Eastern German village at the beginning of the 30's. Quite soon we see the first signs of rising National Socialism: Some inhabitants of this village start to bad-mouthing the small Jewish community, and initially their old friend still support them. But this changes soon. The Nazis become stronger, and trying to keep their stakes, most people give up their relationships to the Jewish.It is the major strength of the book to desribe this process of a slowly emerging dictatorship in a very subtle way. By focussing on a very small village where everybody knows each other, this process becomes the more terrifying. It is the best description of pre-WWII Germany I have read so far, and it is completely contained in the first 2 books.The last two books, which are not in this edition, are considerably weaker and do not deserve 4 stars. Especially the third one which basically describes the transition phase between the end of WWII and separation of the 2 Germanies is not so good. The fourth part proceeds with the beginning of the Soviet Dictatorship, and we learn that people have not learned so much from Nazi-Germany so much, after all. But that does not only apply to Germans, it applies to us all and teaches us that we do have to fight every day for democracy and equal rights and that we should not tolerate any intolerance."},{"Title":"Sisters","review":"Just focus for a moment on the nickname of the husband of the authoress, and it becomes E-Z to understand why Lynne Cheney's throbbing pudenda compelled her to write this novel more than two decades ago.

Yet potent testimony of the intensity of gratified female desire remains between the well-thumbed pages of the few yellowing copies of \\"Sisters\\" that have not been purchased and burned by Attorney General John Ashcroft and his staff members.\\"Sisters\\" made its debut when Mrs. Cheney was an unknown scribbler, though her words undoubtedly inspired the life choices of her daughter Mary. It is shameful that partisan political pressure upon Lynne's publishing house, as well as her current status as Second Womyn of the United States, keeps this moist, glistening gem from being reissued. Readers across America would find \\"Sisters\\" a fine excuse for self-abuse if only this exquisite paean to Sapphic love, as well as to prophylactic-clad heterosexual bonking in the Wild West, became widely available once again!

I did so because Elaine Showalter's on-line notice made me think that, perhaps, interestingly, beneath Mrs. Cheney's political stances lurked a more liberal, variously sympathetic soul. I do not think such is the case. The lesbianism in the story, while positively presented, is forced by circustances so contrived and characters so one dimensional that they undercut any sympathy the author might intend. The presentation of the West is risible.Heterosexual relations in _Sisters_ emanate from shallow cruelty and shallow desire. This combination may be a starting point for analyzing Mrs. Cheney; however, the lack of depth means one can go only so far. For me it is not worth the effort.

This book is one that most everyone should be able to enjoy."},{"Title":"Sisters","review":"Lynne Cheney, Sisters (Signet, 1981)I have to say that, even before I started reading this book, my mind was a vipers' tangle of prejudices about it. I expected it to be horrible. And then I started reading it, and it was slow, but really not as awful as I'd thought. And then, then... then came the last chapter.Sisters may have been marketed as genre romance--at least, that's how I've always heard it described--but it doesn't really read that way. It's got that scent of general-literary-fiction about it, the sort of ungenrifiable feel that draws on a number of things, but isn't well-written enough to wear the literary-fiction tag well. It's definitely genre fiction, though whether that genre is romance or mystery is probably up to the reader to decide; Cheney is not nearly as gifted as, say, Barbara Michaels when it comes to mixing the two. More accurate to say that it borrows a few conventions from the romance genre and a few from the mystery genre, without having enough of either to make a claim. It's not ungenrifiable, in other words, because it resists categorization, but because it doesn't know what it wants to be (as opposed to, in the work of someone like Joyce Carol Oates, being aggressive about not caring).Since there are a somewhat unsurprising number of reviews here from people who have obviously not read the novel and don't care to ever try, I'll spin the synopsis for you: Sophie Dymond, a successful magazine editor from New York City, travels to Cheyenne in the latter part of the nineteenth century to attend her dying grandfather Joe. While she's there, she gets caught up in investigating the year-old death of her sister Helen, with which she has never come to terms, and becomes increasingly convinced that Helen's fall down the stairs was not an accident. Meanwhile, she finds herself attracted to Helen's widower husband, James, a wealthy cattle baron. This gets her involved with the politics of big business, nineteenth-century style, and cattle rustling. All of it comes together in the end, though in a tangled mess rather than a neat package.You'll notice that nowhere in that synopsis is the word \\"lesbian.\\" This is by design. The \\"lesbian fiction\\" tag so often applied to this novel in the last few years is a misnomer at best; there is an undercurrent of lesbianism running through some of the novel's minor characters, but those looking for a cheap thrill (or, as one of the few reviewers who's actually read it puts it, some evidence that \\"beneath Ms. Cheney's political stances lurk[s] a more liberal...soul\\") certainly won't find it here. This is \\"romance\\" in the Danielle Steel tradition--Victorian in its attitudes toward sex (between any combination of sexes).This might have been even slightly disappointing had there been a single character well-developed enough to care about. There aren't. Cheney puts character aside for plot at every turn. As a result, the bulk of the book is at least marginally readable, if you don't much care about characters; Cheney's writing is at least borderline competent, enough so to keep the pages turning simply to find out what happens next. (By \\"borderline competent\\" here, I'm lumping her into the same category as, say, Dan Brown; there's nothing to distinguish it, but there's no obvious reason that the writing style itself is horrible. The badness creeps in because of the meaning the writing conveys.)But then, as I intimated above, comes the books painful, grueling, unbearable final chapter. Were I of the type to be easily, or even not-so-easily, offended, I'd have tried to round up every copy of this book I could find and burn it, the last chapter is so awful. (And considering the prices this book goes for these days, that's saying something.) This shows every indication of being the chapter that got tacked on because Cheney had no earthly idea how she was going to end this book. Every character who's involved has a complete change of heart (and behavior), and they all do so abruptly in a chapter that, for this book, is almost curt. It's a chapter that screams, \\"I'm tired of these characters, and I want to be done with them.\\" Needless to say, this is not the attitude of an author who gives a tenth of a whit about the characters. Even if the rest of the book had been brilliant, had been Pulitzer material, the last chapter would have been enough to cut its rating, at least, in half. And Sisters is not Pulitzer material.I'm not sure I could recommend this at the cover price we paid for paperbacks in 1981; I certainly can't imagine paying a hundred times that price, or more, on the collector's market these days (and that's a conservative estimate). *"},{"Title":"Sisters","review":"As someone who knows little about the Old American West, the exploration of society and social hierarchy made an interesting read.There have been claims that the characters are two-dimensional. This is true. All the men are either evil in some way or another (rapists usually) or totally oblivious (all the Cattle Russlers allowing their wives to go on to those women's lib meetings). Also, it's not a book easy to empathise with. I found myself more than easily putting it down, especially in parts being overly descriptive.It's true that the author does touch over a lot of the 'ugly' underbelly of the West- murder, rape, extramarital affairs and loveless marriages, lynching.However, Sophie Dymond herself seems to be have created to embody all that is 'women's liberation'. For example, Sophie doesn't bat an eyelid when she finds out the secret lives of her sister...but is appalled to find out about what her husband, James, did to her.Tracey Chevalier's Girl With a Pearl Earring suffers a similar problem to this text- the author has cast in a (or several) female characters with 20th Century Women's view on the role and \\"worth\\" of women.Which could quite easily make one think that the volume taboo material included was deliberate, turning it more into a soap-opera than any accurate account of history.The climax of the book was very unrealistic- Sophie turns from a journalist into a female Indiana Jones. Then, the ending was a huge let-down: the Wests' greatest feminist forgets the last two thirds of the book and goes back to her original plan, despite knowing what she did about those involved in the ending. It felt by then that like the author had given up on writing the book.As a comment on the author, people change, political ideologies shift. Lynne wrote this when she was a lot younger and was probably \\"testing the waters\\" a little, as she did with her earlier book \\"Executive Privilege\\". I would dispute her claims she didn't write this, as there are rumours that the US government had a lot to do with tracking down copies in second hand bookstores to make sure the public didn't get them. Also, how could someone with the same name as the author prohibit the publication (republication) of a book that she claims she knew nothing about? It's not the first book she knows nothing about, \\"Executive Privilege\\" is about a President who seeks psychiatric counselling and whose subject matter isn't entirely along a separate vein.A book that covers a lot of ground in a short space of time. Definetly worth a look."},{"Title":"Sisters","review":"I loved this book. Even though Lynne said today on CNN that there was no lesbian story here - well I beg to differ! This is hot and steamy frontier lovin'! Boy do Lynne and her husband know fiction! In fact that's all they know! Tellin' stories! ------- But I still had to give it only one star because it's soft-porn and I am a literary snob. But secretly I take this book out to the woodshed."},{"Title":"Sisters","review":"As a great admirer of Mrs. Cheney's other works (you simply must read her primer on patriotism - it made me fall in love with America all over again), I was delighted to discover this [appealing] but largely overlooked novel. I never would have guessed that one of our fiercest culture warriors could write so movingly about the joys of erotic same-sex love.In my opinion, Mrs. Cheney has never received her due as one of this country's most eloquent and sympathic writers on the lesbian experience. Is there anything more tiresome than the liberal media's insistence on treating this artist and intellectual as some one-dimensional caricature of a right-winger?"},{"Title":"Sisters","review":"This is the symbolic tale of a lost man whose beautiful but enigmantic savior herself lives in the encroaching shadow of spiritual perdition. Her story is a powerful metaphor for the battle between the syncretistic/animist urges basic to man's animal nature (as represented by a ragged but tenacious feral dog), and the purifying revelation of an angry and vengeful Christian God. Never before has a political satire used the mysteries of female sexuality to such elaborate ends, and the mixture of slap-stick and black humor that forms the Sapphic sub-plot's unforeseen climax is a potent one the philosophical underpinnings of which unexpectedly fly in the face of traditional Republican values. Sadly the sloppy, \\"deconstructionist\\"-inspired style makes much of this nearly impossible to extract, and it is only the roughest outline that emerges through the first several readings."},{"Title":"Sisters","review":"Love it! Way too funny, especially in light of the ultra-conservative regime that's in power now and trying to remain so."},{"Title":"Sisters","review":"The vast majority of 'reviewers' here have not read this book. It is not lesbian erotica. There are no 'hot' scenes. The possible lesbian sexual relationship between two of the characters is probably a 'Boston marriage', as speculated by the most worldly character in this novel. The only sex scene is heterosexual, and it is nothing that will get anyone hot and bothered. Incest and a threesome are part of the plot, but they are not dealt with erotically.While it certainly would have been delicious for the wife of the (former) Republican Vice President to have written a lesbian romance, Cheney hasn't. The politically interesting point here is that Cheney is more sympathetic to poor homesteaders and Native Americans than to rich cattle barons. Perhaps that would have been embarassing to Dick earlier in his career, but not now.The novel is a competently written, if lackluster, historical romance set in Wyoming in the late 19th century. Unless you have a real need to collect Wyoming historical fiction, you would be a fool to pay the prices being asked for this book. It is not erotic and it is not politically charged. I'm disturbed that all these bogus reviews are allowed to remain. Cheney would be wise to allow a new edition, to quell all the rumors. Meanwhile, get a copy to read through your library's Inter Library Loan service."},{"Title":"Sisters","review":"This book is an eye opening example of (non)hidden lesbianism in recent historical fiction. Ms Cheney writes as if she were personally inspired by the Diaries of Anne Lister and Macho Sluts (Pat Califia) combined. It's a fantastic coming of age story about the reclamation of women-on-women sexuality and the true and deep feelings women have for each other in spite of how their relationships may appear externally to the men around them."},{"Title":"Sisters","review":"WHat a captivaitng metaphor for the stamping out of Saddma Hussein while still unable ti find Osama.

Howevre the foe we all face inside of oursleves, the truth of our nature drenched in steaming sexzooality, stands nicely upright to illustrate how lies are deeply woven as much into our social fabric and definitions of our nature as they are about our most important matters of national security.Mrs.Chenys descriptiopns of the forbidden yet sacredand beautiful bond between women of the early days of the Amnerican Frontier made me think about the floor of the house or senate and how the democrats have been fighting for the truth, just as women were and still are fighting for their sex.I highly recommend this book, on so many levels.

Hold onto your copy because it's hard to find and expensive, I suppose due to the fact that erotic lesbian novels are not the kind of thing republicans like to brag about writing and it may have been held back from press, hence not a lot of copies are out there. Personally I find that rediculous, and it hasn't stopped a few from getting out anyhow. There's some sexual violence and lesbianism running throughout the story, but nothing terribly shocking. I suppose if you like soft porn or lesbian stories, with a touch of violence, and the old west, you might enjoy this tale.

This book will tell you.It's the well-told story of a jolly journey by an incurably optimistic Brit, who triumphs over all that Johnny Foreigner can throw at him.Richard Meredith is a 50-something writer whose publishers market him as \`The Balding Backpacker'.To provide material for his second book, he persuaded Daewoo Motors to lend him a 1.4 litre family hatchback to drive from their English base at Luton to their factory in Seoul, South Korea.Together with co-driver Phil McNerney, he motored 18,350 km over some of the toughest roads in world and through countries where life, never mind driving, is a nightmare.Altogether they covered 24,000 km, including ferries, trains and two plane lifts over the totally impassable bits.Visiting 25 countries and 17 capital cities, the further east they went, the more difficult it got. First nightmare was Georgia. Then Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan - to Richard they all merge into \`Absurdistan' where roads and border controls are little more than bad jokes.Further east, Bangladesh, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and China all had a go at holding them up at the border or elsewhere. But our intrepid heroes rolled into Seoul to an ecstatic welcome, 115 days after leaving Luton.To describe Richard as one who cuts it fine, is charitable. In the fragile peace of Afghanistan following the defeat of the Taliban and the American occupation, he elected to ignore local advice to dodge bandits by getting off the road by nightfall at all costs.He left Kabul just after lunch, following the same route to the Pakistan border as a British army of 17,000, which was massacred by tribesmen in 1842.As he drove his Daewoo Kalos into the hills, a battered white car full of locals pulled in front of him. Fortunately they were friends not foes and told him to put his foot down.Racing against the lengthening shadows, he made it out of the hills just in time.If you fear this book may be heavy on technical stuff, don't worry. The author is no motor-head. His knowledge of what makes a car tick probably hovers just below average - at least it did when he set out. But anything technical is boiled down to the easily digested essentials.The car stood up to some appalling roads remarkably well and as well as showcasing the qualities of the Daewoo, the journey raised 40,000 for the SOS Children's Villages, a worldwide charity for war orphans, based in Innsbruck, Austria.The whole tale races along at a cracking pace and if you like travelling or if you've got a car, you'll enjoy this book. If you've got a mad streak or if you own a Daewoo, you'll love it.Tony BoullemierNorthampton, England."},{"Title":"Moving Forward: Program for a Participatory Economy","review":"In my early years as an anti-capitalist, I experienced despair because of the negative outcomes in centrally planned \\"communist\\" countries. I knew capitalism was causing tons of suffering all over the world, but it seemed that nations which utilized central-planning style \\"communism\\" also caused tons of suffering. Was a better world impossible?Then a friend told me about Parecon (abbreviation of participatory economics) and my life changed.Finally, here is a viable alternative economic system! And it is described in explicit detail. It's not just a bunch of empty rhetoric about how we should have an economy based on equity, classlessness, non-hierarchy, participatory democracy, self-management, etc. It is a specific and detailed map of how such an economy can operate.Unlike capitalism, parecon is equitable and non-exploitative. Unlike centrally-planned communism, parecon is democratically planned and non-hierarchal.Parecon has many supporters amongst anarchists and libertarian-communists, because it is a vision for an economic system which embodies many of the ideals of anarchism and libertarian-communism - values such as those mentioned earlier: equity, classlessness, non-hierarchy, participatory democracy, and self-management. However, the Parecon is not officially affiliated with any particular political orientation. Even if you don't know what anarchism or libertarian-communism means you can still understand and appreciate Parecon on its own terms.Parecon also has a political vision to accompany it, parpolity (abbreviation of participatory polity), conceived of by political science professor Stephen R. Shalom. And then there is also parsoc (abbreviation of participatory society) which is a vision for a fully participatory society, addressing issues of economics, politics, \\"race\\" and culture, gender and kinship, etc. (See:Real Utopia: Participatory Society for the 21st Century)This particular book, \\"Moving Forward: Program for a Participatory Economy\\", explains Parecon thoroughly and in a way that the average person can understand. There is also a book on Parecon written for those who have studied economics and have a good understanding of economic jargon and mathematics:The Political Economy of Participatory Economics. This is a good book for economists who want a more scientific explanation of how Parecon works."},{"Title":"A Book for Couples","review":"I love The Book For Couples.

I hadn't heard of this author before but thought it sounded interesting. Suzanne's writing is really easy to read and engrossing. I wasn't after a deep read but something easy to digest and in this book I got a bit of both. Basically it is very similar in style to Amanda Quick but I must admit I liked the heroine in this novel better. The story revolves around Liza Elliot and her search for her brothers murderer. Her investigations lead her to Viscount Radcliffe a &quot;fallen angel of the aristocracy&quot;. Viscount Radcliffe only has relationships with women whom he can't form a permanent attatchment and he has a secret that torments him. Liza has been disowned by her father for refusing to marry for a title and makes her own way in the world becoming the owner and founder of a domestic agency. She disguises herself and enters the employ of the Viscount to determine whether or not he is a murderer. This novel is fast paced and easy to get interested in and there are no annoying side plots that are distracting. I read this book in one night and I became hooked on this author. One criticism I have is that the real murderer's thoughts are portrayed as a &quot;hungry, snapping beast who wants to howl&quot;etc. I found this to be contrived and mildly annoying but I would recommend that anyone who hasn't read this author to give this book a go.

Found it to be a fun, entertaining, worthwhile read.See Wolf Bear Does Books for a more in-depth, detailed review of \\"Lady Dangerous.\\""},{"Title":"Lady Dangerous","review":"A Victorian RomanceA BEAUTIFUL DECEIVERLiza Elliot had a very good reason for posing as a maid in the house of the notorious Viscount Radcliffe.

I hope that the single star that was mistakenly given to the seller hasn't turned anybody off from buying the book itself. It is ASTONISHING.By page 20, I was rueing every day of the past four years that I have been studying metaphysical and spiritual thought without the benefit of these insights. The discussion of good vs. evil (in the very first chapter) changed my outlook on the Universe completely... and that's just the beginning. I literally could not recommend this amazing book more highly.I'm so glad I picked this book up (it was good karma that brought me to the bookstore that day... I was trying to do a kindness that had to be put off, and with time to spend I went to the bookstore and found this JEWEL), because I didn't have nearly the same feeling about another of Goldsmith's books, \\"The Infinite Way.\\" This one has affected me so much more deeply... it really is a blessing."},{"Title":"Broadway's greatest musicals","review":"A 519 page book of the American musical theatre, full of personal observation and the prevailing critical consensus. This is easy reading, sometimes spending 4 or 5 pages on a single musical, with gossip about the cast or a recent television appearance. Abe Laufe had an old-fashioned-gentleman prose style that is endearing and he clearly loved his work. The book begins with the early hits of 1884 and concludes with the arrival of 'A Chorus Line'. The last pages of this edition has an extensive list of hit musicals, replete with song-titles and original cast members."},{"Title":"The Countess of Rudolstadt: (Sequel to Consuelo)","review":"I had just finished \\"Consuelo\\" and was eager to read this sequel, when much to my surprise --I opened the book and the type was so small and light== it was like trying to read footnotes.

And before you get overwhelmed, thinking there are no foods left that are healthful, she even gives suggestions of how to focus in on just your specific problem, giving lists of symptoms to help you know where your problem areas might be (foods that cause liver problems, digestion problems, pancreatic problems, allergies, low energy, etc.) Plus, the author's writing style is quite perky, which encourages you to keep up the good fight.

TSR then moved the Mystara setting to AD&D; Mystara line (sadly that only few modules were published in the line before TSR's bankrupcy) and the D&D; line adopt the new Thunder Rift setting. As one of the three tailor-made first time module in Mystara (the other two are B1 and B11, though you can use one of the rest in B series as your starting.), a beginning DM will find it not hard to run. The story itself is attractive and not as simple as B1 and B11. The module here provides a good linkage with other moudules, like DDA4 or B10 which the players may play then.Originally it provides a very good idea for a campaign setting. However, if you prepare to run a Mystara Campaign based on Gazetteer series, PWA series...., you may find that it is too easy to slip into Fort Doom, stronghold of the evil Black Eagle, and steal the artifact from it in the module. (Only a group of Level one adventurers can do this!) Do you think it is reasonable? Such a weak defense of the fort, the stronghold should have already been overrun by expert level adventurers/ civilians. This is just one point I don't agree in this module."},{"Title":"Sermons on several occasions","review":"There are several versions of Wesley's \\"Sermons on Several Occasions\\" on Kindle; I opted for this one because it was cheapest. However, there is no table of contents or any linked list to the sermons themselves. Since one typically does not read this sort of book cover to cover, but rather uses it as a reference, the absence of such a list is glaring. I returned it and went for a more expensive edition."},{"Title":"The Magnet Effect: Attracting and Retaining an Audience on the Internet Today, Tomorrow, and in the Future","review":"This book is designed to help people plan their marketing who want to establish or maintain an Internet-based business.Mr. Berst is the author of the leading on-line newsletter, which adds legitimacy to his description of marketing best practices to date for Internet-based businesses. In this book, he describes the best ways that audiences have been developed into long-term business supporters. The book is enlivened by sample pages from many well-known Internet sites. While much of what he writes will not be new to the reader, the way he stitches it together may well be.The first step is to use a magnet of rich media (such as through television advertising) to attract an audience. He feels that this should precede knowing exactly what you want to do with the audience. In fact, he argues that your offerings should match the audience you are able to attract economically. This is quite contrary to traditional marketing thinking, but certainly worked out well for his example companies, Amazon and Yahoo!He suggests six familiar elements for making your magnet work:(1) content that is rich and constantly changing (eBay)(2) community that adds value to one another (Amazon product reviews)(3) commerce (&quot;actionable content&quot; -- usually this is something you can buy)(4) convenience (RealNetworks enables streaming videos and audios from one site)(5) customization (Yahoo! and Excite)(6) communication (CD Now)Second, you should use spiral marketing to retain your audience with enriched media and the Web. Rich media (like television) creates the intent. Then your Web site creates involvement. You use &quot;opt-in&quot; e-mail to create interaction. That interaction then leads to commerce for your business. Done properly, each element reinforces the next one, creating a virtuous cycle of prosperity for your business.Third, you do as much permission e-mail as your audience is aided by and appreciates. This should focus on time-sensitive material, information that people will want to refer to again and again, and a format that is fun and free. Mr. Berst's newsletter uses all of these methods. He sites Guru as a site that fits this pattern.The final element of the model is to predict which technology trends will impact your business. While the preceding information will probably seem like old hat to most Web veterans, this section contained much that was new. I found it to be the best discussion of how to evaluate competing future technologies that I have seen in print. If you only read chapter 7 on this subject, you will be well rewarded for your efforts in acquiring and using this book. You will gain a paradigm for evaluating technologies in this chapter that will serve you well for the rest of your life.After you have finished reading the book, let me suggest that you think about how the model could be employed in less expensive ways. Television advertising is especially expensive. Why not do event marketing using your own events or by sponsoring other people's events? Creating fresh material is very expensive. How can you use your community to do it inexpensively for you? You get the idea, I'm sure. As wonderful as best practices have been, there's always a gigantic opportunity for improvement. Although Mr. Berst did not look too hard at that question, you certainly can."},{"Title":"The Magnet Effect: Attracting and Retaining an Audience on the Internet Today, Tomorrow, and in the Future","review":"Create a product. Find someone to buy it. That's a pattern that's been pretty consistent since the beginning of civilization. But popular technology guru Jesse Berst says that the Internet has reversed this eternal sequence of commerce. The new logic: Build an audience and then find something to sell to it. That concept is at the core of The Magnet Effect, a brief, hands-on guide to Internet business and marketing. The book illuminates the strategies and tools that have come to define the Internet play, intelligently making a case as to why companies like Amazon.com are worth their multi-billion-dollar valuations even as they are hemorrhaging cash. Berst combines a broad, strategic overview and direct how-to advice in an effective manner that allows us at getAbstract.com to recommend this book to both e-commerce veterans and Internet neophytes."},{"Title":"The Magnet Effect: Attracting and Retaining an Audience on the Internet Today, Tomorrow, and in the Future","review":"For those who were smart enough to listen to the author and not be blinded by short-term fads and fear, the \\"crash\\" has rebounded, and thanks to advice that can be found in this book, those who stuck it out are now ahead of the game, taking a few new cautions, donning a slightly new business suit, gaining ground with weblogs, but are climbing back again. Those who were not smart enough are, well, apparently too \\"dumb\\" and too busy \\"rehashing\\" a wining viewpoint on the world to have what it takes to see something great straight through minor crashes. Seeing the \\"crash\\" as permanent is as stupid as seeing a lull in real estate as permanent. It always rebounds.

It lacks snarky, pithy and/or bloviating commentary. This is an un-hip book that focuses hedgehog-like on your being successful in your new job.The New Leaders 100-Day Action Plan gives us an insight into an area of our business lives that has not been given enough attention, namely what the authors call, the 'executive on-boarding' experience. Many, many new executives fail in new roles, not because they are incompetent but because they are set up for failure before their arrival.The invaluable lessons within this book include: 1) your first day begins well before your first day, 2) negotiate after your offer and before your acceptance, 3) know your stakeholders before you start -- get all of these issues ironed out before you accept the job; and many others.I won't do the standard \\"Amazon book report review\\" here, but if you're in a position to transition into a new role, this is a book you really need to read, quickly.I joined a company many years ago -- hot brand name, great technology, high riding stock price -- only to find out upon arrival that 1) the job I was promised wasn't agreed upon by other stakeholders, 2) that there were others in the company who also had 'my job', and 3) my boss was about to get fired. I left after seven months. Had I spent 15 minutes with this book, I could have unlocked a few of these secrets ahead of time.

There is a road map for every step of the way.The \\"due diligence\\" on a company, department and employer before you apply for a job is the best section I've ever read on this subject.There are also some powerful insights and tips about moving up inside a company.I love that this book NEVER denies real humanity. Something \\"job hunt\\" and \\"management\\" books always do. It recognizes that people are curious, nervous and protect themselves - it's not sneaky to communicate with your employees - it's honest reality.Their concept of the \\"fuzzy front end\\" that time when you start a job in the first couple weeks. Brilliant advice here, the best start plan (that includes tips on your home life ) I've ever seen in print.Even tips on how to set up your office depending on your position.For job seekers, in a post internet world this book has a communications plan with that critical pre-job networking stage.There is an entire section on \\"day one\\" strategy.This is also a great book for board members/ board chairs. Tips in here for you too, how to vet a board, the staff, what to do on day one, week one, month one.I like that this book references Clifton/Buckingham \\"Strength Finder 2.0\\" and the \\"stregths-based\\" leadership series.

Great book!"},{"Title":"The New Leader's 100-Day Action Plan: How to Take Charge, Build Your Team, and Get Immediate Results","review":"The book this week was The New Leader's 100-Day Action Plan by Bradt, Check and Pedraza. I have been really excited to read this book because I am moving into a new job as a leader. I did not expect the book to be written like it was though. I was surprised to find it more of a workbook than anything else and very affective in doing that.As you progress through this book each chapter explains a point in the onboarding process, then tells you how to prepare, and then at the end of the chapter it helps you write out that preparation in a \\"fill in the blank\\" style. Not only does it give you the organization of these preparation forms in the book but the same forms are downloadable on the books website. Very handy in my opinion.One thing that made me wish that I would have read this book before I did is that they start the onboarding process into an organization before your first interview. They identify the common interview questions and give you example answers which were very helpful. This book follows the principle that you can't say yes or no to a job you never get an offer from, so go all out and try to get an offer from as many companies as you can and then after all the offers are on the table, and only after, do you due diligence on that company and find out if they are the best fit for you. In this economy I couldn't think of a better way to go about getting a job. Go for everything under the sun and then you'll leave yourself with more of a selection. And if you use this book as a guide you should be able to perfect you impressions and really make a great impression come interview time.Overall, as I read through this book most of the information was common sense. However, it is nice to have it all laid out because if you don't have everything you ought to do fresh in your mind on your first day... chances are you will forget it. Then as you progress through your first 100 days at your new job, using this book as a guide/workbook, you should be making early wins and bringing all the \\"right\\" types of people aboard your team. These two things are key to making a big impact on any organization and getting ahead faster than you thought possible.I think this book is perfect for everyone out there who is in the process of looking for a job or internship. I wish I would have known that onboarding starts even before the interview and how the early wins even before your first day can influence your overall career outcome. Addtionally, to those of you that have a steady job, even though a lot of the information in this book was common sense, I know that if you read it you'll learn at least one thing that you will be able to apply to you leadership role within your organization.... and wouldn't that make it worth it? If you have any questions on the book don't hesitate to ask me a question. I would be more than happy to help anyone that needs it.Interest in more reviews by me... check out my blog at [...]"},{"Title":"The New Leader's 100-Day Action Plan: How to Take Charge, Build Your Team, and Get Immediate Results","review":"George Bradt and his colleagues at PrimeGenesis have explained in a clear, well organized manner how to successfully \\"on-board\\" as an executive in a new role.

Reviewed by Steve Gladis, Ph.D., March 2011.What's the old Chinese saying about living in interesting times? Transitions are interesting, full of opportunity, and, at the same time, potentially threatening. Whether it's a high school graduate going off to the first year of college, a new college graduate landing her first job, or a seasoned executive moving to a new company--the first few months of their transitions will be equally exciting and risky. George Bradt, Jayme Check, and Jorge Pedraza (all from Prime Genesis, an executive transition consultancy) have taken out a lot on the risk side with the second edition of their book about the first 100 days of a leader's transition. What I liked about the book is that it takes the mystery out of executive transition. The stats on executives surviving are more than sobering: Estimates of failure rates are that 40% of executives fail in the first 18 months. Much of the time when executives get bounced out, they scratch their heads, along with the folks who hired them. Often, neither the hiring execs nor the exiting exec fully understand what went wrong. Thus both sides are doomed to repeat the same mistakes again and again at an enormous price, both personally and for the corporation.George Bradt and his team provide a clear map for the executive looking to come into a company. [If you want to look at how the corporate side should work, read Bradt's earlier book, Onboarding.] Bottom line, his latest book should be in the hands of any executive who even starts to think about getting a new job and well before taking a call from an executive search firm. I recommend this book to all my clients in transition as a MUST read. The book is divided neatly into sections: Getting a head start BEFORE the new job; crafting your own message as you enter the new job; building your 100 day plan (and your team). Also, the checklists or \\"Tools\\" at the end of each chapter are excellent and are bookmarked in my copy.

It does not have the eloquence or depth of Vidal's later work, but it doesn't TRY to--it stays within itself. The official amazon.com reviwer has said not to read it for the sex, and this is of course true. The only sex scene actually described is described metaphorically, but so beautifully as to inspire Thomas Mann to call it (in the word of one translator) \\"glorious.\\" Vidal himself uses a more modest word in translating Mann's diary entry, though he's very proud that Mann credited this book with inspiring him to take up \\"Felix Krull\\" again.The book is NOTHING like \\"Brokeback Miountain,\\" either the movie or the short story. Although Jim resists for a time thinking of himself as gay, and spends the years between 17 and 22 on a quest for the lost love with whom he spent most of a weekend having sex near an abandoned slave cabin close to their homes in a small Virginia town, this quest is interrupted by fairly long-term relatioships with other men, whom he meets after 'going to sea,\\" following in the foosteps of that lost love. The Hollywood actor and the sweet but not very successful writer, in Hollywood, New Orleans and further south--and then again in New York City, where he meets both again, provide an interesting and very realistic sounding mileau for a young gay man on the loose in 1946 and shortly thereafter. He never has sex with a woman, and quits trying after one attempt with a woman he's very fond of.The end of his quest--and I read the revised, less \\"black\\" version--made me scream \\"Oh no!\\" But after thinking about it a while, I shouldn't have been surprised."},{"Title":"The city and the pillar","review":"I always have high expectations for books that broke the rules- particularly those that make their writers suffer needlessly due to society's close-minded bigotry. So I was rather taken by the *concept* of Gore Vidal's 1948 novel \\"The City and the Pillar,\\" but ultimately I found it wanting. In fact, despite the budding romances of handsome young atheletes and showy movie stars, it ended up as quite a dry read. Vidal is dispassionate as he relates young Jim Willard's youthful misadventures of love and lust while searching for his high school crush, who he still holds a flame for years after a timid sexual tryst on a camping trip. His characters seem to me a bit two-dimensional and undeveloped, lacking any basis for their shallow and arid personalities- no one is born acting how they do when they mature, but when the reader is presented with only the face and there are no attempts to divulge the motivations they quickly get irked. The only character whom Vidal seems to make any token attempt to reveal to us is Maria Verlain; even more attentions are given to her than to the protagonist. He describes Maria's many facets with more scrutiny than he'd allow any of Jim's lovers throughout the novel. Why is it Vidal can't manage to give more depth to the shallow Shaw, or spare a few words to tell us the source of the pessimist-masochist Sullivan's eternal grief? Overall, the novel isn't worth analysis so as to find the means to praise it. Daring, yes, but few other endearing attributes show their face in Vidal's sparse, pruned sentences that lack the vitality that is emblazoned upon every page of a good book."},{"Title":"The city and the pillar","review":"There is already a review posted by GTF with which I found much agreement, but I think the reviewer did not go far enough and made one error.Not only is the main character and his lover not interesting as people, as the reviewer justly claims, they are worse than dull: they both are shallow, particularly the protagonist, Jim Willard. Jim Willard becomes the lover of a famous actor and a writer, but what value does Jim Willard offer these men besides his sexual service? Nothing. Jim's main attraction for most of the characters in this novel is sexual. Jim does not get along with most of the other characters in the novel because they are not physically like his teenage dream-idol, Bob Ford. Others who are gay might view Jim as \\"trade,\\" but aside from Jim's beauty and Jim's own judgments about others' physical appeal, all Jim has going for him is money-making tennis skills. Insofar as Bob Ford is concerned, his character is shallow for the reason that the reader encounters him at the beginning of the novel and then at the end of the novel only -- with no appearance in between. And to make it even less palatable for the reader, as time passes (seven years) between Jim's first sexual encounter with Bob Ford and his last (at the very end of the novel), the reader discovers Jim's \\"romantic attitude\\" has nothing to do with who Bob Ford is as a person, what courage he might have, what intelligence, what patience or compassion -- no. Jim's romance with Bob has all to do with how hot Bob Ford is for him physically!Something is very empty, cynical, reductive and dead at the core of this novel, because it denies emotional and spiritual values between human beings, between men (even between man and woman), asserting only physical attraction as the only mechanism that binds people together. And like, GTF wrote in his review earlier, this novel is TEDIOUS! The arc from the first igniting of affection in Jim for Bob to the culmination of Jim's search and conquest of Bob at the conclusion is totally circuitous, inefficacious and often at cross-purposes. This novel really could have been a short story since all Jim had to do to find Bob was contact Bob's parents and find out where he was stationed or where he was living. The roundabout search-approach Gore Vidal sets his Jim-character to for seeking out his great love of all time doesn't add up, isn't sensible, and no reason is ever provided as to why the obvious solution wasn't possible at the start.The error I feel the earlier reviewer makes is solely that this novel belongs to a certain time-period, that it is somehow dated, and that gay encounters aren't conducted any more today in the manner Gore Vidal portrayed them in 1948. I wholly beg to differ. Not everybody lives in the Castro of San Francisco, California circa 2012. There are plenty of \\"down-low\\" types to be found all across America, along with the hypocrisy and attempts at \\"passing for straight.\\" That's why this novel is still relevant today -- in terms of portraying gay types of a very specific sort. Even the references to Stalin, Trotskyites and Communism aren't dated. We have a Communist president. We still have Jews posing as white race actors. Most of the Republican Party today consists of Trotskyites. The Democrats pretty much are all Communistic or communitarians. Communism today exists; it just goes by another name: Globalism and/or International Jewry.As a historical document, this novel is very prescient.I will say it was the ending of this novel that was the most clever thing and the most surprising thing about it. Reading this novel was largely, however, a masochistic (tedious and frustrating) experience -- with a satisfying, final, sadistic punch, however unethical. The reader finally doesn't feel victimized by Gore Vidal's scheme for this novel."},{"Title":"The city and the pillar","review":"Gore Vidal writes with great wit and perfect timing. I laughed often, and often re-read whole paragraphs or pages, savoring each sentence. The story is straightforward and the plot was complex enough to keep me guessing, yet very well tied together. I was gripped, felt present in every scene, and loved the spare and simple prose.Other reviewers have correctly described the writing style as \\"spare\\". Not all writers do great job with subtle understatement, and not all readers respond to that style of writing. Vidal fans might love this book as an example of the writer's earliest style of prose. As a first-time reader of Vidal (finally!), I think this book is a masterpiece. It far outshines almost any other work of fiction I can think of whose main character is a gay man, and -- from reading the other reviews -- I can see that it has a wide appeal. Some -- not all -- of its themes are universal.Dated? The book is set in the years following 1940. Several other reviewers found the plot boring or dated, stereotypical with undeveloped characters, and containing prose not erudite or \\"literary\\" enough. Seeing such complaints makes me understand that not all readers will enjoy this book, and that some could find that the story -- a young man coming to terms with his romantic and sexual attractions to men -- \\"has been done before\\". Except that in 1948, it largely hadn't. Thousands of gay-themed works of fiction have been published since then, but precious few are still being sought out by a wide audience of readers. Like a classic painting, this book is the real article, one of the original works. For those who appreciate, it is very highly enjoyable read.The story takes place in a stunning variety of locations and settings. Vidal, being only 20 or 21 when he wrote this book, must have possessed a wisdom far beyond his tender years. The story begins in his final year of high school but moves forward on board a merchant marine ship, in Hollywood as a tennis coach to movie stars, on to Merida where he becomes a hanger-on to a wealthy woman wintering in the Yucatan, then into military service in the World War II and beyond. The writer sure knew his history even at that young age.It seems a waste that Vidal was apparently blacklisted for several years after publishing this work. His eventual success is easy to understand, though I have read that his later works suffer from an over-wrought, too-erudite style of writing. I'm about to find out for myself, having so thoroughly enjoyed this book, The City and the Pillar. I'm glad I bought this on Amazon.I recommend to those readers who preview books before buying, and who do not like Chapter One, to preview well into Chapter Two before giving up. You will see early signs of this author's capacity to write great fiction. I hope he has not gotten all over-wrought and excessively erudite in his later works."},{"Title":"The city and the pillar","review":"Vidal was 20 when he wrote this coming-of-age novel, set in a post-war America when the word homosexual conjured netherworlds of perversion and depravity. The feat here isn't the author's frankness or even the skill he uses to convey the character's self-lacerating observations(and what a bunch!). Maybe d&eacute;j&agrave; vu is the word for it: Vidal's hero grows in increments until what emerges is a clear-eyed, honest look at one man coming to terms, a coming out whose hills and valleys remains emotionally indistinguishable from the lives of gay men today."},{"Title":"The city and the pillar","review":"In the world of arts and letters euphemisms such as \\"trail blazing\\" and \\"groundbreaking\\" are too often bandied about by over reaching publicists and press agents. In the case of Gore Vidal's gay-lit classic \\"The City and the Pillar\\" (which is being reissued this December by Vintage International), these phrases seem like understatements.Reading this novel again after more then twenty years, I was moved by the clarity and brevity of the prose. Vidal doesn't mince words, but rather cuts to the heart of the matter - Jim Willard is in love with Bob Ford. What bigns as simple boyhood buggery, develops into an all consuming passion, sadly unrequited and ultimately tragic.By tackling a subject considered taboo, Vidal exposed various aspects of the homosexual psyche and the underground gay community as they existed in the 1940s. Readers will note the influence this once shocking work has had on a number of contemporary writers. Vidal remains both a maverick and literary hero."},{"Title":"The city and the pillar","review":"An interesting---even bracing---view in this 1948 novel about gay life in America, and the obstacles and subterfuges that had to go with it then, if one was to have intimate relations."},{"Title":"The city and the pillar","review":"While certainly not earth-shattering by today's standards of maze-like plot twists and forced eccentricity this novel is a reflection of its era, and an incredibly brave one at that. I found it to be an honest depiction of a floundering youth struggling to come to terms with his homosexuality in a time that offered him no real support to speak of, neither \\"will nor grace\\",let alone the wealth of information and services available nowadays accessible to young techno-proficient gays. I found this book a pleasant diversion,sometimes sad, and sometimes laugh out loud humorous.I admire Gore Vidal for his daring in a time when few, if any, writers dared touch this subject, when the whole culture was dripping with disapproval of homosexuality. I don't think this book will ever die. (And one more comment: the cover is strikingly handsome! Wheoever designed it should win an award.)"},{"Title":"The city and the pillar","review":"Once in a while I succumb to the urge to read a \\"hot\\" gay book, but am often disappointed in newer books that feature a lot of over-the-top sex but little character development or narrative. Then I pick up a book like this and get carried away by the story (this one has practically no sex in it). Vidal's tale of a man struggling with being attracted to other men, yet not fitting the 1940's stereotype of the limp-wristed queen, is compelling. It follows this character through a 7 or 8 year period and other characters drift in and out of the story as he matures and accepts his own nature. Recommended unless you're strictly looking for hot over-the-top sex."},{"Title":"The city and the pillar","review":"This slim novel was undoubtedly trailblazing as a 1948 pulpy attempt at serious fiction examining, from an insider's perspective, the post-War gay oppression in the US. The attempt is awkward-- the writing is simplistic, the characters are thin-to-cardboard, the settings are, by now, hoary. The protagonist is a kind of gay Forrest Gump as he moves through all the relevant sociological locations as they are checked off, including small-town alienation, high-seas departure from home, Hollywood queerdom, WWII servicemen and their off-duty haunts, post-War Greenwich Village, etc. The protagonist is surprisingly untouched by all these events unfolding as he is in the right place to allow the author to make the right observations: he receives no parental rejection, he is not gay-bashed in his misguided overtures, he faces no combat during his enlistment, etc. His dilemmas are as much existential as they are products of his time (can I ever find someone to love rather than use?).Despite Vidal's erudite later remarks in the press about not viewing sexuality in categories, at this early stage he barters in virtually every gay stereotype such as trade, queens, hags, married closet cases, studio-arranged marriages, and most importantly, not a single longterm gay relationship. The one break with mid-century cliche is the disturbing ending. This ending recasts everything that went before into a sociopathic delusion and leaves a sour taste. Turns out he was less Forrest Gump and more Lovelace. Definitely not up to Vidal's later writing standards. For a more skillful tale of these events, try Mordden's \\"How Long Has This Been Going On.\\""},{"Title":"The city and the pillar","review":"First rate treatment of young gay love in the 50's"},{"Title":"The city and the pillar","review":"this is a great book even though i myself is not gay.it moves kinda slow with a booming end. try it."},{"Title":"The city and the pillar","review":"Prior to this the only Vidal book I had read was Palimpsest in which he laments over and over that &quot;no one reads literature anymore.&quot; Since I tend to agree, I decided to read this, his first published novel. I did not find it to be geat literature. Unfortunately it read like a Valley of the Dolls with a Homosexual protagonist. There was no deplth to the characters, no great literary style, The characters were all cliches. I had hoped for more. Since he was young when he wrote it, I'll give him the benefit of the doubt and try just one more of his works, but I'm sceptical."},{"Title":"The city and the pillar","review":"[...]In \\"The City and the Pillar\\" Vidal makes every symbol a bludgeon and beats his readers over the head with it. (Hint: the pillar is a phallic symbol!)The structure of the novel is practically outlined in bullet-points before each chapter. When, at the climactic moment he tells us that the circle is complete (actual phrase!) and that this is the climax of the novel, I threw the book at the wall.The book might be appropriate as a Young Adult novel for a struggling gay teenager reading years below his or her grade level, but I'd hesitate there too. It's got all the nuance and subtelty of a YA novel, but it really does try to be an actual piece of literary fiction. Shame, because it could almost be a decent after-school special."},{"Title":"The city and the pillar","review":"Maybe it is because I was denied reading \\"The City and the Pillar\\" for fifteen years, but I really enjoyed this. I fully appeciated the era in which the book was written and the consequences suffered by Vidal, who had to give up novel-writing for a decade after the publication of novel, which portrayed The Love That Dares Not Speak Its Name. This was considered rank heresy at the time.After discovering Gore Vidal's books in college (on my own, without the recommendation of professors), I learned that he wrote \\"The City and the Pillar.\\" Having no idea then what it was about, I asked an English professor, who remembered it being about homosexuals, and advised against my bothering with it, since it would be a bad influence. Of course, this whet my appetite.Next, I searched for this book in the campus library, unsuccessfully. Then I visited the local city library--nada. Then I searched in other college libraries...in bookstores...other city libraries... you get the drift. It became clear to me this book was Entirely Disapproved Of and Censored.Over a decade later, with the advent of Amazon, I finally found a copy for sale and eagerly ordered it. I was not in the slightest disappointed, even though I am not unaware of its defects, as listed by reviewer \\"GFT\\", whose review I marked Helpful. Obviously, Jim, an athlete of average intelligence, is not the most interesting character to grace the pages of fiction. But Jim does not have to be. Personally, I did not care about any of the characters in the novel! Jim is merely the vehicle through which we examine, deplore, and admonish the American homosexual underground of the 1940s. This book is a time machine to another era, much like Vidal's other works.Vidal offers faint praise for his \\"kindred\\" (for lack of a better word), but that is his way, and his attitude is the same toward almost any kind of people throughout his entire works. Vidal finds fault first; then reluctantly admits a few good points. I have grown used to his style over the years and take it in stride. He tries to be honest and frequently is.I take exception with reviews that find this novel stupid or only for Young Adults or whatever; simply unjustified and reflective of a disappointment in finding little erotic or romantic content. Indeed, this is neither Eros' nor Aphrodite's playhouse, and do NOT purchase with such an expectation! Despite the subject matter, it is rather tame by all standards.Well-worth reading, as well as Vidal's seven early short stories."},{"Title":"The city and the pillar","review":"While reading this apparent classic, first published yearsago, I was surprised, because it seemed so contemporary.Apparently this novelette was one of the first to deal withhomosexuality in 'normal', untainted youths. In any case,I liked the spare prose, which suggesteda documentary, which both suited and clarified the centralcharacter of Jim. The images that the book invokes areclean-edged, there is very little that is extravagant des-cription. The basic story is of Jim and Bob, two youthsthat find passion on the last day of Bob's last year ofhigh school. Jim is changed by this experience, and therest of the novel details his search for Bob, or for thesort of wholeness being with Bob gave him. Ultimately, thejourney ends tragically, after Jim has experienced a numberof relationships, but while he is still in his early 20s.I found the tone of the novel to be bleak, a numbed journeyfrom hope and optimism into nihilism at the end. Becauseof the very simplicity of the story, I didn't think it mademuch impression on me while reading. However, I now findmyself continually thinking of Jim and his life and it seemsthe story has indeed got to me. I can't describe what itis, but the tale has left me empty and feeling agreat deal of pity and empathy for Jim and what will happento him afterwards. There are some glorious moments in thebook, and the multitude of personalities in the gay worldthat Vidal illustrates are varied and non-stereotypical,surprising for a book written before supposedly'enlightened' times. I recommend this book, as it isa fascinating read, one thatcontinues to haunt the readerlong after the conclusion."},{"Title":"The city and the pillar","review":"Originally published in 1948, THE CITY AND THE PILLAR is generally considered the first mainstream American novel to place gay men and their lives and loves at dead center of the story. As such, it receives a tremendous amount of attention from critics and historians. Still, for all the stir it caused at the time (most newspapers wouldn't review or advertise it and many bookstores refused to carry it), it is more interesting for its history than for itself.The story concerns Jim, an all-American boy from Virginia, who has a sexual encounter with classmate Bob just before Bob graduates from highschool and leaves town &quot;to go to sea.&quot; This is Jim's first same-sex encounter, and with classic adolescent innocence he concludes that he and Bob are spiritual &quot;twins.&quot; As soon as he graduates, Jim goes in search of Bob on the assumption that Bob feels the same--and driven by this obsession he too &quot;goes to sea,&quot; and moves from port to port and eventually from relationship to relationship in search of his ever-elusive lost love.In a sense, THE CITY AND THE PILLAR gives us a window on what it must have been like to have been a young gay man in this era; at first Jim has absolutely no frame of reference for his sexuality, and when he begins to discover that men who have sex with men are not uncommon he resists thinking of himself as &quot;one of those.&quot; But the overwhelming problem with the novel is that Jim is not a greatly interesting person, nor is Bob, nor are any of the people that Jim encounters while he looks for Bob. It soon becomes difficult to care about Jim, much less about whether or not he will ever find Bob and what will happen if he does.Vidal himself was not greatly happy with the novel as it was published in 1948, and he rewrote it for a 1960s reprint. (The original 1948 version, which has a very different ending and slightly different tone, is no longer widely available.) But in rewriting the novel, Vidal did not go far enough: the characters are just as tedious in the second version as they were in the first. While I applaud Vidal for taking on such then-hot subject matter, I can't really praise what he did with it either originally or in the rewrite. Fortunately, if you feel you must read the novel due to its historical significance, it is fairly short--and that, really, is the best thing I can say for it.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"The city and the pillar","review":"Certainly, as other reviews have pointed out, 'The City and the Pillar' is notable because of its social significance; it was published in 1948 -- a time when homosexuality was still relegated to the fringes of society, so the last place you would expect to see it is in a novel. Gore Vidal put homosexual life out there for everyone to see, and if the picture that he paints isn't a pretty one consider that life for a gay man in that time period wasn't exactly peaches and cream. To start with, Vidal's portrayal of his protagonist, Jim Willard, is mightily restrained. There is a distance between Jim and the reader that at first seems cold, but is somewhat fitting when one considers that there is a distance between Jim's wants and needs that he is completely unable to reconcile. He's not warm and cuddly because he just doesn't understand who he is, and while he delves into the gay society of the time he can't help but mock it because he doesn't want to think of himself as part of it. Jim is constantly trying to rationalize his sexual behavior so that he won't have to believe that he is like the other gay men he meets. If he could bring himself to have a straight relationship he would -- as evinced by his continued friendship with Maria Verlaine. But Jim isn't straight, and putting on airs only makes him dislike himself even more. One could wish that Vidal had put a more humanized, relatable character at the forefront of his novel, but it just wouldn't have been so honest -- which Vidal undoubtedly understood, being a gay man living at the time.Vidal, in addition to putting homosexuality into mainstream consciousness, acknowledged the stereotypes that have been attributed to gay men whilst taking a sledge-hammer to them at the same time. There was a pervading sense in Jim's time (and there still is today) that to be a gay man is to be feminine. Sure enough, there are feminine gay men populating Vidal's novel, but there are numerous masculine men that you wouldn't expect to be gay -- Jim included. Jim is an ace tennis player whose sculpted body and masculine features attract girls in droves, which for a long time helps feed Jim's denial of who he is. He didn't think he could possibly be gay because he wasn't 'girly', but by the end of the novel he has realized that, just like every other type of person, gay people come in all shapes and sizes. \\"Obviously the world was not what it seemed. Anything might be true of anybody,\\" he notes at one point. This is also reflected in Jim's ventures into Hollywood and New York's high society. In Hollywood he has a relationship with Ronald Shaw, a mega-watt movie star who must hide his homosexual dalliances from the public in order to keep getting parts. At parties in New York Jim meets countless gay intellectuals who casually pretend not to know him when they run into each other in restaurants and such -- 'straight' locations where it would be too dangerous for them to reveal their link to each other. There is a lot of mask-wearing that goes into gay life in Jim's time, and he is no exception.Through it all Jim is waiting to reconnect with his childhood friend, Bob Ford -- with whom Jim had his first homosexual experience in one surprising moment after Bob's graduation from high school. The moment has become hopelessly idealized in Jim's mind, and in his desperation to not see himself as part of gay society he continues to place what happened between them on higher, and more precarious, pedestals. He is convinced that when they meet up again (Bob went to sea after graduation, and the two lost touch) they will instantly resume their relationship; it never occurs to him that Bob might not feel the same way.Which leads us to the ultimate tragedy in 'The City and the Pillar': that to be gay in society was to be doomed to a life on the margins, to be misunderstood, to have to hide who you really are from your family, to live a life of unhappiness because of your unfulfilled dreams, and to hate yourself for not conforming to the \\"normal\\" life you were assigned at birth. It may be bleak, but the triumph of Vidal's masterpiece is that he successfully humanizes this tragedy to the reader. No one who reads it can deny that Jim is a real, valuable human being who deserves a life of his own, and that is what makes 'The City and the Pillar' a classic along the lines of 'Uncle Tom's Cabin', and in my opinion just as culturally significant.For another perspective on this subject, albeit an inferior one, I would recommend checking out Carson McCullers' violent 1941 novellaReflections in a Golden Eye.Grade: A-"},{"Title":"The city and the pillar","review":"I just finished The City and the Pillar. I was up until the wee hours to finish it. Recently I've been making my way through the \\"gay\\" classics - City of Night, The Farewell Symphony - and now this little, concise Vidal treat.I usually read the reviews of a book to see what the general story is about and to decide whether or not I might be interested. I had heard so much about this book that I was going to read it no matter what. A few reviews I read said The City and the Pillar wasn't \\"literary\\" enough, not full of blooming phrases, semi-colons and powerful metaphors. Others I read said that it was \\"simple\\", lacking in complex character development but still a reputable time-capsule from the old gay world.The City and the Pillar is a quick read, but hardly lacking in beautiful phrasing and character development. This was one of the best books I read this year. Just like Brokeback Mountain (both book and movie), it deals with what it's like to realize you are gay, \\"normal\\" and just looking for love. Jim, the antihero, doesn't want to fall in with the \\"queens\\" and instead continues to dream about a childhood friend that for one night became more than a friend. This is his ideal and he can't find it in the gay world, partly because it doesn't exist in the gay world or any other - it exists solely in his adolecent mind from long ago, a mind that has churned one night with his best friend into something completely unattainable - at least with that same childhood friend.This is a beautiful book, full of hope."},{"Title":"The city and the pillar","review":"Reading Gore Vidal can be challenging. Over the years I've read his LINCOLN and also 1876. But I read both books, fortunately, with a fair amount of knowledge of the subject matter. Currently I'm reading BURR and once again I'm going in with a fair amount of knowledge of the subject and enjoying it. Vidal's almost snob appeal that his readers has knowledge of the subject has caused me to shy away from most of his works. Lacking some background the reader ends up confused and wondering if the book is worth the effort.In reading a biographical note on Vidal I noted this early work THE CITY AND THE PILLAR and its success and controversy in the late 1940's. Noting the short length of the book and availability in the public library I decided to give it a try and I'm very glad that I did. Unlike his later works it is straight forward and easy to read.In reading the book I got the same sense that I have when watching a movie from the 1940's. It's seeing life during an earlier people of American history.As one of the critics noted the book is not BROKE BACK MOUNTAIN - but it would be a very interesting project for someone to read the two books and two a contrast and comparison. In my opinion Vidal handles the subject matter with class and sophistication. When you consider the book in the context of the late 1940's its pretty amazing.Lots of things have been said about THE CITY AND THE PILLAR by other reviewers. But there are a couple of universal themes that comes across in the book that have nothing to do with the fact that the central character is gay. One of the themes is happiness and finding it within yourself. Jim, Shaw, Maria, Sullivan all seem to seek happiness in a relationship before they find happiness within them selves and there in lies the tradegy of their lives.As to Jim, he's the tragic figure who searches for love in one person and when he finally reunites with Bob, he is rejected. In a sense its the old adadge \\"be careful what you wish for.\\" In retrospect if Jim had enjoyed the moment with Bob and accepted the fact that it was a passing interlude and moved on, his life would have been entirely different.Perhaps the message all these years later is found in the comments of one of the minor characters, Bob's wife, who says to the shock of her contemporaries that she would rather have a husband who has had several affairs and essentially knew what he wanted out of life, before he settles down. In essence she is saying marry someone who knows what he or she wants out of life - a message that was clearly lost on Jim's mother who spent a life time with a man that she did not love. The irony is that while she is willing to concede that part of Bob's character, she seems unwilling to let him follow his dream and remain at sea.We don't know what happens to the tragic Jim at the close of the novel? Will he go back to New York and continue in his same life style. Will be become like the aged gay men that the young Jim meets in bars and salons? Did Bob go back to sea, his dream, or settle down to sell insurance like his wife's family wants him to do? These are only questions for speculation. One can only hope that the characters would find happiness.This would be a great book for a book club. The discussions and the universal theme could create hours of dicussion. For me it was well worth the read."},{"Title":"The city and the pillar","review":"Jim Willard spends a final weekend with his friend Bob Ford at a cabin before Bob heads off to sea, like they talked abouts. They're very close friends, and during this weekend of horseplay and relaxation, Jim and Bob take it to the next level. Before they leave the cabin, Jim promises to hook up with Bob once he's graduated. A year later, and with the memory of that weekend at the cabin still floating through his mind, Jim sets off to find the elusive love of his llfe, going to see, becoming ensnared in the glitz of Hollywood, traveling to South America, but clinging to his love for Bob and never letting himself fall completely for any other men.This novel beautifully tells the story of a young man's search for the ideal person -- or who he thinks is the ideal -- one who is in tune with him in every way. The characters are all well-written, and you really feel that you are right alongside Jim as he makes his way through the world.In the introduction, Vidal talks about how he re-wrote the entire book after its initial publication due to public reaction to the original, tragic ending. The re-written ending, I feel, is much stronger and shows what happens when the ideal becomes tarnished in the idolizer's eyes. It's a remarkable book that discusses homosexuality in a very open way for a novel from 1945. A thoroughly enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The city and the pillar","review":"The first time I read &quot;The City And The Pillar&quot; I was less than blown away. Vidal presents us with a story of first love and passion, but he tells it somewhat dispassionately. The ending in particular did not jive with the nature of the characters. Time passed without me thinking much of this novel until I read &quot;Palimpsest&quot; (Vidal's Memoirs). Palimsest introduces us to the real characters behind TC&amp;TP. I gained a whole new angle to view Maria Verlain with the revelation that she was/is Anias Nin. Likewise, I was introduced to Jimmie Trimble, Vidal's best friend (in Plato's sense of the word) and first love. Jimmie is much more real in &quot;Palimpsest&quot; and I found it difficult not fall in love with him myself, a feeling the characters in TC&amp;TP never inspired. I don't want this to sound like I'm putting down TC&amp;TP, I'm not. I just want to convey that the story was exponentially more powerful and moving after I read &quot;Palimpsest.&quot; I do recomend this book, but only after reading Vidal's memoirs. The real Jimmie is infinitely more beautiful than the Jimmie Vidal morphed into fiction."},{"Title":"The city and the pillar","review":"When it was published in 1948 (it would be eight years until Baldwin's \\"Giovanni's Room\\" appeared), \\"The City and the Pillar\\" was far ahead of its time in its unapologetic portrayal of its \\"straight-acting,\\" exclusively homosexual protagonist. Yet it's not simply a gay novel; at its core, the novel describes the obsessive pursuit of one's first love. An intense relationship between two youths, Jim Willard and his best friend Bob Ford, turns from emotional to physical for one fleeting night, and the experience leaves Jim in the thrall of an infatuation.When Bob leaves the Southern town of his childhood for a career at sea, Jim's remembrance of their affair transforms it into a far more romantic ideal than its actuality would allow. Jim travels the ports of America hoping to find Bob and rekindle their love; his adventures take him through the various gay urban oases of America, from Hollywood to New Orleans to New York. With an understanding of others that often prevents him from understanding himself, Jim describes the desperate plight he shares with his friends and lovers: \\"I don't think he knows what he wants, like the rest of us.\\"The novel's prose is intentionally sparse, even \\"flat\\" (the word used by Vidal), and it lacks the satirical bite and dry wit of the author's other work. Because it was written sixty years ago, it is of significant historical interest, but (alas) the version in print is the edition revised by Vidal in 1965, when he \\"altered the last chapter considerably [and] rewrote the entire book.\\"I agree with Vidal that the new ending is a better one (although it too closely echoes \\"Myra Breckinridge\\"); nevertheless, we have in our hands not a post-War novel far ahead of its time but a gay bildungsroman hardly exceptional for the 1960s. Fortunately, what Vidal left intact in his revision was the character of Jim himself--surely one of the most tragic antiheroes in modern American literature, a man whose outward simplicity belies a profound understanding of the world around him. What ultimately dooms Jim is not his sexual awakening but his unrealistic pursuit of an unattainable ideal."},{"Title":"The city and the pillar","review":"When Thomas Mann read The City and the Pillar he wrote Vidal a short and succinct polite statement thanking him for the copy - in it he misspelled his named. Unbeknownst to Vidal however was the profound effect the novel had on Mann which only came to light through the publication of his personal diaries after his death.Indeed, The City and the Pillar is an extraordinary feat by Gore Vidal. Written when he was only 21 years old, the context of the book was progressive and ground breaking at the time because it portrayed homosexuality as a pervasive and natural thing and also the protagonist as a masculine straight acting athlete.The narrative follows Jim Wallard through his coming of age journey in which his ultimate goal in life is to find and reunite with his childhood friend and lover Bob. Throughout the book you gauge the slow passage of time and Jim's extreme patience and loneliness - the thing that keeps him flowing is the definite hope he has that his eventual reunion with Bob would complete him as a person. In the end the circle is indeed complete but you'll feel an extreme sense of sorrow and pity for Jim as it becomes evident that life can be cruel causing us to foolishly waste time and pursue things that can never be truly ours.The novel is powerful not only because of it redefined history but because its subject matter and embedded metaphors will resonate with many of us in our quest for the unobtainable. Like Jim, how would we know something is unobtainable if we don't try? And is it better the try and fail or to not try in fear of wasting precious time? Yet if we don't try how would we ever know? This circular argument is something that will resound within you after completing this powerful work of art."},{"Title":"The Limerick: 1700 Examples, with Notes, Variants and Index","review":"As it says on the cover: &quot;This is the largest collection of limericks ever published, erotic or otherwise.

Following in the tradition of Jesus, Dorothy Day and the Catholic Worker movement, and the Berrigan brothers, Chavez's orientation was biblical to the core. He preached and practiced nonviolent resistance, personal and group sacrifice, the transformative power of love and forgiveness, and individual prayer and meditation as essential tools in working for peace and justice. Unlike so many activists then and now, Chavez wasn't concerned with protesting and demonstrating just to say &quot;No.&quot; More fundamentally, he was interested in working for social and economic conditions that would affirm people with a resounding &quot;Yes!&quot; Chavez's deep faith in God and the Gospel of justice and peace grounded that &quot;Yes&quot; and made it truly prophetic. As he himself said, &quot;What keeps me going? Well, it's like a fire--a consuming, nagging everyday and every-moment demand of my soul to just do it. It's difficult to explain. I like to think it's the good Spirit asking me to do it. I hope so...If you really want something, you have to sacrifice. Because of my faith the concept of sacrifice is understood&quot; (p. 162).This is a must-read for anyone who yearns to integrate a passion for social justice with a deep, mystical faith in God. Cesar showed us, as all genuine mystics do, that the two are not only incompatible but necessarily conjoined. Dalton's sensitive and well-written study has done Chavez proud."},{"Title":"The Moral Vision of Cesar Chavez","review":"Cesar Chavez has been likened to the American Gandhi, using the powerful tools of nonviolence, including fasting with prayer and mass mobilizations, to affect political change, labor rights and human rights for his people, our people, for Americans now again forgotten, rejected, despised, blockaded, dispossessed. We need him now. We need him again. Read this book. Be him now.Published by the excellent Catholic printing house Orbis Books, this biography was written by a professor of moral theology at Holy Rosary College in San Jose who briefly and intermittently volunteered for the UFW after the death of Cesar Chavez, whom he had seen once deliver a speech.I met Mr. Chavez a few times nearly twenty five years ago at Mass in the tiny chapel of the Maryknoll House in Manhattan, as he was visiting during conferences in New York. Mr. Chavez was ever a faithful and a profoundly practicing Catholic, inspired by our Faith to work for peace and justice and labor and human rights for the most poor and despised, just as Our Holy Father His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI recently exhorts us in Sacramentum Caritatis: el Sacramento de la Caridad: una Exhortacion Apostolica Postsinodal that the Eucharist in itself compels us to alter the unjust economic structures which entrap so many of us in desparate poverty.Ceasr Chavez therefore inspires and guides all Americans and all Catholics in the true realization of living our Faith integrally. Professor of Moral Theology Dalton here examines deeply the life of Mr. Chavez, exploring his moral vision and his true path in Faith.Briefly the professor sums up this intense and real moral vision thusly:\\"Cesar's moral vision centered on sacrificial service, solidarity through voluntary poverty, nonviolent confrontation, and faith in God and others. These virtues shaped the identity and character of the union community just as they shaped Cesar's own identity and character. These characteristics were from Cesar's perspective, non-negotiable (p. 152).\\"I fonud the references to the great Bishops Connelly and Curtis of Connecticut tantalizing yet welcome. Despite the revised Code of Canon Law's bias which might throw cold water on such faith necessities, they performed truly Catholic work in line with Pope Leo the Great's famous encyclical Rerum Novarum, a courageous labor which may be studied more fully and thus usefully at Cesar Chavez, the Catholic Bishops, and the Farmworkers' Struggle for Social Justice. We need them and their truly Catholic hierarchical witness and orthopraxis and deeply moral vision and integral living of our Faith now more than ever."},{"Title":"George Raft","review":"I have been in love with George Raft from the moment I first saw him in \\"Manpower\\", and this book just made me love him more!His story is poignant because he seemed to have been a man who truly had so much to give to the right woman but was barred from that all his life because of a greedy, clutching estranged wife.I loved reading his own accounts of his life, his loves, his behind-the-scene accounts during the making of his films.I admired the fact that he was such a gentleman, never resorting to bad-mouthing those who were his antagonists. The man had class with a capital \\"C\\". He did not turn his back on his friends, many of whom were big names in organized crime, and stood by them, in spite of Hollywood's trepidation and warnings. He was a true man who stood by his own code.His sexual prowess was intriguing reading, but was delightfully pretty much what I would have suspected, as his physical chemistry has always been so overpowering and alluring. The accounts of his intimate encounters and relationships were exactly as my fantasies had always portayed them to be.I relished the author's insight and portrait of what made George Raft click---his surprising lack of self esteem which pursued him all his life. His amazing generosity and sensitive heart. His gritty determination and ability for survival during a crazy days of 20's; his screen image cementing during the 30's into the most mermorable \\"gangster\\" of all time; his leading man image of the 40's; and his gradual decline afterwards.If you are a George Raft fan (and even if you're not) this biography is fantastic reading and an intimate portrait of one of the sexiest, vital and sensitive actors in film history."},{"Title":"George Raft","review":"The biography, although not totally accurate when reciting Raft's early existency (no Raft biography is), is heartfelt and insightful in explaining the motivations behind one of the most interesting figures of the 21st century.

It was part of a deep rooted psyche - of notwanting to be identified in the public's mind with his criminal associations.I have always loved George Raft - he always struck me as a really genuine guy. This book iswritten with his co-operation and there are some quite funny stories he remembers. Isuppose because of Raft's imput, there isn't really an indepth look at why he did some ofthe things he did. Why did he marry Grace Mulrooney - the woman who completely wreckedhis personal life. He thought she was a sweet kid but she was anything but and it didn'ttake him long to realise it.Her not allowing him a divorce changed his life and after a few lengthy affairs (Virginia Pine, even Norma Shearer and Betty Grable, whom the book quotes as saying \\"I would have married him on our first date\\") settled into a life of mostly one night stands. I found that part of the book very sad - that he wasn't able to live the normal life he so wanted. But this book shows his determination to better himself - initially through dancing. In the 1920s he was the fastest charleston dancer in the world and Fred Astaire thought he was one of the best dancers. Not the definite biography about this complex man but definately worthreading for some of Raft's personal, racier stories."},{"Title":"George Raft","review":"Factual and insightful biography of George Raft.

With its artistically aged sign and poster of the Roman Coliseum and the Acropolis, not as look now, but as they looked when new, Arden St. Clare couldn't resist investigating. The proprietor assures her the time-travel agency will only be there a week, &quot;depending on whether the solar winds stay calm.&quot; He recommends the Regency period, a time of romantics and rebels.Arden has dreamed for years about living out just one of her fantasies. An orphan, her aunt and uncle would not like it if she takes a vacation. They only believe in the pleasure of making more money. St. Claires would never ride in Mardi Gras parades or rub elbows with movie stars. They would behave as tradition behooves. So time-travel offers the perfect solution! She can be carefree and reckless, and the St. Claires will never know. Her antics won't disrupt the New Orleans's upper crust, or her family business.Unfortunately, solar flares throw the trip off a bit, and she lands in the right time, wrong place.Dropped off, the proprietor and the time-travel shop disappear before Arden can ask any questions. She walks through the woods, pausing when she hears angry voices. Two men are leaving a young duke, dosed with laudanum to freeze to death in the woods. Rescuing the boy after they leave, Arden takes him to a nearby cottage to spend the night. The next morning, a searching uncle discovers them. Rather than a season among London's high society, Arden finds herself in the company of the young duke and his uncles. Captain Royce Warrick, a hero of the Battle of Waterloo, is terribly suspicious of Arden and how she came to be in the middle of woods. Someone has made several attempts on his nephew's life. Royce can't decide if Arden is friend or foe, yet he can't deny his attraction for this unusual woman.Arden's struggle with the language and the conventions of the time is humorous, while her cheerful attitude and flair keep the novel moving along quickly. Linda Kay does a remarkable job of making the impossible not only plausible, but also delightful in the plotting of this memorable tale. If you read only one time travel novel this year, make it TO TAME A ROGUE"},{"Title":"To Tame A Rogue (Zebra Time Travel Historical Romance)","review":"What a fabulous book! Linda Kay's TO TAME A ROGUE had me laughing out loud and was the perfect way to spend a lazy, rainy afternoon. I can't wait to read more by this writer."},{"Title":"To Tame A Rogue (Zebra Time Travel Historical Romance)","review":"Thoroughly enjoyed this story & its sequel \\"To charm a knight\\". A very unusal premise in that it is a time-travel agent who is a wizard from the 19th. century, takes you to where you want to go in his shop \\"Any time, any place\\". And it only costs $1,000,000 to find your hearts desire."},{"Title":"To Tame A Rogue (Zebra Time Travel Historical Romance)","review":"Unique way to time travel; a time travel agency! I liked much of this story. It involves a very young duke, the nephew of our hero. Someone is trying to kill him and our heroine and hero become involved in trying to find out who that is.What bothered me was that Arden (our time traveler) felt the only way to make Royce learn to have fun again was to seduce him. I found that thinking flawed and was disappointed when he finally succumbed to her - after all he was trying to be honorable and true to his betrothed. Plus Royce was worried about who was trying to do away with the duke (his 12 year old nephew William). I felt there were other ways to help remember more carefree times... Both Arden and Royce seemed a bit shallow - I found no depth to them!Other characters in the book were interesting. Giles and the Dowager Duchess, Dora, were well fleshed out and their romance was actually better than the \\"main\\" event. Arden's Aunt Lavinia added a nice touch to the story.All loose ends were tied up much too quickly, plus Arden was too modern throughout the book - I think she would have been rejected by everyone in society for her shocking ways --Good for a quick read, not a keeper."},{"Title":"The Temporal Logic of Reactive and Concurrent Systems: Specification","review":"This book provides a very good introduction to concurrent systems and specifications. However, new or used it's certainly not worth 100$ or more. As a used book I wouldn't pay any more than 25$ for it."},{"Title":"The Diluvian Impact: The Great Flood Catastrophe 10,000 Years Ago As the Consequence of a Comet's Impact","review":"The author is far closer than he realizes on some points, but he misses on the key points. This book is mainly a collection of ancient stories and myths relating to the flood of Noah. It is a good source book for finding flood legends from around the world, along with some interesting interpretations about how the ancient stories all point to the same event. The main short coming of the book is its the failure to trust the accuracy of the most reliable of all flood accounts, the bible. The theory put forward by the author is that 10,000 years ago the earth was hit by a number of comet fragments which triggered huge waves and other destructive events that are what is behind many of the flood or cataclysm myths nearly all ancient cultures tell of. The book does not support a global deluge, but does present evidence supporting a recent world wide disaster. The book is interesting in that it is written by someone who doesn't believe in the flood or the bible, and yet feels the evidence overwhelmingly points towards a recent world wide disaster of which there where few survivors. For coming so close, I felt this book deserved two stars despite its short comings."},{"Title":"Making the minister smile","review":"I bought this book thinking that it would be at least enjoyable as the author's first novel - The Inscrutable Americans. It has turned out to be a complete waste of time. The dialogue is unbelievably juvenile and the plot tests the willing suspension of disbelief to the fullest.The 'efforts' of Chris the American collaborator of an Indian firm manufacturing plastic buckets to step in and 'help' in overcoming labor problems at the Indian factory are so thinly stretched as to want to throw this book away...and to think that trees were felled for printing this!The book is replete with beaten-to-death misconceptions and generalizations of Americans and Indians. To give one example American football players have I.Q's of retarded clams and Indians are disorderly in almost all that they do.The book miserably fails at entertaining or informing. Avoid this book and save on all scores."},{"Title":"Making the minister smile","review":"Attention! Attention! All those who plan to pick up this book, Halt!Stop right there! The blurb leads you to believe this is an original plot,that might hold promise. But the book lets you down so badly, you feel angry at yourself for wasting your time. Chris Stark is an American footballer who worries that his Indian partner Ajay Kapoor has a serious labour problem in his factory and feels as a &quot;friend&quot; he must try and help. But, he doesn't have a single guilt pang about &quot;doing&quot; Ajai 's fiance at every opportunity he can get!!The dialogue is shallow, observations about Indians even more so.(Indians give the best parties, Indians leave no parking space for their guests..oh puhleeze grow up!). Then there's a bizzarre angle about apparitions appearing every now and then before Chris...which is explained towards the end as a plot by international intelligence agencies!It is such a convoluted and juvenille sub plot that you check the cover again in disbelief that it's written by an author who's first book apparently is the highest selling Indian novel!The book is full of incidents and assumptions that a Delhi brat with little sensitivity and exposure will conjure up.For example, we are told all Indian women are now tending to extra marital affairs, men from Patna lech at girls because they are depreived of them in their hick town, Punjabis speak in a particular rhyming way...All this is stuff that any Indian will talk about once in a while,so there's nothing original about them. Besides, to make generalisations in a novel based on these observations is absolutely immature.The only good point is that the author's got the slimy dialogue between Delhi politicos and businessmen pretty right.But overall it 's a book that shows the author has either not put in enough effort and thought or he is incapable of doing so. Here's an example of a writer who is clearly resting on the past laurels of his first book and feels that should be enough reason for the world to read anything else that he churns out.Don't prove him right!"},{"Title":"Making the minister smile","review":"I read this book expecting that it would be as entertaining as the first book by the same author.It started off reasonably enough, and held my interest till I was midway through. Suddenly, though, it's as if the author hit writer's block, or just decided he couldn't be bothered to think anymore.A series of ludicrious plot twists later, the book abruptly ended. It really was abrupt - a bunch of trails led nowhere, a ton of strings left dangling, bizarre twists to the story, and a completely nonsensical end.I don't think I'll be paying for anymore of Mr. Mathur's books for a while.I'd recommend reading this book if someone pays you well to do it - otherwise your time is better spent doing anything else."},{"Title":"Not the salary but the opportunity","review":"This book will enable you to value your integrity by teaching you how to put love and intent in every thing you do so that it is done with the most purest and highest of your energies. The outcome of doing this is like a savings account that will yield greater returns for your future success. Highly inspirational and practical!"},{"Title":"Not the salary but the opportunity","review":"O.S. Marden was one of the original writers of 'success' books. I wish I had access to these when I was young. I have no doubt that my current net worth would be ten to twenty times higher than it is now. His chapter on \\"The salary outside your pay envelope\\" is excellent. \\"One part of this outside salary is the opportunity of the employee to absorb the secrets of his employer's success, and to learn from his mistakes, while he is being paid for learning his trade or profession. The other part, and the best of all, is the opportunity for growth, for development, for mental expansion; the opportunity to become a larger, broader, more efficient man.\\"He goes on to show that people who rise in the world do not focus on just the salary, but on developing character, honor, and integrity. The salary will not get you ahead in life, but what you can learn while you are working will help you to get whatever you desire. My only regret is that his books are so short and to the point. Sun publishing has done us a great service in reprinting some of OSM's books. I highly recommend them.

It was technically just what it said, Interviews with Romance Writers. For some reason it just didn't grab my interest and I ended up scanning it for bit and pieces I liked. I'd recommend to other romance writers to get a peek into the mind of writers. Just not my fave."},{"Title":"Spanish Still Life In The Golden Age 1600-1650","review":"This is one of the best art books I have ever seen. As a still-life painter myself I keep this book nearby at all times for inspiration and just plain enjoyment. It is it written in a clear and informative style, and the lay-out seems to be trying to help you to use the book as easily as possible. The paintings reproduced are of extremely high quality and generous in quantity. All this makes me wish there was a second volume!"},{"Title":"Talks to teachers on psychology: And to students on some of life's ideals","review":"This work is divided into two parts. The first is Talks to Teachers and the second Talks to Students. The talks to teachers are more technical, but they too are in clear, understandable prose. The Talks to Teachers open with a chapter on 'Psychology and the Art of Teaching'. There are also chapters on 'The Stream of Consciousness' ' The Child as a Behaving Organism' ' Education and Behavior' 'The Necessity of Reactions' ' Native Reactions and Acquired Reactions' 'What the Native Reactions are' 'The Laws of Habit' ' The Association of Ideas' ' Interest' 'Attention' 'Memory' ' The Acquistion of Ideas' 'Aperception' 'The Will'. The Talks to Students consists in three essays, 'The Gospel of Relaxation' 'On a Certain Blindness in Human Beings' 'What Makes a Life Significant'.In the first and most scientifically important section I especially took pleasure in the essay on 'Habit' James shows how our habits lead us to action in ways we do not know. And he shows how by putting on auto- pilot of habits many activities we free our minds for new creative efforts in everyday life.Perhaps the most well - known essay is 'On a Certain Blindness in Human Beings' where James teaches the inherent difficulty we have in understanding others perspectives and needs. Always the pluralist, the fox who sees many things, James strongly advocates our greater openness to others, our tolerance for their perspectives and actions as long as they do not damage ours. \\" Now the blindness of human beings is the blindness which we all are afflicted in regard to the feelings of creatures and people different from ourselves.\\"He asks of us a generosity in understanding.He illustrates his thesis by many quotations from literary works, including Tolstoy , whose 'War and Peace' he calls the greatest of all novels, and 'Crossing Brooklyn Ferry' of Whitman.The final essay is \\"What Makes a Life Significant\\" He opens this essay by telling of an incident from his own personal experience in which he spent an enjoyable week at Chattaqua a kind of paradise of reasonable successful rational secure American life. He later reflects however on what he felt missing in it. And this leads him to thoughts about the heroic struggle of life and why our lives seem to need some element of danger and adventure .\\" But what our human emotions seem to require is the sight of the struggle going on.The moment the fruits are being merely eaten, things become ignorble. Sweat and effort, human nature strained to the uttermost and on the rack, yet getting through alive, and then turning its back on success to pursue another more rare and arduous still- this is the sort of thing the presence of which inspires us, and the reality of which seems to be the function of all the higher forms of literature and fine art to bring home to us and suggest.\\"For James the meaning of life is bound up with our action in the heroism of the everyday life struggle. \\"It is the 'exercise of courage patience and kindness' which James sees as most important in giving life meaning.He also speaks in this regard of our acting in 'obedience to a higher ideal' As he understands it Education is a means of mulitplying and enhancing our ideals and thus enriching our lives. \\" And let the orientalists and pessimists say what they will ,thing of deepest- significance in life does seem to be its charactr of progress, or that strange union of reality with ideal novelty which it continues from one moment to another in present\\".James thus provides in his teaching- a philosophy of action for better enabling us to realize our life- goals."}]`),S={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:x},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},F=["disabled"],W={key:0},D={key:1};function H(n,e,s,c,r,i){const m=y("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",M,[(t(!0),a(g,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),p(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",D,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",W,"See more"))],8,F)):b("",!0)])}const E=u(S,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-1eab114e"]]),G=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/40.md","filePath":"quotes/40.md"}'),q={name:"quotes/40.md"},P=Object.assign(q,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(E)]))}});export{G as __pageData,P as default};
