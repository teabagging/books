This is the best book out there on FIGHTING - whether for sport or self protection. The authors really get into the 3 phases of combat (&quot;free-movement&quot;; &quot;the clinch&quot;; and &quot;ground fighting&quot;). There is also some great historical information on the evolution of Jujitsu since the Meiji Restoration, how Judo revolutioned the art, and the innovations since.This book is not full of &quot;how-to&quot; photos, but has more than enough photos to get their points across. I also own Renzo's other book &quot;Brazilian Jiu Jitsu: Theory and Technique&quot;, and it is well laid out with scores of color photos. However, I'd recommend this one, &quot;Mastering Jujitsu&quot;, over his other book or any other Brazilian Jiu Jitsu text.Buy this book."},{"Title":"Mastering Jujitsu (Mastering Martial Arts Series)","review":"Especially division of a fight into phases is very good. Well prepared and easily read book. Alhtough rather an advanced practicionner I am, I have found very good tips. There are not many techniques but I think the purpose of the author is rather giving tactics. Consider that the book does not cost much either."},{"Title":"Mastering Jujitsu (Mastering Martial Arts Series)","review":"If you practice any martial art - not just jiu jitsu - this book deserves your careful study and attention. It is indispensable for anyone who desires a better understanding of unarmed combat between two fighters. The book could just as easily have been entitled \\"Mastering Vale Tudo.\\" Vale tudo (no holds barred fighting) matches and mixed martial arts competitions have been the crucible through which different martial styles have tested themselves for combat effectiveness. These competitions have demonstrated that fighters must understand and be prepared to deal with combat in all of its phases. This book delves deeply into each of these phases and covers such concepts as overall and positional strategy. It also contains chapters on self-defense and training. The chapter on fighting from the clinch alone is worth more than the price of the book. The authors are to be commended for the depth and clarity of their thinking on these subjects and the crystal clear manner in which they articulate their insights. For me, reading this book was a series of \\"eureka!\\" experiences. I suspect that (depending upon your particular martial practice) you will find this book illuminating, insightful, perhaps controversial, but always compellingly thought out and lucidly written. It should change the way that you think about fighting and the way that you train. To my knowledge, there is nothing else like this on the market. It is extraordinary."},{"Title":"Mastering Jujitsu (Mastering Martial Arts Series)","review":"Mastering Jujitsu is an interesting martial art book without gi. At the beggining of the book there are very good chapters about theory and history of Jujitsu and aslo about modern Jujitsu. At the end of the book there is one of the best words I've read about Jujitsu for self-defense. I would like to see this book in next edition with color photos. One of the best on teh market."},{"Title":"Mastering Jujitsu (Mastering Martial Arts Series)","review":"This is the best book I've ever read, period. The way Renzo and John Danaher break down the theory and techniques is amazing. Every BJJ practicioner should read and own this book."},{"Title":"Mastering Jujitsu (Mastering Martial Arts Series)","review":"While this is not the perfect book, I'm giving it five stars because the parts that are good, are awesome and the parts that aren't; aren't that bad.Strong points:-Best theoretical breakdown of Brazilian Jiujitsu in any book I've seen. Clearly explains the theory behind the sport, mma/vale tudo and self defense aspects of Brazilian Jiujitsu.-Clear, engaging writing style. It's not dry in any way, but it's not dumbed down. A page turner.-Good historical breakdown. Some people argue that it's not completely historically accurate, which is a good point (that I'm not qualified to confirm or deny), but it is pretty thorough and is accurate enough for a basic working knowledge of where this stuff comes from.Weak points:-The techniques. There aren't a lot of techniques in here (which is fine by me as I prefer to learn from my teacher, or from books/videos that are more clearly geared towards that end) and the ones that are present are not well photographed. The photos are tough to follow sometimes.All in all, my favorite book out there. Excellent!"},{"Title":"Mastering Jujitsu (Mastering Martial Arts Series)","review":"I found this book interesting. It covers the history behind the art however it does not illustrate a lot of movements. This book contains only the very basic moves a white belt may learn. Honestly if you are thinking about this book, consider a month of lessons and \\"google\\" BJJ and you'll know as much as this book will cover."},{"Title":"Mastering Jujitsu (Mastering Martial Arts Series)","review":"As many other reviewers have noted, the book itself is very history heavy with only a smattering of techniques blended in to keep it interesting. The mistake I made was buying this book in Kindle format because I didn't want to wait for it to ship. In the technique sections, the pictures aren't placed near the techniques they represent. For example, they may be describing how to do an armbar from guard on one page, but the picture that accompanies the text shows up 4 or 5 pages later. Books like this really need to be purchased in the print version. Lesson learned."},{"Title":"Mastering Jujitsu (Mastering Martial Arts Series)","review":"To many, this book was \\"Renzo's long awaited No-Gi book\\" If you're looking for a list of a 200 gi-less technqiues, you'll be disappointed - that book is coming later. But this book is much much more...The book starts with a history of ju jitsu. It places Brazilian jiu jitsu in the context of Judo, Japanese JuJitsu and other martial arts. It then covers the theory of jujitsu, including the various phases of fighting. This background provides a great context or framework to understand techniques. (This is analogous to the economic framework behind financial technqiues)After providing the broad context, the book delves into deeper theory on each general position, along with a few specific techniques. Again, the focus is on frameworks and how to think about positions more than a listing of techniques.The book also contains case studies on various fighters who have learned certain aspects of fighting. Although the book has a jujitsu focus, fighters from other arts such as Mark Coleman and Vanderlei Silva are highlighted. This demonstrates the broad landscape of ideas covered.In summary, this has proven to be a uniquely informative book. The authors use the medium (book versus the common tape format) to convey history and theory that is more difficult to convey in class or on a tape. It's about time that someone wrote it!"},{"Title":"Mastering Jujitsu (Mastering Martial Arts Series)","review":"This is a great book that explains in detail the underlying theory behind Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and ground combat.This is NOT a technique book. While There are pictures of techniques in the book the main idea behind the text is the underlying theory that Ground Fighters need to engage in while fighting.Renzo does a great job of explaining the phases of combat, and details strategy for each of those phases. He also cites examples of current MMA fighters and shows how they apply the principles that he is explaining.This book requires some knowledge of ground grappling to understand the strategy behind what is going on."},{"Title":"Mastering Jujitsu (Mastering Martial Arts Series)","review":"The reviewer who said this book is poorly written and that Reno Gracie can't teach must read a different book than me. Reno (and his co-author) write with grace, precision and clarity. The Gracie family identified and corrected two key weakness of tradional martial arts:1) Lack of ground skills.2) Lack of strategy.Reno wisely points out that powerful punches and kicks are often no use on your back. Many street fights end up on the ground and traditional striking fighters have no idea what to do there. In a real fight that's fatal. BJJ (Brazillian Jujitsu) teaches the ground fighting that (most) traditional martial arts sorely lack.Second, most martial arts dont teach fighting strategy. What do you want to do? How are you going to do it? How will you attack your enemy? How will you win? This leaves people with no idea how to proceed. Chess masters say players with no stategy are just pushing wood. Experienced chess masters know what they want to do from the beginning of the battle until the king is crushed. Without a cohesive strategy you're just flailing around.That said, BJJ isn't perfect. This book fits well into any martial artist's library, but it should be read with a critical eye. The book only covers one on one fighting and says there are no defenses to multiple attackers. That's ridiculous. Traditional kung fu, such as Choy Li Fut and Hung Gar, covers defenses against multiple attackers in depth. Kung Fu techniques were formed in battle, often against multiple opponents. Gracie says multiple times that because they've won a bunch of MMA fights BJJ is clearly superior to other martial arts. That's just dumb. As close as MMA are to real fights, they just aren't the same thing. And to say that kung fu and the like have no value is totally short sighted. He also says that by removing lethal techniques and using only techniques that can be practiced at full power that they created a stronger martial arts form. That's also patently absurd. Deadly or vicious techniques, such as eye goughing, stops, neck strikes, groin strikes, etc, are hard to perform in a real battle, but not impossible. To eliminate them in foolish, because you also eliminate defenses for them. Besides if you blind your opponent and kick him in the jewels, I guarantee that most of his ground grappling goes right out the window.The perfect martial art would be a mixture of striking, deadly techniques and grappling, as well as hard and soft power. Maybe it doesn't exist yet and so we have to pull from multiple sources in order to become complete fighters. This book is a good start for your cross training."},{"Title":"Mastering Jujitsu (Mastering Martial Arts Series)","review":"The book is great for the history of jiujitsu and philosophies of fighting and stuff like that. But if you're hoping to learn a wide range of new techniques, it's not in this book. If you're a blue belt already, or even a white belt like me, you won't learn many new things. Get a better book if you're looking for something that covers moves. This book has very few pictures compared to text."},{"Title":"Mastering Jujitsu (Mastering Martial Arts Series)","review":"Throughout the book the authors confound Brazilian Jiujitsu with competition mixed martial arts. While the it is often used in this sport I understand the importance of bringing it into context however this is really a book about MMA with full section dedicated to concepts and fighting methods that have nothing to do with BJJ. Furthermore, the book is long on the \\"this is why our art is the best\\" arguments that are tacky and dead-ended. We already bought your book, we're interested in BJJ, don't be a egotist about it. To accomplish this end the authors often set up paper arguments in favor of other styles/methods so they can knock them down and \\"prove\\" BJJ's superiority.The one piece I did enjoy was reading about the history and methodological evolution of the art."},{"Title":"Mastering Jujitsu (Mastering Martial Arts Series)","review":"My husband and sons enjoy the book and have been implementing the teachings of it in their Bjj practices!

Nothing too major, but since the photos are identified with only a letter, it was hard to know if you were looking at the proper illustration of the move being described in the text.

I do not know what his formal education was but he is a very educated writer and renzo gracies critical thinking keeps the book interesting at every part."},{"Title":"Mastering Jujitsu (Mastering Martial Arts Series)","review":"What are the three phases in most any fight?1. The Free-Standing phase in which all fights begin, unless the fight is ended quickly by some idiot sucker punching you like a wuss. But this phase covers the ability and freedom the fighters have to punch, kick and back away at will.2. The Clinch. Before a fight gets on the ground, there is a time where the fight gets in a clinch in effort to bring someone to the ground. Unless of course both or one fighter trips. Judoka's [Judo players] are quite good at getting their opponents on the ground since they spend so much time training to do that very thing. One of the primary goals in Judo is to break an opponents Kuzushi. The problem though, is this is usually a small part of any fight and even if you get in a superior position after breaking your opponents balance, you still need to understand the last and probably most important phase, and that is:3. The Ground. Here is where the BJJ shines. This is truly indeed \\"their\\" specialty. This is what they practice, this is what they do. This is why they are so successful.But don't think that all BJJ players want to bring their opponent to the ground, that is not true. In cases where they happen to know their opponents BJJ is equal but has less striking skills, the practitioner may want to keep the fight standing. Or if you are in a real fight and perhaps an opponent pulls a knife of if there is glass all over a cement ground, probably the last place you want to be is rolling around in that.Overall, a very good book, especially in the history of Jujitsu itself. I would be remiss if I didn't mention that this book covers that really well and I found that extremely interesting."},{"Title":"Mastering Jujitsu (Mastering Martial Arts Series)","review":"The condition of the book itself was excellent!

It has a lot of information to offer that I have not seen in any other martial arts book. I find the book to be misnamed however; the core of it is about Brazilian Jujitsu, but it is pretty much about MMA on the whole and not just Jujitsu. One reason why this book is so good is because whenever the authors make a statement, they have a tendency to qualify what they say with either historical reference or indepth explanations. If they tell you to use a certain use technique or not to use a technique, they usually tell you precisely why. In essence, the authors have a very good understanding of unarmed combat and how a fight can unfold; knowing and applying the information in this book can mean the difference between victory and defeat. An ABSOLUTE must for any martial artist, the casual practioner or pro fighter."},{"Title":"Mastering Jujitsu (Mastering Martial Arts Series)","review":"The best book on unarmed single \\"combat\\".

This book shows Leopold in a far wider context. Leopold held many jobs and had many hobbies in his full life: forest ranger, administrator, hunter, game manager, laboratory director, wilderness traveler, professor. Every time he encountered a new situation he thought about it deeply and creatively, and recorded his thoughts in vivid, non-technical essays, many of which are collected in this book.I was particulaly impressed by Leopold's thoughtfullness -- that he reached his conclusions not by following the majority nor by catering to the powerful nor by jerking his knee, but by deep and clear thinking. Reading these essays renders vivid the fact that current public discourse is dominated by power play and snide insults rather than by civil, reasoned debate."},{"Title":"The River of the Mother of God and Other Essays by Aldo Leopold","review":"Readers of outdoor ethics and conservation philosophy have likely seen collections of Aldo Leopold's essays elsewhere, but I doubt you will find a more diverse and wide-ranging collection than this. Browse the brief chronologic summary of his life and then skip the lengthy introduction (for now), and you will get to the meat of this book. It starts with an essay written by Aldo Leopold as a high school student. From there, the path of essays winds its way like a river through his life, with many stops along the way. The reader can see how Mr. Leopold's outlook matured and changed over time; from such things as a letter to a newspaper editor, to my favorite: an introductory lecture from the first college course he taught. What I would give to go back in time and be a student in that classroom!Aldo Leopold may be gone, but his body of work remains. His written work has proven to be prophetic. We still face many of the same conservation problems that we faced in the early 1900s; some of these problems have worsened. As a society, we have to realize that we cannot go on repeating our past mistakes. There are solutions to these problems. And the words of Aldo Leopold hold some of the answers."},{"Title":"The River of the Mother of God and Other Essays by Aldo Leopold","review":"I got this book quickly and it is in the condition described.

Thirty-six pages constitutes a pamphlet. \\"Paperback\\" is a misleading description. I could have downloaded this information much less expensively."},{"Title":"The Anabaptist vision","review":"This is one of the first books I read as an intro to Anabaptism. Initially it answered many of my nagging doubts regarding modern evangelicalism. It also fired me up and got me really excited about following the Bible and the words of Jesus literally. If you know nothing about Anabaptists, Amish or Mennonites then this book is for you. Well worth the few quid you spend on it. It's a great book. the book that kind of clinched it for me really in my decision to become Amish-Mennonite. though when I got there I found modern day Anabaptism is not what I thought it was or what historical Anabaptism was.I went the way of so many. Looking for the perfect Church according to my own set of standards of what perfect is. Like so many I didn't find it. Many end up leaving the Church and just heading out on their own with their family. Others try to recreate the Church and end up like the groups they despise.I tried a different route. Find the Church of the first century, locate it on earth today. Join it, and submit myself to it. What I found wasn't necessarily what I was comfortable with, but it is the Church that Jesus established through His Apostles, sinners and all! The Orthodox Church doesn't have the prettiest history, but neither does ancient Judaism, yet Jesus said the people of his day regarding the pharisees, and I paraphrase \\"do what they say, but don't do what they do, for they sit in the seat of Moses.\\" Now if he could say that about the hypocritical pharisees, how much more the successors of the Apostles, the men who sit in their seats? And there are plenty of righteous men in the Orthodox Church, past and present.Schism is a great sin, numbered right up there with adultery and murder. The Anabaptist Church is infamous for it's history of schism. If you are searching for the truth, I encourage you to consider Orthodoxy. A good book to start with is eitherThe Way: What Every Protestant Should Know about the Orthodox ChurchorBecoming Orthodox: A Journey to the Ancient Christian Faith."},{"Title":"Mandie and the Midnight Journey (Mandie, Book 13)","review":"I liked this Mandie book, and the mystery was good.

However, I do not think that I would necessarily recommend it to casual fans of the game. I will discuss the layout of the book and the information provided in hopes to educate potential buyers as to whether or not this book would make a good addition to their libraries.This book is divided into different chapters that each focuses on various parts of the game: the infield, the outfield, the umps, the dugout, base runners, and others. Each section starts with some interesting stories and trivia about historical eras and historical players. There is even information about current (at the time of print) players and teams. After these \\"fun facts\\" comes the \\"brainteasers.\\" There are many situations in this book that will more often than not be overlooked or missed by the casual fan; but, for the baseball junkies, these situations are what they yearn for while watching games. It is these classic crazy aspects of the game of baseball that make it enjoyable and great conversations, even years after the play in question (as discussed in the book about some of record disputes from Babe Ruth's era).These brainteasers are fun to read but not necessarily to \\"solve.\\" The book poses a question about rule interpretations and then immediately gives the answer. My problem with this book is that many times it seems like the answers needed more information other than what the others provided. Many times a rule from the official MLB rulebook is listed, but not explained in enough detail to fully grasp the reasoning behind the final decision. Other times there is a great description followed by the rule that would back up the decision if the reader were interested in looking up the specific rule. Of course I understand that it would get repetitive to list each and every rule that is involved in every play throughout the book (like a base runner missing a bag while running - which already happens quite frequently in the first chapter alone) but it would be nice for some greater clarification.For these reasons I would recommend this book to die-hard baseball fans. It could potentially provide some great discussions and intellectual stimulation for an individual or a group of people. However, I see the greatest benefit for those who know the MLB official rules from top-to-bottom or for a person who has a copy of the MLB official rules and doesn't mind referencing it frequently.Of course, this book is also fun and interesting to just read through, no matter how much knowledge the reader has (or does not have) about the game of baseball."},{"Title":"The Marketing Power of Emotion","review":"Excellent insight and research into how marketing that appeals to emotions works.

Ms. Bluestone's own story is an inspiration, and she brings to her work the unique empathy of one who has &quot;been there&quot; and found her way out. HANDLE respects individuality and eschews labels; the accounts of these HANDLE clients are compelling and dramatic. Perhaps the most important thing this book provides is hope, which is often in painfully short supply for &quot;marginalized&quot; people. I congratulate all these writers for recounting their journeys, and I think thousands of people can benefit from stepping into the Churkendoose shoes for a few hours. I recommend this book to those with open minds, tired spirits, and vital hearts."},{"Title":"The Churkendoose Anthology: True Stories of Triumph over Neurological Dysfunction: Insights into the Holistic Approach to NeuroDevelopment and Learning Efficiency (HANDLE)","review":"Compiled and edited by Lisa Brenner, The Churkendoose Anthology: True Stories of Triumph over Neurological Dysfunction is a collection of uplifting testimonies offering a positive message of hope to individuals afflicted with neurodevelopment problems ranging from attention disorders, learning disabilities, Tourette's Syndrom, or an acquired brain injury, to Cerebral Palsy, sleep disorders, Vestibular Dysfunction, Down's Syndrome, and obsessive-compulsive behaviors.

Joel's niece Meredith, unlike all the other females, resists hibernation and thus gives birth surrounded by the irresponsible and indifferent males. Joel cannot ignore the danger -- especially when he notices that Meredith's antisocial brother Rory is taking an unhealthy interest in the clan's newest member. While trying to protect little Eli, Joel learns a horrific secret about how Desmodus babies are nurtured -- and how the Desmodus matriarchy perpetuates itself. Every step that Joel takes to help and protect the child puts them both into worse and more bizarre circumstances, finally leading to a nightmarish yet somehow inevitable conclusion.Underlying DESMODUS is the ultimate biological explanation for vampires: a clan apparently descended from vampire bats (&quot;Desmodus rotundus&quot; is the scientific name of the common vampire bat). Yet Tem makes this alien species with its self-contained social system as real as our neighbors and as frightening as the evening news. Much of the horror of DESMODUS comes from Joel's own disarming meekness. He is an unlikely vehicle for describing a family falling in on itself: his introspective nature and somewhat wordy style underscore the hopelessness of his situation as the foundations of his life collapse. Yet his very ordinariness makes his horror and determination all the more compelling and his attempts at heroism all the more gripping, even when they are doomed to failure.DESMODUS tells a powerful story with deliberate but subtle skewedness. Its horror builds slowly, almost casually; the nonchalance of its grotesquery makes it more unsettling than simple gore or violence. Such a blend of tragedy and perverse wonder will satisfy the most profound lust for the disturbing, leaving images that no reader's mind will quickly put to rest."},{"Title":"The Folk Arts of Japan","review":"the folk arts of japanby dr. hugo munsterberg1958Contents include: paper-mache, thread ball, pottery and ceramics, baskets, wood, architecture [old traditional Japanese farm & rural houses], lacquer, metal work, toys, textiles, Kimono, painting, sculpture and more.Bound in Kasuri hand-woven indigo blue textile covers."},{"Title":"ON GROWTH FORM AND COMPUTERS","review":"Excellent copy and shipped fast.

My favorite chapter is the very useful 'A to Z of Fragrant Plants', which is an extensive list of over 200 entries (not all roses, for a change) giving botanical names, common names, family, height and width, plant type, flower color, flowering time, fragrant parts (flowers, leaves, bulbs etc.), preferred climate, growing notes and special uses.The book is nicely laid out with good photographs and colored illustrations, and is printed on high quality glossy paper. The index is quite good, unlike so many of the attractive, magazine-format gardening books.Even though I own five other books devoted to fragrant plants, I still found many useful and interesting things. There is little filler or fluff in this book.This book would make a good gift (which was my original intention, but I had to buy another one !) for new or more experienced gardeners, or even those who can only enjoy the beautiful photographs and dream."},{"Title":"Powder and Patch: A Comedy of Manners (The Transformation of Philip Jettan)","review":"This is one of my favourites, in spite of the fact that it is an early work (circa 1930) and as such lacks some of the polish and more rounded character portrayals we have all come to love and expect from Georgette Heyer. It is also a much shorter novel and is told in a very straightforward manner. However Ms Heyer's effervescent wit and obvious ability to tell a good and humourous story is already evident, thus making &quot;Powder and Patch&quot; an enjoyable and worthwhile read.Much to the chagrin of his father, Maurice Jettan, and his childhood sweetheart, the beautiful Cleone Charteris, Philip Jettan, is perfectly happy being a man of the country. Not for him the perfumed manners of the London drawing rooms! Unfortunately for Philip, Cleone has spent some time in London, where her beauty and grace had been much feted, and in a much more elegant and witty manner than Philip's unvarnished and from the heart declarations. Cleone would like Philip to acquire some city polish. And in this her desires are matched by Philip's father, Maurice. And so together the pair conspire; and the upshot of which is that Philip takes off for Paris in a fit of rage. Have Cleone and Maurice done the right thing? Is a more polished Philip what they really want? Cleone is beginning to wonder if she may have made the mistake of her life in scorning Philip's honest and unvarnished outpourings of love...I'll admit the first time I read this novel, I kept hoping that Philip would meet some nice and sensible young lady in Paris who would make him forget Cleone Charteris. Part of the problem was that I found myself unable to understand exactly what Cleone and Maurice found so wanting in Philip. Philip Jettan was sincere and true, unlike a great many romance heroes who (by comparison) come across as insincere women-haters. Years later I understood that &quot;Powder and Patch&quot; was actually a comedy of manners, written very much in the style of an 18th century play. Understanding this allowed me appreciate Cleone more. The joy to be gleaned from this novel is from &quot;watching&quot; Philip blossom and become more polished, watching him trying to teach Cleone a much needed lesson or two, and watching quick tempered Cleone react to everything that's unfolding before her eyes. So that the happily-ever-after few pages when it (finally) came was tender and satisfyingly well worth the wait. Witty and lighthearted, &quot;Powder and Patch&quot; is a read not to be missed."},{"Title":"Powder and Patch: A Comedy of Manners (The Transformation of Philip Jettan)","review":"This book is one of my favorite Georgette Heyer romances (you simply can't pick one favorite!). Phillip Jettan is a man who disdains the current fashion for powdered wigs and light-hearted flirtation, but he adores his childhood friend Cleone who has tasted the elegance of a London season and isn't content with her crude lover. With the help of his frivolous Uncle Tom he sets off for Paris, and is transformed into &quot;le petit Philippe&quot; who becomes the darling of French society - much to the dismay of Cleone! This story sparkles with witty dialogue, and wonderful descriptions of costumes and festivities of the 1700's. I re-read it at least once a year and I enjoy it as much as the first time, again and again!"},{"Title":"Powder and Patch: A Comedy of Manners (The Transformation of Philip Jettan)","review":"This is pleasant piece of fluff as unsubstantial as a sweet meringue.

She advises him to take himself off to gain a bit of charm and polish, but when he returns, painted, powdered and mincing in satins and lace and affecting a languid air, she realises that she prefers the honest young man to the fop that he seems to be. Of course it's all an act and true love wins out in the end."},{"Title":"Powder and Patch: A Comedy of Manners (The Transformation of Philip Jettan)","review":"There is nothing quite like Georgette Heyer before bed. Even in this early novel, Heyer's writing skills and mastery of story telling are evident. I can understand why people might view Powder and Patch as a short, frivolous story. It is short, of course, but I found that it had a lot more depth to it than some of her later stories. I particularly liked the portrayal of Philip. While the way in which he was sent off to Paris to become refined was admittedly a little cruel, he was not perfect to begin with, and I can understand Cleone's dislike of his crude possessiveness. Even when Philip was transformed with paint, powder and patch, there is a solid depth of character under his frivolous - and I thought cynical - behaviour. His love for Cleone is unwavering, even when he is angry with her. His character is refined, but he does not turn into a painted puppet. He lives for a time behind a mask, as I am sure all of us do for at least some part of our lives. As for Cleone, she was perhaps a little shallow, though this seemed to arise from naivety rather than anything else. Just as with Philip her character is refined in this comedy of manners and she begins to mature. I liked the genuinely affectionate father-daughterish relationship she had with Sir Maurice. So yes, I do like Cleone. And oh, how I like Philip! He began an honest man, and ended an honest gentleman. The secondary characters are amusing, but the main story woven around Philip and Cleone was truly beautiful."},{"Title":"Powder and Patch: A Comedy of Manners (The Transformation of Philip Jettan)","review":"I've only begun reading Heyer's books as of late last year and can honestly say that so far every single one has been a source of pure delight. No surprise- Powder and Patch followed suit in keeping me well entertained. This book, sweet, short, hilarious, with its oh-so-French flair was completed in one sitting.The book is about Philip Jettan, son to the extravagant Maurice and nephew of Tom. The latter are both highly fashionable men, who are well known in high society; whereas the good-natured, but somewhat simpleton and rough-on-the-edges Philip, leaves much to be desired.Philip is, however, the loving flame of Cleone, a neighborhood friend and great beauty. Cleone, along with the rest of Philip's small family, all agree that the young man should get a make-over to improve his style, fashion sense, etiquette and social skills. Philip is not too keen on this and believes he should be loved for who he is. He makes a strong point- Except that things change dramatically when a certain Bancroft comes to town...Bankroft is handsome, well-mannered, sophisticated, well-versed, and ever so fashionable. He also has a way with the ladies, and Cleone notices him immediately. She is seemingly swooned by Bancroft who pays gracious attention to her every need. Philip notices this but believes that Cleone is his sweetheart and that no one can ever come between them. Cleone admits that she loves Philip but will not take him as he is...he definitely needs refining. She would love him to be more romantic and worldly.The decision is taken by both father and uncle- Philip is to go to France to become more civilized and worldly. Philip, enflamed by jealousy, finally agrees, and off he goes to Paris. There, a huge transformation takes place. Elegance to the max, Philip is the center of all attention- no party is worth going if he's not present. He's got style, class, fashion...and, a way with words that makes every woman want to be with him.When he comes back to England, he is a changed man. But Philip wants to know if Cleone really loves the man, or the powder. It is a struggle of wits, suitors for Cleone, love games, jealous rants and more. Cleone is not used to this man who is no longer simple...intriguing to the max, she cannot resist him, yet she will not succumb. What will happen? Do they end up together or will Cleone marry another?I loved this sweet story filled with old French sayings that I hadn't heard in years (Salipopette!) the details in fashion and Phillip's mundane experiences were totally amusing. The characters are also perfectly suited to the story. Heyer brings in Louis XV, la Pompadour and other figures of the times to further immerse us into a world of glamour, extravagance and fun- all precisely intended to highten Phillips magnificent make-over. The setting, the language, the story; everything about this book makes it an extremely enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Powder and Patch: A Comedy of Manners (The Transformation of Philip Jettan)","review":"When I initially read this book many years ago...I think I did not care for it because I don't remember rereading and it is much briefer and less polished than her later Regency romances.Recently, I reread this novel for the 1st time. Despite being a short novel, it start out very slow and the plot does not move along until about one quarter of the way though the novel. In the beginning Philip is happy to be just a country farmer, running his father's estate Tom's Pride. He has been born a gentleman but he does not have the manners of a gentleman. He has always been in love with Cleone Charteris, a neighbor's daughter but he does not woo her. He really takes his relationship with her for granted. Cleone is beautiful but childish and shallow, perhaps because this is a very early effort by Ms. Heyer who has not yet learned to create more complex and interesting heroines.After a humiliating short sword fight over Cleone with Henry Bancroft, another neighbor's foppish and disagreeable son (Henry is rusticating from London), rejection from Cleone, and pressure from his father Sir Maurice, Philip is determined to become the height of the fashionable 18th century gentleman to prove to Cleone and his father that he was more worthy as a country gentleman than as a shallow painted puppy. Philip disappears with his uncle to Paris to be trained by the uncle's aristocratic French friends. Philip is a very fast learner and rapidly becomes the delight of Paris for his exquisite taste in clothing and his sweet, humorous, refreshingly energetic personality. The ladies and gentlemen of Paris are enchanted with le petit Philippe; no party is dull when Philippe attends. Though other reviewers seem to prefer the pre-Paris Philip, I most definitely prefer the light-hearted Paris transformed Philip over the too serious country gentleman farmer. As Philip's uncle in London tells Sir Maurice (before Sir Maurice has met his transformed son), the new Philip is pure joy. Underneath his powder and patch, the old Philip is still there, but now he has acquired creative ways to express himself and no longer takes himself too seriously. Philip really is much more fun. I think a sense of humor is a very attractive trait in a man and Philip's sense humor is definitely improved by his stay in Paris.This novel reads more like a comedic play by Sheridan than a later Heyer Regency romance (which resemble Jane Austen novels)."},{"Title":"Powder and Patch: A Comedy of Manners (The Transformation of Philip Jettan)","review":"I am a really big fan of Georgette Heyer's work, but this book was a disappointment. Originally entitled \\"The Transformation of Phillip Jettan\\" the story is about a young man who is in love with his neighbour Cleone Charteris but she wants someone a little more exciting. When a newcomer arrives in their locality and shows Cleone all the areas in which Phillip is wanting she rejects Phillip.And then the book became disappointing. Phillip went to France to learn to be a painted dandy - and thus to become the opposite of what he was before. There are various interesting events like him fighting a duel and then his reacquaintance with Cleone but overall this didn't work for me. The misunderstandings between the young couple were irritating.Probably part of the reason I didn't like this book is that Phillip turned himself from a traditional Heyer hero into a painted fop, the traditional Heyer butt of jokes. I found myself disliking Phillip and finding Cleone stupid, shallow and annoying.The book receives 3 stars from me as it's written with the usual Heyer excellence but there are a score of better books by this author."},{"Title":"Powder and Patch: A Comedy of Manners (The Transformation of Philip Jettan)","review":"Georgette Heyer is in a class all her own with her quirky and witty \`romance' novels. Nothing like today's books of the genre, which are over-sexed and rarely authentic, the antiquated cadences and dialect simply cannot be matched by contemporary writers. In Powder and Patch, you will find on the first page the following phrase:Page 1 \\"...glaring white erection, stark-naked and blatant...\\"This refers to a building, and I do not think for a moment that it was written with sexual innuendos. It's really very interesting to see the turns of phrase used, even if they sound a little silly to us now. This is perhaps my favorite part of Heyer's writing style, though I enjoy her characters and their unpredictable escapades as well.Page 15 \\"By God sir, you are a damned dull dog!\\"Powder and Patch is set in early Georgian England, rather than the Regency era, but the mannerisms are nearly the same, though the dress is slightly different. Our protagonist is a country gentleman named Philip Jettan, who is very anti-dandy. He is in love with one of his neighbors, Miss Cleone and she likes him well enough, but longs for a lover who pays attention to the latest fashions and posses fine French manners. In desperation to win her affection he departs to meet his uncle in London, where they decide to travel to Paris to help Philip gain the very qualities that he himself deplores.\\"A while back I spoke of three gentlemen...to the tune of one whole chapter.\\"The narration is unique - like the author is sitting by the fire reading aloud and suddenly looks up and inserts comments about her book. I find this style just as charming and entertaining as the lively characters.Because I so enjoyed Powder and Patch (finishing it in one day, nearly one sitting), I have ordered several of Heyer's Regency romances to give much needed breaks between my heftier historical reads.

Once I got past that, I was able to enjoy the book. I do think that The Black Moth and (especially) Regency Buck were more cleverly done.

The characters were particularly disappointing; the heroine is a work of insipidity and the hero moves from being a stiff, but likeable country bumpkin to an irritatingly controlling male who is invested overnight with incredibly pretentious society manners.Nonetheless, the period detail is fascinating as always and there are moments of fun.

The writing is as authentic as it comes (you will actually feel as your are reading an Austen or Bronte book) and the characters are interesting and witty. I very much liked Philip and Cleone's story and how their romance develops but while reading it, I was haunted by this question: why does Philip actually fall in love with Cleone? What is it about her that inspires him to make such a drastic change in himself and his lifestyle? By the end, I was still confused...Georgette Heyer is a master regency romance writer. If you are a fan of Austen and Bronte, then you will find yourself engrossed in her narrative of the time period's lifestyle and dialogues. Enjoy!**See all my reviews on my blog (sensibleromance.wordpress.com)"},{"Title":"Powder and Patch: A Comedy of Manners (The Transformation of Philip Jettan)","review":"Powder and Patch was a darling read. Set in England and France during which the fashion of the time was wearing powdered wigs, make up, and high heels. Philip Jettan was a down to earth country gentleman who was lacking in \\"polish\\" as his father stated. He was painfully blunt and had not one single vanity about him. That is until his childhood love, his hope to be betrothed, the beautiful Cleone Charteris draws the attention of a newly arrived powdered and patched gentlemen by the name of Mr Bancroft. Cleone began to waver on her feelings for Philip because she concluded she would like a man with \\"polish\\". Philip did not fit into that grouping.Cleone and Philip cared profoundly for each other having grown up together. But she had other dreams of what her kind of man was; she did care about \\"frivolities\\" as Philip had put it. Somewhere inside of her were unanswered feelings for Philip and he knew it. To defend his status with her he baited Mr Bancroft into a duel. Proving Philip's lack of \\"polish\\" he was defeated by Bancroft. Even worse for Philip, Cleone had the impudence to chastise him for his lack of gentlemen skills. With that Philip left her for London with only with a promise from her she would wait. He would have to go to his uncle, like his father had told him so many times before.Upon Philip's arrival and full discussion with his uncle of his situation, the two men decided he should disappear to Paris for his transformation. Awh Paris, the late nigh parties, courtiers, and powdered faces were a sight to behold in themselves. I swear you could just smell the perfumed, gem-encrusted fashions. Philip lived up to his \\"short shirt\\" potential and became everything Cleone wanted. Thing between them however had turned sour. He wanted real love, to be loved for who he truly was, not for what he dressed like. Oh a tangled web we weave ourselves into for love. A few mishaps and everything could be lost forever.This book was sent to me by the publisher for review."},{"Title":"Powder and Patch: A Comedy of Manners (The Transformation of Philip Jettan)","review":"In reading the reviews of this book, I found I felt a little different than some. I've read a number of Heyer's books and there are very few I can't put down. But this was not one of them. I thoroughly enjoyed the story and the characters. It's not quite as good as my favorite, Devil's Cub, but I'd give it a solid 4 1/2 stars and recommend it to anyone that likes Heyer's."},{"Title":"Powder and Patch: A Comedy of Manners (The Transformation of Philip Jettan)","review":"STORY BRIEF:Phillip is happy with his simple life as a country farmer. He doesn't wear fine clothes. He has no desire for the social life. Phillip and Cleone love each other. Henry comes to town and flirts with Cleone. Cleone is impressed that Henry is well dressed. Cleone tells Phillip she wants him to gain polish and to dress better. Phillip goes to Paris to transform himself. He learns French and how to fence, dress, and be entertaining. He wears wigs, powder, rouge, and jewels. When he sees Cleone again, she believes untrue gossip about him which causes problems.REVIEWER'S OPINION:There were many French phrases, and I did not understand any of them. I guess that was ok, since most of that conversation was silly and meant to be like party chit- chat. When Phillip goes to Paris we don't see the transformation process which I would have liked. Instead we are quickly taken to six months later where he is an excellent swordsman and fun party-goer. When he returns to England, the plot with Cleone was farcical. Conflicts were based on silly misunderstandings with neither party communicating in a reasonable manner. For example, he loves her but he acts like he doesn't - because he wants to test her or teach her a lesson.Cleone was finicky, scatterbrained, stupid, shallow, and irritating. The intent was humor, but I didn't find it funny. There was also an odd issue. Apparently Cleone could believe two opposing ideas and wanted Phillip to \\"master her\\" into the right decisions. Apparently she had no logic or decision making ability.This was one of Heyer's early works. It's about half the length of most of her books. I consider it an experiment on her part and not worth buying unless you are a rabid Heyer fan and want to read everything she does. The narrator was fine. I enjoyed hearing him speak the French phrases.DATA:Unabridged audiobook length: 5 hours 5 minutes. Narrator: Jamie Glover. Swearing language: none. Sexual content: none.

The story is filled with useless conversations in English. I am planning on finishing the book, I am halfway through, but it is difficult when I am not particularly enamored with the characters.

Lots of advice, some of it quite ingenious, about foiling deer. Most of it might work better where deer aren't as drought-desperate as ours. Tried some ploys which my deer laughed at. For instance,who knew that my hungry Hill Country deer actually LIKE Liquid Fence?

Instead they hired a piece of crap writer to carry Asprin and he screwed up the book. Heck obviously had a story of his own in mind when he was handed the reins to &quot;A Phule and His Money&quot;. The beginning of the book was typical Asprin; funny, lighthearted and an enjoyable read. Then Heck sat down in front of the computer and proceeded to butcher Asprin's jovial artistry. The following is a list complaints I have with the book. Too long- I should have known something was up when I saw the size of the book and Heck's name on the cover (I love long books but it wasn't appropriate for the Phule series). Side Plots- Heck killed all the side plots within just a few pages of each other and wasted an opportunity to write a better book. New characters- This book was supposed to be about the new additions to the Omega crew. Instead, these new characters had very small roles in this book. Heck took a fun loving commander who involved his troops in everything he did and only used his money to take care of minor inconviences and he turned him into a self centered, secretive individual who instead of using his team to solve problems used his money. I can honestly say I wish I had never read this book and if the next book in the MYTH series is anything like this, ACE shouldn't even bother to print it."},{"Title":"A Phule and His Money (Phule's Company)","review":"This was actually the subtitle of the book, found inside the cover, and it is an accurate assesment of the book on the whole.It's been roughly six years since the previous Phule book was published, and it seems this is the best effort Ace could come up with. I would have preferred to wait another six years for another book of the same quality rather than be duped into buying this ill-conceived and poorly written attempt at trying to cash in on Asprin's creation. I can't imagine that Robert Asprin had much to do with this latest volume of the series, other than by providing a general outline and then allowing Peter Heck to have his way with the Phule universe. I've never read anything by Peter J Heck before and have no idea if this effort is representative of his other work, but I can't imagine that he spent much effort in researching for the book.Anyone who has read Asprin before will be gravely dissappointed, especially if they've read the previous two books in this series. Characters often behave inconsistently in speech and action, doing and saying things that never would have happened if they were under the control of the original author. It was a painful experience just trying to finish it. The material introduced at the closing of Phule's Paradise is wasted here, with old characters making appearances with no purpose other than to show that they're still alive, and many subplots still left dangling as the book eventually derails, a rollercoaster ride gone horribly wrong. Even the cover art is lame, with Jester looking like a 16 year old with braces. I encourage anyone curious about Asprin's MYTH and Phule series to look at the earlier installments, and not to be put off by this latest.The bottom line, save yourself the money and the aggravation, and stay the &quot;Heck&quot; away from this one!"},{"Title":"A Phule and His Money (Phule's Company)","review":"The &quot;Phule&quot; books -- all of them -- are meant to be tongue-in-cheek, light-hearted reads, and &quot;A Phule and His Money&quot; fits the bill, following in the entertaining footsteps of its predecessors. All of the characters are there -- the butler (who plays a major role despite what a previous reviewer claimed), Chocolate Henry, Mother, Sgt. Brandy, et al -- and Phule's escapades as he outwits his superiors in rank while accomplishing his mission's goals are as humorous as ever. There's mystery, organized crime, abductions, even romance! Note: you must read the two previous books in order to understand this one. Also, don't expect in-depth plots or character exposes. This book is meant to be fun, not something on the book-club list."},{"Title":"A Phule and His Money (Phule's Company)","review":"I waited a very long time for this book and was totally disappointed after reading it. I waited page after page for the Asprin Magic to kick in but it never did.Readers - If you are new to Robert Asprin then buy Phules Company and then Phules Paradise but don't bother with this one unless you want the complete set.Mr. Asprin - What happened? Why was this book so poor compared to the other two? You took long enough to publish it, surely you could tell it wasn't up to your normal level of entertainment?"},{"Title":"A Phule and His Money (Phule's Company)","review":"Having enjoyed the previous two Phules Co. books, I looked forward to reading this one when I received it for my birthday. Unfortunately I was unable to get past about 1/3 of the way. I am sorry that Mr. Aspirin allowed someone else to write this book. It was very poor. The characters were all there, but they were not the people we had grown to love in the previous books. In many cases they were behaving in ways that were totally out of character.Most of all I missed the butler. He always imparted quality to the crew. I do hope that Mr. Aspirin will write another Phules Co. book. I hope that only Mr. Aspirin writes it."},{"Title":"A Phule and His Money (Phule's Company)","review":"The summary pretty much says it. Aside from the names of the characters, this book had nothing in common with the other two. Characters spoke and acted differently, and all the fun was just sucked out of the experience."},{"Title":"A Phule and His Money (Phule's Company)","review":"This is not a bad book, but it's somewhat disappointing. The plot carryovers from the previous book (Phule's Paradise) are terminated off-handedly, but you at least get some explanation of what happened with regards to the Casino, the Yakuza tie-in, Chocolate Harry's past, Lavinia's future, and so on. The roller coaster plot was simply ludicrous. The characters are still likeable, but several of the mainstays are shuffled to the side. If there's ever another in the sequel, may Phule's Errand be it's title, not it's description."},{"Title":"A Phule and His Money (Phule's Company)","review":"Thepreviously brilliant and flamboyant Captain Jester has been reduced to a slightly unorthodox businessman. The characters, on the whole, are dull, soulless cardboard cutouts of their former selves. Conflicts were resolved too easily, with a minimum of humor. My last thought upon finishing it was, &quot;That's it! &quot; I would have preferred to wait for another &quot;Phule&quot; book and never get one, rather than seeing the series shamelessly trampled like this. (It was, however, tolerable if you didn't think of it as part of the &quot;Phule's Company&quot; series.) I hope Robert Asprin is ashamed of himself for putting his name on this, even with someone else to share the blame."},{"Title":"A Phule and His Money (Phule's Company)","review":"I have read all of the books in the Myth series and I have enjoyed every page. I was very impressed with &quot;Phule's Company&quot; and follow-up: &quot;Phule's Paradise&quot;. &quot;A Phule And His Money&quot; had a good idea, but the story will bore you. It seems like accomplishing the HORRIBLE task given by the General was no challenge at all. There is no excuse for this book...other than Asprin was too busy working on the next Myth novel. Wishful thinking...."},{"Title":"A Phule and His Money (Phule's Company)","review":"Great to see this series picked up again.Unsure of how much that has to do with companion author.Phule and his Omega Company are &quot;thrown away&quot; members of the Space Legion. Misfits and maladjusted, they have the &quot;wrong&quot; approach to everything.Asprin juggles a large cast, that naturally gets bigger in every book as new recruits join the unit. Rather than gloss over this, this book makes it a feature. How to bring new into old, how veterans deal with green members, and how the Top Brass try to take credit for Phule's successes.Not as bright and fresh as the first two books, but many members of the Company are maturing. That means less 'wacky' stuff is in the plot. But Asprin manages to deliver as the story gets broader with the &quot;trail of baggage&quot; and plot threads building each time.The next book may tell the story as to whether the series realizes it's potential. Good fun, good read, and an author who appreciates his characters, even if the main purpose here is to bring a smile."},{"Title":"A Phule and His Money (Phule's Company)","review":"It is unfortunate that this series has fallen into a repetition of the same old gag. The premise, perhaps, was doomed from the start. Wacky bunch of military misfits are foisted off on equally misfit commander(promising, but here's the fatal flaw), wacky misfit commander is rich as Croesus. Therefore, instead of interestingly thinking or fighting its way out of trouble, the unit simply BUYS its way out. Perhaps this is a bit of wish fullfillment on Asprin's part considering his recent financial troubles, but it is a disappointing come-down from the thoroughly charming (if a bit formulaic) &quot;Myth&quot; books."},{"Title":"A Phule and His Money (Phule's Company)","review":"If I could give the book less than 1 star, I would. I love the MYTH series and the Phule books previous to this one, but if you're looking for the same sense of easy-to-identify characters and fun, look elsewhere. I have some doubt as to whether Aspirin had anything to do with writing the book at all; maybe he just provided the story idea. In any case, the characters completely lose their established personalities, becoming both boring and unbelievable, and the interesting plot ideas crash and burn horribly - which can't be a great surprise since the Phule series is character driven. Whoever Peter Heck is, I hope Aspirin comes to his senses and doesn't let him near another of his books."},{"Title":"A Phule and His Money (Phule's Company)","review":"I similarly found this book to be disappointing, and not up to past standards."},{"Title":"A Phule and His Money (Phule's Company)","review":"All the negative reveiws are correct. The most endearing things about the first two Phule's Company books were that each of the character's had their own Voice and were described in such a way to provide Character. Aspirin's subletly is replaced by a much more heavy handed effort that fails by trying so hard. 'Blah' is the word that describes the book best."},{"Title":"A Phule and His Money (Phule's Company)","review":"Dumbed down, maybe deadline pressure. Everything an author or would-be author would read and start to pity the forced action of formerly delightful characters.I don't know who &quot;contributor&quot; P.Heck is, and now I really don't care to find out how he may have butchered Mark Twain in a sort of revisionist historic mystery setting.What is it with the bizarre word choices? Is it a cry for help (or hidden excuse) to the Literary Critics? In some rarified language? Even the names chosen for 'new' characters are strange."},{"Title":"A Phule and His Money (Phule's Company)","review":"I have looked forward to this sequel ever since reading the first two books. Many of the characters from those books were either greatly ignored or just seen in passing. Also it had Willard Phule worrying about money of all things. This from a man that bought a hotel so he could have the manager help him. A man who bought 2 Port-A-Brains (cost of a small corportion) so he would not have to possibly wait for a pay terminal. I can't believe Asprin wrote this. Makes me think Heck wrote it and Asprin get the credit (read as BLAME). Makes it very doubtful that I would buy a 4th one, especially if anyone's name is on it besides Asprin."},{"Title":"A Phule and His Money (Phule's Company)","review":"This is clearly the worst book of the three so far and may signal the start of the decline. Usually, it takes longer for his series to begin to go downhill, but we're seeing it in only the third book.What made the first two books funny and charming is almost gone in this installment. The characters seem to have no depth and less wit, and the &quot;hilarious situations&quot; come off forced and stilted. Asprin's &quot;voice&quot; seems to have changed (perhaps due to the unexplained presence of a co-author) and not for the better.Summary: Internet fan fiction would have been better than this."},{"Title":"A Phule and His Money (Phule's Company)","review":"I loved Phule in the early books. Unfortunately, the series has been going downhill ever since Asprin began collaborating, apparently in an effort to increase his productivity. The latest entries in the series just don't have the same sense of fun that the early ones had.Very disappointing."},{"Title":"A Phule and His Money (Phule's Company)","review":"Unlike its light-hearted, original, and funny predecessors, this time Robert Aspirin (with Peter J. Heck) buries the Omega Company into a boring tale of trying to one-up a back-world government. Where's the humor? Where's the fun? There is none!"},{"Title":"A Phule and His Money (Phule's Company)","review":"If you are loking for a fun and entertaining science fiction book you've come to the right place.This book's main character is Captain Willard Phule, a commander of the Space Legion, which is the security branch at a casino called Fat Chance. Phule whips his troops into shape, and their abilities are soon recognized by General Blitzkrieg, who deploys them to the struggling planet Landoor. As they investigate the new planet, they find out that the goverenment is secretly planning to build a theme park. With this information, the Space Legion starts their own park for competition. In the end, they have created the biggest combined theme park in the galaxy.The characters in Aspirin's books have very unique and witty personalities.Although the character may seem a little unreal, it is almost scary realizing how similar they are to everyday people.A Phule and His Money is a book targeted towards the young teen age group. The book may seem a little confusing at the start, but, like most books, it develops soon after. I don't think anyone over 15 would like this book, because the main idea wouldn't seem to interesting and it doesn't have a big revealing ending that sums the whole book up. I don't think this book would win an award, but if you're a sci-fi lover, this is your book."},{"Title":"A Phule and His Money (Phule's Company)","review":"This third book in the series uses its own history - or in this case the history of Captain Wiilard Phule - when it is assigned to a certain planet. A planet in which war has ended - kind of - but not with any help from Phule. In fact, it is because of him that war - kind of - continues. This is the very same planet in which he attacked the peace conference.Oh, characters, events, and issues from the first two books also make things a tad complex, to say the least. In other words, lots of people are trying to kill him. Not defeat his Company or defeat the Legion. No, they want his head on a platter.It is good, with lots of humor, military action, and very, very twisted in its plot. But not as good as the first two. I feel like it has lost some steam.Get it used or get it out of a library."},{"Title":"A Phule and His Money (Phule's Company)","review":"Let me say right out front that I did not like this book.The first two books in the series were fun. This one was not.The first two books introduced us to a bunch of military misfits who pulled together due to the resourcefulness and resources of their commander into a unit that could handle all kinds of things. In this book, they behave like the previous two books did not happen.I guess that is what happens when a collaborator comes on board and basically takes on the name of the original author and does not bother to even read the first two books. How could he have missed such things as the Zenobians looking like lizards? Or, the fact that Phule had requested a Chaplain and was offered one? Is the Space Legion really so screwed up that all the new recruits come directly to the company - except that the two \\"people\\" who are requested, are not listed?What's with the Gambolts anyway?There were also all kinds of weak plots in this book. The first half of the book really winds up the previous book and all the action takes place on Lorelei. Then, the second half of the book tries to develop a whole story and jam it into 100 pages - not only is the plot ludicruous, but it really does not play well. I guess the only reason for doing it was to close out the storyline of how Scaramouche became Jester. But come on! A government that is apparently comprised of two people does not understand how to use the media? An ambassador who can come in at the last moment and overturn the dictates of the General who is in charge of the Space Legion?Even the puns fall flat in this volume. Anyone who has been in any service will recognize the utter ridiculousness of having Brandy NOT being able to handle Mahatma. Why would a Mahatma join the legion anyway? And then, to have the Reverend be a believer in the King's resurrection and sport sequines and facial hair? Oh, stop me from splitting my sides with laughter - NOT!This was bad. Not recommended."},{"Title":"A Phule and His Money (Phule's Company)","review":"This book has none of the belly laughs associated with the first two books. It is written in an entirely different style, leading one to wonder if Robert Asprin or Peter Heck wrote it.If this were the first in a series, the series would founder and die at book two."},{"Title":"A Phule and His Money (Phule's Company)","review":"This book was just as much fun to read as any of his previous books. You can actually tell that someone else was writing some of his dialogue but the story was just as much fun to read as any of his other books."},{"Title":"A Phule and His Money (Phule's Company)","review":"Honestly I am a *HUGE* asprin fan, and as such I've watched with disapointment as his battle with personal problems leaked into his work. In saying that, this book is a good step back in the right direction (as opposed to the last MYTH book which was, well, awful) Really, this is a good read, and is well worth the few bucks paperbacks cost these days, this is esp. true if you do not compare it to the other books as it is not of the same caliber as his earlier work."},{"Title":"A Phule and His Money (Phule's Company)","review":"Critic's don't buy books. People do. If your expecting something like &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; your in the wrong section. This is a light-hearted comedy from a man that makes the pun an art form. Definetly worth reading several more times."},{"Title":"A Phule and His Money (Phule's Company)","review":"Critic's don't buy books. People do.

What a mistake that would have been. I completely enjoyed it - it was funny, and I got the pleasure of reading about my favorite characters again. There were things I didn't like about it - for instance, the second half was rushed, and didn't have the plot development of the first half, but for pure, light hearted enjoyment I got my money's worth. For everyone else that was disappointed - I'm really sorry, but what did you expect - &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;? Lighten up!"},{"Title":"A Phule and His Money (Phule's Company)","review":"Sure, the book isn't a great work of fiction, but it certainly wasn't meant to be. If you take this book for what it is - a light hearted read meant to kill a few hours - then it lives up to expectations. What more can you ask for?"},{"Title":"A Phule and His Money (Phule's Company)","review":"upon reading the other reviews, i agree that robert asprin must have left much of the writing to his collaborator. the characters, who seem like old friends after the first two novels, do not act (or even talk!!) as you would expect. however, the story was still entertaining and had some good laughs. nowhere near as bad as &quot;sweet myth-tery of life&quot;, the worst book i have ever read by asprin."},{"Title":"A Phule and His Money (Phule's Company)","review":"While I did read reviews before I read the book, I read it with an open mind, determined to make my own decision. Frankly, I had to agree with the negative reviews. This book was a let-down from the other two Phule books. I did not find it nearly as funny, and it was a chore to get through it. The characters were not as interesting, nor was the plot as involving. If you've read the other Phule books and enjoyed them, go ahead and read this, but don't make it a priority. This is something to read on a long plane trip, or something similar."},{"Title":"A Phule and His Money (Phule's Company)","review":"I was excited to see a new Asprin book on the shelf -- finally back to Phule! It seemed that the writing style was quite different and there was less humour than the first two books in the series. If you're an Asprin fan, buy it! If not, stick with one of his earlier works (though not the recent non-Phule sci-fi books - they are lousy)."},{"Title":"A Phule and His Money (Phule's Company)","review":"As a long time fan of Robert Asprin ( going back to Thieves World ) I was very disappointed in this installment of such a fun series. It's pretty obvious right from the start that somebody else basically wrote the book. The character's voices, mannerisms and speech patterns all changed. Sushi no long speaks with an accent in broken english, and the other characters also lose that individualism that the first two books had. You could pull dialog from the first two books and pretty much know who was speaking by the way it was written but that was lost in this book. All in all it read more like an attempt to make money on a hit series than a real effort at continuing, what had been, a great bunch or books."},{"Title":"A Phule and His Money (Phule's Company)","review":"I loved the first two Phule's books-but this one feels as if it was written by someone else. It had no depth, no flavor, limited humor, and none of the characters rang true--they all seemed flat and expressionless.This one is a waste of money--don't bother."},{"Title":"A Phule and His Money (Phule's Company)","review":"Where did this book go wrong? Let me count the ways.A captain who pores over the files of his people before meeting them in the first book, manages to forget between books two and three that he was told he was getting his requested chaplain and a Zenobian observer.His top three officers also forget this.Neither the chaplain nor the observer appear on the paperwork that the Sergeant is reading names off of.Sushi goes from very formal english to very casual.Escrima goes from being a Phillipino stick fighter speaking broken english to speaking perfect english, right down to the slang, and being a gambler who owes Sushi money.No one recognizes the lizard lurking around the corners of the casino as a Zenobian, even though the company had first contact with them.Everyone has gone from mildly competent (and lucky) to being the Keystone Kops.Phule refers to the company as the Omega company, even though this had been established in the first book as being derogatory slang for the *type* of company, not their official name.The humor was forced, the plot was contrived, none of the characters sounded right.I could probably go on, but by this point, I hadn't finished chapter three, so I didn't think there was any point in reading the rest of the book. Needless to say, I don't think Mr. Heck bothered to read the first two books of the series, and it shows.My recommendation is, read Phule's Company and Phule's Paradise, by Robert Asprin, and skip the inferior immitations by Peter Heck. If I could give this book zero stars, I would."},{"Title":"A Phule and His Money (Phule's Company)","review":"An enjoyable read in the same tradition as Phule's Company and Phule's Paradise.It took a few years but Asprin and Heck do a good job of picking up where Phule's Paradise left off. Not only do all of our old favorites return (to varying degrees), but we get to make new friends along the way, many of whom carry on Asprin's trademark sense of the ridiculous. Remember how Maxine Pruet had all those horrible plans for our Captain Jester and the Omega Company at the end of Phule's Paradise? Well, they all come to pass in this enjoyable and (surprise!) offbeat sequel, but not without Phule's uncanny knack for getting himself AND his men out of hot water. But the mob boss on Lorelei isn't the only one gunning for Phule. Once again General Blitzkreig is doing his best to see the end of Willard Phule's career in the Space Legion. Things really get rolling (and we hope one of those rolling things isn't our Fearless Leader's head), when Blitzkreig sends the Omega Company back to the original site of Phule's most ignominious escapade.Is this book worth the years of waiting? That depends on the reader. I personally don't think any book is &quot;worth&quot; a seven year wait. If you're looking for something to justify all that waiting, then don't bother. The result would have to be a masterpiece of monolithic proportions...and this one ain't. But if you're looking for the continuation of a story with memorable characters and satirical wit, check it out and enjoy, it's worth the discounted paperback price.I encourage all of Asprin's fool fans...er, Phule fans to try this one out. But remember, don't let years of expectation and anticipation ruin the experience for you. Read A Phule and His Money, then go back and re-read all three books in order. I don't think you'll regret it."},{"Title":"A Phule and His Money (Phule's Company)","review":"Not the best I've ever read, either....and this is based on getting to page 33. None of the characterizations feel &quot;right&quot;-from Tusk-anini, to Escrima's speech patterns, to a sudden change in gender for General Blitzkreig's aide. I'm going to finish it, but I can tell that it's not going to be as good as the first two."},{"Title":"A Phule and His Money (Phule's Company)","review":"This book is too obviously not Asprin's work. There are clearly Asprin like touches in the plot and a few of the lines, but overall this looks to be mostly Heck's work. The previous Phule books were light, sprightly works that jumped from one witty quip to the next without much concern. The plots were funny and the characters engaging. This one is not. The characters plod from place to place with no enjoyment. The plot, in outline, is very funny. The execution of the plot is awful. It reads as if Asprin supplied the overall outline and the direction while Heck filled in the rest, with little supervision or oversight from Asprin. The series suffers. Unfortunatly, I have already purchased both in this new Phule series. Please do not make the same mistake. If you must read them, get them from a library."},{"Title":"A Phule and His Money (Phule's Company)","review":"I've been a fan of RL Asprin ever since I picked up his Myth-Adventures series--I've eagerly read every book he's written, and no few of the anthologies he's edited. That's why A Phule And His Money was such a great disappointment. The plot was all Asprin--clever and full of potential. Unfortunately, that potential was never realized; whoever did the actual writing whether it was Heck or Asprin (the smart money is on Heck) absolutely massacred the storyline. Emphasis was placed on irrelevant and uninteresting points, and the book had none of Asprin's characteristic incisive satire and wise wit. The bottom line--after finishing the book, the reader is left with the nagging feeling that the book was just a first draft."},{"Title":"A Phule and His Money (Phule's Company)","review":"The book was, without a doubt, disappointing from the hideous front cover on. A lot of reviewers have been blaming Peter Heck. Well, it's quite possible that he's to blame, but I wouldn't rule out Robert Asprin, either. Look at the disappointing Sweet Myth-teries of Life, for example, which had only his name on it. For that matter, look at the copyright date. Asprin left off Phule's Paradise with a cliffhanger (a deplorable and self-serving habit of his) SEVEN YEARS ago! Maybe Heck did what he could (obviously and unfortunately not enough) with Asprin's work.The best thing I can say about this novel is that it didn't end with a cliffhanger. Hopefully Asprin's realized by now that by delaying so long between books, he's lost the right to use cliffhangers ever again."},{"Title":"A Phule and His Money (Phule's Company)","review":"This book lacks any of the traits that I have come to expect from this author. The book has a simplistic plot with little or no humor. It is overall a poor representation of Mr Asprin's work."},{"Title":"A Phule and His Money (Phule's Company)","review":"I don't know what some of the other reviewers were reading... but it probably wasn't this book. This third instalment in the &quot;Phule&quot; series easily lives up to its prdecessors, despite some of the other reviews here, some of whom are just plain wrong. For instance, one reviewer wrote that Beeker was not in this book. He is. Another wrote that the second half is written in a different style than the first half. Its not. However, there are a few odd things here and there, such as a reference to the word &quot;freaking&quot; as profanity. I attribute such oddities to editors - even as no battle plan survives contact with the enemy, few manuscripts survive contact with editors. Asprin is in rare form again, and this book is not to be missed by fans of the first two books."},{"Title":"A Phule and His Money (Phule's Company)","review":"I found the book a very good read. It's not as good as most his other books. But he still did an out standing job. The only complaint I have is he need to write more. A lot more :)"},{"Title":"A Phule and His Money (Phule's Company)","review":"I had a gggrrreat time reading this 3rd installment.It had all the phun and phantasy of the previous books in this series.Keep up the phantastic work guys :-)"},{"Title":"A Phule and His Money (Phule's Company)","review":"This book bears only a superficial resemblance to the first two books. Plot elements are barely strung together at all. No real action is ever taken by Phule than to pull out his credit card and propose business deals. Problems seem to come and magically resolve themselves with no apparent action taken on the part of the principals. This is probably the last in the series because few people that read this book will ever buy another &quot;Phule&quot; book. Which is really sad because I loved the first two. I can only guess that the publisher invoked a contract clause allowing the book to be finished by a ghost author. The humor is lame and the plot is almost as bad. I normally see better FanFic published on the Web. With all apologies to Mr. Asprin who has brought me so much enjoyment with his previous works, this one's a dud!"},{"Title":"A Phule and His Money (Phule's Company)","review":"I enjoyed the first two books in this series enough to read them a second time, but this collaboration was absolutely atrocious.Every indication seems to be that Asprin wrote an outline which Peter J. Heck attempted to flesh out into a book: Unfortunately, Peter J. Heck has no sense of character or comedy. I only got a few dozen pages into the book before throwing it against the wall in total disgust, but time and time again I saw scenes which -- if the old Robert Asprin had been executing them -- would have been hilarious. Here, however, they fell flat and lifeless to the pavement.There are no laughs here. The characters and the scenes are forced. All sense of a point is missing.No matter how much you loved the first two books, avoid this installment at all costs. Indeed, the closer the first two books are to your heart, the deeper this book will thrust the knife."},{"Title":"A Phule and His Money (Phule's Company)","review":"I've been a big fan of Robert Asprin for a while now. My former girlfriend started me on the Myth series and I was hooked.I've thoroughly enjoyed the Phule series, until now. I'm not sure what happened between &quot;Phule's Paradise&quot; and &quot;A Phule and His Money&quot;, but Asprin just doesn't seem to do anything special with his characters.One of the things I like about Asprin's writing is his character development. However, the dialogue in &quot;A Phule and His Money&quot; is flat and static, lacking the subtle nuances that define each character's personality.The plot was a bit disjointed as well, leaving several gaping holes in the story line (weren't they going to take on the Yakuza? )It is still a worthwhile read. The Asprin wit still shines through in places, it just isn't as bright as we're used to."},{"Title":"A Phule and His Money (Phule's Company)","review":"While Phule has a habit of throwing money at a problem, it usually seems to be with more intelegance, and meaning then this book allowed for. In this case the money is spent and spent with none of the detail that made it interesting in prior books.So many characters that your favorites will barely appear, and new ones remain one dimensional. The side plot with the 'Rev' was simply annoying. The stupidity of the general outright dumb. And the fast wrap of plot lines unsatisfying.I didn't buy another book after this one. Asprin developed a promising series, but let it get trashed by a co-author. Read the first one, and the second if you like, but don't bother with this one."},{"Title":"A Phule and His Money (Phule's Company)","review":"This book was very disappointing. The previous two Phule books were great, but this one was choppy and forced; the plot seemed terribly contrived and the characters uninspired caricatures of what went before. It was a chore to read, but nowhere near as bad as the sequel..."},{"Title":"A Phule and His Money (Phule's Company)","review":"I've happened across every book in this series completely by accident, and until now it's been a pleasant surprise every single time. This time? Well, it was a pleasant surprise to see a new &quot;Phule&quot; book, but until the last few chapters, it just didn't... FEEL right.Not a book I'd recommend (although I would strongly recommend the previous two books in the series)."},{"Title":"A Phule and His Money (Phule's Company)","review":"One has to wonder if Mr. Asprin wrote this book or did Mr. Heck just get stuck with it. There are way to many inaccuracies with this book to be the supposed writer block and could only come from someone not familiar with the series or from someone who could care less about it. The story line is flat, the humor is non-excitant, and the characters that where so alive the first books are cardboard cut outs now. I am normally a big fan of Mr. Asprin's work, but if there ever is another installment to this series I will read it, but I will not buy it first."},{"Title":"A Phule and His Money (Phule's Company)","review":"I had been eagerly awaiting this sequel and was very disappointed. No humour, scenes that seemed to serve no purpose, characterizations were wrong. My favorite character, Mother, was reduced to a dull personality. The impression I was left with is that Peter J. Heck wrote the story and Robert Asprin put his name on it. I will be very hesitant to purchase any of Asprin's books in the future."},{"Title":"A Phule and His Money (Phule's Company)","review":"I loved Book 1 &quot;Phule's Company&quot; and Book 2 &quot;Phule's Paradise&quot;, but I hesitated to read this Book 3 because of these negative reviews. But finally I did read it, because I wanted to find out by my own eyes why this book was so badly reputed and how it was different from the previous two books.Now I do know why. I expected it not so good as the previous books but so-so enjoyable, but I am disappointed. It's still tolerable that the nice mixture of humor, wit and warmth has changed to a noisy slapstick comedy. But I can't help feeling something is wrong; the characters's behavior and/or speech have delicately deviated from those in the previous books. Especially, Beeker has been deprived of his flavor. For example, Beeker calls the big brass &quot;enemies&quot;. They are enemies indeed, but it is very unlikely for Beeker to use such a straight expression.It might have been very difficult for any writers except the creator to reproduce the charm of this series. Or Asprin's memory and/or affection for this series might have faded in the long gap. Anyway, I wish such a sequel had not been forcedly published."},{"Title":"A Phule and His Money (Phule's Company)","review":"Asprin's books are not for those who are seeking deep, intellectual satisfaction. They are, however, funny and a breeze to read. This book was not as laugh-out-loud funny as his prior books, but it still a quick read. It's a little odd now that the central band of misfits are so thoroughly respected, but Asprin's formula keeps on working - strong leaders with lots of financial resources (they type you'd like as a boss), getting into and out of sticky situations with their loyal band of various oddities, complete with a lot of puns."},{"Title":"Terra Incognita","review":"Terra Incognita is a collection of black and white large format images of various aspects, grand and minute, of the North American landscape. This work establishes Steve Mulligan as a true heir to the mantle of Ansel Adams, Minor White, and other luminaries of the &quot;black and white&quot; photographic medium. Mulligan is able to see what most of us cannot, and is able to translate that perception into images of light, shadows, and darkness which touch the soul and heart as well as the eyes.

P. Roe (1838-1888), who later bacame the most popular American novelist of his day. As with most of his novels, the plot is built on an actual historical event: in this case, the Chicago Fire. The book was originally published in 1873, and has remained in print for over 120 years. A movie based on the book was made in the early 1930's"},{"Title":"Barriers burned away,","review":"I'm a huge fan of Charles Sheldon. I read this book by E.P.

After the Chicago fire, he was moved to write this stirring account of that tragedy. The conflict between the two main characters is more mezmerizing than the fire! This is an outstanding book by my favorite author."},{"Title":"Barriers burned away,","review":"Edward Payson Roe served as a chaplain and war correspondent for the Union army during the civil war. A prominent clergyman in upstate New York, he was deeply troubled by the events of the Chicago fire. Although never having actually seen the tragedy, Roe creates a moving fictional account of the events during and following the fire. The majority of the novel, however, is spent on the most fascinating portion of the book -- a tale of two brilliant but unknown artists: Dennis, a young man of faith, and Christine, the worldly daughter of a skeptic. Although one might naturally assume that the terrible fire would be the climax of the story, the true climax takes place much earlier in the book as the two main charaters draw closer and closer to the inevitable collision of their disparate upbringings. 'Barriers Burned Away' is, by no means, Roe's best novel, but for a first effort it is truly remarkable. Roe's books are like buried treasure. By all means, search for them. They have the power to change their readers' lives. - - Monte Wilson"},{"Title":"Religion and natural law: Hulsean lectures","review":"To tell the truth, with Christmas holidays and all the business, I have not even opened this book; in fact, I could not tell you where it is right now - probably with my supply of unused Christmas gifts I bought. I will find it and keep it for myself as I am interested in this."},{"Title":"Word Study Greek-English New Testament: with complete concordance","review":"I have in my personal library (hardback and electronic) 70+ bible translations from Hebrew, Greek, Latin to English, German, French, etc. I use the 100% free downloadable E-Sword program (www.e-sword.net) that has 67 Bibles 27 English &amp; 40 Foreign (Asian, European, African, North/South Americas, &amp; Australia) including Greek/Hebrew MSS of Critical, Majority, and Textus Receptus; 15 Commentaries (e.g., Matthew Henry); 13 Dictionaries/Encyclopedias (e.g., Vine's); 7 Graphics (e.g., Rev. Larkin's &quot;Dispensational Truth&quot;); 37 Christian Classic Books (e.g., John Calvin's &quot;Institutes of Christian Religion&quot;; 3 Devotions (e.g., Spurgeon's &quot;Morning &amp; Evening&quot;). In addition, I have used hardback Interlinear Bibles (Marshall's, McReynold's) as well as those on E-Sword.After taking Greek Courses online, I have found the YLT is the most-accurate/best of all English Bibles Old and New Testament (w/ Darby a close 2nd) of all time-- better than ASV 1901, NASB, NKJV, or any other formal/literal translation.Dynamic translations are not as accurate, but readable (e.g., NIV, RSV, NLT); however, the interlinear translations (Young's, Green's, Darby's, McReynold's, Marshall's, Morris') are the most accurate than the formal translation (KJV, NKJV, NASB). Dynamic translation translates using a &quot;thought-for-thought&quot; methodology whereby the translator &quot;translates&quot; as well as &quot;interprets&quot; the bible. This allows the &quot;translators&quot; to become &quot;commentators&quot; whereby he/she can interject (consciously or unconsciously) his/her doctrinal bias which are not supported/found in the Original Greek and Hebrew O.T. and N.T. The Formal and Interlinear/Literal translations translate using a &quot;word-for-word&quot; method whereby the translator &quot;translates&quot; only. This prevents him/her from interpreting or inputting any doctrinal bias not found in Original Word of God (Greek and Hebrew Manuscripts). The Interlinear translation is more accurate than the Formal because it follows the Greek Grammar and Syntax (word order), while the Formal follows more of an English Grammar and Syntax to improve readability, but at the cost of pin-point accuracy. The Interlinear translation has the Greek text with his translation underneath each Hebrew &amp; Greek word.So after comparing for the 5+ years the following Interlinear translations of Old &amp; New Testament [Jay P. Green's LITV, Zondervan' s Parallel N.T. by Alfred Marshall, Young's Literal Translation (YLT), Analytical-Literal Translation (ALT), Darby's Translation, Morris's Literal Translation] as well as formal translations (ASV, Amplified Bible, NASB, NASB update, NKJV, MKJV) with respect to the Greek and Hebrew, YLT is the best with Darby's as a strong 2nd place. Because it follows the Hebrew and Greek Grammar and Syntax the best of all.The only disadvantage of YLT is that it does not use the latest Critical Texts as NASB. However, the Textus Receptus (YLT, KJV) and Critical Text (NASB, NRSV, NIV) agree 99.9% in the text and the footnotes at the bottom of NIV, NASB, and NRSV, since all include the ending of Mark 16 and John 8 adulteress woman. Anyway, Darby supplements the difference between Majority text vs. Critical text if one is picky in this respect. [NOTE: McReynold's Interlinear is the BEST N.T. translation than even YLT or Darby's; however, it does not do the Old Testament!]If you have any further questions, e-mail me at wjcharliee@hotmail.com and put in the Subject Line: &quot;E-sword&quot;."},{"Title":"Word Study Greek-English New Testament: with complete concordance","review":"I bought this for my scholarly son who is studying to be a congregational leader.

McReynolds provides one in this book. It is very literal, therefore it is difficult to casually read.His stated goal is to try to assign one English word per Greek word. Although this is helpful for consistency's sake and allows you to read a Greekified English, it doesn't help if you are curious to see how he translates a particular occurrence of any given word compared to another translator. For example, if doing a translational study of the Greek word &quot;mello&quot; by comparing translations by Young, Marshall, Berry, Comfort, Farstad, Green, and McReynolds, you will find that McReynolds translates every occurrence of &quot;mello&quot; as &quot;about to,&quot; whereas the other translators try to differentiate various shades of meaning. For such a comparative study, it would be almost useless to consult McReynolds' work.But laying aside this one limitation and returning to strengths, McReynolds provides Strong's concordance numbers for every Greek word. He also helpfully differentiates between the singular and plural &quot;you&quot; in his translation. Greek verb tenses are translated carefully herein. Furthermore, he provides a concordance of his own, based on Greek words and not English, which is quite useful. Finally, he lists the page numbers where you can find discussion of each Greek word in several popular lexicons. All of this between two covers!

NRSV is in the margin. (BTW, the NRSV is an ok translation, it matches the UBS4 text quite well, even though I prefer either NASB95 or ESV).Strongs numbers are above the word and a complete concordance in the back based on Strongs number.Each word is always translated the same way in the interlinear no matter how appropriate that may or may not be. This is good and bad of course. In my opinion it is good because it highlights when the same word is being used in different contexts and is very useful for making an unbiased translation of your own.It is a big bulky book.

First, the impeccable UBS text--4th edition! For the serious student, the straight text itself is probably worth the price Amazon charges for the entire toolbox.Second, a great literal interlinear text. I never study the Greek New Testament without the lexicon close at hand; but this interlinear is great as a prompt for the casual contribution in group Bible study or Sunday School. Some people will say it is wooden, but it is not meant to be a substitute for a translation; it is not meant to flow but to prompt the reader as to the significance of the word.Third--and the main reason I purchased this book--is the terrific Greek concordance. The numbers are Strong's, which is great for anyone using other similarly keyed study tools; but every single word in the text is keyed, and every single text--every usage of the given word--is listed. Verbs and nouns are listed in their lexical forms. If you want to make a comparison of the uses (for example) of AGAPAO and PHILEO, it is all at your fingertips.The fourth great tool--almost like a bonus thrown in for being one of the first ten callers--is the parallel NRSV text, in detail with its footnotes. The NRSV is my personal choice for both study and devotional reading. Its textual soundness is virtually without parallel. It is just the thing to complement this great package--kind of like the handle that fits all of the other tools.I don't know how this work had esceaped my attention in the past; I will not be without it again.One more thing: I had priced the hard copy edition at a bookstore chain, and seeing Amazon's price I expected it to be paper--it wasn't!"},{"Title":"Word Study Greek-English New Testament: with complete concordance","review":"The interelinear portion of this book is great and many of the other reviews have done a fine job of explaining why.

A complete work."},{"Title":"Word Study Greek-English New Testament: with complete concordance","review":"This interlinear is good in that each Greek word has a Strong's # above it, to easily find the word in a Greek dictionary that uses Strong's numbering system. However, if you are serious about delving into the Greek, it seems that you would eventually want to at least learn the Greek alphabet, in which case you would not need these numbers to look up Greek word definitions. Also, the type is easy to read. Also, the book contains a Greek concordance at the back, to quickly see where a particular Greek word is located in the NT.First, let me preface this review by stating that I am an extreme novice, in the serious study of the scriptures, so don't regard my opion too highly.I do not trust any one completely, when it comes to the matter of my own salvation, which is very much dependent on my understanding of scripture. I have what I regard as a healthy contempt for doctors of divinity, and conferred degrees; all people are subject to common human frailty, and are thus subject to being deceived, no matter what seminary they attend, whatever academic degrees they have obtained, and however sincere they may be. Once a concept is accepted as true, it generally is highly resistant to being rejected, even after the light of truth has revealed it to be error. What I am trying to say, is that generally, children in a Baptist Sunday School class, generally grow up to become Baptist theologians, and Lutheran children likewise usually grow up to become Lutheran theologians, and so on. I know that all theologians have their own particular set of presuppositions and biases, and these biases necessarily affect their interpretation of scripture, even though they may strive valiantly to resist all subjectivity, when called upon to perform the holy, sacred, and even frightening work of translating the scriptures.McReynold's has chosen a scheme of scripture translation, which only renders a single English word, for each Greek word. That is, he has not sought to enter into speculation regarding which shade of meaning a Greek word has, depending on the context of the passage, nor I suppose, it's grammatical placement (where the word is placed in the sentence), as well as other factors that I am not seeing, due to my great ignorance. This may seem like a severe drawback, and to some extent it probably is. However, consider that it has the advantage of being relatively free from the theological presuppositions and biases of a translator, who sincerely tries to help along the scripture, to say what he believes it is trying to say, and you will then see that McReynold's translation is inherently more trustworthy in this respect. To my knowledge, no other interlinear, nor Bible version, is translated this way.Being that I am so easily deceived, because I have virtually no background in Greek, I find this interlinear to be a preventive bulwark against the subtleties of man. Better yet--if I understood biblical Greek fluently, I could generally dispense with using interlinears; but for now, they are a necessary help, to bridge me over to the original writings, to some degree at least."},{"Title":"Word Study Greek-English New Testament: with complete concordance","review":"This is a great find for anyone that wants to study the Bible.

Handy and thorough, one of my favorite tools."},{"Title":"The Evil 100","review":"The editors of this book have put together a list of 100 undoubtedly evil people (mostly men, but including poisoner Catherine de Medici and real-life vampiress Elizabeth Bathory as well as one or two other women)distilled down to 2-3-page summaries covering their lives, their actions, and usually a little bit about their motivations, though frequently these are facile one-sentence comments such as \\"infidels cannot be allowed to live.\\" Most notable are the frequently lurid descriptions of the actions of these people, some of which, such as the uncensored reprinting of mocking (and graphic)letters murderer Albert Fish wrote to the parents of two children he had killed, cooked, and eaten, are not for the easily sickened. Though body count and continuing influence are important factors, the editors also use a somewhat nebulous \\"glee factor\\" and the depravity of a subject's action when determining rank.The usual suspects among this world's tyrants and democides top the list (Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, and so on, as well as terrorist bin Laden and a group listing for the tyrannical Taliban), but after about 30 it quickly shifts to a list of mass murderers, including the well-known (Dahmer, Bundy, Manson, Gacy, Berkowitz), the not-as-well-known (satanist Richard Ramirez, white-hater Mark Essex), and the unknown (The Boston Strangler, Jack the Ripper). Places on the list also go to Columbine shooters Harris and Klebold and a general listing for computer virus writers.Some villains of the medieval period rank surprisingly highly, Genghis Khan, Attila, and Ivan the Terrible all appear among the top 10. Though Khan, who conquered most of Asia in a very brutal manner, probably deserves to be there, and perhaps Ivan, who set a pattern for repressive government in Russia also does, but Attila, brutal as he was, was largely unrealized possibility, for after his defeat at Chalons the odds of his dominating Europe vanished if ever they were there, and I question the high ranking of such an ephemeral person. Likewise highly rated is Basil the Bulgar-slayer, who blinded 14,000 captured prisoners, but was no more a tyrant than most to sit on the throne in Constantinople. One crime, it appears, can sometimes vault one very high on the list, though it may not have tremendous influence. Enver Pasha and Talat Pasha, who engineered the genocide of the Armenians in the Turkish Empire, share a high spot on the list, certainly merited, although none of the sultans appear.That leads to the question of whether the editors of this book cast their nets wide enough, and turned too quickly to lurid and perhaps topical 20th century murderers to fill out the list. Though no one can deny what the Columbine shooters did was both insane and evil, they were essentially bullied kids who hit back much too hard. No one can also deny that virus writers cause many problems, but almost never death. Yet both are mentioned. Castro, however, is not, nor are Nicolae Ceacescu, Enver Hoxha, nor almost any of the other Cold War dictators, many of whom were even worse to their own people than any Communist ruler save Hitler and Mao. Chile's Pinochet makes the list, but not his counterpart in Argentina Juan Peron, of the days of helicopters departing full over the seas and returning empty and other \\"disappearances.\\" Saddam Hussein makes the list, but not his opponent Ayatollah Khomeini, who sent Iranian teenagers in human-wave attacks against Iraqi tanks and bombers. Mithridates of Pontus, who murdered 100,000 Romans, and Francisco Lopez, who led the nation of Paraguay into a triple-front war in the 1800s that reduced his own population from 1,400,000 to 229,000 and killed 1,000,000 Argentinians, Brazilians, and Uruguayans, all in the name of megalomania, get no mention at all. Likewise, terrorists Yasser Arafat, Jomo Kenyatta, who led the vicious Mau Mau movement in Kenya, and Roger Casement, father of the IRA, get no mention at all.In sum, although the book paints a very good picture of 100 evil people, it is by no means complete or comprehensive."},{"Title":"The Evil 100","review":"This book is a good book, but there are a lot of people who that are not in this book that should be in there.

To be fair I'm not sure either individual should be included in this terribly flawed book, but one was a rather insignificant politician, the other freed his nation from imperialist bondage. Then again, Gandhi wasn't an American so perhaps his death is less significant in the eyes of this particular author.Many of the choices of evil individuals the author makes in this book are arbitrary at best, and many individuals are included simply because of the lurid and sensasionalistic details of their crimes. For example, Ed Gein was clearly insane and should not be included with people who understood the implications of their crimes, yet choose to commit them anyways, yet he's included among the great \\"evils\\" of the world because of the... well... exotic nature of his crimes related to already dead women; while not intending to minimize his actual murders, he is known to have killed only one woman - perhaps three - hardly worthy of inclusion in a book of \\"pure evil.\\" I'm still shocked that this author would seriously include the creators of computer viruses as being in the 100th most \\"evil\\" person(s) in history.In addition to sometimes very poor choices, the quality of the writing is very poor. (...) There are times he simply repeats the exact thing he wrote a paragraph or two before. (...) There are also times when one isn't sure who the author is refering to in a story. What \\"he\\" are you taliking about? The subject of the story? A victim?Far be it for me to tell potntial purchasers of this book how they should spend their money. Suffice it to say, though, that I received my copy as a gift, and I still think I spent too much on it."},{"Title":"The Evil 100","review":"The book is clearly not the most reliable source, but reliability is hard to come by when authors are dealing with biographies of some lunatics like Gaskins, Dahmer, and so on. In fact, there are so many sources online that will contradict another source three more times.As far as the book, the set up is easy. It is a page turner. I found it to be extremely entertaining. Partially, I am giving this book good review because I was not looking for detailed specifics. You cannot ever do. The Evil 100 is just like some of these books that you read about kids who kill their parents, or kids who kill. Unreliable, but fiction-like entertaining.I recommend it for a good entertaining read and as a good first time reference/direction. It is as addictive as wikipedia despite its unreliable information."},{"Title":"The Evil 100","review":"There are many things wrong with this book as a list, and as a discussion of the problem of evil. But consider just one thing. This is a collection of malefactors that Islamic fanatics would approve of. Of course Osama Bin Laden makes number 8, and so do the Taliban and Saddam Hussein. But that's to be expected from Americans. But how could they not admire a book in which 46 of the world's most evil people come from the United States? When you add people from Britain, Australia and Canada you get a solid majority from the Anglo-American world. And so many of their crimes involve sexual perversity and anonymous murder, which clearly trumps religious bigotry and systematic injustice in the author's scale of evils. Basically this is a book that starts off with the most infamous tyrants (Hitler is number one), and after the first twenty and thirty places, goes on to discuss mass murderers and serial killers. The four Presidential assassins are included, and the book rounds out with the Marquis De Sade and virus writers. Aside from inadvertently giving aid to comfort to America's enemies by suggesting it has, if not a monopoly of evil, controlling interest in it, the book is superficial and unpleasant to read. The book combines a shallow moralism with a lurid interest in their subject's atrocities, a sort of pornography for Republicans. The moral questions are not really addressed. For a start many of the book's subjects are patently insane, even by the strict and pro-Prosecutor guidelines of Anglo-American law. Is it useful to describe as evil someone who does not have the capacity for moral choice, or which is constrained by severe psychological problems? Sure, says the author. It doesn't matter that Martin Bryant, the Tasmanian mass murderer had an IQ of 66 or that Caligula may have been suffering from schizophrenia or epilepsy.Reading the earlier entries one wondered how many of the charges against Genghis Khan, Attila the Hun, Ivan IV (the Terrible) or Vlad III (the Impaler, who makes the top 10) are actually true or are just propaganda. Good question, since Vlad III's status rests more on the idea that he was the inspiration for Dracula. The suspicion increases when the entry on Hussein starts by blaming him for the anthrax mailings in the fall of 2001, something which he clearly was not responsible for. The historical analysis is not very deep. Salvador Allende was not a Communist. There is no good reason for having Eichmann appear before Himmler, his superior, nor did he have to face 15 charges at Nuremberg. The book overstates the severity and intensity of the persecution of Christians as a result of Nero, while at the time ignoring his destruction of Jerusalem. Likewise Tojo's treatment of American POWs gets more condemnation than the way the treated the rest of Asia. Mussolini's worst acts, his African atrocities, get little space. And there is much that is missing. Neither Khomenei or the Shah appear; the African slave trade is completely ignored, and so is apartheid. Idi Amin Dada appears, but the perpetrators of the Rwandan genocide are missed. The Belgian Rulers who may have caused the deaths of 15 million Congolese in their occupation of the country are forgotten. The whole bloody subjugation of the Western hemisphere goes unmentioned, so there is nothing on how Pizarro managed to destroy and enslave an entire civilization out of sheer greed. The Thirty Years War, the Crusades, the conquest of Ireland, the suppression of the Dutch Revolt are all ignored. If Stalin's and Mao's famines are to be condemned what about the Irish potato famine or the (several) Bengal famines? Mobuto, Suharto, D'Aubisson, Stroessener and the rulers of Guatemala get no mention. Nor, needless to say, do Hiroshima and Nagasaki. If Garfield's assasin deserves an entry, shouldn't Gandhi's? (Or for that matter the assassins of Indira or Rajiv Gandhi?) Charles Guiteau was just a disgruntled office seeker and Garfield a mediocre politician. The assassins of Gandhi, Luxembourg, Jaures, Rabin, King, Barthou, Bloch, Milk and Moscone were fascists or something close to it. And what about the judicial murder of Thomas More or Margaret Pole? McKinley's conquest of the Philippines involved many atrocities and the death of one in seven Filipinos. Shouldn't he rank higher than his killer?"},{"Title":"The Evil 100","review":"I can't figure out who this extremely weak book is aimed at. As a serious discussion of evil -- something I held out hope for until a couple of minutes after I cracked open the cover -- it is far too superficial and haphazard. A light and fun treatment of the subject? Um, doesn't writing something about evil preclude that tact?Instead, we're left with an an almost random list of people who, at the highest levels, are responsible for some truly atrocious events (Adolph Hitler is first; Ossama bin Laden eighth), then eroding into a list of rapists, assassins, and serial killers at the middle levels, before concluding with the world's most famous sexual fetishist (the Marquis De Sade) and a couple of computer virus writers. Almost half of the evildoers are from the U.S.; almost all are men.None of this is to belittle the horrible to nasty things these people did, though it could be argued that the format of this book does that. The whole concept is similar to learning about food by writing about the hundred most tasty meals ever prepared, or discussing parenting by ranking the hundred best-behaved children ever to be potty trained. It's absurd. Much more interesting would have been an investigation into what kind of psychology makes people evil, or of historical trends regarding the subject.But there are other problems:--How do you rank kinds of evil? The whole process requires some kind of formula based on how much persecution is worth how many murders, that the murder of anonymous masses is worth more or less than a high degree of sexual perversion, a lack of sanity, or a low IQ, and puts a ratio on how much property damage is worth a human life.--Also, how good is the history this information in based on? Comparing the well-documented evils of Nazi leaders with the myth of someone like Vlad The Impaler, the historical character that Count Dracula is based on who is ranked in the top ten and who may or may not have existed ... well, you see the point, which is made over and over again.--There are many factual errors. The number of dead listed for the battle of Antietam is actually the number of men killed, injured, or missing. Chilean dictator Salvador Allende was not a Communist. And no serious commentator has blamed Iraq's Sadam Hussein for the anthrax attacks in the U.S. in 2001. There are many more examples.--Then, as with any top 100 compilation, what about those left off the list? Africa and Latin America are woefully underrepresented. What about the perpetrators of apartheid in South Africa or of the African slave trade? Or Fransisco Pizarro, who destroyed the great Inca capital of Cusco and killed tens of thousands of natives so he could send their gold and silver home, to the smelters of Sevilla? What about Abamael Guzman, the founder of Latin Americas bloodiest rebel group, or Alfredo Stroessener, who ran Paraguay as a haven for ex-Nazis and who left his country a generation behind most of the rest of the continent?In the end, the book's limited value is as a collection of mini biographies of despicable characters aimed at the small niche of people interested in rubber necking at an almost random collection of people who left a negative mark on history. For anything beyond that, this book is not up to the task."},{"Title":"The Evil 100","review":"This book is not reliable for sources or anything else, for that matter. I have not read it, but I know.

The most obvious one:John Wilkes Booth makes the list of most evil (number 94), but Linconln should be there instead. Lincoln is primarily responsible for the deaths of 620,000 people because he could have simply allowed the Confederate states to have their independence. Instead, he launched a military invasion, allowed the demolition of cities which caused starvation and disease. He imprisoned thousands of people simply because they were sympathetic to the Confederacy, leaving them jailed indefinitely, without access to attorneys or a listing of charges against them. He shut down many newspapers and confisticated telegraph companies. He refused to meet with Confederate delegations during the war, which could have resulted in a compromise. The South was justified in seeking relief from the unfair tax burden and their decreasing representation in the senate and house. The constitution and other laws effectively permitted secession. Lincoln was not really anti-slavery and slavery was dying out throughout the Americas anyway (it ended in Brazil, in 1888).Also, referring to the Civil War battle of Antietam, 22,000 was not the number killed. It was the number of casualties (dead, wounded and missing)."},{"Title":"Guitar Today: Book One","review":"One of the best I've ever seen!

I wanted to correct my grammar which weren't very good but Derrida did not help me he was talking difficult stuff.While my grammar was attacked however, Miss Rogers did concede my principal point, which was that Derrida, having constructed his own metanarrative, is as susceptible to wilful misinterpretation through the prism of other metanarratives as he inflicts on others. Moreover, in some of Derrida's earlier essays, he specifically attacks Heidegger for misunderstanding what he means when accounting for his own form of deconstruction. Yet it seems to me - and surely to most? - that the central tenet of deconstruction is this: that authorial intent cannot be guaranteed as ultimate meaning; and that ultimate meaning does not exist. Vive la differance? Or does he need a kick up the arche?Miss Rogers gave me a B- for anyone interested."},{"Title":"Jacques Derrida Of Grammatology","review":"While this book offers up some interesting concepts, I find that much of it is borrowed from earlier philosophical explorations. Derrida's work is an attempt to link language, and the use thereof, to epistemology, but it is an epistemology that is underdeveloped. The concept that everything is &quot;text&quot; is really nothing new. The classical (Aristotelian) idea that thought is built upon two things 1) simple apprehension 2) judgement depends upon the use of language to function properly. I &quot;signify&quot; and then make judgements upon my signification.Derrida is the 20th century nominalist -still in rebellion over whether or not things have meaning in and of themselves -that labels we create can denote &quot;essence&quot;. Problems with insisting that a system of binary oppositions (black / white) is the foundation by which we reason are apparent when we consider terms which have no opposite. &quot;Being&quot; the opposite of which is &quot;Non-being&quot; for instance. This is not a binary, this is a negation. Therefore, much of deconstruction is inherently illogical. Could even Derrida maintain that we can only know the world equivocally and nothing can be known univocally?The issue with Derrida is the problem that many modern philosophers and academics struggle with today -the problem of &quot;specialization.&quot; Derrida's most effective arguments arise within the sphere of linguistics. If viewed from a different perspective, such as that of Logic or Epistemology, many of his assertions appear absurd. This led the French philosopher, along with many of his followers (especially in the US) to denounce traditional metaphysics, and to proclaim the invalidity of prior reasoning. Such an approach is problematic to say the least. If I were to create my own mathematics, I doubt I would be taken seriously.If we consider this a work of linguistics, however, we can gain much from it. While far too complex to summarize here, Derrida's ideas should be taken into consideration, even if his prose (and again, this has much to do with translation) is convoluted. After reading Derrida for an hour, I often find myself picking up a work from Ortega or Marias, just to see the dramatic difference between philosophers who can write, and those who cannot.Other works on linguistics and philosophy that are useful, include those by John of St. Thomas, and Francis Suarez. You will gain more from these two individuals than you will from Derrida."},{"Title":"Jacques Derrida Of Grammatology","review":"Massively controversial, intellectually and rhetorically dense, over-loaded with theoretical apparatus and suspiciously breezy -- this is the public image of *Of Grammatology*, often used as a whet-stone for literature students learning \\"critical theory\\". Despite Derrida's infamy as a \\"foggy froggie\\", there has been no mistake by the \\"tenured radicals\\": Derrida's first major work is nothing if not one of the most powerful pieces of textual criticism enacted during the 20th century. The 60s were flush with structuralism, and the excitement of phenomenology and Heidegger's nearer or further derivatives had not worn off; Derrida, through careful juxtaposition and comparison of various canonical and not-so-canonical texts from Rousseau to Hjemslev, pokes many holes in the \\"metaphysics of presence\\" that continues to hiddenly determine these developments. There is a little sloganeering -- the famous \\"deconstruction\\" (or, as it is helpfully glossed, \\"de-sedimentation\\") of the intellectual tradition appears here, and Derrida does devote a little time to excitements like \\"there is nothing outside the text\\". But he is smart and he is, in his own way, careful: picking apart the obviousness of structuralist dogmas like \\"the only bond of language is the bond of sound\\" and Levi-Strauss' relaxed theoreticism about social critique is no mean feat and no small service. Derrida's importance for literary studies is no accident; by following the twists and turns of the argument (and there is an argument), one learns to read texts more deeply and with a philosophical eclat that does not drown out the concrete text in a backwash of values and social problems.The book has two parts. The first, \\"Writing Before the Letter\\", tackles the problems raised by Saussurean structuralism and its interplay with Husserlian intentionality by studying how \\"writing\\" in an extended sense over-rides phonocentrism; one of Derrida's main concepts, the \\"trace\\", takes the difficulty of authorial intention and pins a structure of signs/concepts to it. In analyzing just why a doctrinaire structuralism fails to capture the possibility of novel thought -- one of Derrida's less-repeated statements is \\"thought is what we know we have not begun to do\\" -- about the world and the mind's reverberation to it, Derrida is not unaware (thanks to a year of study at Harvard) of the Anglo-American tradition, saying interesting things about Peirce and cybernetics. The second part, \\"Nature, Culture, Writing\\", completely dissects Levi-Strauss' enthusiasm for Rousseau, demonstrating by way of Freudian metapsychology and Nietzschean demolition tactics just why one of the more \\"onto-theological\\" thinkers of modernity provides a convenient foil for anthropology's somewhat blinkered enthusiasm for Man. The translation by Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak is wonderful and successfully maintains much of the French quasi-jargon that differentiates Derrida (and Deleuze, for that matter) from wide-eyed *philosophes* out only to edify. This is a very important book, and educated people -- whatever their preconceptions about \\"postmodernism\\" or poststructuralism\\" -- should read it."},{"Title":"Jacques Derrida Of Grammatology","review":"This is deconstruction's nascent tome, written in a style and manner designed to obfuscate rather than elucidate -- a problem associated with many French and German thinkers.The thrust of deconstruction is the unstable meanings of words leads to unstable meanings in texts and elsewhere. Built upon the foundations of de Saussure, semiotics is taken to its ultimate scam, namely that the plurality of readings and dangling verbs and nouns make stable meanings impossible.But alas, Kripke and others have shown that nouns and verbs do have stable meanings, that the logic of deconstruction degrades into its own circularity, and that differences in meanings does not mean there are no shared meanings. What's rude about this book and others like it is that it cannot just say this, but has to create neologism and syntatical abuse after abuse to hint at this thesis (otherwise, the simple declaration of what it is would undermine its very theoretical basis).But, don't be fooled or lulled into silly syntax and semantics that is more giddy and goofey than substantive and think the inpenetrable language therefore substantiates its &quot;non-claims.&quot; The skeptic, which is a core constituency of this kind of book, will always find ways not to agree with others, but that doesn't mean there isn't shared knowledge, much less that language is so unstable as to have any shared meaning.In a nutshell, this is verbose nonsense. It's passe, and it's boring."},{"Title":"Jacques Derrida Of Grammatology","review":"It's okay to not understand Derrida. He's not saying anything in particular. He writes to make himself look impressive and to stroke the egos of those who pretend to understand him, not to clarify or reveal. Alas, I cannot even review the meaning of the text, because if we are to believe Derrida, texts have no stable meaning. So what's the point? Read into it what you want to.The original idea behind deconstruction is somewhat intriguing and dates back at least to Plato's Euthypro, where Socrates \\"deconstructs\\" in so many words the meaning of virtue. But he never denied that it could be defined: only that we too often use words arbitrarily and that we ought to watch out for that.But while Socrates tried to elucidate, Derrida tries to obfuscate. Don't worry if you can't understand a word Derrida is saying: he's not saying anything. As a writer, I have learned that rule #1 of professionalism is that if your reader doesn't know what you're trying to say, it's always your fault. Derrida's intellectual clique won't approve of the rest of us calling out his sophistry, but that's what it is, kids: nonsense.Highly recommended as a crash course in how not to write."},{"Title":"Jacques Derrida Of Grammatology","review":"While it's certainly true that there will always be a gulf between reality and words, communication between reader and writer is nonetheless very real and potentially profound, thanks in no small part to empathy and the imagination. Deconstructionism, by denying presence and instead proposing unlimited differences between signs, dismisses any connection between readers and writers and turns language into a hermetic system separated from the outside world which is, of course, inhabited by people who read and people who write. This is exactly what makes deconstructionism so empty and hypocritical: It rejects traditional metaphysics while adopting a pseudo-mystical position which regards language as some unstable and solipsistic alien creature independent of everything and everyone."},{"Title":"Jacques Derrida Of Grammatology","review":"Really deep. The preface by Spivak is a great introduction to deconstruction."},{"Title":"Jacques Derrida Of Grammatology","review":"The importance of Derrida and his movement is monumental - not for the term \\"deconstructionism\\" (heard frequently without a clue to its true meaning) but for how he has influenced (Western) society. Derrida, like Marcuse, Chomsky, Foucault and others, has moved from his original study to a broader agenda and, like many intellectuals, considers his mastery of one subject transferrable to another. He managed to survive the embarrassing Paul de Man fiasco and has since wisely avoided mention of the \\"Hitler in all of us\\". He has remarked on the authoritarian anti-democratic nature of deconstructionism, treating the subject ironically.This is, allegedly, a textbook of post-Modern thought on language but reads like a didactic, out-of-focus Proust. The writing is nebulous, self-referential, unreadable. He speaks in Orwellian terms equating opposite qualities and words. It is so ephemeral as to lack certitude and for this very reason many commentators fear definitive statements on the subject. Deconstructionism is, despite all the twaddle, inherently subjective. He muses on expression, anxiety, emotions, signs and existentialism, finding meaning and interpretation where there is none. His popularity rests entirely on academia and like-minded camp followers in the media. I mean, how many Iowans care about the \\"ultimate\\" meaning of allusions? The problem with the ouevre is that when taken seriously, it literally make mountains of molehills.Such as, well, equating fairy tales to S&M; sagas, symphonies to invitations to rape, skyscrapers to phallic power trips, signs of \\"white\\" recycled paper as racism and stuttering as aggression. Allusions are, in Derrida-speak, fraught with deep meaning. To accomplish this one must divorce words from their sources and stated intent. The critic has been necessarily elevated above the author since only he can provide a \\"true\\" meaning. It is so outrageous that few outside of the Ivory Towers give it credence. That would be a mistake. Language is perhaps the most human of all abilities and its interpretation affects our personal and collective consciousness. His method has been called the \\"language of cultural Marxism\\" and is a necessary component of modern leftist ideology. At any time I expect Jacques Derrida to announce, like Alan Sokal, that it has all been a collosal joke on both the true believer and the reader."},{"Title":"Jacques Derrida Of Grammatology","review":"Derrida's wit is super and he really knows how to be profound.

Derrida thinks he is saying something so deep but he can't say it right, he always uses strange words that I don't know the meanings. I can't find them in my dictionary and I even have a French one. If he knew what he was talking about then maybe we could start talking, but he never makes his point. For example a real philosopher like Kahlil Gibran (remember &quot;The Prophet?) never wastes time but gets to the point. I think Derrida would like to be like Kahlil Gibran but he's going to have to work at it."},{"Title":"Jacques Derrida Of Grammatology","review":"This text is worth the effort and cost, if only for the fantastic introduction by Spivak -- perhaps the nicest introduction to Deconstruction available.

Hillis Miller."},{"Title":"Jacques Derrida Of Grammatology","review":"This book is not for everyone. Derrida's poststructuralism made several new critical approaches possible, and his contribution to the analysis of language is interesting at least for that. If you are not a fan of Deconstruction, which means looking at the different parts of a text and how they make up the whole (rather than Destruction, which would mean taking apart the house), then this book is obviously not for you. You are looking for Harold Bloom, and you will find him. My suggestion is that you read this book only if you have an open mind and the desire to test your perspective on a number of subjects against that of one of this century's great philosophers."},{"Title":"Jacques Derrida Of Grammatology","review":"When I first tried to tackle this book I was a first year undergrad philosophy and logic student - I declared Derrida my arche-enemy.Three years later I am devoted to Derrida.I eventually managed to push down the frustration (and at times, the blind rage) I felt at reading his stuff and took my time to follow him where he wants to take us.Derrida is important for thinking, whether or not you agree with what he is saying.Derrida's greatest lesson is forcing us to look closer, he wants us to pay attention to what is really going on (or at least, to pay attention to other possibilities that may be at work)"},{"Title":"Jacques Derrida Of Grammatology","review":"Whatever all the British traditionalists and analytic philosophers say, Derrida is obviously highly intelligent, but the problem with his work, including this one, is that he just never gets anywhere.

The people who are too stupid to understand Hegel, Heidegger, Sartre and metaphysics in general tend to criticise European philosophers unfairly, but in the case of Derrida, while he certainly isn't the meaningless charlatan they claim him to be, you get the feeling you're being cheated when you read his books - it's just a massive, complex, intellectual joke."},{"Title":"Jacques Derrida Of Grammatology","review":"How long can a philosophical movement last before it exhausts its methodology and goals? Does it take decades or centuries, or maybe even thousands of years? A more appropriate question might be: how long can philosophy itself last before it is labeled as superfluous and subjected to the questioneering of an impatient and caustic interlocutor? Philosophy is usually presented as a conglomeration of schools of thought, each of these having a well-defined set of tools for investigating ultimate foundations of truth and reason. Its practitioners have been guarded in their systemization. Criticizing each other vociferously, they all agree though that philosophy has intrinsic worth and should be sustained. After all, philosophy sets the foundation for science, ethics, art, culture, and politics. To end it would pull the rug out that lies underneath the table of civilization. To end philosophical discourse would make us all hopeless wanderers with no discernable direction or purpose.A colleague once told me that this book should be read as a reaction against French structuralism. This may be true, but I see it as a literary project to indulge in the excesses of Nietzschean/Dionysian ecstacy. It is an attempt to take a break from philosophy, to put on oversized white shirts and with a sloppy oil paintbrush, disfigure the classical works of Western philosophy. It is, to quote the translator of the book, an attempt to become \\"intoxicated at the prospect of never hitting bottom\\". The movement of deconstruction reacts against the stealth of the philosophers, who try to cover their literary tracks. Deconstruction exposes the so-called solidity of philosophical texts, exposing the hierarchies they construct as fragile, and removing them with delight.The translator has written a superb preface to this book (and also explains why such a preface is appropriate). The Hegelian/Nietzschean/Freudian/Husserlian influences are readily apparent in the author, as the translator brings out with great clarity. Deconstruction has become almost a school of thought in itself now, and it was making the front pages of newspapers fifteen years ago. If one objects that deconstruction should be examined using its own strategies, that its practitioners should become themselves \\"bricoleurs\\", the deconstructionists agree. The translator explains this as both a \\"search for a foundation\\" and as \\"pleasure of the bottomless\\". The process of deconstruction thus acts against itself, as well as others. It is never to be arrested, for no text can be deconstructed in its entirety. Thus deconstruction permits no ending, just as no book can claim an ending in its view. The logocentrism of Western philosophy is in its scheme mere word salad, and it acts against it with glee.The creative process is disorganized, intuitive, nonlinear, and frequently executes a random walk in conceptual space. It grabs at every straw of insight, and sometimes desparately makes claims about these ideas that uproot them from their origins. In addition, the codification of these ideas in the written word sometimes contains remnants of the creative process. Thus an oral tradition is frequently needed to accompany these texts, to explain and interpret what has been lost in the printed page. Hence the spoken and the written are mutually symbiotic. The deconstructionists though fail to see this symbiosis, and ignore the oral tradition. They view this tension in texts as a window of opportunity, and spend inordinate amounts of time wandering in them, getting lost in the process. As they read, they make decisions rapidly and on-the-fly, and they are nervous and guarded at all times against succoumbing to the tyranny of logic and order. But they inadvertently find resting points, in spite of their attempts not to. Their texts of deconstruction thus become mere diaries of their journeys, tiresome to read, and completely inert and useless."},{"Title":"Jacques Derrida Of Grammatology","review":"Of Grammatology is somewhat of its time, but it has cast a long shadow. The book's language is dense and vertiginous by turns, often rhetorically masterful even as it probes the resources of such mastery. A particular difficulty for many readers is the way in which Derrida mingles commentary and paraphrase, restating and reshaping the texts under discussion; it's interesting to see how many different opinions are attributed to the author by different commentators (he is either the very spit of Rousseau, or of Plato, or a poor Algerian knock-off with a curdled prose-style tacked on like a fake moustache).Actually, Of Grammatology is a marvel of idiosyncratically reverent close reading, incisive and eccentric, which honours the era from which it detaches itself and prefigures in its concerns much of what is now worried at under the headings of cybernetics and information theory. I'm dubious about its value as an instrument of undergraduate curricula; it wants a different kind of attention to the kind paid by all but a few students, and tends to make the few in question rather conceited. But this is autobiography. Why not try mingling it with yours?"},{"Title":"Jacques Derrida Of Grammatology","review":"Jacuqes Derrida, like many of his cacique clique, had what I would call a conditional aura of possible brilliance. Similar to what can be found around the works of his contemporaries such as Foucault,Lacan or Barthes, Derrida is only brilliant, only mind-numbing if you believe in, and follow the structure that he has created for you. This was a similar form in the writings of Foucault, his ideas of knowledge/power/discourse/domination, while attractive when you're hope is to jingoistically numb and verbally gibberish language til the point where you have philosophically altered all beyond repair control or hope of restoration, and then can claim to of attained a hidden or shourded apex of monumental brilliance through the elite code speak which you just created, facilitated and were a willing participant to.In other words, Derrida is only as smart as you think he is. Regardless of what any number of critics proclaim, he, just like all like him (including Barthes) fall into the traps which Barthes so proudly outlined in his Myths texts. The problem with each philosophes of this mettle is that they claim a strucutre, while consistently creating their own around this unknown and unfathomable structure. This is best exemplefied through the Derridian claim that speech and writing belong to the same form of communication he terms &quot;arche-writing.&quot; This is mind blowing if you follow his logic and play the game within the rules he deans you. However in any other discipline on any other field with different rules, his logic is as flawed as his hairstyle.My favorite deconstruction of Derrida is a post-colonial one, which I don't think anyone has really made yet (at least to my satisfaction). It is so very interesting that in page after page of grammatology, Derrida caresses the visage he creates, lathering it down in imagined/partial/ridiculous freedom, announcing his feats, while falling into his own logic traps, which by his rules and mine, he can never actually escape. To someone such as me, who thankfully(hopefully) sits somewhere outside the Centre Derrida is ridiculous not because he is difficult (which he really isn't), but because he never truly realizes that his liberation is just as false as The French Revolution or The Emancipation Proclamation. By giving us notice of what he sees as a crime against humanity, the marginality of writing from Speech in Western Civilization, he locks back up the non-European nations/ non-first world and non-industrialized nations within that context, by speaking for them, by speaking about writing and speech as if Grand Europa controlled all the cards in this hidden structure the world is organically connected by.Derrida once attacked Foucault for speaking for the mad, from a point outside of madness. I make a similar point for this text."},{"Title":"Jacques Derrida Of Grammatology","review":"...floating in the philosophical Sea of Circumlocution.The wondrous thing about deconstruction as Derrida writes it is that it could even deconstruct the criticism that it's incomprehensibly turgid. All you'd need do is invert the criticism, questioning its premises and in effect turning it back on the critic: an old philosopher's (and lawyer's) trick disguising itself as a postmodern innovation.In any case, I don't deny the necessity for Derrida's work and find various aspects of it challenging and stimulating. But I get mightily irritated with the constant word games best left to poets, most of whom eschew verbosity and ground themselves in the soil of daily lived and felt experience. Derrida's gymnastics obscure what they ought to be clarifying (unless one claims that the point is to obscure in the name of overturning our usual notions of clarity...see what I mean?).In Zen, the koan &quot;deconstructs&quot; the student's stucknesses until nothing is left but the experience; in Derrida, deconstruction deconstructs even itself until there's nothing left at all. If intellectually gifted writers are going to resort to such showy maneuvers, they may be right to object to a charge of nihilistic grandstanding, but one would hope they'd see the shadow of truth in the accusation."},{"Title":"Jacques Derrida Of Grammatology","review":"There are a number of books on the market whose titles begin with &quot;Of&quot; (&quot;Of Mice and Men,&quot; &quot;Of Course I Can Cook&quot;) and I have generally enjoyed them. This particular work is less satisfying on a number of levels, not the least of which is its rather uncompromising use of the letter &quot;P.&quot; Still, the plotting is exciting, the characters vivid and their portraits poignant. But in the end, can it really be said that the structures of perception inherent in our language can reveal parallel structures of domination and oppression in the political world? More importantly, can it really be said without using the letter &quot;P&quot; quite so much?Readers who are interested in this subject matter may want to investigate some of the later works of Sean Hannity and Ludwig Wittgenstein, whose treatises on language and morality used a much richer selection of hard consonants."},{"Title":"Jacques Derrida Of Grammatology","review":"I have no idea why this book is so influential. The critique of &quot;logocentrism&quot; is flat-out boring and basically a rehash of Plato's critique of the shift in society when the written word came into play. Derrida is certainly not a new nor a creative thinker, and he really does not write very well. There is a certain stylistic flow to his prose, but the book is filled full of gobble-de-gook that makes little sense. Okay, so Derrida is celebrating the play of language and the creative aspects of miscommunication -- writing of the margins and white-space so that he calls into question the standards of written prose. So what? Is this useful? Is it accurate? Does not making sense make any sense? Even when one breaks through to the few segments of writing that are even remotely understandable, the arguments that Derrida makes are really dated. They are drawn from obsolete and racist theories of unilinear cultural evolution that has been discarded by reputable anthropologists for well over 70 years. There are no &quot;traces&quot; of grammatological signs hidden in the unconscious. The book is little more than a pseudo-intellectual excursion and descent into the etymological fallacy."},{"Title":"Jacques Derrida Of Grammatology","review":"Derrida is deep and profound in his philosophy in linguisitc yet fail to grasp the techniques of using languages himself. HE CAN'T WRITE! This book, like all his other works, is difficult to comprehend!"},{"Title":"Jacques Derrida Of Grammatology","review":"In the context of Derrida's early project - to provide a critique of the foundational human science - linguistics - Of Grammatology is an essential book. In it he develops ideas about \\"writing\\" and about the \\"trace\\", ideas which illuminate much about the modern science of linguistics. His work is an astringent when applied to other more \\"analytical\\" philosophers of language (e.g. John Searle).Derrida's writing style may seem difficult at first, until one realizes that it embodies two other important ideas - play and undecideability. Of Grammatology is not exactly a book of philosophy, and not exactly a book on linguistics, and not exactly a literary work but one which rests uneasily among these three disciplines. By not drawing conclusions, by keeping in play many concepts at once, Derrida manages to provide provocative ideas on mental representations while at the same time instantiating these ideas in the ebb and flow of the work itself.Because of its kalidescopic style, the book can be read for the pure enjoyment of a rambunctious entertainment, and as an important philosophical text, and as a satire, and as profoundly serious.As the academic furor over \\"decontruction\\" dies down, Derrida's work perhaps can begun to be read for its human importance. Those who value an insistent questioning will find a champion here."},{"Title":"Jacques Derrida Of Grammatology","review":"Having spent many frustrating hours looking for the substance in Derrida's many labyrinthine works, I make this suggestion to others: \`Of Grammatology' is the thread text to start your wonderings through the rest of Derrida's thought."},{"Title":"Jacques Derrida Of Grammatology","review":"This volume is central to Derrida's project and is, perhaps, his single most important work. In it, one finds the essentail contentions that inform his other essays. Whether one views, from the analytic tradition, these concepts as indulgent rubish or as culmination of a pre-Socratic force hidden under the ubiquitous effects of Plato and Aristotle, they are critical in understanding the disjunctions of philosophy.While Derrida's writing may be difficult because it is both dense and playful, allusive and iconoclastic,these presentational &quot;quirks&quot; are not empty but tied to the basic structures of his argumentation.Since its publication, popular characterizations of this book have attributed to it positions it does not hold. Derrida is, among his other gifts, a scholar of the first order and behind his statements are close readings of many of the philosphical greats that preceded his effort. This is not the babbling of the manic mind but a huge encounter with the dominant tradition of interpretation.Such a gigantic target cannot be exhausted in one volume, but even if one wishes to affirm the analytic tradition, this volume should be read with the respect and care one gives a worthy enemy."},{"Title":"Jacques Derrida Of Grammatology","review":"I was unable to figure out what this book meant.

It's like, just when I thought it was about to come out and say something that made sense, it seemed to end up saying something else instead. Infuriating. Can someone please sum up what Derrida was trying to say here?"},{"Title":"Jacques Derrida Of Grammatology","review":"I first read this in the eighties, before I was ready. If you want to understand deconstruction, I was told, &quot;Of Grammatology&quot; is the singlemost important text. Then I read the excellent introduction by Christopher Norris, went back and re-read Pirsig's &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,&quot; went back and read Plato's &quot;Phaedrus,&quot; which Pirsig deconstructs in &quot;Zen.&quot; Finally, the pieces came together and it became possible to appreciate Derrida for the genuine philosopher/philologist/phenomenologist/existential thinker that he is.In reading Derrida I find it useful to keep in mind several key ideas: first, language, spoken or written, is subject to the movement of &quot;real&quot; time. Any &quot;now&quot;utterance is necessarily a past &quot;trace&quot; and a hypothetical future. 2nd, language is not the expression of thought; rather, language &quot;is&quot; pure consciousness. All ideas are words, all words are &quot;interpretations,&quot; meanings made by human minds. Hence, there is no escaping the &quot;text.&quot; We can &quot;know&quot; nothing beyond the interpretations of the thinking (language-using/meaning-making) human subject. 3rd, the text, while &quot;intranscendable,&quot; is necessarily inexhaustible, since every signified must in turn become a signifier. Hence, the awesome (dis)play of language by a thinking subject such as &quot;Shakespeare,&quot; whose metaphors never attempt to posit a reality beyond the human world of language (there are no &quot;truth claims&quot; in Shakespeare's sonnets: every meaning can be &quot;proven&quot; by the words which create it. 4th, any &quot;opposition&quot; is more a trick/trope of language than an actual &quot;event.&quot; Speaking vs. writing. male vs. female, white vs. black, life vs. death, ideal vs. mundane, the center vs. the margin are all &quot;provisional&quot; metaphors, more complementary than exclusive: the one term always depends upon the other for completion of its meaning.Finally, just as it is unwise to conflate Christian and biblical understandings about anything, it's mistaken to confuse Derrida with the &quot;liberal, radical fringe&quot; often accused of dismantling the canons and foundations of Western civilization. In fact, Derrida's respect for language has more in common with more &quot;traditional&quot; critics such as Bloom and Kermode than it does with the academic activists, political reformers, socialist zealots who have attached themselves to &quot;positions,&quot; alliances, causes. These latter groupings violate the very nature of language and thought. (Unfortunately, the American public frequently vote for candidates on the basis of their &quot;positions&quot;--guns, taxes, abortion, etc.--rather than a candidate's ability to think and use language.)Frankly, I now find it curious that I once regarded Derrida with suspicion. His work belongs in the mainstream of philosophy and semantics."},{"Title":"Jacques Derrida Of Grammatology","review":"First, the translation is not so much of a translation at all. We know that many French words were borrowed into English. But their usage in English is very different from French. Even if the word looks similar or the same, you cannot just leave it in your translation without translating it. For example, \\"exergue\\" means \\"a space on a coin, token, or medal usually on the reverse below the central part of the design\\" according to the online Merriam-Webster dictionary. But in French, in addition to this meaning, it can also mean \\"citation plac&eacute;e hors-texte, &agrave; droite en d&eacute;but d'ouvrage, d'article ou de chapitre, qui illustre le propos du texte.\\" (i.e. \\"citation placed on a seperate page outside the text on the right at the beginning of a work, of an article, or of a chapter to illustrate the point of the text\\". In fact the exergue is quite easily understandable in French. But if you put it directly into English, it is much less understandable. What does it have to do with a coin? Thus a good translator would use a normal English word to convey the same meaning. It is obvious that Spivak is a great scholar who knows a lot. It is probably not a problem for her to use \\"exergue\\" in the French way in an English text, since she understands the word and it it not a problem for her and also it might sound more impressive than an ordinary English word. Sometimes scholars try to use big words to just sound erudite. I have no objection to using big words as long as the usage is justified. But using big words to sound more impressive is just pretentious. Thus in this translation there are many problems with this kind of lack of translation by using the original French term. Derrida is difficult to read. But he is much better in French. It is only in this English translation that Derrida becomes impossible to read. I am comparing the original French with the English translation. I find that the original French is much more understandable. In addition to using French words in this English translation, the translator also uses a lot of French syntax. Many sentences in the translation sound very \\"fragmented\\". If I were to translate this text, I would definitely change the words around to make the English more flowing.On the other hand, I find Derrida very abstract and repetitive. His ideas are not exactly that difficult to understand. The central points are pretty straightfoward. But I have to say that although textual analysis is a nice technique, Derrida himself didn't provide lucid textual analyses with ample citations in this work. We would have to read long pages without any citation although he keeps referring to the works and authors he is going to cite. Also I have no objection to using big words. But Derrida uses really abstract words to refer to something that's quite easy to understand if said in plain \\"French\\" or English. I also find the constant use of the \\"A of B or B of A\\" pattern very annoying. After reading \\"le temps de la ligne\\" and \\"la ligne du temps\\", we keeps encountering similar play of words. What's the point, other than trying to sound cute? I do think Derrida has a point, but he keeps tantalizing us with the ultimate promise of a point without making it."},{"Title":"Jacques Derrida Of Grammatology","review":"In OF GRAMMATOLOGY, Jacques Derrida examines the relation between writing and Being. He further considers how speech and writing develop as forms of language. His book is divided into two parts: \\"Writing before the Letter\\" and \\"Nature, Culture, Writing.\\" When academics think of Derridean style deconstruction, they usually lump the contents of OF GRAMMATOLOGY with \\"Structure Sign and Play in the Discourse of Human Science\\" and \\"Differance.\\" In all three works, Derrida posits the idea that all of Western thought, language, and culture are based on a rarely examined given--that human beings live their lives under the shared illusion that there exists an eternal and fixed \\"center\\" from which all else flows. This center has many variations--God, truth, love, man--all of which are seen and understood in terms of polar opposites or binaries: God/devil; truth/falsehood; love/hate; man/woman etc. Derrida took this view from the writings of Ferdinand de Saussure who argued that the left/right division could make sense only if there were clear and marked differences between them. De Saussure also wrote of signifiers (the \\"sound\\" of a word) and of signifieds (the abstract concept that the sound puts in the mind of the listener). What Derrida did to Saussure's theory was to take a theory that clearly linked words to words and ideas to ideas and added something new--that these signifieds could never point to their \\"real\\" referents. There never was nor can there ever be a \\"real\\" referent. What Derrida was suggesting was that signification was far more than the mere spatial differences of Saussure. Signification must now include temporalization, a fancy word that suggests that time passes eternally and endlessly as each signified points only to other signifieds like a dog chasing its tail. Derrida calls this useless and never ending search a mask that offers the comforting illusion that the ground underneath one's feet is as truly as firm as it feels. Though Derrida asserts that this \\"center\\" does not exist, he nevertheless gives the concept a variety of names all of which mean roughly the same: transcendental signified, metaphysics of presence, and logocentrism. When word leaked out beginning in 1967 what Derrida had written, there was a very nearly universal acceptance that the search for \\"metaphysics of presence\\" meant only that the seeker was hopelessly out of touch with this trendy anti-establishment mode of thought. Even now some forty years later, the vast majority of intellectuals, philosophers, and university professors still profess outright admiration for deconstruction. Sadly, all such believers have been taken in by an extraordinarily elaborate smoke and mirror illusion that cannot withstand close analysis.Those who praise Derrida often gloss over a myriad of his assertions that are ill-defined, incoherent, or simply garbled. Derrida's main thrust in OF GRAMMATOLOGY is to prove that all of Western thought has privileged speech over writing from Plato until the present. As proof, Derrida discusses Saussure as one who privileged writing over speech. Saussure, however, actually privileged speech over writing in that he feared that societies that had limited written records would then be excluded from the intricacies of a melding between thought and writing. Derrida also, without justification, pictures Saussure as a supporter of an entrenched Western ethnocentrism, which Derrida further claims \\"everywhere and always had controlled the concept of writing.\\" Such a sweeping statement as this is typical of the florid and dramatic vocabulary of one who seeks to dazzle with pomp rather than convince with hard logic. As far as Derrida's complaint that writing must always and everywhere privilege itself over speech is contradicted by the following: (a) speaking had long pre-existed writing as a mode of communication (b) some languages are spoken but not written but none are written without being spoken (c) Many individuals today can speak but not write but none barring infirmity can write without speech (d) though there is a very large number of written languages none can compare to speech in terms of intonation.Derrida tends to use a variety of terms that are ill-defined, an unwise omission for one who seeks to validate the acceptance of a radical and revolutionary philosophy as deconstruction. He introduces the term \\"play\\" rather than its more common synonym \\"contrast\\" only to nudge the reader into an unthinking acceptance of an unexpected word in a novel context. Had Derrida used \\"contrast\\" instead of \\"play,\\" then he would have given the linguistic game away since the former requires clear differences between one thing and another while the latter allows Derrida to continue the fiction of an endless deferring of meaning. Derrida uses other terms like \\"trace\\" and \\"supplementarity\\" in a similar unfounded manner. As part of his paradigm that meaning must be endlessly deferred is his insistence that language is a system of signifiers; this is an incorrect quote from Saussure who wrote that language is a system of signs. The difference between \\"signs\\" and \\"signifiers\\" is sufficiently pronounced to call into question the comprehension of one who sees himself as the avatar of a daring and complex philosophy. Derrida, in addition, makes the interesting claim that a signified can become a signifier in an open loop of repetition. As with his other terms, Derrida offers no explanation.Normally, the prose style of a writer should not be used as a marker of illogic. After all, many complex ideas cannot be expressed in simple terms. However, when one notices Derrida's penchant for the grandiose phrase like \\"transcendental signified\\" or \\"metaphysics of presence,\\" one can expect him to justify why the one fancy phrase cannot be swapped for its more mundane synonym. Had Derrida used the phrase \\"certain terms cannot be further extrapolated\\" rather than either of these two, then as with \\"play\\" he would have opened the curtain for Dorothy to see the Wizard pulling the levers of fear.Finally, the fatal flaw of deconstruction is its one size fits all methodology. One might think that a legitimate critic would seek to analyze a topic in a manner that is a challenge to his skills and ability. What does a deconstructionist do but announce that his target is ready to undergo \\"demystification\\" before he uses (incorrectly) Saussure's binary polarities merely to subvert it by turning the meaning inside out. It is ironic that deconstruction, which promised a sophisticated level of thought would emerge as a pointless exercise in dreary simplification."},{"Title":"Jacques Derrida Of Grammatology","review":"Derrida's thought is the primary reason why I inevitably feel an urge to put quotation marks around so many of the conceptual labels in my own writing; he initiates a needful misgiving: Do we really know what we are speaking about when we attempt to speak philosophically? Or is our language so subverted, displaced, and otherwise (blindly) ideological that a lot of the theoretical malarkey that academics put forth just seems to beg the age-old questions of knowledge, truth, meaning, etc.? But wait. We shouldn't lose sight of the fact that Derrida's writing shies away, almost essentially, from authoritative positioning in such matters because his own writing is subject to the same blind alleys and provisionalism that all writing is. In this respect, his writing is always, in a way, winking and playful, but admittedly in an rigorous and sometimes difficult way.Is this book difficult? Yes, you bet it is! But I assure you that it's is as close to entry-level Derrida as any other book written by him. I first encountered the thinking of Derrida in a very watered-down gloss on his theory in postmodernist primer; this intrigued me to pursue him further, to read such things as Beginner's Guides and Short Introductions (which I definitely recommend to those who have either no prior experience with him or no great familiarity with the other thinkers he addresses in Of Grammatology--Saussure, Rousseau, etc.). Of course, you'll discover that these tidy little intros can be oversimplifying in places, but they at least get you to the general neighborhood before your set out on your own.Derrida's writing, because of its inherent need for argumentative clarity and rigor, can at times be difficult to decipher; therefore, do not obsess over every sentence; the overall meaning of the argument is much more important and often becomes clearer if you just plow through difficult passages.Every writing, especially philosophical writing, and even of course Derrida's, is by nature ideological; it works outward from a set of assumptions. There is no other alternative. We cannot start from scratch, from some dreamed-of ground zero where there is no preceding meaning and out of which we may deduce all the truths of the universe. Derrida's ideological vantage is then what appealed to me about him; perhaps never in black and white, but always and everywhere his thinking seems to question authoritative accounts, seeks to expand upon the marginalized element in any discourse, and foregrounds the difficulty in making large and almost mathematical pronouncements in philosophical and other supradisciplinary affairs. These are certain dispositions which align with my own particular perspective, and if they have some resonance with you, and if you come to Derrida having completed a little homework and bringing along a good dose of patience and effort, then you'll likely find this book rewarding as well.A final note on the opposing opinion: Although there is no one camp of thinkers or philosophers which opposes Derrida's thought for one and only one reason, some of the most vocal of his detractors (and I will temporarily assume their voice here) regard him as a proponent of relativism or an attempted (but miserably failed) assassin of the western philosophical tradition. They are less skeptical of a fundamental faith in the general structures of meaning and in the rudimentary capabilities of the rational mind to attain to some variety of truth, however limited. Also, opponents often regard Derrida as a kind of interloper in the field of philosophy, that he should putter around with his obscurantist games in the narrow field of literary theory where he belongs. Therefore, if Plato, Descartes, and Locke seem like more feasible philosophical pursuits, Derrida probably (1) won't convert you and (2) won't be to your liking. He doesn't put forth a philosophical system, and neither does he assert an epistemological framework, so you won't find the kind of concrete, axiomatical philsophical claims common to pre-modern and early modern philosophy."},{"Title":"Jacques Derrida Of Grammatology","review":"Gayatri Chekravorty Spivak has done justice to this famous (some would say infamous) work of philosophy and literary theory. Derrida's Grammatology exploded like an intellectual bomb in American and European literary circles upon its publication, and it has remained the source of considerable debate and often vituperative outrage within the halls of academe. Derrida questions the Western privileging of speech over writing through a deconstruction of modern structuralism. A sustained and nuanced reading of Saussure, Levi-Strauss, and Rousseau reveals an ethnocentrism and logocentrism determined by a classical metaphysical understanding of being as presence. But Derrida proposes the centrality of the play of absence and presence as the horizon of significance and meaning, of 'Differance.' With a collapsing of the clean Saussurean distinction between the signifier and the signified, Derrida presents the 'gramme,' the mark, as a productive force in signification. \\"A writing that breaks with the phone radically is perhaps the most rational and effective of scientific machines; it no longer responds to any desire or rather it signifies its death to desire. It was what already operated within speech as writing and machine. It is the represented in its pure state, without the represented, or without the order of the represendted naturally linked to it.\\" 'Of Grammatology is a crucially significant development in 20th century thought. A knowledge of Heidegger, Freud, Nietzsche, Plato, Rousseau, Saussure, and Levi-Strauss is assumed."},{"Title":"Jacques Derrida Of Grammatology","review":"Derrida's \\"Of Grammatology\\" is perhaps his most famous, as well as his best, work. It is a masterpiece of postmodern philosophy and also, incidentally, Derrida's most readable writing.The book is also a kind of showpiece of the deconstructive method: in it, the reader witnesses Derrida's deconstructions of Saussure, Levi-Strauss and Rousseau, all of whom, according to Derrida, privilege speech over writing. Derrida's method is to show how these logocentric philosophers set up pairs of binary oppositions -- such as nature / culture, speech / writing, inside / outside, presence / absence, etc. -- as absolute metaphysical structures which Derrida, acting as a kind of cognitive antigen, then proceeds to attack like a virus landing on the wall of a cellular membrane. In the case of Saussure, for instance, he shows how Saussure sets up an \\"interior\\" in which linguistics privileges the oral tradition and in which writing is seen as a kind of exterior that poses a threat to it, the threat, for instance, of the corruption of speech by written traditions. But Derrida demonstrates how there is a common ancestor to both speech and writing, a type of writing which Derrida terms \\"arche-writing,\\" which enables the formation of semiological differences in an originary sense, thus undermining the opposition between them. Linguistics can no longer be said to have an inside that is protected from writing as an outside if both are descendants of a kind of primordial matrix of signification that Derrida calls \\"differance.\\"In the essay on Levi-Strauss, he goes on to show how the same privileging of speech over writing which has been characteristic of the metaphysical tradition since Plato continues with Levi-Strauss's opposition of oral cultures vs. literate cultures. Derrida recounts how Levi-Strauss, in his book \\"Triste-Tropiques,\\" describes how he introduced \\"writing\\" to a tribe known as the Nambikwara, who did not previously have writing. Levi-Strauss simply distributed amongst them paper and pencils and watched what happened: the people, not understanding writing, began to mimic it by drawing nonsense symbols on paper, including the chief of the tribe, who then used his fictional skill to reinforce his power over the community, thus illustrating Levi-Strauss's thesis that writing corrupts oral societies and introduces violence and hierarchization into them. Derrida, however, cites examples from Levi-Strauss's own texts showing that violence clearly existed amongst the Nambikwara before writing was introduced to them, thus undermining Levi-Strauss's metaphysical opposition between a \\"natural\\" society of oral purity and an \\"artificial\\" one degraded by writing.The metaphysical tradition, for Derrida, has privileged speech over writing, since speech has immediate access to the logos. Speech is a representation of thought, which has direct access to Being, whereas writing is at third remove from being, since it is a representation of a representation; that is to say, it represents speech, which already represents thought. The logocentrism of the west, furthermore, has been a phonocentric tradition in which writing is seen as something secondary, a supplement to speech, a supplement that is prosthetic, artificial and deadening.But for Derrida, the supplement is identical with differance, that is to say, the play of signification in which chains of signifiers constantly defer to other signifiers ad infinitum. There is nothing outside the text, as he famously says, since for Derrida, the text really IS the cosmos, a cosmos in which the absence of a transcendental signified such as God or logos or Being no longer anchors the binding of signifiers to their signifieds. As a result, all the traditional conceptual metaphysical signifieds are gone, allowing an endless deferral of meaning from signifier to signifier. Texts are embedded in other texts, endlessly. Meaning is always deferred from signifier to signifier, unleashing the play of the trace which is a kind of supplemental remainder of meaning that cuts across the traditional metaphysical pairs of opposites.The great metaphysical systems have created meaning precisely by restricting it. They have trapped signifiers into grand systems patterned in binary pairs of opposites that reduce the traces of multiple meanings by subordinating them to the logos and locking them into place, as it were, within these systems. For Derrida, the Western metaphysical tradition is a linear tradition that has captured all the signifiers and locked them into place by repressing non-linear forms of writing. By deconstructing these systems, Derrida is rescuing, as it were, all the traces that have been swallowed up by these systems so that they can now run free in a play of endless reference, meaning and signification that is no longer bound by traditional signifieds.The fate of meaning in the postmodern age, then, is that it is polysemic, multiple and disseminated in ways that allow meaning to become infinite through the play of the traces that surround words like halos of meaning that are irreducible to conceptual oppositions.In short, Derrida's book ranks with the great po-mo classics, like \\"A Thousand Plateaus\\" or \\"The Order of Things\\" as a masterpiece of philosophy, and should be read together with them as part of the shift of the Western mind from pre-World War II German thought to post-World War II French thinking.SEE ALSO MY YOUTUBE VIDEO SERIES ON DERRIDA, ENTITLED \\"DERRIDA'S OF GRAMMATOLOGY PART 1 BY JOHN DAVID EBERT\\"--John David Ebert, author of \\"The New Media Invasion\\" (McFarland, 2011) and \\"The Age of Catastrophe\\" (McFarland, 2012)"},{"Title":"Wounded Man: The White Haired Demon, Volume 1","review":"This book is intense to the point of insanity.

Obviously, Mark Cotta Vaz's book was inspired the revival of interest in the character following the critical success of Frank Miller's &quot;Dark Knight&quot; and the Tim Burton film version of &quot;Batman.&quot; This book does a solid job of detailing the continuing evolution of Batman since the character was first introduced in Detective Comics #27 in May 1939. Vaz looks at the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of the Forties, when the orphaned Bruce Wayne first began his crime-fighting career, the development of the arch-villains such as the Joker and Penguin, what he characterizes as the &quot;benign scoutmaster&quot; days of the Fifties during the comic book censorship uproar, the strange science-fiction/space alien episodes of the early Sixties and the campy late Sixties television show, and the characters return to his root as the apocalyptic Dark Knight. &quot;Tales of the Dark Knight&quot; is fully illustrated by artists from Bob Kane to Curt Swan, Sheldon Moldoff to Murphy Andreson, Neal Adams to Ed Hannigan, all the way up to Frank Miller and David Mazzucchelli. In addition to panels from dozens of comics there are 48 classic covers presented in full color.

You can never finish the book, because one page opens one hundred more books, and when you're done reading those you will find yourself on an endless journey that will only end-or perhaps begin anew-when you enter the spirit world.It is a native belief system that began here, as all of us born in America did-and that has meaning. It is intuitive, yet tangible. Nothing about it is forced, and no symbol or person represents it. It is everything...and it is nothing. You can find its masters here...on this continent. It's not imported from China, Israel, Iraq, or Tibet. There are no human founders, prophets or leaders living or dead who are worshiped. No symbols to rally an army or angry mob behind.In this book, our American ancestors give you a look across many different tribes, each of which has a remarkably similar spiritual essence, born of the land we inhabit. The deserts. The mountains. The rivers, forests and meadows. While I think it is neat to study other religions and philosophies, they all have men, symbols, houses of worship and styles of dress that identify and define them. How well you memorize, display, adhere to and pay homage to these things of man determines your piousness and how well you are accepted into to their community. Indian Spirit frees you from these things.Perhaps one could study Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, Sufism, Judaism, and other philosophies and religions that one respects to nurse out all of the best bits so one can create an amalgam for some personal belief system based on \\"favorite hits\\". But why bother? It's like searching endlessly through junkyards to scavenge parts that are only perhaps cosmetically better than the parts you already have on your car. Oooh...a chrome plated ash tray. Wow, a leather covered steering wheel. Nifty, spoked rims.All the ingredients for a spiritual belief system that is in harmony with our country are here.

Benji was a scared little six-week old puppy when Frank Inn saw him at an Animal Shelter and literally saved his life. This book briefly recounts Benji's road to stardom and features a number of pictures of Benji in a variety of settings. Frank Inn was already a well-known animal trainer, and Benji (who was originally named Higgins) turned out to be the smartest animal Inn had ever worked with. Benji was so talented that fame basically found him on two occasions. On the set of Beverly Hillbillies, Paul Henning just so happened to see Inn (who supplied some of Ellie Mae's critters for the show) working with Benji and selected him as the dog for his upcoming series Petticoat Junction. After seven years on television, Benji retired and began leading a normal dog's life. Then rookie filmmaker Joe Camp came calling to ask for Frank Inn's help in making a movie that would tell the story from a dog's point of view, seemingly a crazy idea to many. Walking back to his car, Camp looked over and spotted Benji resting in the shade; he knew then and there that he had the canine actor he was looking for.There is at least one picture included on every page: Benji as a puppy, shots from Petticoat Junction and the first two Benji films, private and behind-the-scenes shots of Benji, photos of Benji and some of his many fans taken during his national and worldwide tours, and photos taken on the night of the world premiere of the original Benji film. Best of all, though, you get shots and photos from the big night when Benji became just the second animal (the first was Lassie) to be inducted into the Animal Actors Hall of Fame; this is basically the most prestigious award possible for an animal and his trainer.This isn't a very lengthy book by any means, and none of the many photos are in color, but Frank Inn's love for Benji and the amount of satisfaction he felt knowing how many lives Benji had brightened in locations all over the globe are palpable and obviously from the heart. No Benji collection is complete without at least one copy of The Phenomenon of Benji."},{"Title":"The Lady Vanishes","review":"If life is a dream, it must surely be a nightmare from which one cannot awaken This would seem to be the major theme of this book, originally published in 1936 as The Wheel Spins, and from which Alfred Hitchcock made his great movie, The Lady Vanishes.It's a good exercise to occasionally read a book from the past. Styles change, even in writing, and it can be educational as well as entertaining to take that step backwards.Certainly Ms. White knows how to plot. That is, by far, the strongest element in this book. It's somewhat strange to read a book with so little dialogue and so much introspection. And, so many viewpoints. Nearly every character in the book has a chance for internal conversation with his or herself.Unfortunately, in a mystery novel, there must be at least one sympathetic character for the reader to root for, and in this book, the most sympathetic of all is the dog, Sock. A sort of Old English Sheepdog, Sock waits patiently for the return of the daughter of the house, Winifred Froy, who delights in being away from home for months on end. Not just from home, but from country as well, and in the middle to Eastern Europe of the thirties, this can sometimes be a dangerous pastime.Winifred is the \`lady' of the title, but the main female protagonist is Iris Carr, a youngish Englishwoman about to return home after a holiday in an un-named country, perhaps in the Balkans, but filled with mountains and resorts. Her friends have all left a day or two before she does, leaving her to the company of a rector and his wife, a honeymooning couple, and a pair of elderly spinster sisters.They all end up on the same train, heading for Trieste, and further embarkation. Iris is injured, thus putting her in the company of Winifred, and a strange assortment of natives, none of whom can speak any other language. When Winifred vanishes mid-trip, Iris is suddenly informed that not only has the lady not vanished, she never even existed at all! Thus the nightmare begins.The suspense is somewhat weakened by the repetitiousness of Iris's meanderings--physically and emotionally. Finally, in spite of the well-meaning interfering young Hare, his friend the professor, and the villainous doctor, all ends as it should. I think it might be fun to find a video of the movie just to compare notes."},{"Title":"The Lady Vanishes","review":"Published in 1936, this book is a mystery that reflects the social mores of the times. In it, Iris Carr, a wealthy young socialite type is vacationing somewhere in Europe at a mountain resort. She seems to be a totally self-absorbed young woman who is hobnobbing with other rich and self-absorbed young people. Instead of returning home to England with her friends, she decides to stay back at the resort for a few extra days. Thus, she finds herself alone when she suffers from a bout of sunstroke just before she boards the train for home days later.Finding herself trapped in a compartment with uncongenial strangers, she assumes she is the only English speaking person in the compartment. She shortly discovers that there is another English woman in the compartment, a Miss Winifred Froy, who is a gabby, middle aged governess, who is returning home to England for a visit. Somehow, she grows on Iris. Later, Iris later a brief nap and, upon awakening, discovers that Miss Froy not only appears to be missing but seems to have left virtually no trace of her existence!The plot of the book is really quite ingenious and the mystery is intricately plotted. The problem that I have with the book is that there are so few characters that are at all likable. Certainly, the main protagonist, Iris Carr, is anything but likable, despite her efforts with respect to the elusive Miss Froy. Moreover, the writing style of the author is somewhat cumbersome. Still, not withstanding these minor criticisms, this is an excellent, plot driven mystery."},{"Title":"The Lady Vanishes","review":"\\"The day before the disaster, Iris Carr had her first premonition of danger...\\" From her 1936 novel, The Wheel Spins, Alfred Hitchcock made one of his classic tales of mystery and suspense, The Lady Vanishes. It's the deceptively simple tale of a young girl returning to England after a vacation in Europe. Feeling alone, she befriends an elderly woman. When she suddenly vanishes without a trace, Iris tries to solve the mystery, only to discover that no one on board the train remembers seeing her. Although I found the story to be well plotted, the pacing of the book almost slows to a crawl at times, bogging down with inner monologues. Missing is the snappy banter that moves other books in this genre. As noted elsewhere, the dog has one of the better roles.Ethel Lina White wrote several novels that were successfully turned into movies.Her heart in her throat,became The Unseen andSome Must Watch: A murder mystery with a likable heroine and an unexpected ending.is the basis for The Spiral Staircase."},{"Title":"The Lady Vanishes","review":"Originally titled 'The Wheel Spins', after the success of the Alfred Hitchcock movie, 'The Lady Vanishes' it is now frequently known under the new title. The story concerns a self absorbed young Englishwomen named Iris who is vacationing in eastern Europe during the inter-war period. On the train ride home she shares a compartment with another englishwomen returning home after working in the employ of an aristocratic family in the unnamed country (likely Yugoslavia). Iris falls asleep, and when she awakes the lady is gone and noone else on the train recalls seeing her. Iris supects foul play, and a conspiracy of silence among some of her fellow passengers, but she cannot persuade any other English passengers, who suspect that she is either hallucinating due to illness (at best), or a pathological liar (at worst).A fairly entertaining story preying on the fears (and subtly satirizing them) of the tourist in a strange land. Now a days, the story would be about an American tourist in Africa. It's amusing to think that 75 years ago, eastern Europe was the dark and mysterious place, and the english were the rich and condescending tourists. 3.5 stars (rounded up for Amazon)"},{"Title":"The Lady Vanishes","review":"This was a very interesting perspective of attitudes of the time.

Americans still tend to think of Indian communities as living in the past. John Finger gives us a sympathetic and engaging history of the Eastern Cherokee tribe in since 1900. The Eastern Band of Cherokee managed to evade the Cherokee Trail of Tears and remained in their mountain homeland. Not as well known as the Western Cherokee, the smaller eastern tribe has a reservation bordering the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Western North Carolina. The Eastern Cherokee were benignly neglected by the Bureau of Indian Affairs for many years. Finger shows us how tribal leaders took advantage of this neglect to carve out self-determination for their tribe long before the concept became the guiding light of modern federal Indian policy. The book is useful for any student of 20th century tribal life. It also works well in college classes in Indian history or ethnohistory."},{"Title":"Cherokee Americans: The Eastern Band of Cherokees in the Twentieth Century (Indians of the Southeast)","review":"This book provides a history of the Eastern Band of Cherokees over the last century. While many have told the story of the Trail of Tears, few have checked back with the much smaller group of Cherokee who managed to stay in North Carolina.Finger's book provides a valuable and sizeable part of that history. He relies significantly on oral histories, capturing these voices before they disappear. Of course, this reliance on insider perspectives also limits his history as the interaction of outsiders with the tribe is minimized. Because the Eastern Band is very heavily intermarried with non-Cherokee, oral histories of those people who retain the strongest affiliation with the tribe also tends to downplay the stories of those of only quarter or eighth Cherokee blood. While he discusses some of the resulting internal divisions in the tribe, he tends not to obtain the views of those who left the area for one reason or another.Many parts of this story would be interesting for other parts of twentieth-century southern history. For example, the role of Indians in the Jim Crow period and civil rights movement is not at all visible, but it should be. The Cherokee had a very ambiguous status in the North Carolina's system of apartheid. Despite being classified as citizens for the purposes of being drafted in World War I, Cherokee men were classified as non-citizens for the purpose of voting. This may reflect racism, of course, but it may also reflect the strong connection between the Cherokee band and the Republican Party, a connection they shared with other mountain people.Finger does discuss one important outside influence on the Band, the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. He provides balanced assessment of advantages and disadvantages of the national park for the Eastern Band, which has one of the highest income levels of any Indian reservation. At the same time, contact with tourists has worn down the traditional culture of the Cherokee, and has essentially eliminated the language.Despite some of the limitations mentioned above, this is a very interesting and fair-minded account of the Eastern Band in the twentieth century. I recommend it for those with an interest in Native Americans, North Carolina, and/or the Great Smoky Mountains."},{"Title":"Alicia's Song (Timeswept)","review":"Susan Plunkett's Alicia's Song is a stunningly beautiful novel replete with searing passion and genuine love. It celebrates the wonder and tenderness of not only an extraordinary man and woman meant for each other but also of that special love between a parent and child.Alicia James, along with her beloved sisters Bethany and Caitlyn, has since childhood sung in graveyards to bless the spirits of the recently departed. But when the three sing for Yolanda D'Arcy, who was widely reputed to have been a witch, Alicia is swept from her home in modern rural Wyoming to the pristine mystical beauty of 1895 Sitka.Alicia immediately encounters Caleb Marker, a devastatingly handsome, passionate and tender lumberman devoted to Mariah, his bright and full-hearted 5-year-old daughter.After a grueling process in which Alicia-a thoroughly modern botanist with haunting violet eyes-must come to terms with the impossibility of her having traveled through time, Alicia takes on the only work she can find: a live-in position as Mariah's governess.Mariah quickly comes to worship the warm, imaginative and highly intelligent Alicia-whom she longs to have as her mommy-while Alicia and Caleb fight the enormous passion that is growing between them. After a disastrous marriage, the last thing Alicia wants is to fall in love, while Caleb is utterly captivated yet wary of the intriguing \\"wood nymph\\" who shares all his values but will share almost nothing about her past.As mutual passion, respect and a limited trust blossom into love, Alicia and Caleb must come to terms with the secrets they have from one another which threaten to destroy the most extraordinary relationship they have ever imagined.Plunkett writes with such passion and wonder that the reader is spellbound. Alicia's Song reverberates with the lush, wild and fragile beauty of a magnificent setting that reflects an equally magnificent love. The exquisitely crafted characters possess such vitality and appeal that the delighted reader's heart also sings.I was utterly captivated and unable to put down this supremely entertaining, uplifting and life-affirming novel. Plunkett's sensitivity, wisdom and magic with words places her high on the must-read list for any romance lover."},{"Title":"Alicia's Song (Timeswept)","review":"At the Drexel cemetery in the Wyoming mountains, the three sisters sing Christian songs at the burial of local witch Yolanda D'Arcy. No one else including the caretaker Digger Phelps (not the former Irish coach) attend the ceremony. Soon a fog comes out of nowhere and engulfs the female trio.Alicia, a botanist, quickly realizes that she is no longer in Wyoming, but seemingly in the Alaskan wilderness. Her two siblings are not with her, but she is not alone. She is near the home of logging mogul Caleb Marker who is shocked that a governess has arrived so soon. Stunned to realize that she also traveled back in time to 1895, Alicia accepts the job offer especially after meeting Caleb's daughter. As the trio fall in love and have the possibility of forging a family together, he cannot let go of a past betrayal while she worries about her sisters and whether she will return to her proper place in time.ALICIA'S SONG is an entertaining time travel romance that readers will fully enjoy even as they breathlessly await the upcoming stories starring the two siblings. Though a botanist and from a ranch, Alicia's acceptance seems too simple and easy, yet the audience will still adore the chronically impaired heroine. Caleb also leaves quite a mark on the readers, as does his daughter.

Did the writer get tired of writing? Did the editor insist the story really ends here? Will the publisher only allow an average of 320 pages? But I'll confess that my complaints of this book are not only with its abrupt ending. And, I was left with far too many questions at the end of the book.I could suspend my disbelief in the vague, inexplicable way Alicia is transported through time, but I really needed more character development to believe these two people could really cared for each other so quickly. Also, this book held no surprises for me. I predicted every plot turn well before it happened and the only redeeming aspect was the well-written dialogue between Alicia and Caleb (and the love scenes were good). But it just simply felt rushed.For all my critism though, I did manage to finish the book primarily because I wanted to know what was going to happen. The characters are likeable and did manage to hold my interest. And, I might have given it a better review if it had just had 2 or 3 more pages, or at least an epilogue. Many, many times a good epilogue can make up for an abrupt ending.It's rare for me to not give a favorable recommendation for a book.

Most of us have always believed his basic tenet that could not believe that we were being paid to fly for the service. He also reminded me that your primary instructor had the biggest impact on your approach to training other pilots. Thank you !"},{"Title":"Once A Fighter Pilot","review":"General Cook takes us on a life's journey with a combination of insight into the no-longer-available process of becoming a fighter pilot as an Aviation Cadet with the real-world emotions of flying in ever more high performance aircraft through training and combat. As a fighter pilot wannabe since I was about 7 years old in the early 1950's, he lived the dream I could not when I learned I had 20/40 vision in the 8th grade. Now in my 60's I finally get to fly two jets - a Cessna Citation business jet and an Aero Vodochody L-39 fighter trainer, and I can only surmise that the experiences I'm able to have in these two lower performance aircraft represent but a fraction of what General Cook experienced in the fighters he flew. The book is written in a style that reflects the man and his perspective, rather than a heavily edited and polished work of English prose that would have lost much of the realism that comes through in this form."},{"Title":"Once A Fighter Pilot","review":"I met the F-4 Phantom as a 6 inch stack of IBM tab cards.

There are three principle reasons for my saying this:1. General Cook writes in a very informal, almost conversational style, which flows naturally and puts the reader at ease. Reading OAFP, I felt as comfortable as I would have if I'd been sitting down with an old friend over a couple of beers, discussing his career. He writes as he would speak, and there is nothing at all pretentious or stilted about him.2. OAFP is written not with long, drawn-out chapters, but in a series of short vignettes, some only a page or two long. This makes for a very easy read.3. OAFP is one of those rare books about military aviation that is written for pilots and non-pilots alike. General Cook knows that not everyone reading his words will be intimately familiar with Air Force jargon and terms, and he takes that into account, explaining technology, terminology, and procedures, where necessary, in plain English.Jerry Cook began his military career during a time of great technological development and political turmoil, and for those interested in that period of history -- the late 1950s to the late 1960s -- his recollections are fascinating. Whether describing his first encounter with an SR-71 Blackbird, offering his insights into the military hierarchy of the era, or conveying the life-and-death intensity of his 200+ combat missions in Vietnam, he provides the reader with a valuable perspective.Some of General Cook's tales are hilarious, some are gripping, some are tragic, and some are keenly insightful about that period of time in US Air Force history. Put them all together, and combine them with his superb writing style, and you have one of those great books that you simply won't want to put down, and don't want to end."},{"Title":"Once A Fighter Pilot","review":"Awesome book. All I ever wanted to do was fly an F-4 and this book brought me as close as I'll ever get. Written in a down-to-earth manner that was easily understandable; thanks Jerry Cook!"},{"Title":"Once A Fighter Pilot","review":"I haven't had a chance yet to read this book, but Jerry Cook was my primary flight instructor at the Ark ANG when I was taught to fly the RF-101C Voodoo reconnaissance fighter. I also flew with him when our unit transitioned into the KC-135A aerial refueling tanker. He is an outstanding pilot and mentor--I look forward to reading his book and hopefully getting him to sign it the next time I'm in Little Rock, AR visiting my in-laws."},{"Title":"Once A Fighter Pilot","review":"The stories were interesting but sometimes unconnected. It sometimes felt more like a compilation of stories rather than one non-fiction piece."},{"Title":"Once A Fighter Pilot","review":"Once a Fighter Pilot is a book written as a memoir. The author, Jerry Cook, rose from a dreaming kid wanting to fly, to a veteran fighter pilot in Vietnam. His purpose of wanting to write this book was to tell his story of his life, and, to memorialize it so his children and his generations that follow would know what he did in life. Cook was fortunate throughout his flying career, beginning with being selected for cadet school and each challenging step he encounter along his training process.He eventually did get assigned to Phantom F-4's and into Vietnam where his combat career unfolds. His writing style is entertaining, injecting humor and sarcasm to his experiences. This book does read more like a collection of flight reports and sometimes the reader senses a lack of continuity. It's rather choppy reading and annoying. What does come through in pieces is he was both a skilled F-4 driver, and a lucky one. On average one out of three drivers made it back from deployment. Cook lives through witnessing friends being shot down and he shares the turmoil he faces. Every combat veteran experiences this, and he lives with it alone. Cook made it out of the war but remained in the reserves to complete his career retiring bridgidare general. I believe he wrote this book more for himself than to share his war with you. It's more of a diary and it reads like it."},{"Title":"Once A Fighter Pilot","review":"Really interesting account, I could identify with so many of the places referred to in the Nam and since the author was there at the same time that adds to the reality of all that Jerry C writes on"},{"Title":"Once A Fighter Pilot","review":"Writes well for readers who have a connection with flying.

Adding to my apprehension was the timeframe, set early in the Viet Nam War while valuable lessons were still unlearned, and the mere fact that it had anything to do with the Viet Nam War. Though I was born as Saigon fell in '75, I feel such intense and conflicting emotions when reading about it. Anyways, let me just say that General Cook quickly laid to rest all of my apprehension. From page 1 onward I was hooked. &quot;Once a Fighter Pilot&quot; is a chronicle of Cook's Air Force career from enlistment, through training, and finally his deployment to, survival of, and return home from SE Asia. His recollections of his combat experiences are very vivid and involving, especially for the amount of time between the experiences and the writing of this book. Most impressive was Cook's &quot;anti-Maverick&quot; attitude and admission of feeling real human emotions such as fear and sorrow, a rare quality among fighter-jock autobiographies. Most sobering were the General's accounts of losing close friends to accidents and to the enemy. Cook allows those of us who were born after the war to feel the pain and frustration of the generation that lived through it, feelings that bring with them an understanding of why that pain and frustration continue to be felt today. I had to refrain from giving this book a 10 simply because I wanted more. Though Cook acknowledges that many memories have been forgotten or are so blurred to render them untransferable to the written word, I still felt like this man had many more stories of bravery, heroism, high-spirited wit, and sorrow to tell. I highly recommend this book not only to enthusiasts of military aviation, but to critics of those who put their lives on the line in Viet Nam, as well as anyone with an appreciation for good stories about the ups and downs of li! fe, especially stories that are as well-written and easy to follow as Cook's &quot;Once a Fighter Pilot.&quot;"},{"Title":"Once A Fighter Pilot","review":"I've had the pleasure of meeting Jerry Cook and I can tell you he is what an aerial warrior is all about. This means he appreciates not only the firepower that is his responsibility, but also the restraint that is necessary as well. Above all, being a pilot myself, I can viscerally place myself in his rapt descriptions of aircraft performance and raw power. His situational &quot;awareness&quot; and extraordinary flying skills easily flow off the page, and speak to the incredible edge that must be developed and maintained to fight and survive in ACM environments.Jerry, thanks for your service to the country. Although the war was extraordinarily complicated, with no real winners, the fact that you gave your all to your Commander in Chief under the flag of freedom is appreciated and respected."},{"Title":"Once A Fighter Pilot","review":"I've read \\"Once a Fighter Pilot\\" more than once, and greatly enjoyed it each time. It's an intriguing mix of stories about flying in Vietnam, flying at MacDill AFB while the F-4 was just becoming available, and many flight instructor tales. (And sometimes the flight instructor stories are scarier than the ones about flying in Vietnam!) He's opinionated, open, honest, and to the point.I consider this to be in the top 5% of its genre because it covers such a broad area and does it well. There are perhaps better and/or more detailed autobiographies specifically about flying in Vietnam, but this one is one of the few which really covers Air Force life during the 60s. I also like the overall style, it's a series of short tales in chronological order rather than a more continuous work.It's a fun read--you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Once A Fighter Pilot","review":"If you want to get an idea of what it was like to be a fighter pilot during this time frame, this book is one heck of a place to start! Let me assure you, it is the way it was.Highly recommended!!"},{"Title":"Once A Fighter Pilot","review":"The author is my cousin, and I've heard a number of the stories over the dinner table at one or another Thanksgiving long before they turned up in this book; and when you read this book, that's what you get--true tales conversationally told by a shure-as-shootin' warhorse.The best thing about the book is its informal authenticity. Written utterly without a ghostwriter and barely touched by any meddling editors, that authenticity comes through.Stylistically, General Cook may come off looking a little raw, but he spent his life as a fighting man, not a writing man."},{"Title":"Once A Fighter Pilot","review":"This is an excellent story and a rare insight to the real life of an Air Force fighter pilot. One of the major reasons I enjoyed this book was in how little being in the Air Force has actually changed since the days when Cook served.This is one of those few books that actually gives you a sense of &quot;being there,&quot; and it has some touching stories as well as some funny stories. The only problem is the author tends to repeat himself A LOT, so if you read it cover-to-cover (like most people do), you get a sense of deja-vu. Anyway, good book."},{"Title":"Once A Fighter Pilot","review":"Jerry Cook's \\"Once A Fighter Pilot\\" is one of the books that occupies a small section of my shelf reserved for truly extraordinary books written by pilots. Many fighter jocks are good at BFM, formation, gunnery, instrument flying, and other skills, but the ones who can evoke strong emotion through the written word are scarce. My military flying career is past, but this book takes me right back into the cockpit, in a way few books do.This book is the real deal, folks."},{"Title":"Once A Fighter Pilot","review":"I first saw this book in a local bookstore and saw the cover. I didnt really now what it was about, but when I read it it was the best book yet. It is on my Absolute Favorite list.Since I bought the book I have read it over 5 times, and find something new each time. It has also made me want to be a fighter pilot in our Air Force. A must read for anyone."},{"Title":"Once A Fighter Pilot","review":"This book is one man's story about his career in the Cold War air force. This is a collection of rememberences and recollections told with the straightforward style of a man who's flown jet aircraft most of his life.He explains how his parents went from selling auto parts to owning their own Buick and Pontiac dealership in Oklahoma, and how on a visit to them during training he was pulled over by a sheriff's deputy just outside of town. He thought he had been speeding in his Pontiac convertible hotrod and was getting a ticket, but the deputy did a bit of hotrodding himself and wanted to challenge this young pilot to a race. Thinking that the deputy was just trying to get an easy speeding ticket out him, Mr. Cook was a bit cautious. The solution: the deputy would signal the start of the race and turn on his siren and lights so that people would think he was chasing Mr. Cook. It sounded fair enough so off they went to a lonely stretch of highway. They picked a start point and end point and the race was on. Cook's Pontiac took off like a rocket and soon the deputy's hopped-up hardtop was a dot in the rear view mirror. At the end of the race, Mr. Cook got out and the deputy jumped in his Pontiac. &quot;Now we'll race back to town!&quot; he said as the Pontiac shot off down the road. Mr. Cook got in the deputy's car and drove back to town, in no particular hurry since he had proven his point already.He found his Pontiac in the parking lot of his dad's dealership and he could see the deputy in a heated discussion with Cook's dad. Exercising the better part of valor he hung out in the mechanics bay until things cooled down. After awhile his dad came looking for him and asked him if he knew what that discussion was about. Thinking that his joy-riding days were over, Mr. Cook muttered a few things, but before he could finish his dad said that he had just sold a brand new Pontiac hardtop to the deputy and that he had Mr. Cook to thank for it. Cook's dad never found out exactly how the deal wa! s done.And there are a few stories about pretty girls, life, and death, and combat. I haven't gotten to the part where he gets transferred to 'Nam yet, but I expect the rest of the book to be just as entertaining and well-written as the first parts are.This review really doesn't do justice to the book. I think that this book could become one of the classics in my air combat library, along with &quot;Baa Baa Black Sheep&quot; by Gregory Boyington, &quot;Samurai&quot; by Saburo Sakai, and &quot;Mustang Ace&quot; by Robert Goebel."},{"Title":"Once A Fighter Pilot","review":"This memoir was just like it said on the cover. General cook's stories of his early flying days and Vietnam experiences were told lucidly, with humor and never a trace of exaggeration (a trait reserved for Navy personnel). If only there were a couple of hundred more pages to read...! I didn't want the book to end. Although I didn't work at Gen Cook's bases of assignment, I know the places and I worked on both the F-4 Phantoms and the F-105 Thuds which we all hold in such great esteem."},{"Title":"San Francisco's Reign of Terror","review":"As its title implies, this book exposes the sordid history of the villainy and lawlessness of the 1856 San Francisco Vigilantes; a group who took over the city, suspended legitimate law and order, ignored the U.S. Constitution and the rights it grants to citizens, terrorized their political enemies, murdered four men, and even threatened to take over all of California and separate it from the Union. However, Myer's book is primarily the tale of Judge Edward \\"Ned\\" McGowan, a remarkable character who was one of the few enemies of the Vigilantes who, though hounded unmercifully by them, avoided their far reaching grasp, and lived to tell his tail. Myers relates the history of the Vigilante Committee through McGowan's experiences, and in doing so, helps to rehabilitate the Judge's reputation that had been unfairly blackened by his nefarious enemies.Ned McGowan emerges from this narrative as one of the great colorful characters of the Old West. He came to California with the \`49ers, and quickly established himself as one of the preeminent citizens of San Francisco, both as a judge, and as an active player in Democratic Party politics. He was a cheerful rake - the type of man who refused to show shame for enjoying his whiskey, gambling, or keeping the company of select working women. Like many of his time and place, he believed in the gentleman's code of dueling, and was prepared to meet his enemies accordingly. In addition to all of this, he was a writer and poet (though Myers gives him higher marks for his poetry than I believe he deserves). Beyond his harrowing adventures running from the wrath of San Francisco's Vigilantes, the rest of his life was likewise adventuresome. He prospected for gold in both British Columbia and the Arizona Territory. With the coming of the Civil War, he threw in his lot with the Confederacy, joining their army at the advanced age of 49. He distinguished himself while fighting in the Battle of Camp Bisland in which he was captured, and later led a group of Confederate prisoners in taking over the ship on which they were being transported and escaping from captivity. Even at an advanced age, he was still the adventurer, as he was drawn to such wild spots as Deadwood and Tombstone when he was in his sixties and seventies. He never recovered either his fortune or reputation; both unjustly taken from him by the Vigilantes who targeted him, yet he remained game until the end of his days.Though I found \`San Francisco's Reign of Terror' to be fascinating reading, its story is often convoluted and unevenly told. Myer's idiosyncratic writing style is full of colorful and folksy phrasing that while interesting and charming in its own right, here often serves to obscure the complicated story of the machinations of the Vigilante Committee, making those parts of the narrative hard to follow. Myers is at his best in this book when writing directly about McGowan, a character he clearly relished, and I believe, identified with as a fellow poet and rake. It is because of the sometimes confusing narrative that I have rated this book at only three out of five stars, though I enjoyed it, and still give it a qualified recommendation.Theo Logos"},{"Title":"San Francisco's Reign of Terror","review":"This book tells the story of the San Francisco vigilante movement of the 1850's, and the story of one man, Ned McGowan, who barely escaped the vigilante groups and managed to become a real thorn in their side, only to be abandoned and ridiculed by history writers until Myers could refurbish his reputation.Myers' writing style is dense, with many clever phrases thrown in, apparantly for his own amusement. It is a style that can be difficult to cope with at first, but just as a new style of food takes some getting used to and can be ultimately rewarding, the reader who sticks with Myers usually ends up enjoying the ride, as well as eagerly anticipating the next bizarre phrase or incident.A reader who enjoys history and stories of unlikely heroes will be in for a treat with this book."},{"Title":"San Francisco's Reign of Terror","review":"The two previous reviewers have hit the mark. Myers, way too often, stretches for an archaic or obscure word or phrase that stops the reader and obscures meaning. It's clever but highly mannered writing that goes too far, attracting too much (unfavorable) attention to itself, forcing the reader to become a translator rather than an viewer of a scene or listener to a story. Yet the solid substance here, the product of serious reasearch, makes the pain worthwhile."},{"Title":"1001 Ways to Market Your Books: For Authors and Publishers (Book Marketing Series)","review":"Wow, the only problem with 1001 Ways to Market Your Books is that I just found out about it a few months ago--and it's been out for years.

The reviews we have, the endorsements, the press releases and the marketing plan that the bookstores want to see are so nicely presented and thought out, and this is because we found Kremer's book to be so helpful.I also go to Kremer's site regularly (bookmarket.com)for all the free stuff he puts up there, and the free newsletter he sends has always been helpful, and the site and the newsletter, which you can try for yourself, are a mere fraction of the value I have found in 1001 Ways to Market Your Books. Thank you many times over, John Kremer.This is an unpaid and sincere endorsement of John Kremer and his book, 1001 Ways to Market Your Books. Read my upcoming blog to see what other interesting advice from John Kremer we will be using.

Excellent how-tos and easy-to-follow, albeit so much to consider, you might re-think authoring your book at all!

Some of the info is clearly outdated, changed URLs, etc.It is definitely the most complete, comprehensive handbook I own on the subject of publishing and marketing.I highly recommend it for authors planning to get involved with the marketing of your book, even if you have a publisher (not yourself), you will be expected to do your part.

I'm finding it full of ways to move forward. I bought it because it was recommended by Steve Harrison to my Quantum Leap group #11. If Steve recommends something, that's reason enough for me. But I also subscribe to John Kremer's newsletter, so combined, the book purchase was a no-brainer.But feeling slightly lazy and because I love reading reviews, I read the one by the poker player guy titled \\"Stimulating....but you need time, patience, and a plan.\\" It's kind of a passive/aggressive negative review.I was surprised at what I read because John Kremer, like Steve Harrison, is a hugely recognized resource and expert on getting publicity for your book. So that, combined with Steve's recommendation, really made me wonder WTH? when I read this guy's review. If those things - such sloppy work and inattention to detail - were true, Steve wouldn't have recommended it and John Kremer certainly wouldn't be the expert that he is.So the review, by its very substance, left me highly skeptical of its veracity. Then I read the comments on the comment - 3 of which were from John saying the stuff in the review isn't even in his book!I don't know why Amazon still has that comment up. But in case they don't take it down, I wanted to make sure people didn't read it and give it a thumbs up. Ignore it and let it drop to the bottom of the queue.Now, if you're serious about promoting your book, go get on both John Kremer's and Steve Harrison's mailing lists.

Kremer seems to want to overwhelm you with ideas, many of which are marginal at best (e.g. skywriting as a marketing tool)and the result is a confusing mishmash of half-baked ideas. Much of the text is regurgitation of very basic marketing principles you can glean from any marketing text. The book seemed poorly organized and fragmented. Kremer apparently sold \\"ads\\" in his book disguised as short \\"informational\\" articles by people trying to sell various products and services to book publishers.

It also didn't help that the book told me that if I were reviewed in the New York Times, that would increase sales, too.

The title is misleading. It really ought to specify that it offers 1001 ways to market relatively easy to market books. If, for example, you have written \\"The Ultimate Guide to Poodle Grooming,\\" you probably already know what the book will tell you - attend conferences attended by those who groom poodles, advertise in poodle grooming magazines, and try to get excerpts of your book published on poodle grooming websites.For those who write literary books, \\"1001 Ways\\" has scant few suggestions.Also, the book is a bit out of date on some matters, given how rapidly technology changes. Fax machines are not as important as they used to be.The information in the book was arranged in too haphazard a fashion for me to easily assimilate it, and the book actually promotes itself within the pages of the book, for example, buy more copies of this book and distribute them.

The author also includes articles by experts on various subjects, as well as an amalgam of up-to-date links and resources.What sets this book part from others in the field, besides the amount of information, are the details. There are many books on promotion out there, but few go as deep as this one. In this sense, this is an invaluable reference work.Though it is impossible to list all the subjects covered, following are some of them: basic fundamentals of book marketing, planning, distributors and wholesalers, major book reviewers, arranging print/radio/TV interviews, book tours, book signings, advertising (direct mail, finding lists, telemarketing, print ads), offbeat marketing, book fairs and conferences, catalogs, internet promotion, selling to bookstores, libraries, gifts shops and many other retail markets, subsidiary and foreign rights, and much, much more.Kremer explores each subject in depth and offers clear, pragmatic advice on how to succeed at each level of promotion.

Each header's type is boldface which makes it easy to locate pertinent information. And each marketing tool is conveniently numbered. Kremer makes it easy for authors and publishers to use the book as a daily reference.\\"1001 Ways...\\" tells authors and publishers how to build their products and place them properly, how to care for customers, and how to build strong relationships with distributers, marketers, and media outlets. It details approaches for opening new markets and even talks about methods for creating New York Times and Amazon Best Sellers, giving testimonials from authors and publishers that have created successful bestseller campaigns.I got everything that I needed from this book--for now.

That is what you will ask yourself after you read this masterpiece. With all of this information \\"WHERE DO I BEGIN?\\"This book is a monster. It is jam-packed with more (high-quality) information than any other book on the subject. There is absolutely no fluff in this book, which is a drag when you consider how much of it there is to read. Every aspect of book marketing is covered, and I like the fact that JK keep updating it, as the world of book marketing is changing every year. Just on the internet alone: first there were web pages, then myspace, friendster, facebook, blogs, plogs, vlogs, book teaser trailers, reviews, previews, ebooks, audiobooks, iTunes, ebay, and podcastalley! (I sound like Hedy Lamar!)I have read a LOT of books on book marketing, book promotion, publishing, and self-publishing. This is at the top of my list, along with Jump Start Your Book Sales. There are other VERY good books (I will have to remember to make a listmania of them), but this is the one--the Bible if you will--the one above all others that you must read and own and reread. in fact, this book is the think and Grow Rich of book marketing.I will leave the detailed analysis for other authors. The purpose of this review is to get you to \\"buy this book NOW!\\" because at $18.45 (current sale price on Amazon) this is one of the most important investments you will ever make on your career as an author (or a publicist). You can keep reading reviews, or you can buy this book (or even get a copy at the library--but you WILL end up wanting your own copy) and start making serious money.This book will NOT give you a plan. it will not show you step-by-step how to do all of the things it recommends. That is why other books exist. Here's:\\"How to use this book\\"Read it. Mark the ideas that really inspire you. Then go through it a second (or third) time and on a SEPARATE piece of paper write down the page number of the idea you like, write a short headline (3-7 words) followed by a 3-5 sentence description of what the idea is--not why you like it. Do this for all of the ideas you like. the purpose of doing this is to f-o-c-u-s you on what you CAN and WILL do, so that you don't get OVERWHELMED. This book will overwhelm you, unless you are a zombie, which is just cool in its own right.NEXT: Look ate all of the ideas you have headlined and described on paper. you should have a few pages of scribbles, maybe even up to a dozen or so. Now, with the book put aside, type THOSE ideas into your computer. I recommend any word processing software (like MS Word, WordPerfect, Open Office...) rather than a spreadsheet program. The point of this part of the exercise is to see which listings you will pause over an which ones you will delete. Also you should find yourself re-prioritizing ideas, even if you had set out to type everything in exact order. Do not have someone else do this for you or you will defeat the purpose of weeding out the \\"maybes\\" from the \\"must do\\"'s. This is your future (and fame, and money) we are talking about here. Don't cheat yourself.Once you have that list entered and you are happy with it, save it and print out a copy. Look at it a few times over the next week. Some ideas will start to grow on you while others ill sound less fun. DO THE FUN ONES FIRST! do what you can afford to do now first! Don't eat your vegetables first, eat the candy! The point is to get started and make headway, not punish yourself by dutifully finishing boring tasks. Once you get some momentum built up and you can see progress you can measure--then start in on the more intensive stuff.Thanks for reading"},{"Title":"1001 Ways to Market Your Books: For Authors and Publishers (Book Marketing Series)","review":"John Kremer's book is by far the best on how to effectively market your books.

Norton's four-book series about the trader-crew of the 'Solar Queen' ended in 1969 with \\"Postmarked the Stars\\" but beware! Lesser authors have butted into the series, presumably with Norton's permission since this remarkable Gandalf Grand Master of Fantasy and Nebula Grand Master just recently passed away after a long and extremely fruitful career (her first novel was published in 1934, her latest fantasy in 2005).One 'Solar Queen' rip-off to avoid at all costs is \\"Redline: the Stars.\\"Norton's 'Solar Queen' stories are told from the viewpoint of Dane Thorson, an apprentice-Cargo Master who is introduced in \\"Sargasso of Space,\\" the first 'Solar Queen' novel, as a \\"lanky, very young man in an ill-fitting Trader's tunic.\\" Most of this author's heroes and heroines are young, uncertain of themselves, shy, with a tendency to trip over their own enthusiasms and load themselves up with guilt at the slightest opportunity. They are very likeable and their adventures are narrated in remarkably lean prose with just the right touch of description.After ten years of schooling, orphan Dane Thorson is assigned via a computer analysis of his psychological profile--not to a safe berth on a sleek Company-run starship that his classmates were vying for--but to a battered tramp of a Free Trader. To say that the 'Solar Queen' \\"lacked a great many refinements and luxurious fittings which the Company ships boasted\\" was an understatement.

This time around, Thorson and his 11 shipmates on the galactic trader Solar Queen...It's a very fast-moving and suspenseful tale, full of unusual detail and unexpected turns. There are several highlights that make the book really shine, such as the gorp hunt early in the story. (And when I say \\"gorp,\\" I'm not talking about high-energy nut-and-raisin trail mix, but rather reptilian, crablike monsters!) This gorp hunt takes place at sunset on the reefs of an oily sea, and is a highly atmospheric and exciting segment. Other great sections include a raid on an asteroid's emergency station; a landing in the Big Burn... and the viewing of the mutant life-forms therein; and the battle... near the book's end, where our heroes make a desperate bid to make their plea for justice to the citizens of the solar system. Like I said, this is a slam-bang sequel, that will leave few readers unsatisfied.That having been said, I need to also mention that there are a few inconsistencies in the book. At one point, Norton tells us that Dane has been in the trading service for a few months; somewhere else, she says that it has been a full year. Huh? And I feel that I must chastise Ace Books for the deplorable job with which this book has been put together. Now don't get me wrong: I LOVE these little Ace paperbacks from the 1950s, especially those 2-in-1 Ace doubles. But there are so many typos--not to mention punctuational and grammatical errors--in this book that the reading thereof is made a labor. Should we blame Norton or the publishers for a sentence such as this: \\"His hands, blundering within the metallic claws of the gloves, Dane buckled two safety belts about him.\\" How could any copy editor or proofreader let such an egregious line such as this get through, when just the simple deletion of that first comma would have made all the difference?! Apparently, these little Ace books were never proofed or edited. They're wonderful volumes, with marvelously pulpy covers, but sadly, the contents were not given their due. But enough about Ace's carelessness. \\"Plague Ship,\\" despite the occasional blunder, is still a marvelous entertainment, and I do highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Plague Ship","review":"Solar Queen adventure about trading contract for the planet Sargol acquired after losing planet Limbo contract to Star Patrol(Sargasso of Space).

Classic Andre Norton"},{"Title":"Plague Ship","review":"\\"Plague Planet\\" is the 2nd book that chronicles the adventures of the free trader starship Solar Queen. In Ms Norton's carefully crafted universe of space exploration and exploitation two commercial enterprises are attempt to reap enormous financial benefits by trading, bartering or hoodwinking intelligent alien races. You can think of the Dutch buying Manhattan Island for a trunk full of beads. The first group consists of \\"five great galaxy wide organizations\\" these combines intend to dominant trading and muscle out the independent competitions. The Solar Queen represents the independent free traders - the good guys. One of the major topics in the story is the fierce completion and resulting bad feelings between the combines and the free traders. Overlaying this is the Space Patrol and a Code of Ethics or trading behavior, rules and regulations that attempt to prevent the most blatant violations of the native rights or outright commercial sabotage. The Patrol and the Code are referenced thought the story but are never adequately described which detracts from the story in my oppinion.The first third of this novel is most interesting and features great creativity and imagination when detailing the intelligent feline-like natives, the Salariki, of the planet Sargol. The descriptions of the native society, clan structure, emphasis of the use of perfumes and attitudes towards off-worlders and their trade trinkets make for captivating reading. Alas, after a few opening chapters its \\"jets up\\" and the remainder of the story is a so-so space adventure concerning, well, a plague on the spaceship. An interesting book that will keep you turning pages to see how it a shakes out; another one of Ms Norton's entertaining Solar Queen stories.Ms Norton wrote four novels that could be grouped under the heading \\"Space Adventures of the free trader starship Solar Queen\\" The novels are also referred to as the \\"Solar Queen\\" books. The books and the first publication date are as follows: Sargasso of Space (1955), Plague Ship (1956), Voodoo Planet (1959) and Postmarked the Stars (1969). Each of these books stands alone but interested readers should attempt to read the books in sequence if available. Three additional \\"Solar Queen\\" books were written in the 1990's in collaboration with other authors. I am very suspect of these \\"collaborations\\" that seem to pop up like weeds late in an author's life. Was Ms. Norton's contribution just her name and the rights to the story line? I don't know the answer but I steer away from these types of books."},{"Title":"Plague Ship","review":"We like Andre Norton, as one of our favorite writers, and had read many of this author's books in our youth.

I liked thinking how someone in the sixties imagined our world and what was going on.

I have read her books for over 50 years and they sparked my imagination and my interest in science and reading. Plaque ship is an excellent adventure told by a young crewman (Dane Thorson) aboard the spaceship Solar Queen. He is an apprentice cargo master and aboard the ship when they are on a trade mission and visiting the planet Sargol. The cat like creatures of the planet have been hard to deal with but the crew accidentally finds a secret trading item that they covet. The alien race of cats is in love with the catnip that the crew had on board for their pet cat!They trade what little they had to them for valuable Kronos jewels and a rare and high quality wood that they can sell back on Earth. They win a valuable contract with the aliens but have to return back in 6 months with a ship load of catnip as cargo to trade with or lose the contract. Shortly after leaving the planet the senior members of the crew become ill and fall into a coma like state. The Solar Queen is now considered a plague ship and is to be destroyed upon sight or pushed into the sun. They are banned on returning home after being so close to their wildest dreams. How can the younger and unaffected crew members save the ship and their dreams....This is the kind of story that will draw in younger readers into the genre of Sci-Fi. I love this story and I recommend it to you. It will make you an Andre Norton fan."},{"Title":"Plague Ship","review":"I got this book becasue it was free and while it wasn't the worst book I've read it sure wasn't one of the better ones. I just couldn't get into the characters or the story."},{"Title":"Plague Ship","review":"This is one of the Solar Queen novels, which chronicles the adventures of Dane Thorson and crew as they travel the galaxy on a Free Trade vessel. In this one, they visit the planet Sargol. It is populated by feline-like beings, who control the supply of a rare gem found on their planet. Thorson doubts the Solar Queen has anything that the Salariki (Sargol natives) will want in exchange for the gems, but he is wrong. The object that captures the Salariki attention is unexpected, but logical. Of course, the Queen has very little quantity of the item on board, as it was present only for the benefit of one certain passenger. Plans are made to lift off and return with more, but plans are interrupted when a rival I-S ship arrives, seeking claim to the precious gems. That distraction is handled, and the Queen lifts off with a contract in hand. But shortly after, crew members begin to become sick, one by one.The nature of the mysterious illness becomes the focus of the story, and the Queen is quickly branded a \\"plague ship\\" by authorities. That brand means certain doom for the ship and crew, unless they can discover an alternative source for the sickness. Intrigue exists for the reader, as to how a possible plague got on board, and of course sabotage by the rival I-S crew is suspected. But how? And were the Salariki somehow involved? The future is uncertain for the crew of the Queen, as they race against time to discover a way out of a probable fatal end.Animals and animal-like aliens feature prominently in the working out of the problems, as in many other Norton novels. Action is plentiful, and the adventure feel of this novel is never lost or sacrificed for unnecessary material. Every chapter adds to the story. That is what I love about Norton's books. Her writing is focused like few other authors, and her style is strong enough to carry the reader along without the need for lengthy dialogue. If adventure is the focus, then that is what you get. The spirit of the characters are adequately conveyed, without the need for in-depth character analysis. This book is over before you know it. I suggest having another Norton book ready. I'm always surprised how quickly I'll reach for another of her books after finsihing one. They may not be the best science fiction out there, but they are certainly among the most readable. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Plague Ship","review":"A crew of interstellar traders complete a trading mission and shortly after they start their return journey to earth members of the crew become ill with an unknown aliment that leaves them incapacitated.

In fact, I almost gave it up after the 5th chapter, but I didn't. I struggled through, but was left with a ho-hum feeling by the time I reached the end.

Yes, there are two parts, and I am certain that the second half is just as bad as the first. The whole story was just describing Professor Aronnax's daily life on the Nautilus, which was completely repetitive if you ask me. The only SOMEWHAT interesting parts of the story was when Professor Aronnax is in danger of being attacked by natives, but Jules Verne just HAS to say it in the most boring way. Jules Verne also spent entire pages describing totally boring conversations between Captain Nemo and Professor Aronnax. These conversations were not only boring but confusing. Jules Verne used way to many technical words, in my opinion. Don't get me wrong- I have a big vocabulary range, but that was ridiculous. And who cares about finding the Nautilus's exact location on a map using latitude and longitude lines? Why couldn't Jules Verne just say, &quot;IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ATLANTIC OCEAN?&quot; If I were you, I would stay away from this book. Don't even THINK about reading it, because you'll just be bored to tears. I know you will, because I was.

But the captain's free, lawless life has its dark side, and the three men begin to realize that they must get away from the Nautilus no matter what.It's actually rather amazing that Jules Verne not only dreamed up the idea of a semi-modern submarine long before they existed, but thought out the applications, the stealth, and the vast size.

The begining starts of slow but once you get into it, it gets pretty good. Well, everyone around the world is talking about this so called narwhale in the ocean destroying ships. It really isn't a narwhale, but I am not going to tell you because it ruins the story. Well the nautlis, is the submarine that goes underwater and explores the ocean underwater forests.

Well, a \\"classic\\" is merely a book that is still in print, possibly because the publisher does not have to pay royalties on public domain titles. Now, this book is still in print; so, by golly, it indeed qualifies as a classic. And, it is just the thing to give to a reluctant reader to prevent him from ever checking out anything again. It is definitely not a fast read by modern standards. Not that TLUTS is not a great read, but it is hard work for an average reader and should not be required of the inexperienced reader.

Because the most amazing element of this work, more than the astounding genius and limitless creativity, was the fact it was penned in the latter stages of the 19th centruy. Some highlights: the undersea walks, Atlantis, and the attack of the cuttle-fish. There's many more, though; you could do worse than reading this book and discovering it's hidden treasures for yourself. There may be perhaps a bit too much of 'zoophytes' in it, but the book will hold it's own as a classic, regardless. For Verne's prowess was not how he told his stories, but WHEN. One final note: was Captain Nemo a villian, or simply a good guy who went too far? A megalomaniac, that Nemo."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"A scientist, his sidekick and a big strong sailor are going to have their lives changed forever when they are sent to capture a giant octopus. But, instead, they fall overboard and find out what they think is an octopus is really a giant submarine with a Captain Nimo and a crew that speaks their own language (which the trio calls &quot;the submarine language&quot;)! In this submarine, they go on millions of adventures like: tunneling through blocks of ice in the antartic, zooming through tunnels from sea to sea, and seeing every different kind of fish you could ever imagine. The only problem is the scientist's sidekick joins with the big sailor, Ned, and together they try to escape. They have many of their own adventures too, like when they try to escape the first time and they almost get caught by cannibals. The second time they escape and write a story which you will read if you want to read it and it's called, &quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot;.

The listener is swept, along with the narrator and his two companions, aboard the futuristic (but never improbable) submarine \\"Nautilus,\\" helmed by the mysterious (and ultimately tragic) Captain Nemo. The wonders of Verne's tale of adventure, as well as the tension and sheer terror contained therein, have never before been made so real in any performance of any adaptation of this novel. It becomes easy to empathize with the plight of the narrator, and, indeed, to share in his feelings and frustrations, save one -- the listener may not share the narrator's desire to end the adventure and go home. Ellison's vocal work is outstanding, and the direction of the adaptation is flawless. In an era where the science fiction market increasingly relies on the use of franchised characters, it is refreshing to hear this adaptation of a highly original (and ever relevant) work."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"Beautiful descriptions, heroic adventure, and intellectual, that is how I describe the classic story &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea&quot; written by the infamous author Jules Verne. &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea&quot; is full of Adventure, vivid descriptions, and is well researched.

Is he the antithesis of a 19th century capitalist? Is he the result of capitalism, using technology to gain the liberty of a higher standard of living which it allows? Is he despot, savior, evil or compassionate?Nemo epitomizes a vision of humanity which is arrogantly attempting to create a peaceful world through technology. The battle is clearly in vain as the characters are hindered by the passions of their natures.Nemo is the rebel, the nationless man, who has turned away from the machine mentality, dollar diplomacy and imperialist expansionism of his age.Verne creates a self-contained world for Nemo, one in which there is no dependency on capitalism. All that Nemo needs is produced by the Nautilus.This freedom is decadent. The Nautilus produces no surplus value other than to provide for the whims of Nemo, a person dehumanized by the progress of the developing western world. A world he doesn't understand or is in touch with.Even in his act of political intervention against imperialism through the financing of the liberation movement of the Cretans from the Turks was decadent. The money came from the sea, it was put back into circulation, it wasn't the result of production or creativity. There is no net gain to society by this action. The people could have been better provided for by encouraging production and industry.Though Nemo was creative enough to produce the Nautilus to escape his world of torment, he's nothing more than a narcissist. Racing back and forth across the oceans is an act of conspicuous and selfish consumption.Nemo's goal is conquest of the sea, to make nature a possession, something no longer mysterious and otherworldly, but just a part of the humanized world, as if that's possible.Though Nemo suffers great loss, he blames the world, not himself. He sees himself as virtuous, as a victim of industry and progress. He is a paradox of the world.His is a world running from machines and science in a machine. A world free from governments and country in which he governs. A world free from captivity in which he holds others captive. A world from which he takes freely, but gives nothing to in return. Nemo is everything he disdains.All of this is lost to Nemo, an obscurity of self, hidden behind his anger and self exile. Reckless abandon seems to be his only motive. His disgust with society has robbed him of all virtue, all concern for others.In making his journey of discovery around the world, Nemo fails to make the most important discovry there is, what it means to be human."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"WOW--WOW--WOW---GREAT BOOK---WHAT A CLASSIC---CAN YOU BELIEVE THATIT WAS WRITTEN IN 1869???

The tension created by the unknown realm of the seas is immense.

You also get ten times the number of adventures seen in the movie. Heck, I was so involved in it, I finished it in only 2 1/2 days! Read this book."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"I really enjoy books that revolve around science... especially when they were written during the 1800s and early 1900s. It is very entertaining to discover what these people believed and to compare their beliefs to ours in modern times. 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea is entertaining in this fashion. Jules Verne is suprisingly accurate in his depiction of a modern-day electric submarine and its workings... although he doesn't go into the minute details that I was hoping for. The ending of this book is a tremendous let-down with regards to the character of Captain Nemo. Throughout the entire book, the Captain's background is built up to be a giant mystery... which simply begs for resolution. I couldn't wait to reach the end of the book in order to find out why Captain Nemo was the way he was. This resolution never comes. Never. This left me with the opinion that Jules Verne simply wasn't a talented storyteller, and never bothered to fill out and completely think about the character of Captain Nemo. Anyone can think up fantastic situations and theories... but the real talent comes in explaining them in a plausible way to the reader. It's akin to watching a movie where lots of incredible things happen to the main characters, only to have them wake up stating that it was all a dream."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"In 1866, there are a number of sightings of an unexpected object in the ocean. Some of these sightings are far apart from one another. With no other logical answer, some fear that it might be a sea monster.An expedition is established under Captain Farragut, with the U.S. Naval frigate, Abraham Lincoln. They are firm in their resolve to find this monster.Professor Pierre Aronnax of the Museum of Paris had written articles about the phenomenon of a possible sea creature and he is asked to join the others, as is, his man, Conseil, and the Canadian harpooner, Ned Land.Once they are out to sea and have traveled far in their search, something is sighted. Ned, Pierre and Conseil take a small boat from the Abraham Lincoln with Ned's harpoon. Ned tries to harpoon the object but their boat is overturned and they are picked up by the submarine, the Nautilus under Captain Nemo.They are held in polite captivity as the Nautilus travels the world. Captain Nemo has constant proclamations of where they are and Pierre tells the reader the importance in history of what they are seeing, such as, a sunken ship with riches in it. The men are anxious to be free and have their escape at the earliest opportunity.The writing style is dry and without much emotional comment. The style is so different from much of today's literature that it is challenging to get into the story line and become involved with the story.It is interesting to see Jules Verne's ideas of deep sea diving equipment and his idea of 20,000 leagues under the sea-which is more than the circumference of the earth. It is also noteworthy to see where literature and adventure fiction has come to in the last one hundred years."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"This review is for the Easton Press leather bound 1977 edition of the Mercier Lewis first english translation of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, by Jules Verne.Anil Menon notes in a 2006 examination of 'The Politics of Nemo' that, \\"Verne liked to place his human characters in enclosed, self-contained, unique spaces of one kind or the other-- heavier-than-air flying machines, isolated islands, floating cities, villages on tree-tops, the earth's core, cannon-balls to the moon, steel submarines 20,000 leagues under the sea-- and send them out for a spin. For the most part, his people are two-dimensional cross-hairs; their main role is keep track of places in the reader's mind.\\"Most English-speaking readers are familiar with the image of Captain Nemo as an escapee from human society driven by hatred to live a life separate from humanity in general. Verne appears to have endeavored to use his story as a vehicle for some sort of political message or commentary on the conditions of his era though. One quote in the book offers a glimpse of this dark motivation: , \\"I've witnessed the destruction of everything I loved, cherished, and venerated--homeland, wife, children, father, and mother! There lies everything I hate!\\"Due to the politics of his time in France, Nemo fails to properly identify precisely who inflicted the personal pain on him. It is speculated that Nemo originally intended to point the finger at Tsarist Russia for their victimization of the Polish people, but France was friendly with Russia at the time so Nemo chose to leave the identity of his victimizers to speculation. That is unfortunate, because it causes Nemo to be more of a 'stick-figure' for the story than might otherwise have been the case.Regardless of this, the story of Nemo and his submarine continues to this day to intrigue readers as it always has. The problem for us English speakers however, is that Verne wrote his original story in French and the numerous English translations differ widely in terms of how accurately they reflect Verne's original story. Unfortunately, Easton Press chose to use what is generally considered to be the worst possible English language rendition of this famous book; the Mercier Lewis translation.Mercier Lewis went after Verne's story with a scalpel, cutting and removing entire sections and altering the meaning of many French words and ultimately, the story itself. When he was done, Lewis had removed over 20% of Verne's manuscript, paying particular attention to the removal of any comments that might contradict the Christian Bible. The result is that the reader of this translation is far less likely to gain an accurate appreciation of the original novel.There are other, much more legitimate English translations available. One generally considered to be the best current English translation is the Walter James Miller & Frederick Paul Walter version completed in 1993 and published by the Naval Institute Press. Unfortunately, that version presently only seems to be available in paperback. The Easton Press leather-bound edition looks much nicer sitting on the bookshelf and that is the main reason many continue to purchase it. But if one is interested in genuinely exploring the world of Captain Nemo, the Navel Institute Press version by Miller & Walter is the way to go."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"I loved it so much that I want to read it all over again!

The book's original title Vingt mille lieues sous les mers, the literal translation would be \\"Seas\\" which might imply the seven seas.The story is told from the view point of Professor Pierre Aronnax, a famous French marine biologist. The professor accepts an invitation to join an expedition to destroy a sea monster who is sinking ships. Along for the ride come Canadian harpoonist Ned Land and Conseil, the professor's servant.The expedition fails, the monster sinks it and the Professor, Ned Land and Conseil find themselves at the mercy of Captain Nemo, who commands The Nautilus, a submarine the likes of which have never been seen.I have read 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea by Jules Verne in two languages and several versions. I have to say that this translation beats them all.The book shows Verne's genius which is tough to translate, the characters come alive on the pages and the adventures they go through are exciting. The comedic tone and even psychology show well in this wonderful translation.As in the previous versions I have read, there are many \\"lists\\" and descriptions of the ocean life. I have to say that I did skimmed through the lists but read the descriptive parts enthusiastically. With the exception of intricate scientific names, which lend credibility to this fantasy, I found the book absorbing and engrossing. I'm glad I read it again.While submarines today are common place and almost anyone of can go and visit one (there are several older submarines which one can go on), the fantastic voyages and imagination are inspiring today as they were in 1870.What I love about this book is that the translators took their time to write an excellent introduction and, best of all, wonderful footnotes which, as I said time and time again, make a translated book into a cultural experience and raises the level of enjoyment by multiple degrees.Not many people are aware, but almost a whole quarter of the book was literally lost in translation. This wonderful edition, translated by Water James Miller and Frederick Paul Walter, restores those pages as well asIf you ever wondered what the big hoopla is about Jules Verne, read this version and you'll find out."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"My exposure to science fiction is embarrassingly limited, so who better to remedy it than Verne? Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea was a groundbreaking work. It particularly established hard science fiction at a time when technology could not help but change the way we looked at the world.And therein lies much of my criticism. With its frequent calculations of the size of the submarine and what not, it sometimes reads like a math textbook. Sadly, I do not take the same interest in the science as Verne so obviously did and other readers may. The descriptions of life at the bottom of the sea, on the other hand, make me want to visit an aquarium post-haste. Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea is very much the type of science fiction that revels in the \`science' part.That is not to say that Verne does take advantage of speculative fiction to use the \\"speculative\\" portion to explore human nature. Captain Nemo is as fertile ground as Captain Ahab for this. And our narrator has even less to say about his captain--he is consistently nave, to the point that the subtleties of Nemo can be at first lost. However, over the course of the novel it becomes apparent that all is not well. We are never told what great sin civilization has done Nemo, rather we must wrestle over whether any sin could justify his actions. The action is quite light and the plot slow-placed. Most of the book is devoted to a tour of the wonders of the deep, with Nemo's gradual, swirling decline in the background.The titular \\"twenty thousand leagues\\" refers to the distance covered by the Nautilus over the course of the book--well over twice the circumference of the earth--not the depth to which it sinks. There is no good reason to think the latter, but I was nonetheless confused on this point for years.Of course any book this old will not age evenly. Captain Nemo's conservation instincts are a bit off-base. Shortly after chastising the whaler Ned Land for seeking to hunt southern whales, which he describes as \\"inoffensive creature[s],\\" he gleefully slaughters a herd of \\"cruel, mischievous\\" sperm whales. Hardly sustainability at its best. But perhaps Verne too expected us to recoil with Land at the bloodbath (how odd it is to side with the whaler over the conservationist).Verne is as successful as any science fiction writer at his predictive science and technology. Sometimes it's incredibly accurate--Verne describes a light bulb a decade prior to its invention, the crew of the Nautilus communicate with an invented language a little under fifteen years before the invention of Esperanto, the South Pole is on a southern continent, and the Nautilus is largely built and operates like modern submarines (especially the double-hulled design). Other times, it's less so--a workable electric bullet has yet to be invented. Verne also repeats errors of his day--e.g., the misplaced notion that malaria was caused by \\"foul air.\\"Verne wrote at an exciting time. The south pole had not yet been reached and the first trans-Atlantic (telegraph) cable had recently been laid. We were just beginning to understand electricity. The ocean remained a great, unknown frontier.Verne frequently uses archaic or technical terms for the sea creatures encountered. Sperm whales are called cachalots, walruses are called morse, and sea horses are called hippocampi.I read the Kindle version of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea offered free through Amazon. There are a handful of typographical errors, but not enough to be overly distracting and none that cause confusion. Most bothersome is the degree symbol is replaced by a question mark throughout--a common error as the submarine's latitude is frequently given. It includes neither a foreword nor an afterword. I also own an old Educator Classic Library edition from 1968. It contains numerous added illustrations and helpful definitions and explanations throughout the text (directly next to the relevant text in the margin so they do not affect readability like a footnote or endnote would). These are particularly helpful for an older hard science fiction novel. It also contains a \\"backword\\" with helpful information about Verne and the history of the submarine."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"I did enjoy this book and I'm glad I read it but ... the introduction by Ray Bradbury was the best part of this book. If you are going to get a copy to read - get this one - specifically for the introduction. As for the book itself, well, the action parts and story line are great. The problem is that Verne seems to have felt that he needed to include every single bit of background research he did into the book. He didn't seem to waste anything he had found in in his research.. He goes on for several pages listing the types of fish that can be found in a particular area. Whenever we come across a sunken ship we are treated to several pages of the history of the ship and the ships that preceded it into whatever cove we are in along with who actually made it back to make the report. Some of this stuff is interesting, but mostly, it's unnecessary filler. I found myself skipping over the taxonomic lessons and skipping to the actual story line.The story line is great. Totally enjoyed it. Spoiler - they get attacked by 10 giant squids, not one. They also get trapped under the ice at the south pole and have lots of other adventures you don't see in the movies. All in all a worthwhile read, but it is a bit tedious because about half of the book is devoting to listing fish and their attributes (this one had a spotted tail with a blue underbelly, the next one had rings and a white belly and on and on and on.)Do I recommend it? Well ... yeah - good story, better then what they show in the movies, you just need to gloss over the endless filler."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"Fantastic!!

Professor Aronnax accompanies a warship to attempt to destroy it, but falls overboard and ends up inside the sea animal. The \\"monster\\" turns out to be a secret submarine build by Captain Nemo. As a passenger aboard Captain Nemo's craft, Professor Aronnax is witness to the wonders hidden beneath the ocean waters.Written over a century ago, Jules Verne creates a fantastic setting that leaves even today's readers fascinated about Captain Nemo and his Nautilus. Detailed descriptions about underwater life fill a majority of the book and create a rich setting, but can drag on at times.Water makes up the majority of the earth. As humans, we have only a mere understanding of the creatures and life forms that dwell within the depths of the oceans, and Verne expands on this unknown realm to create a powerful and lasting tale.Maybe it's a coincidence that I've read a lot of novels with aquatic settings (Life of Pi, The Old Man and the Sea, Moby Dick), but 20000 Leagues Under the Sea is another watery classic worth reading.8/10 -> 4/5"},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"This is a very attractive edition of this book.

However, I thoroughly enjoyed the detail he provided."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"Submarines as we know them didn't exist in 1869. But Jules Verne had an almost eerily prophetic knack for knowing what technology would be used in the future -- and he put it to work in \\"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea,\\" a slow-moving adventure tale with plenty of proto-steampunk and almost fantastical undersea life.Ships in the middle of the ocean are suddenly seeing -- and being attacked by -- \\"a long object, spindle-shaped, occasionally phosphorescent, and infinitely larger and more rapid in its movements than a whale.\\"Eventually the US government sends out a ship to capture the object, and during a sea battle Professor Aronnax, his manservant Conseil and harpooner Ned Land go overboard. Soon they're picked up by the Nautilus, the vast submarine that has been causing all this trouble, and introduced to Captain Nemo -- an intelligent, charismatic man who belongs to no nation.Aronnax becomes fascinated by Nemo, his ship and his library -- as well as the amazing underwater adventures that Nemo introduces them to, like pearl-hunting and fighting a giant squid. But the captain's free, lawless life has its dark side, and the three men begin to realize that they must get away from the Nautilus no matter what.It's actually rather amazing that Jules Verne not only dreamed up the idea of a semi-modern submarine long before they existed, but thought out the applications, the stealth, and the vast size. And since nothing like the Nautilus existed at the time, there's a slightly fantastical, steampunk flavor to \\"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.\\"And as usual, Verne painstakingly studies everything about his imagined world, filling it with science (although he obviously didn't know about water/air pressure) and lovely descriptions of the Nautilus and the eerie underwater world (giant oysters, forests, Atlantis). The only flaw is that he tends to ramble on about exact measurements and travel details; there are boring patches here and there.But Captain Nemo is probably one of Verne's most fascinating characters -- a charismatic, embittered man who is a sort of noble sea pirate. He does some stuff that is totally unacceptable (sinking a random warship), but he also has little spurts of kindness and generosity towards poor and powerless peoples of the world. He's scary but fascinating.Giant submarines, charismatic pirates and an undersea world just waiting to be explored -- \\"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea\\" is a fascinating sci-fi classic, if you can get past the dull patches."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"On my Kindle 4 and iPhone app. As always, Jules Verne came through with a fun and exciting read.

I decided to give the book a try having just read (and enjoyed) the author's other classic 'The Time Machine'. '20,000 Leagues...' is a far more ambitious novel and, overall, even more enjoyable.The story is set in the late 1860s when the book was written. Due to unusual circumstance (..no spoilers here) three men (a naturalist, his manservant, and a whaler) are taken against their will onto a (then unheard of) submarine by the enigmatic Captain Nemo. For many months they circumnavigate the globe and cross all the oceans. Along the way the encounter the fantastic, some dramatic episodes, and even fleeting moments of comedy. The author goes into great detail of describing the wonders of the submarine. While of course much of the science he describes is a bit silly most of it is remarkably true to life. I am especially amazed at his foresight into electricity years before the lightbulb was invented. Monsieur Verne was truly a genius. And thankfully, he was a pretty good writer.But this book doesn't hit all the right notes. All the in-depth descriptions of amazing underwater flora and fauna gets rather repetitive. The middle third of the book is a bit of a tedious read. Thankfully the story tightens considerably towards the end, with a very surprising climax.Bottom line: an often overlooked classic that will probably bore younger readers but will enthrall adults. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"Verne's prophetic masterpiece still thrills readers over 100 years after its publication. In this adventure, French naturalist Pierre Aronnax is taken aboard the Nautilus, a secret high-technology submarine capable of high speeds. Aronnax meets the enigmatic Captain Nemo, a renegade against society with a strong desire for revenge against the enemy that drove him under the sea. This novel is one of the first examples of modern science fiction. The world of science fiction owes Jules Verne a great debt.This edition is particularly valuable. Most people aren't aware that the standard English translation is filled with lots of translation errors which botch the science of Verne's masterpiece. Also, the standard version cuts about 25% of the original French novel. This translation fixes the errors, and returns 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea's scientific accuracy (for that time). Also, the cut parts have been restored, so we can now enjoy reading a complete version of Verne's novel.If you love classic books, and you're interested in reading about one of the greatest characters in science fiction, you have to read this. Also fans of science fiction should read this to understand where their genre came from. If you've read the old standard translation, you have to read this edition to see it the way it was meant to be."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"My (10 year old) daughter got interested in '20,000 leagues' after reading the \\"Wishbone\\" version (go ahead and laugh). I went searching for the real thing to read with her, and came across this edition. With all of the missing content recovered, plus the annotations to fill in all sorts of additional information, the result is fascinating for adult readers. If you read the usual (butchered) version as a kid, you really owe yourself this one. All of the critiques of Verne over the years that tried to belittle his knowledge of science turn out to have been based on translations that whacked out what Verne really said -- they thought it was too dry and boring. Reading what he really said, plus the extensive footnotes that describe the state of knowledge at the time, make Verne's brilliance all the more astonishing. Just consider that he wrote about the Nautilus at a time when the Hunley was the state of the art!"},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"I havent read many books in my lifetime but I'd have to say that this is the best one I' ve ever read. Jules Verne takes you on an amazing journey through the worlds oceans and to some places where man still hasn't been. I was sad when I had read the last page and the books was over. I found myself wanting to be on the Nautilis, meeting Captin Nemo, and see the ocean depths with my own eyes. The book defintly sparks your imagination; I guess that's why it has remained a classic for many years."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"Jules Verne is widely recognized as the father of science fiction, and &quot;20000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot; is his most famous work. This fantastic tale of the adventures of an under-sea craft (written BEFORE their actual invention) fires the imagination of readers young and old. Verne's genius was his ability to create incredible (in his time) machines, around which he'd write believable stories with admirable characters and meaningful morals. As with the submarine Nautilus, many of his machines have since become modern realities."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"I can still remember reading 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA for the first time as a kid. I was fascinated by submarines and captivated by the story of this wonderful ship, capable of making all my dreams come true. I wanted to dive beneath the waves and accompany Professor Aronnax on his incredible journey. Reading it again after many years, I find that I am still impressed by the story. Not only is it quite prophetic for its day & age, the fact that the story is STILL captivating after all these years just goes to show that great literature is timeless. In what follows, my comments shall refer to the Bantam version of the novel, translated by Anthony Bonner. This translation (or another suitably modern translation) is critical to getting the most out of this novel, as I will touch upon later.There is something for everyone in this book. On the one hand, the reader is treated to a very scientific (at times, \\"too\\" scientific for many readers) tale of undersea exploration, mixed with a tale of adventure and intrigue. The Nautilus carries us to every ocean of the world, exploring the South Pole, the lost city of Atlantis, shipwrecks, a mysterious tunnel between the Arabian and Mediterranean seas, and so much more. On the other hand, Jules Verne has also managed to flesh out a human story, one focused on Captain Nemo and his mysterious past and hatred for Western civilization. While the \\"kid\\" in you will have your eyes fixed on the Nautilus's glass portal that reveals the wonders of the deep, the \\"adult\\" in you will be rapidly trying to figure out exactly \\"who\\" this captain is and why he has built this ship, capable of removing him permanently from society.Many have complained about Verne's tendency to lose the story for endless lists of scientific classification. It is not hard to see their point. Verne does go on and on about species of fish in a manner that loses the reader's interest after a short while. But there is nothing to prevent you from skimming over these passages and moving onto the story. That's what I do and I don't think I've sacrificed a thing in doing so. Moreover, I would recommend that you keep an atlas or wold map handy when you are reading. It is much more fun to read this novel if you can actually track where they are at each point in the novel.Those coming to this novel from the movies will either be happily impressed or disappointed. While the films borrow heavily from the novel, they tend to focus on certain elements of the story (enhancing the action) while forgetting about others. This is not the tale of a madman, destined to hunt and destroy ever ocean-going vessel he comes across. It is so much more than that. In fact, my only complaint (and I have similar complaints for many authors) is that Verne seems to have been at a loss for how to end the novel. Therefore, he hands us a \\"deus ex machine\\" ending, of gigantic proportions. However, despite this minor flaw, the novel still holds up to modern scrutiny and remains enjoyable throughout.While this translation is much, much better than the cheap translations you find from the \\"bargain\\" publishing houses, I have heard that the recent, fully-annotated version is even better. Make sure that, when searching for a copy, that you get one of the modern translations (like the Bonner) and stay away from \\"quick & dirty\\" versions that you can find for a couple of dollars. Many of these cheap translations omit a full quarter of the novel and contain numerous errors. Additionally, they render the French into archaic English, ensuring that you will not enjoy the novel as much as you could. So, my advice is to stay away from the \\"bargain\\" versions-they aren't a bargain at all. But do read 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA. You'll be happy you did."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"This is a story about three friends aboard the Nautilus, a cantankerous submarine-like vessel that is commandeered by Captain Nemo, an elusive figure with a mind of steel and a impenetrable purpose in life. Captain Nemo has long ago turned his back on the world, building this vessel with the intent of making it his home, staffing it with the most loyal of crews, and arming it as though it were a fortress. And a fortress it is. Captain Nemo and his crew live beneath the sea in this fascinating underwater vehicle as solid as stone. They never touch land, and are prepared to spend the rest of their days living underwater. The world has learned of this vessel, but rumors of its nature abound. Most think it is a sea monster of sorts, and the great ship the Abraham Lincoln sets out on a voyage to find and destroy the Nautilus. On board are Professor Aronnax, underwater expert, his loyal subject Conseil, and a Canadian whale harpooner named Ned Land. These unfortunate characters are tossed into the sea while heavily engaged in a confrontation with the mighty Nautilus. Hours later, they are picked up by the Nautilus, having been clinging to it's topside for safety. They are held prisoner within, but never have prisoners of war had such luxury and freedom. What follows is Monsieur Aronnax' account of the adventures that abound as he travels around the world underwater, seeing sights never before seen, engaging in activities he once only dreamed of, and enjoying times never meant to be had by man. When his companion, Ned Land, becomes restless and wishes to escape the Nautilus, the story heats up. Throughout, Captain Nemo is a mystery you will wish revealed. The story has many dull parts too, and many unfamiliar words and expressions that may bore you. Nevertheless, it is a fascinating and marvelous classic - if you have not yet read this, you should."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"The story gets 5 stars but this free Kindle version only ranks three stars.I am about 20% through the book and have decided to order a different version. This free version has a few typos and the translation is confusing and slows my reading.I love the story, characters and plot!If you really can't afford to pay for another version, this one is just fine."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"I read this after reading &#34;Mysterious Island&#34; just to get the background story. I think that Verne must have been a botanist and/or marine biologist - he goes into SO much detail on fauna and aquatic wildlife. This distracted from the story for me, I often found myself skipping pages just to get back to the journey."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"Jules Verne often comes to us in old, abridged translations of varying quality. For many years \\"20,000 Leagues...\\" was available to us only in Louis Mercier's abridged version. It was not bad, but it was not as Verne intended it to be. But in recent times, we now have three wonderful modern and unabridged translations from which to choose: F.P. Walter's, Anthony Bonner's, and Mendor Brunetti's. Walter's is more readily accessible (both for free and for purchase) because at least one version of his translation is in the public domain. To read it go to the Kindle store and type in: Verne Vingt Mille English. The other two are both copyrighted and limited to their respective publishers which makes them more difficult to locate and definitely not free. Having said that, Brunetti's translation is particularly readable. The true Verne fan (as in fanatic) may wish to read all three to compare. Just don't expect major differences; they mostly differ in style of expression. I first encountered Bonner and liked his translation. But then I discovered Brunetti and later Walter, so now I really don't know which is best. But I can tell you that that Brunetti's is an excellent translation and you can't go wrong choosing to read it."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"There has GOT to be a better translation out there than this!Here is an excerpt:\\"The cheaper journals replied keenly and with inexhaustible zest. These satirical writers parodied a remark of Linnaeus, quoted by the adversaries of the monster, maintaining that \\"nature did not make fools\\", and adjured their contemporaries not to give the lie to nature, by admitting the existence of krakens, sea-serpents, \\"Moby Dicks\\", and other lucubrations of delirious sailors.\\"The whole book is written like this. Also, it takes the book a whole page or more just to convey something as simple as \\"people were scared\\", and it uses obscure vocabulary to do so. I mean, seriously, is \\"lucubrations\\" the best word the translator could come up with there? It makes me think he does not speak English and was using babelfish online to translate it.However, if you enjoyed reading the excerpt I provided, then by all means go ahead and buy this version of the book."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"We follow Captain Nemo, and his Nautilus - a sub that runs on batteries, in his travels around the oceans of the Earth. We follow him as he explores underwater forests, goes hunting dangerous sea monsters, takes from the sea what he and his men need to live, visits the South Pole and even shows us Atlantis.The problem is that about one third of the book is Jules Verne explaining EVERY tiny detail, from the family trees of fish and other sea creatures, to page after page on how the Nautilus works. The fight with the school of squid is only a few pages long.On the other hand, Nemo is not shown as a man trying to force mankind to improve as much as he is trying to live without contact with it (even when he helps some parts of it to fight back by giving rebels gold he finds on the seafloor). In the end, it is mankind who forces him to fight back, by hunting him down with warships.My book had an introduction by Ray Bradbury, which was very interesting, but did little to help the story itself.A good book for fans of Jules Verne, classic adventure stories and anybody interested in the sea."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"Who is Captain Nemo? Is he the antithesis of a 19th century capitalist? Is he the result of capitalism, using technology to gain the liberty of a higher standard of living, which it allows? Is he despot, savior, evil or compassionate?Nemo epitomizes a vision of humanity, which is arrogantly attempting to create a peaceful world through technology. The battle is clearly in vein as the characters are hindered by the passions of their natures.Nemo is the rebel, the nation-less man, who has turned away from the machine mentality, dollar diplomacy and imperialist expansionism of his age.Verne creates a self-contained world for Nemo, one in which there is no dependency on capitalism. The Nautilus produces all that Nemo needs.This freedom is decadent. The Nautilus produces no surplus value other than to provide for the whims of Nemo, a person dehumanized by the progress of the developing western world. A world he doesn't understand or is in touch with.Even in his act of political intervention against imperialism through the financing the liberation movement of the Cretans from the Turks was decadent. The money came from the sea, it was put back into circulation, and it was not the result of production or creativity. There is no net gain to society by this action. Encouraging production and industry could have better provided for the people.Though Nemo was creative enough to produce the Nautilus to escape his world of torment, he's nothing more that a narcissist!When Nemo brings the Professor on his trip, it becomes a conquest of the sea. Nature becomes a possession, no longer mysterious and otherworldly, but just a part of the humanized world.It is Ned alone who sees the vanity of the voyage, but to no avail. All aboard become trapped in the world of Nemo.A world running from machine and science in a machine. A world free from governments and country in which he governs. A world free from captivity in which he holds others captive. A world which he takes freely from, but gives nothing to in return. Nemo is everything he disdains.In making his journey of discovery around the world, Nemo fails to make the most important discovery that there is, what it means to be human!"},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"This book is not for everyone. If you do not like to read classics with everything that goes along with that (such as long-winded language that seems outdated to us today), then you should stay away.For lovers of classical and relatively easy to read literature, this is a good book. A lot of things are amazing, considering how long ago they were written and what overall level of scientific knowledge was at the time. Some of it just boggles my mind.At the same time, the book is long winded and in the end, not quite as much happens as one would expect. Dan Brown's DaVinci code has more things happening in the first 20 pages than Verne has in his entire book. But that is OK in a way, because when I read a classic, I do not expect to compare it to modern standards. The entertainment is due to different factors. In fact, the way the book is written is part of the entertainment and not just the story.I do not give this book 5 stars however, because I was disappointed in the end, since not enough of the story really comes to a conclusion. I do not want to spoil the book for you, but there are a lot of unanswered questions, and getting those answers really was what kept me reading. There is quite a bit of build-up, and then in some ways, the book just ends. (I noticed that style in many books of that time, where the narrator just says \\"here is what I know... but I do not know the whole story...\\").Also, to some extent, I agree with some of my fellow reviewers that gave a lower score, in that it is too much of a narration rather than a real story. I do not complain about some of it being like a log book, but I would have wished to get a bit more information about the daily life on board. I just do not buy that the 3 travelers just stayed in their room. They must have found out a bit more about other parts of the boat. Or at least attempted it, and that would have been interesting to read about, without breaking with the overall style of the book."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea was a very complex book. The authors word choice was what made it so complex, the author used words like \\"Vexed\\" \\"Zoophytes\\" and \\"Connoisseur.\\" The majority of these words were Old English, which added to the complexity of the book. The sentence structure was similar to the word choice, it was also very complex sentences, the sentences were usually not to long but not to short, at times they could be quite long though, and they were old an English style. The book itself is about Three Human beings chasing after a giant \\"Narwhal\\" as the author calls it. These three characters are known as Professor M. Arronax, a genius Professor from France whose passion is to study, Conseil, a teenage boy who devotes his life to serving the professor, and Ned Land, a Canadian Harpooner. Conseil and the Professor accept an invitation to the boat the Abram Lincoln, the goal of the voyage is to track down a giant Cetacean, or a sea creature. This creature has apparently been reeking havoc across the world causing all sorts of deeds, and so the 3 meet up at the boat. They pursue the creature for over a month, when they finally catch up with the lightning fast Cetacean they pursue it, however when the creature strikes back Ned Land, Conseil, and Professor Arronax are thrown into the ocean, and separated from their boat, they awake to find they are in the supposed cetacean, to find out that it is not at all a sea monster, but an amazing Submarine named the Nautilus led by Captain Nemo. They then learn of Captain Nemo's plans, and embark on a Submarine Hunt on the bottom of the Ocean, they Discover Atlantis, they venture to the south pole, and even fight among Poulps or Cuttlefish of enormous size, 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea is full of adventure.In 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea The Brilliant minds of Captain Nemo and Professor Arronax save them in times of danger, Captain Nemo's knowledge of the sea allows him to guide his submarine across the world, confronting the sea's greatest beauties and threats. Jules Verne does a very good job of telling the story and making out every last inch of the amazing journeys taken place on board the Nautilus. In my opinion this was a very good book, there are times in the book were discussions between the captain and the professor take place that are extremely difficult to comprehend, but in the end I would say this book is definitely worth the money. However as I've said before almost every page has Old English in it and is hard to understand, the sentences are very difficult and there are some words which I'd never heard before in my life, so because of the books complexity I would have to say that only someone 13+ can read this, this would be great for adults even, but I don't think anyone below the 7th grade could fully understand it, a 6th grader could but not get the full detail of the book."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"In this book there are three main characters,Ned Land, Professor Aronnax, and Captain Nemo.

For example one scene captain Nemo sees anindian gets attacked by a shark so he he jumps in the water and tackels the shark. He almost gets killed but Ned Land throws hisharpoon and kills the shark.This book reminds me of the ocean because they are always traveling through the ocean in their submarine.

And over all itwaas okay, but I wouldn't be caught reading it again."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"As I have mentioned in other reviews, Jules Verne is an author greatly at the mercy of his translators. Bad translations have cut and mangled Verne's writing, often making his style seem arthritic, his plots disjointed, and his thematic content insipid. Therefore my reviews of Verne's novels usually are concerned with a particular edition of Verne.This is a review of the 1962 Bantam Classic edition of _20,000 Leagues Under the Sea_ (1870). It contains an introduction by Ray Bradbury comparing Captains Nemo and Ahab. (Nemo is mad north-by-northwest, but Ahab is _really_ crazy.) The translation is by Anthony Bonner, which is generally rated as \\"above average\\" by Verne scholars. Bonner does maintain some errors from the older (and much inferior) Mercier Lewis translation. For example, Nemo still says that the steel plates on the _Nautilus_ have a density of .7 to .8 that of water. If this were true, the steel would be lighter than water! What Nemo actually says in the original text is that the specific gravity of the steel plates is 7.8. What a difference a few decimal places can make!But on the balance, the Bonner translation does very well in allowing Verne to exercise his scientific knowledge without cutting or mangling it. The discussion by Professor Aronnax of sea pressure and the type of creature that would have to withstand it, the details of the electrical system of the _Nautilus_, the shipbuilding figures for constructing the submarine, the calculations of the formidable Black Stream... all are detailed and concrete. (Though admittedly, there is electronic information that is withheld from us.) And there are underwater sights such as these:The sun's rays struck the surface at a rather oblique angle, and, refracted by this contact as if passing through a prism, they tinted the edges of rocks, plants, shells and corals with the seven colors of the solar spectrum. It was a marvelous feast for the eyes; colors criss-crossed one another in a veritable kaleidoscope of green, yellow, orange, violet, indigo, and blue-- the entire palette of an enthusiastic colorist! (113)And again, during an undersea funeral near a coral forest:The light [from our lamps] produced a thousand charming effects as it played about these brightly colored branches. I thought I could see these tissuelike cylindrical tubes tremble beneath the wavy motion of the water. Small, fast fish would would dart past like flocks of birds. I was tempted to pick the coral's fresh flowers and delicate tentacles, some of which had just blossomed and others scarcely yet opened. But if my hand drew near these living, sensitive flowers, an alarm would spread throughout the colony. The white blossoms would dart inside their red cases and vanish from sight; the shrub would change into a block of stony bulges. (175)The enigmatic Captain Nemo (sometimes vindictive and villainous, sometimes noble and heroic) promises his three involuntary guests: \\"You will travel through a land of marvels. Your mind will be in a continual state of astonishment and stupefaction. It will be difficult to get bored with the continual spectacle that will pass before your eyes\\" (71). And do you know, the Captain is right. The voyage of the _Nautilus_ is truly a grand adventure-- almost the archtypical extraordinary voyage-- from the undersea hunting party, to the encounter with the giant clam, to the visit to Atlantis, to the battle with the squid, to the use of Nemo's thunderbolts.Some modern readers grumble over the length and detail of Verne's descriptive passages. But remember: Jules Verne wasn't writing for an audience that had seen dozens of underwater movies. His task was to get people who had _never_ seen such a sight \\"to enter a new element\\" (71) and experience it for the very first time. He did this. And if you give Verne half a chance, he will do it again."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"Almost twenty years ago, I took hold of this book and remember reading it in a day (though we all know how memory can trick you). I didn't recall much more of a narrative other than a general knowledge when I took it again, but I remember avidly my childhood experience and feelings which went hand in hand with this book. It was all about mysteries, about adventure, about submerging into the unknown depths on a strange vessel accompanied with a mysterious figure of Captain Nemo. I recall reading, after lengthy search, sequel of this novel, trying to fulfill the urge for finishing of the tale, and being astonished with events on mystery island that summed up the story. Verne was one of my first authors and first guide to the fantastic world of science fiction. Much has changed since those days. In part, I blame it all to growing-up, other parts would be too lengthy to mention. I picked this book again about a month or so, hearing the praise of this translation of Naval institute press, wanting to remember some of the experiences I had as a child. Effect was quite opposite. I was bored to death. And I saw too much. Somehow, when you're innocent in reading, when your voyage through world of books is only at its beginning, world seems much simpler and you take your story for granted. You're easily marveled by plot, by gadgets, by effects, by sheer promise of something unknown that unravels in front of you, failing to notice all of the work that lies somewhere behind. When you loose your virginity, when you spend countless hours studying the mechanism of narration, the idea of fiction and storytelling, those hidden things come before your eyes. And you start to see faults and errors, bad phrases and filler paragraphs, you begin to see colonialism, glorification of science, problems of liberty and equality and rhythm of the text and somehow it all falls apart. Instead of the wondrous book that you remember from childhood, you hold before yourself gigantic block of text without almost any kind of value other than historical one. Reader that exists today, one that grew distant from childhood innocence, keeps noticing the cramped language, keeps comparing Verne to other authors of the period and finding him outmatched, keeps noticing hasty structure with uneven tempo and failing rhythm, keeps noticing typified characterization and obsessiveness about scientific detail which painfully slows narration and cannot avert his gaze from all of that. It existed before, for sure, but being unaware of it, made \\"20 000 leagues under the sea\\" a fond memory. Today, it stands for concept of bad literature. I am aware that many of the Verne's fans out there could debate me on numerous points here but I do not wish to start a debate here. This text talks more about me as a reader than about the book in question, but in a way it is accounting of an experience and personal voyage through concepts of literature. If your views are similar to mine, it is likely that you will also be disappointed with this book. Maybe this should come with a stamp - not suitable for those above 14. And maybe, once again, I'm failing to see something of importance. Maybe another decade or so will shed some more light on it. Oh and, by the way, edition and translation is great."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"This book looks very nice, it is great to have the whole map on the cover so you can actually follow the travels.

Great copy!"},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"A group of men come to misfortune at sea. They have the dubious misfortune to come to the attention of Captain Nemo and his highly advanced submarine, Nautilus. While this prevents them from drowning, they do get caught up with some of the odd Captain's other pursuits. Ned and company do certainly get some education in oceanography and marine biology along the way.They do have to worry about what the antiheroic supergenius Nemo is actually up to, though."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"After read 20,000 leagues under the sea my thoughts about fiction changed and Jules Verne became for me my favorite author of the matter. I lived for two days in a world of fantasy and mystery inside the submarine Nautilus where The Captain Memo dwelled with his friends and after, in the company of an unexpected party.My imagination flew away to the depths of the sea, as never it had done it before, living the adventures of the voyage of the Nautilus to wherever it went, even to the frizzed lands of The South Pole or to the mystic and lost Atlantic.Jules Verne, the pioneer of the Science Fiction had done a magnificent job in this book that I value as his masterwork and his most visionary point of view of the world's technology of that time since in that moments submarines didn't exist, and he created one.I really enjoyed reading this and I strongly recommend it to anyone, especially kids, that want to read a good Science Fiction book and also a classic of all the times.

The story dose have plot but that is about all the good things that go along with the story. I also did enjoy how Verne made up basic human needs from using marine and plant life from the sea. The last thing that was good, was when the crew of the Natulius had to fight the giant squid, they are called something else in the book, but I didn't pay attention. Those are the ONLY good factors about this book. The author spends more time on description of the water than the action of the book. I found that very dull and boring.

This review is of the complete edition (not the bowdlerised children's version) and references the translation by Mendor T. Brunetti.This was a reread for me. I read most of the Verne books when I was quite young, and lately wanted to revisit some of my favorites. When I was younger, I was very much (like Captain Aronnax) taken with the catalogue of undersea marvels that Captain Nemo and his Nautilus enabled us to visit. Reading it this time around, I was quite struck with the political picture of Captain Nemo. As a man from an unknown country who has lost everything at the hands of men, Nemo becomes what we would today call a terrorist. He funds freedom fighters. He takes his revenge on the men from the countries who hurt him and his. The portraits on his wall: John Brown, Kosciusko, Daniel O'Connell. I think that I'm going to add The Mysterious Island to my list. I had never read the sequel in the past, and I understand that it provides more background about the mysterious captain.Readers who aren't familiar with this book are encouraged by this reviewer to rapidly amend this sad condition. I also have to say that I first read this when I was nine (the full version, not a children's edition) and I can't imagine what really needs to be cut to make it suitable for younger folks. I'd hand them the whole thing with a confident heart."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"I loved this classic French novel by Jules Verne and found it to be very entertaining from start to finish! I was very surprised that I would enjoy this book as much as I did.... I figured \\"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\\", like many classic novels, would be boring, but Jules Verne is a marvelous storyteller. He imbues this novel with lots of intrigue and mystery as you wonder how the story will unfold... There is lots of adventure and interesting predicaments, and of course, many unforgettable characters one comes to care about during the course of the novel. Also if you like science fiction then this is the novel for you! Jules Verne seems to be ahead of his time in terms of technology and creates quite a wonderful piece of classic literature that has stood the test of time.The attention to detail that Jules Verne used to capture the readers attention is marvelous... This book is written in the 1st person through the eyes of Assistant Professor Pierre Aronnax of the Paris Museum of Natural History. Professor Aronnax unfolds the story to the reader of this novel about several sightings of a mysterious object seen around the world by many different people.... Some believe it to be an island, others seem to think the object is a floating reef, a large whale or other large mammal and so on. It isn't until Professor Aronnax and his faithful Flemish assistant, Conseil, take part on an expedition aboard the Abraham Lincoln to seek out this unknown object once and for all. Eventually, it is discovered that this unknown object is a submarine named the Nautilus, on which Professor Aronnax, Conseil and Canadian harpooner, Ned Land, spend the remaining part of the novel sailing on the Nautilus through the various oceans of the world along with the crew of the Nautilus. What adventures they have while sailing on the Nautilus!! And the exquisite detail in which Jules Verne imparts is wonderful. One feels like they are truly reading the actually travel journal/diary of Professor Aronnax. Professor Aronnax writes from a scientific/natural history perspective as he is very much interested in the under water world of the worlds oceans.The only draw back I had with this novel was that some of the descriptions were a bit overdone or a bit too much to take in (like classification of animal species or various nautical terms).... These descriptions aren't overwhelming or occur that frequently, I'd just find myself skimming through these parts rather quickly."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"My husband bought this book for our son at a visit to an aquarium, even though I thought it was too advanced for him because he's only four and half. I was wrong - my son LOVES this book! I know the age range on it is 9 to 12 and I have no doubt those ages would also enjoy reading the book themselves, but my son is constantly wanting me to read this to him and is always begging for me to read one more chapter because we usually only read one or two at a time (I will admit, I tone down the scarier parts just a bit for him because he's only four). The illustrated pages help hold his attention while I read to him even though there is a significant amount of text per page, and even my two and half year old can manage to sit through a chapter most days. I love the combination of illustration and text that allows me to read my sons more involved and advanced stories without them becoming bored because there isn't enough to hold their attention to the story. My older son loves asking questions about the pictures, especially the ones in the inserts that have information related to different aspects of the story, and I have learned a lot from those too! I definitely recommend this book and am currently looking into buying my son some more books from the DK/Eyewitness Classics series."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"The Easton Press edition of Verne's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea is one case to judge a book by its cover. Two other Easton Press editions: From the Earth to the Moon and Around the Moon are two more examples of this rule. To me, Easton Press has outdone itself with these gorgeous Verne covers. To brass tacks on the 20,000 Leagues edition: the English translation is by Mercier Lewis with an introduction by Fletcher Pratt and illustrations by Edward A. Wilson. One may have wished for one of the more modern translations, but the cover IS stunning."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"If you have been hunting for books with sea adventures, then the book 20000 Leagues Under The Sea is the perfect book for you. It's a bookwith two main characters named Captain Nemo and professor Monsier Pierre Aronnax. The professor studies about underwater living. He finds a large submarine which he thought to be a whale. Captain Nemo named it The Nautilus. The captain has a strange vow not to put foot on land people have been on land people have been on. He also explains that he only uses things that are from the sea. For example, his bed was made of soft eelgrass. On the voyage, the professor learns to hunt for pearls and sea animals. This book is also suspenseful because it leaves you in one question is captain Nemo still alive?I really liked this book because it had a leveled amount of description even though it is first person narrative. I would recommend this book this book between ages of 7 and 11. This book is also suitable for people who like to read. You won't feel disappointed after you read this famous book"},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"Who would have thought that a major contribution to the world of literature would come out of the Naval Institute Press! Normally, they come out with things like \\"An Illustrated Design History of the United States Destroyer.\\" I'm not casting any aspersions on such a volume, and I may own a copy or two. But Jules Verne, is an a class by himself as one of the great inventive masters of literature. He stands up there with Homer and Chaucer and James M. Cain. And what a superb edition this is, the translation impeccable and the annotations which include technical and historical explanations of the text and are invaluable. I have to confess, it is one of the few times (not including Nabokov) I actually read all the footnotes in a novel (or any book) and found them to be supremely enjoyable. Anyway, treat yourself to this marvel!"},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"The book, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, is both amazing and suspense holding. Just imagine you're on a ship trying to destroy a sea monster. When that exact sea monster has sunken huge ships, small ships, and even war ships. One second you are asking a question, the next thing you know people are screaming, the ship is flooding, and you're knocked overboard with the beast. Get ready for whirlwind of an adventure!Professor Arronax becomes famous from his studies, but he never tells anybody about Captain Nemo or what they call a sea monster, but is actually a submarine. The professor after a few days figured that he has to get off the monster seeing the captain is nearly insane, but he refuses to get off because it is his. Those are not the only characters. Others are Ned Land, Consiel, cannibals, Commander Farragut, and crew men.Three-fourths through the book, people are going crazy. Worst of all, Ned is going so insane; he wants to swim thousands of miles to shore. He feels he just has to get off the beast, even though he's being well supplied with food. As days go on Professor Arronax is seeing Captain Nemo acting weirder and weirder every day, until finally Captain Nemo resorts to yelling at the Professor for no reason.I would recommend this book for ages eight and up. If someone is reading 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea aloud, it would be exciting for any age. If you like drama, mystery, action, or creativity, this book is for you. In my conclusion, this book is amazing and suspense holding. I loved it and would rate it ***** (out of 5 stars).

And I think if u like Jules Verne's stories you should read twenty thousand leagues under the sea"},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"If you're going to read one of the great classics of literature-and you should-don't pick up this edition. It is a reprint of a version that dates back to the 1870s and was exposed more than 40 years ago for cutting nearly one-quarter of Verne's story and mistranslating much of the remainder. Its reappearance in this edition is all the more amazing considering Tor's status as a leading science fiction publisher, and the company's willingness to perpetrate this fraud on is many readers is truly stunning. If you want to truly get to know Verne's novel, pick up the elegant Naval Institute Press edition, in a modern, complete, updated translation, with commentary by the leading American Verne expert today, Walter James Miller. That book also comes with many of the artistic engravings that illustrated the original French first edition (no illustrations are to be found in the B&N Mercier reprint). Less attractive but more academic is the Oxford Classics version of Twenty Thousand Leagues. This review is posted on behalf of the North American Jules Verne Society by Jean-Michel Margot, president NAJVS."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"This is without a doubt the best translation of Jules Verne's 1870 science fiction classic &quot;Vingt mille lieues sous les mers&quot; (&quot;20,000 Leagues under the Sea&quot;). This translation by two Verne scholars, Walter James Miller and Frederick Paul Walter, takes all the knowledge available on the book and its author to not only make an accurate and readable complete text (early versions often omit a full quarter of the French original) that fixes the many errors of earlier translators, but also purges the text of many mistakes that were made by the original French compositors. The research and work that went into this translations is really quite stunning, and the result is a text that really lets Verne's genius shine: &quot;20,000 Leagues under the Sea&quot; is not only a brilliant piece of scientific prophecy, but also a thrilling story with superb, subtle characterizations.The plot is familiar: Captain Nemo, an enigmatic figure who has withdrawn himself from the world, tours the oceans in his submarine called the Nautilus. We see this journey of 20,000 leagues (approx. 43,200 miles) through the eyes of Professor Pierre Aronnax, a scientist who is both Nemo's guest and prisoner. Also aboard with Aronnax are his manservant Conseil and a gruff ship's harpooner, Ned Land. The Nautilus encounters many wonders and obstacles on its long voyage: underwater forests, giant clams, attacks by huge squid, imprisonment in ice at the South Pole, monster storms, a war with a pack of sperm whales, and the discovery of the lost continent of Atlantis. But as something deep and destructive gnaws away at Captain Nemo, his prisoners seek a way to escape from the miracle ship.In the English-speaking world Jules Verne has rarely received in the praise he truly deserves as a writer. People applaud his scientific foresight (while criticizing him for errors that were usually the fault of the translators), but shrug off his writing as inconsequential, with cardboard characters and plotless stories. If only these critics would read this translation of Verne's best novel...they would have to re-think their position on the great French writer! His genius for blending adventure, comedy, and psychology burst through in this translation. The book does veer into lengthy descriptions of marine life in places, and modern readers are likely to skim these parts (Verne even provides clues in the text to indicate when he's about to digress), but as a whole the novel is absolutely engrossing, throwing one stupendous adventure after another at the characters, while developing a mystery around Captain Nemo and increasing tension onboard the Nautilus so that the many different incidents hold together as a single plot. Even though submarines are commonplace technology today, Verne infuses his story with such awe-inspiring wonder that you can't help but feel the same sense of amazement as Professor Aronnax when he finds himself cruising the depths of the world's oceans. Real wonder never gets stakes, and no one was better at creating wonder than Jules Verne.Aside from the excellent translation, this edition contains numerous extras (if this were a DVD, it would be labeled as a Special Edition Director's Cut). The lengthy introduction explains Verne's background, education, the development of the novel, the many things that Verne accurately predicted, the book's unsung literary qualities, the different French texts, and the problems with earlier translations. All the original illustrations from the original French edition are reproduced in the text, and generous footnotes give the reader a guide through Verne's more obscure references and shed light on the author's scientific genius. As a bonus at the end of the book, the editors include a new translation of the relevant passages from &quot;Mysterious Island&quot; that discuss Captain Nemo's background (just in case you're too impatient to go read &quot;Mysterious Island&quot; for yourself to solve the Captain Nemo mystery). There's also a table of the measurements used in the novel for those readers who really want to test the author's scientific accuracy.There really isn't any other choice when it comes to translations of the &quot;20,000 Leagues under the Sea.&quot; Nothing comes close to this: it will appease hard science readers, and it will open people up to Jules Verne's overlooked literary talents. With the wealth of background information available, this edition does better by Jules Verne -- ANY Jules Verne -- than has ever been published in the English language."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"Most of Jules Verne's works were hastily translated, with many &quot;improvements&quot; made in the process, such as deletion of scientific exposition, as well as deletion of many moments deemed by the translator as dull.This, the Restored and Annotated version of 20,000 leagues, is a VAST improvement over previous English editions. The translation is very well done, and the annotations explain what has been changed and what previous translations accomplished.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"If you want to read the novel itself rather than a &quot;version&quot; based upon it, I recommend the relatively inexpensive 'Bantam Classic' edition of 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA. Although the foreword by Ray Bradbury is negligible, the Anthony Bonner translation is a graceful compromise between the 1870 French and modern American English, catching the flavor of the period without burying the reader in pseudo-Victorian turns of phrase.That said, readers who come to LEAGUES from either text, audio, or film adaptations of the novel are likely in for a shock, for the original novel is quite different. Some basics, however, remain the same: Professor Arronax, his valet Conseil, and harpooner Ned Land are coaxed into assisting the United States in a search for a sea monster said to be terrorizing shipping lanes--but the monster is not flesh and blood. The three soon find themselves in the hands of the mysterious Captain Nemo, who has created a machine that glides beneath the surface of the ocean: a submarine named Nautilus.But there the similarity ends. While there are very clear similarities between the novel and the various adaptations it has spawned, the Verne novel is less concerned with story, characters, and adventures than it is in creating a plausible vision of something that simply did not exist at the time Verne wrote: a fully functional submarine capable of navigating even the most treacherous waters. Consequently, the bulk of Verne's text is concerned with detailed descriptions of the Nautilus and the sealife it encounters.Many modern readers may find it uphill work, particularly when Professor Arronax determinedly notes the sealife he sees to the point of scientific classification. But even so, and while it may not reach the level of &quot;great art&quot; literature, LEAGUES is a fascinating novel to read--fascinating as much for itself as for what it tells us about the world of the 1870s and what was believed to be possible. The vision that Verne had would indeed come to pass: there would be submarines, and they would strong enough to brave the polar seas. It is an impressive accomplishment--and a tremendously fun read.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"This is Jules Verne's classic tale of undersea adventure, as best I can tell based on the 1873 translation by Lewis Mercier. Since that's been the standard English translation for over a hundred years, it's probably the one you remember reading way back when, and the edition you'll be familiar with.Re-reading this as an adult, and an adult who's spent twenty-plus years since then reading science fiction, I did have to remind myself more than once how amazing the then-future technologies Verne describes, like electric rifles, undersea diving suits, electric motors, etc., would have been to his contemporary readers; the book was first published in 1869, a mere five years after the Confederate submarine Hunley became the first submarine to sink an enemy warship (and sank itself in the process). At times I found myself mentally substituting \\"outer space\\" for \\"under sea,\\" just to help me analogize the situation. Despite that, the plot and action were as riveting now as they were when I first read it twenty years ago. I did find myself, now as then, skimming over much of Verne's extensive scientific descriptions of undersea flora and fauna, etc., but that might be my own failing as a reader -- when I did take the time to read Verne's descriptions, I did sometimes catch the same sense of aquatic wonder I remember from watching films like _The Life Aquatic_.From what I've read, the Mercier translation this is based on contains a number of translation errors, cuts out about 20% of the text, etc. Corrected, completed, updated ebook editions of this classic are available on Amazon, but they cost money -- I've been unable to find an out-of-copyright, corrected, complete, and free edition. For readers on a budget, though, this is probably the version you remember, and if read in the right way -- keeping in mind the era in which it was written, and skimming whenever the science gets too dry or detailed for you -- it's still quite entertaining.Verne did write a sequel, _The Mysterious Island_, also available in the kindle free store; the better translation is available here:The Mysterious Island."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"I could not believe this version of 20,000 leagues under the sea. I learned so much from this book. All the other movies and stories that I heard about Captain Nemo were not even close to all the adventures that he goes on in this book. When I think about the movie by Walt Disney and then remember the book I realize that the movie was about 1/4 of the books adventures.All the adventures that I never heard about before like the hunt on the sea floor with the electric bullets, the Arabian tunnel under the sea, Santorin Island the Grecian Archipelago, the volcanoes of the Mediterranean, the Bay of Vigo with all the treasures, the size of the mountains in Atlantis, the adventure at the South Pole, the fight with all the sperm whales, his home Island and the production of salt to run his electric engines.There is so much more to this story than what I have heard before and in this edition the foot notes are excellent. I especially like the story of Arachne and how the name of Arachnid came to mean spiders. The footnotes explain all the literary references which are helpful to understanding the characters. There is so much information here about the sea world in an adventure that makes each moment exciting.Verne must have done so much research for this book to get all the scientific information correct. I never thought they knew all those things about the sea at that time.I was surprised by the character of Nemo who never seemed to go after anyone unless he was attacked. The whole idea that he chased after all forms of warships was something made up in Hollywood. Nemo never seemed to want to even deal with people. The story of Nemo's life at the end of the book explains many of his behaviors.The description of all the types of food that they were constantly eating was interesting you never knew what they were going to catch in the Nautilus' nets.I thought the adventure at the South Pole was the best of all with the predicament that they got into. It was the most adventurous and had the most suspense.I do not know why a book like this is not required reading for high school kids they would learn so much as well as adults. There is so much science geography, ichthyology, astronomy practical uses of physics etc.I would recommend this book to everyone who likes science and adventure."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"One of the great problems with Jules Verne is that in the English speaking world he is relagated to the category of &quot;Boys' Own Adventures&quot;. On the Continent, however, he is considered a brilliant social commentator, and biting satirist, AND a man who predicted the future. This is a volume that helps set matters to the right.If you know of &quot;20,000 Leagues&quot; already, you will find little different at first. The plot is still the plot. Nemo is still Nemo, Prof. Aronnax is still pompous and fascinated by the Nautilus and Ned Land....Ned Land is a flaming socialist.This is one of the major shifts between the original French and the &quot;cleaned up&quot; English editions. Most of the science of the day was pulled out as a &quot;dull read&quot; and all the Socialism, anti-English remarks, and other commentaries of a &quot;questionable nature&quot; were excised. We Americans have unfortunately been until only very recently only able to find these poor early translations, or translations based on these poor translations. There is much more to Verne than submarines and diving suits. He is a man with a vision of his times, both scientific and political, and his books underline this strongly.English readers, demand your Verne well-translated! Do not allow yourself to be fobbed off with bowlderized versions! To be able to read as he wrote himself (well, in English, for those of us who don't read French...) is a greater pleasure than merely an amusing old science-fiction story from the 19th century. Reading this book, as Verne /meant/ it to be read, if a pleasure, but also a struggle to understand ourselves and our relationship to the oceans themselves."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"This is Jules Verne at his best, creating the enigmatic character of Captain Nemo.The setting is the mid-nineteenth century. Deadly and mysterious calamities continue to befall ocean-going vessels, with wild reports by survivors that the culprit is a sea monster large enough to ram and sink ships. French professor M. Aronnax finds himself aboard the Abraham Lincoln, a ship charged with finding and destroying the beast. Accompanying him is his loyal servant, Conseil. The ship succeeds in locating the leviathan, but it, too, falls victim to a deadly attack. Aronnax, Conseil, and a Canadian harpooner named Ned Land are the sole survivors--rescued by none other than the \\"monster\\" itself, which turns out not to be flesh and bone, but the world's largest and most technically advanced submarine.They meet Captain Nemo, the owner, inventor, and sovereign leader of the flag-less ship, Nautilus. He explains that they're now his prisoners for life, though they will be treated well and are free to roam the ship. Thus begins an underwater tour of the planet, narrated by the fascinated Aronnax. With today's knowledge of the seas, some of the action is laughable, but at the time this was leading-edge science fiction. Verne's vision of submarine technology, the use of electricity, scuba operations, and various other things is uncanny and typical of great science fiction writers' ability to foretell the future. The ridiculous episodes include traversing an underwater tunnel beneath the Suez to the Mediterranean; a visit to Atlantis; and a trip to the South Pole under the ice, where they break through the surface for a look-see. This would be difficult, considering that the ice is more than a mile thick with a continent of solid rock below. But remember that when Verne wrote the book in 1869, Antarctica had not been explored and remained a virtual myth.The enduring lure of 20,000 Leagues, though, is Verne's Captain Nemo. It takes the entire book (and then some) to learn who this genius Nemo really is. What horrible ordeal has produced such a cynical man, one driven to build the self-sustaining Nautilus, to swear off all contact with the \\"civilized\\" world, never to touch land again, and to ruthlessly and brutally defend himself against any perceived threat? At one glance we see a maniacal scientist worthy of a James Bond thriller. But at closer inspection, Verne has captured the timeless personification of angst over the errors and excesses of Man's interminable war against Nature and himself. Aspects of this same character can today be found in political and environmental activism throughout the world. Actually, it strikes a cord with us all; everyone wants at some time to build what today would amount to a spaceship and shove off from this screwed up planet, saying, \\"Adios, idiots. It's your mess now.\\" --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Big Ice."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"This is the &#34;classic&#34; old translation by Louis Mercier most of us read and loved. But a good bit of the novel was left out, not so much that the story was greatly altered, but still not as Verne wrote it and intended it to be. Fortunately, there is another free public domain version available which I would encourage you to also download and read; this is a modern translation by F. P. Walter and it is unabridged. It may be found in the Kindle store by typing: Vingt Mille Lieues Sous Les Mers English (or simply: Verne Vingt Mille English). The title is French but don't worry, the book is entirely in English with an informative introduction by Walter. This great new translation is wordier than the old one, but it comes as close, in English, to what Verne actually wrote in French--and it is complete. I would strongly urge you to compare them--especially if you are a true Jules Verne fan."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea is a masterful science fiction classic and the crowning achievement of Verne's impressive literary legacy. While the story itself is absorbing, it is the character of the enigmatic Captain Nemo that makes this novel so successful. Many of the characters we meet in Verne's fiction are one-dimensional; while eccentric, a man like Professor Lidenbrock in Journey to the Centre of the Earth is easy to understand, seemingly driven by science and nothing else. In contrast, Captain Nemo is an incredibly complex man whom neither the reader nor the protagonist is ever really able to understand. He has forsaken all of humanity and retreated beneath the sea, yet he shows great compassion to his crewmen and to the poor on earth; he is generally self-absorbed and emotionless, yet we see glimpses of an emotional trauma that constantly afflicts him and is capable of destroying him. He has suffered a great loss at some point in his life, and his sorrow is matched only by a drive for vengeance against his unnamed oppressors. Captain Nemo is one of the most interesting, delightfully mysterious characters in all of literature.As for the story, a naturalist, his assistant, and a harpooner join a party in search of a giant sea creature which has attacked a couple of ships. They are knocked overboard and find themselves saved by the monster, which turns out to be a submarine manned by a mysterious crew of sailors. Captain Nemo requires them to stay on board the Nautilus permanently because he wants to keep the existence of his submarine a secret from the world. The three men sail on the Nautilus for ten months, exploring the world's oceans and seas. They marvel at the animal life under the waves; explore underground forests, oyster beds, deep trenches; gaze with somber eyes at great numbers of sunken vessels; fight off giant squids and dangerous sharks; cast their eyes upon the sunken continent of Atlantis; and burrow underneath the polar ice caps to emerge at the South Pole. All the while, they hope to escape and return to their homelands, although the naturalist hesitates to leave his traveling laboratory until such a time as Captain Nemo's emotions become dangerously unbalanced.All in all, this is an incredibly rich, fascinating novel with a poignant yet powerful conclusion. Contemporary readers must have been overpowered by Verne's descriptions of this unknown sailing vessel and the exploits the sub was capable of. That magical element is missing from modern reader's reactions, but this does little to hinder the overall effect of the story. There is one negative aspect to the book--the naturalist and his assistant go out of their way to name and catalogue virtually every animal, mineral, and plant they discover. This is interesting to a point, but the plot often finds itself bogged down for a couple of pages while the reader is bombarded with a veritable encyclopedia of scientific names which are virtually unpronounceable and largely meaningless to his/her ears. These interludes are the only things slowing down the story, however. It is a joy to read the adventures these men have under the sea, and it is even more fascinating to ponder the mind of Captain Nemo. Even the unseen depths of the sea cannot offer the reader a mystery as deep and powerful as that of the Nautilus' exceptional captain."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"Many others have left very informed reviews, so I will simply say that it was a very interesting look at human relationships. My wife and I listened as we drove accross America, enjoying hearing words that are all but lost in modern culture.Rae"},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"The classic undersea adventure doesn't disappoint. Full of mystery, both in terms of the unknown element of the seas, but in the behavior of cagey Captain Nemo. Easily engaged, the reader will travel beneath the sea, visiting places of the imagination, and seeing phenomena that I hope a lucky few may have witnessed."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (Books of Wonder)is one of my favourite books of all time. Verne has managed to writing an intriguing, invigorating and adventure-filled adventure that also delves into questions morality and religion. Verne's love of science and technology is a leading theme through out the book and one gets a lesson in the marine-life as it was known during his lifetime. The illustrations by the Dillon's are certainly a work of art to bestow and admire. The afterword by Peter Glassman is very well-written and informative. I can highly recommend this book to readers of all ages and I gave this amazing classic a strong 5/5. 5/5."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"We are reading the unabridged version to the kids and this is an indespensible aid for understanding the descriptive story. The pictures are great and very accurate to the descriptions. Historical notes put the story in context of when it was written (i.e. marvels at an electric engine, extant knowledge of sea life, predictions about underwater scuba gear). The kids can follow along in this while I read and the text is very close. I heartily recommend it as a reading aid."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"Jules Verne was a genius well ahead of his time. In this classic book he takes the reader through the unexplored depths of the ocean on a fantastic and breathtaking voyage fraught with excitement and danger.I have read several reviews of this book from a variety of sources. The biggest criticism that is offered by the reviewers is that throughout the book Verne, through the words of Professor Annorax, lists and describes a multitude of sea life, both flora and fauna. Many reviewers find this distracting and boring. My personal opinion is that the reason that many readers and reviewers criticize this is because they are comparing the book to the very poor Disney film interpretation and adaptation of the book.In truth, the book would suffer greatly without the detailed description of the flora and fauna observed by Professor Annorax. Why? I believe that many of the readers and reviewers misunderstand Verne's intention of who Professor Annorax is. Professor Annorax is a world renown naturalist and specialist in sea life. That is exactly what makes this story so wonderful. Verne takes the worlds foremost expert on sea flora and fauna and throws him into a world previously unknown to him. By observing the many life forms never before documented Annorax realizes just how much he does not know and becomes an even greater expert than before. The documentation of the many species is the natural response an expert naturalist would have to the sudden discovery of a whole new world of flora and fauna.Clearly, Verne had a vivid imagination by describing a functioning submarine well before the concept of a submarine had ever been dreamt of. The detailed explanations of how the submarine works and how it is able to produce electricity and power from nothing more than sea water is perhaps the best kind of science fiction, the kind that has a basis in fact. I have to believe that when the first submarines were being built that the inventors had to have made a serious study of Verne's Nautilus. To have come up with such an intricate, detailed, and scientifically sound description of a submarine in his time is absolutely astounding.Finally, the accuracy of the never before seen flora and fauna when coupled with the scientifically accurate description of the design and functioning of the Nautilus has to make one wonder if Captain Nemo and the Nautilus are really science fiction or if by some miracle they did actually exist and instead of fiction this story was a summary of a real experience Verne, as Professor Annorax, actually experienced."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea was one of the best books of it's time and it's legacy still continues today. The author Jules Verne is able to create a world that is fantastic and believable at the same time. However there are moments in which the details become repetitive and rather insignificant.The main character Captain Nemo, it is never obvious if he is the protagonist or antagonist, has a personality that is quite paradoxical. He believes that mankind has wrecked the earth and has given up on the human race as so decides to escape it by traveling the seas in his submarine. However, he is compassionate towards his crew members. At most times he is emotionless, but it is his emotional trauma that bothers him more than anything else. He is a complex character who is interesting, mysterious, and quite interesting to analyze.The story line is intriguing and Verne's imagination adds to the impact of the plot. The story begins with a naturalist, his assistant, and a harpooner looking for a giant sea creature that has destroyed several ships. It turns out that this creature that they are looking for, and find, is Captain Nemo's submarine. Verne is also able to create a wonderful world full of different creature of the sea as well as the submarine it's self. At the time the book was written sea travel was common but submarines were unheard of. The description of the vessel and its ability must have wowed readers of the time.However, it's Verne's over usage of description and unnecessary plot that tends to ruin the pace of the story. For pages on end there is a constant rambling of encyclopedia-like information. Is it really necessary to know the name, size, origin, composition, weight (etc) of some random mineral that naturalist happens to find?Unfortunately these random occurrences make the book a little hard to follow, but in the end it is still a classic that everyone should end up reading."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"Twenty Thousand Leagues under The Sea by Jules Verne is one of the bestscience fiction books. I would recommend the movie starring James Masonas Captain Nemo. It is well written as all of Jules Verne's books are.Danny Fleming, author of How to Prove The Collatz Conjecture."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"Having chewed and digested \\"Around the World in Eighty Days\\", \\"Five Weeks in a Balloon\\" and \\"Journey to the Centre of the Earth\\", I set out to devour another chef d'oeuvre of Verne [the often overlooked \\"true\\" father of science fiction] with much relish. Sure, \\"20,000 Leagues\\" seemed bigger than the others I'd read, but I thought it would be the classic excitement and drama of Verne all the way. Well, I was nearly right.Professor Arronax leaves a \\"normal\\" life in France for the US, taking his assistant with him, to investigate the matter that has taken all the attention of the \\"modern\\" or \\"known\\" world. Joined by the egotistic harpooner, Ned Land, they seek adventure, and they find it.Again, I see Verne's classic touch of the dramatic as the threesome find the monster - the Nautilus - or rather, as the Nautilus finds them. They awaken to an interminable adventure under the sea. The Professor is fascinated, or perhaps, intoxicated with the endless wealth of life in the sea and spends hours, days and months observing and recording. The tireless taxonomist takes in all the eye can see and with the help of his assistant, classifies it all. This is where the tedium began for me as the reader. Pages upon pages of pure taxonomy.The accounts of the undersea explorations in specially designed suits offers some relief. The enigmatic Captain Nemo is in charge; incidents and never accidents. Everything about him is shrouded in mystery - pondering on the life of Captain Nemo offers some useful distraction and provides the fuel to consume more and more pages.However, you can never miss Verne's climactic scenes, where he brings drama and suspense to their peak. The almighty Nautilus is trapped inside a huge mass of ice at the South Pole, and for the first time, Captain Nemo shows signs of worry, however subtle. Yet, he goes on with a steely determination. Things are looking very desperate, but as usual, the day is saved. However, I found myself following every detail, sharing all their fears, their toil, their despair. Their ecstasy was mine when the Nautilus broke free. I was totally drawn in......The irritable Ned Land sparks the fire of escape. He's sick and tired of submarine life as Nemo shows no signs of releasing his charges. The adventure ends with the escape of the threesome back to terra firma, or does it? I guess it continued with Captain Nemo and his longsuffering crew until his death, burying years of useful knowledge and resources under the sea. Or did he live forever?A highly challenging but rewarding read for the discerning reader or Verne fanatic."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"Oh my gosh, this book is so cool! And so very important in understanding Verne's place in literary and scientific history. This large format book is an annotated version of the most widely circulated English translation of t he Verne classic. And because of the annotations, we learn how HORRIBLY Verne's work was translated from the original French. A great example comes near the beginning of the book when the delightfully detailed annotation in the margin points out that the common edition translation talks of the narrator returning from the \\"disagreeable territory of Nebraska.\\" We learn from the annotation that this is a huge distortion of the narrator's personality and experience. Verne's original writing spoke of the \\"badlands of Nebraska\\" and actually had a favorable attitude toward the region. We learn from the annotations that there were dozens of such awful, misleading mistranslations throughout the common edition that so many people have read, with the author often criticized for errors the he should not be held accountable for. Some of the mistranslations are comical in retrospect. For example we learn in this edition that the common edition includes the phrase \\"at the expense of my loins\\" when, in fact, a more accurate translation would be \\"hurting my back.\\"Verne's book is so filled with cutting edge science of his day and the annotations enlighten us so much about them. Thus this annotated version makes Verne's story an even more interesting and multi-dimentional reading experience."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea20,000 Leagues Under the Sea by Jules Verne is a mysterious adventure book about four voyagers pioneering the unknown depths of the sea. The main characters of this book are Pierre Aronnax, Counseil, Ned Land, and Captain Nemo. Pierre Aronnax is an assistant professor at a natural history museum and Counseil is Aronnax's 30 year old servant. Ned Land is an expert Canadian harpooner with an instinct to kill. Finally, Captain Nemo the mystifying captain of the ship takes them in and does not release them. The French narrator of this story, Pierre Aronnax, while intrigued by Captain Nemo and their many underwater excursions knows that he is still a captive and is planning to escape.Pierre Aronnax, his servant Conseil, and Ned Land were all summoned to the Abraham Lincoln a ship designed to pursue the monster who was tormenting voyagers on the seas. They encounter a large and swift object in the sea and all three of them are thrown over board. The three men find out later that it was a submarine that attacked them and the commander of this submarine Captain Nemo brings them aboard his vessel. Nemo gives them a grand tour of the vessel. He still treats them like captives but grants them some mobility. Their first adventure with Captain Nemo is the Pearl Fields. The Pearl Fields are fields filled with pearl oysters but Nemo doesn't stop for any of them. He takes them into a huge cave and eventually leads them to a 7-foot long oyster with a pearl the size of a coconut. Nemo does not take the oyster but leaves it to grow. The next encounter is with a gigantic shark. The shark is preying on a helpless fisherman when Nemo jumps in to stab it in the belly. The shark overthrows Nemo but Ned Land is quick to defend him by spearing the shark through the head. The waters are foggy with blood but Nemo manages to bring the fisherman back to his boat and revive him. While these men are thrown together by chance they still show devotion to each other and acts of bravery and humanity. Still Arronax continues to want to escape. The last adventure these men have together is just off the American Coast when seven giant sea monsters that resemble squid attack their submarine. Just as they open the hatch a giant tentacle swirls down into the ship and grabs a hold of a defenseless sailor. As the squid's arm is slinking down Nemo cuts it off with a hatchet. They all fiercely battle the monsters as Ned Land barely escapes the jaws of one squid with Nemo's help. They soon fight off all the enormous squid and are on their way again. They come upon a whirl pool and as they frantically try to escape, a life boat is ripped from the submarine and Pierre Aronnax's world goes dark. What becomes of Nemo and his crew, Ned Land, Aronnax and his humble servant Conseil is the last part of the book.I thought this book was a great read and kept me guessing all the way through. It is not all violence and gore most of the book is about these adventurers discovering nature and the sea. The characters are interesting and very different from each other. Nemo is the caring yet stern captain of the ship while Pierre is somewhat shy and curious. I like both of these characters equally but respect Nemo more because of his strength and convictions. Ned Land is a hostile maverick with the instinct to kill while Conseil is gentle and barely expresses his personality except for his devotion to Arronax. I think Ned Land is a dangerous person to be with but he could save your life if you run into trouble and I admire Conseil's unflinching loyalty to Aronnax. The discovery and respect for nature is an underlying theme throughout the book and I was fascinated by this point of view because it was written so long ago. I can't compare this book to any other book because it is unique but probably the closest book would be Journey to the Center of the Earth which is also an adventure book. Anyone who likes a creative book with lots of adventure, action and heroics would find this book extraordinary."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"A fantasy written long ago in 1887, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea started almost an entire genre of fantasy with submarines like the Tom Clancy novels. In this story ships all over the world claim to have seen a mysterious shifting black reef. Many thought it was just a rumor until it bore a hole into the hull of a steamer that had been able to make it back to shore. Pierre Arronax, a French biology expert, and his servant are invited on a ship going to hunt this creature. When the ship sunk, they found themselves captive on the creature that turned out to be a submarine, and it captain, Nemo, a genius who despised human society, showed them the wonders of the depths.Slow and plodding, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea does not match the excitement of more contemporary fantasy fiction. One reason that this book did not appeal to me is that, compared to the other fantasy book that I am reading, The Fires of Heaven by Robert Jordan, the characters and events are dull and boring. For example, a protagonist in The Fires of Heaven, Mat Cauthon, has two intriguing aspects. One is his incredible luck in games of chance. The other, most fascinating aspect, is that he has vivid memories of lives lived in the distant past. there is no character in the Jules Vern novel that can compare to such a riveting figure.Jules Vern's novel is flat and unimaginative in contrast to Robert Jordan's work. I was told it was a classic, but I was disappointed by its quality of creativity. I would not recommend this book to anyone who enjoys fantasy fiction."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"okay i think this is a pretty good book but it's not that intresting.

Verne always wrote his novels with a tool that many novelists, especially scifi novelists, lack. That tool is knowledge.

It's so facinating now, so many years in the future, to see how amazingly close to the truth Verne often was using the little information available to him and his great scientific mind.

But the sea creature turns out to be a submarine, the Nautilus, and they're joined by the harpooner Ned Land in being rescued/captured by its crew when their attack on it fails.I definitely encountered this book far too late to fully enjoy it. Like when I tried re-reading Tolkein a couple of years ago, I found I lacked the patience to read through pages and pages of interminable description. There were several times when I just couldn't stand it any longer and I'd put the book down and go do something else. Only sheer stubbornness made me finish it.The story itself was interesting, though the style of the times was a bit of an obstacle. The enigmatic Captain Nemo is never fully explained, nor are the professor and his two companions. It's left up to the reader to fill in the blanks. The professor's unconcern about his imprisonment on the submarine is partially explained by his fascination with the undersea worlds he encounters; the complacence of his assistant and Ned Land are less understandable. Ned Land does try to escape occasionally, but he's portrayed as narrow-mindedly violent because of that, which I found peculiar.I do see why films were made from this--condensing those descriptive passages into scenery would make the action and adventure parts of the story stand out more. I've never seen one, but I'm thinking of adding one to the Netflix queue. Any suggestions of which version to try?In short, I'm giving this 4 stars for the story, but 2 stars for the pain of reading it."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"Unfortunately, \\"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\\" shows its age.

However, I was bored in the 1950's and cannot imagine that today's youngsters will do much better.

But Jules Verne had an almost eerily prophetic knack for knowing what technology would be used in the future -- and he put it to work in \\"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea,\\" a slow-moving adventure tale with plenty of proto-steampunk and almost fantastical undersea life.Ships in the middle of the ocean are suddenly seeing -- and being attacked by -- \\"a long object, spindle-shaped, occasionally phosphorescent, and infinitely larger and more rapid in its movements than a whale.\\"Eventually the US government sends out a ship to capture the object, and during a sea battle Professor Aronnax, his manservant Conseil and harpooner Ned Land go overboard. Soon they're picked up by the Nautilus, the vast submarine that has been causing all this trouble, and introduced to Captain Nemo -- an intelligent, charismatic man who belongs to no nation.Aronnax becomes fascinated by Nemo, his ship and his library -- as well as the amazing underwater adventures that Nemo introduces them to, like pearl-hunting and fighting a giant squid. But the captain's free, lawless life has its dark side, and the three men begin to realize that they must get away from the Nautilus no matter what.It's actually rather amazing that Jules Verne not only dreamed up the idea of a semi-modern submarine long before they existed, but thought out the applications, the stealth, and the vast size. And since nothing like the Nautilus existed at the time, there's a slightly fantastical, steampunk flavor to \\"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.\\"And as usual, Verne painstakingly studies everything about his imagined world, filling it with science (although he obviously didn't know about water/air pressure) and lovely descriptions of the Nautilus and the eerie underwater world (giant oysters, forests, Atlantis). The only flaw is that he tends to ramble on about exact measurements and travel details; there are boring patches here and there.But Captain Nemo is probably one of Verne's most fascinating characters -- a charismatic, embittered man who is a sort of noble sea pirate. He does some stuff that is totally unacceptable (sinking a random warship), but he also has little spurts of kindness and generosity towards poor and powerless peoples of the world.

Instead of meat (which they could not get) they ate many kinds of fish and sea plants, which, unless you were told, were indistiguishable from land- raised meat and vegetables.

The reader can clearly identify with the characters and their view of being on the Nautilus. Captain Nemo is an enigmatic person with many layers. In this one will see Man vs. man, and man vs. nature. For some the descriptions of various Marine life may seem over done.

The United States Government sends Professor Arronnax out to sea on the ship called the Abraham Lincoln to search for the monster. Professor Arronnax and his servant, Conseil, set out on the adventure.Professor Arronnax soon learns that the monster is really a steel-plated submarine, called the Nautilus. The Nautilus crashes into their ship and Professor Arronnax, Conseil and Ned, a harpooner, fall into the water and are captured by Captain Nemo. On the Nautilus, Professor Arronnax, Conseil and Ted watch Captain Nemo as he explores the under water world. On the Nautilus they visit many places including the lost continent of Atlantis, the South Pole and the Great Ice Barrier. They search for treasure and have fights with unfriendly sea creatures. Captain Nemo, however, rams the Nautilus into other ships when they get into his way. Nemo rams the Nautilus into a war ship one day because he believes the people on the ship are responsible for killing his family and taking everything away from him that he loves. Professor Arronnax realizes that Captian Nemo is crazy and that they must escape. Professor Arronnax, Conseil and Ted plan their escape only to learn that the Nautilus was caught up in the Maelstrom, the most violent whirlpool in the world. No ship had ever escaped the current of the Maelstrom! Do Professor Arronnax, Conseil and Ted escape the Nautilus and the violent whirlpool or do they drown in the whirlpool and sink to the bottom of the sea?I chose to read this book because I like adventure books and this certainly has adventure and excitement in it. I think that anyone who enjoys reading adventure stories should purchase this book because the characters go to many different places and always are in constant danger. I could not put the book down!

There was always action happening, for example, when the giant squid attacked the Nautilus. The characters were realistic and intriguing. I particularly liked Conseil because he was Professor Aronnax's servant and was extremely loyal. The plot seemed like it could be very real. I learned a lot about different geographic settings.

He is certainly a master in mixing scientific facts with literary fiction. A true visionary. Although I have seen various movie versions, I was still surprised at some of the events in this story. The book seemed to move along well besides a relatively slow begining. It has everything a great story should have. Mystery, adventure, action, exotic locations and even a bit of romance, albeit it is with Nemo and the Sea.This particular version was an &quot;audio book&quot; performed by Harlan Ellison. His narration was inspired. I also enjoyed his voice characterizations, especially the impersonation of James Mason's Captain Nemo. It had a reminiscent quality. Music and sound effects would have been a nice touch as long as it wouldn't be distracting. For me, the book ended too quickly. I wanted to hear more of their adventures and would have also liked to have read more about Nemo's past. Although, Verne does tell us more in &quot;The Mysterious Island&quot;. Another book I shall look forward in taking up soon. I am sure it will be an equally pleasing experience."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"It's indeed ironic that great works of literature are censored, not only prior to publication, but also after the books hit the shelves. Depending on a period and country, even a incontroversial author like Jules Verne suffered from closed-mindedness. That totalitarian regimes see fit to burn books, or to actively block publication and distribution of some books, in hope that the nation will not see the uneasy point of view often expressed in books - that fact does not surprise anyone anymore nowadays. But that such practices have been utilized in the land of the free and the brave - makes us wonder how different these two systems are. What had poor Verne done to deserve censorship? \\"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea\\" was censored prior to publication, and the original manuscript never saw the day during Verne's lifetime. Against his will the author had to cut the social commentary from his trilogy, of which this novel is the first volume. By today's standards, the punishment was incomparable to the guilt, but even then it was disturbing that a work of fiction, a splendid tale of adventure written for the purpose of entertainment and education of the reader, not a political pastiche, mind you, had to have been censored. In particular, the crucial part of the novel had been cut, one in which we learn what were the origins of Captain Nemo, his motivations and heritage. Only years later, after Verne's death, the original manuscript was published, to reveal that Verne originally intended Nemo to have been a Polish nobleman, who escaped his Vaterland after the failure of the 1863 uprising against the Russian Empire. Nemo decided to remove himself from the society, literally from human view - by constructing the famous Nautilus, a submarine, in which he cruised the tranquil abyss of the oceans, where no hand would touch him, and where he wouldn't have to stand the pettiness and cruelty of his fellow human beings.Thus, if you happened to have read the censored version, you would be genuinely puzzled as to the motivations of the Captain. Today, many abridged versions of Verne's novels appear in print, where most of the content is done away with, and what is left is the bare-bones action storyline. To mutilate the book in this way is to commit an unforgivable crime in general, and to hurt the author and readers in particular. \\"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea\\" deserves to be widely read just as it had been intended by the author, with its wealth of scientific and prophetic information left untouched, with the commentaries and philosophical musings intact. Only then, within the grand context, the adventure makes sense, only then it is art. I have read this novel circa twenty times; I have admired Captain Nemo for years; I have held my breath in the depths of the Golfstr&ouml;m in the Norwegian Sea during the storm, and during many thrilling moments in the book, not to mention the unforgettable conclusion of the novel; I have tried to solve the mystery of the waterborne ship made of steel, with its many complicated instruments; I have followed the arguments hurled between the Captain and the involuntary passengers of the Nautilus; and finally, I was trembling all over whenever I reached the culmination of the adventure. Verne was a genius, and Captain Nemo was his most original character creation, one I am very fond of for personal reasons, as is I am sure the case with many other readers of the prophetic French author."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"THIS IS A CLASSIC THIS IS A CLASSIC.

Although they are in a sense prisoners, they are allowed to use all the facilities aboard the submarine. This submarine, powered by nuclear energy and christened the Nautilus, is one of Verne's many brilliant predictions of modern life made throughout many of his works. This like may others was correct. Through out the book, the reader gains a vast knowledge of marine life, and the lives of people in distant lands.The book begins when Professor Pierre Aronnax, the narrator of the story, boards an American frigate commissioned to investigate a rash of attacks on international shipping by what is thought to be an amphibious monster. The supposed sea creature, which is actually the submarine Nautilus, sinks Aronnax's vessel and imprisons him along with his devoted servant Conseil and Ned Land, a temperamental harpooner. When they are returned to their senses, the find themselves inside a dark, gloomy, desolate, endless, predicament. They are locked in a cell. However they soon meet Captain Nemo who agrees to let them move about the ship freely on one condition. They must remain aboard the Nautilus. So begins a great adventure of a truly fantastic voyage from the pearl-laden waters of Ceylon to the icy dangers of the South Pole, as Captain Nemo, one of the greatest villains ever created, takes his revenge on all society.The detail that Verne pours into this book is amazing. This is one of the few books that are capable of making the readers feel that they are actually there. His descriptions of how the Nautilus operates, how Nemo's crew harvests food and his account of hunting on Hawaii are excellent, and the plot never falters. The characters are wonderfully scripted; each one having their own unique personality, and they are weaved flawlessly into the awe filled spectacle.This is the book that predicted that there would be submarines, and that submarines would eventually go to the South Pole. It predicted the development of the SCUBA suit; it even predicted nuclear powered ships. The technology used in this book makes it easy to understand even today.

The reader can picture this adventure happening as if it actually happened. The climax of the book will keep you turning the pages. That is the best thing going for this book. The worst thing about the book is the length/number of pages. It contains 371 pages and if one is wanting to read something quickly this is definitely a book that will take some time. So plan ahead and take an exciting adventure."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"The hardcover version of the Sterling edition is bound and printed nicely. Jules Verne's story is enthralling and full of detail. However, the translation in the Sterling edition is very old and can be rather tongue-twisting when read aloud. The word ordering in the sentences often reflects the original French a bit too much. Likewise, the numereous names of various flora and fauna are rendered in Latin form, rather than the more common names I'm familiar with. I've found Frederick Paul Walter's newer (and also unabridged) translation to be much easier to read:Amazing Journeys: Journey to the Center of the Earth, From the Earth to the Moon, Circling the Moon, 20,000 Leagues Under the Seas, and Around the World in 80 Days."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"Regular readers of [...] won't be surprised to learn that the first book I read on the Kindle was 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. There's something so right about reading a century-old tale -- whose narrator is enthralled with the power of electricity -- on a device that's a pretty darn enthralling use of electricity.That said, in exploring how the image of technology and the future has changed over time, few books are as influential as this one. Some observations:1. Captain Nemo's built himself a utopia. Consider that he says the Nautilus is out of reach from tyrants and built so well that it can't be damaged by nature. Nemo says he's never been as free as when he put himself inside the sub. There's a library with nearly unlimited information. The ocean provides an unlimited amount of food. Everyone's healthy thanks to the constant temperature and fresh sea air. Electricity, described as providing light \\"more uniform and continuous than the sun\\" and behaving \\"more obedient than gas\\" provides an unlimited amount of power. Sounds like every other golden age longed for through time, but this one is all thanks to technology--and especially electricity.2. The constant use of extreme detail in the book, going on for pages and pages about what the fish look like and rattling off measurements, give the fantasy parts of the book much more credence. It's a lesson on the benefits of getting granular when selling a vision of the future.3. There's a great passage where, on behalf of science, Verne snobbily says, \\"It was Tasman who discovered this group in 1643, the year Torricelli invented the barometer and Louis XIV mounted the throne. I leave the reader to decide which of these events has been more useful to the human race.\\" This wasn't the first time an innovator scoffed at a politician, but it's certainly one of the sharpest. Food for thought for those innovation v. public policy debates that break out every so often."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"I thought that the book had one of the best plot lines I've ever seen, reguardless of the fact that there is only slight building up to the climax. The only thing that I didn't think was that good about the book was that about every other page, Jules Verne would go into a paragraph description of the animals. For example, he would say something like: I just saw a tuna. But not the normal tuna, it was yellow-bellied, had dorsal fins that went at a downward angle, etc.\\" Otherwise, I thought it was a great read and well worth the money. I will be purchasing more of Jules Verne's books very soon. I highly suggest for you to read this book. Another thing, if you enjoyed watching the 1954 \\"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea Film,\\" I highly suggest the book because the movie only gives a small picture of what actually occurred during their submarine venture and the book tells you everything, and the occurrences are just amazing.The novel basically tells the story of Professor Arronax, Ned Land and Conseil who get taken aboard the Nautilus and experiences many adverntures, such as going to Atlantis, an underwater hunt, getting trapped in an ice block and much more."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"I don't pretend to be a literary know-it-all. I know about as much about classic literature as I do about moose hunting...and that ain't much. For whatever reason, I thought it might make me a more cultured and enlightened person if I read some of the old school fiction. You know, the authors that nobody ever mentions unless you're in an English class. They may be crusty, but they're considered to have written some of the greatest novels ever.While my trek through the classics is still at its infancy, I decided to take that journey 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea that Jules Verne has been begging me to take ever since I was a wee lad. I've always noticed the various covers of this book over the years, often featuring a giant squid attacking either a submarine or some guy in an old-timey diving suit, or even both. Sometimes there's a treasure chest involved, too. It's no wonder that the book has always peaked my interest. How could you go wrong with such an inviting cover. It was about time that I figured out what was up with this Captain Nemo guy I'd always heard about.Through virtually the entire book, you have basically only four characters. Captain Nemo, of course, is the one everyone's heard of. He's the mysterious commander of an astonishing vehicle for its time, an electric submarine called The Nautilus. Professor Arronax, his servent Conseil, and Ned Land, a noted French-canadian harpooner, end up as captives aboard Nemo's strange vessel and are taken along for a voyage across the globe. The sights that they encounter are incredible. Creatures never imagined, lost treasure, undersea eruptions, and long-sunken vessels. The adventures are high ones, as they take the dangerous trip beneath the polar ice cap and even visit the lost city of Atlantis.I guess you could call it high adventure, but surprisingly, it's not all that exciting. The journey 20,000 Leagues Under the sea is a slow, plodding one. Sandwiched in between a fairly compelling beginning and ending is a wordy, overly explanatory middle filled with obscene amounts of nautical and technical jargon, yet devoid of much stimulating drama.I have no doubt that in the 1800s Jules Verne's descriptive prose awed readers to the wonders of the sea and underwater travel. In this day and age, however, the bar has been raised considerably and the story itself is very underwhelming for the modern read. The average person has been able to witness for themselves much of the stuff that Verne describes in such painstaking detail, either through television or trips to aquariums and the like. Much of the book simply isn't as extraordinary as it was 100 years ago. While the sea still holds great mystery, it's not near as foreign to us as it was back then.If you're not aroused by the technical workings of a submarine, or of the many food dishes that you can make out of sea life, there's not much else there for the average reader. The plot is more centered around situations conceived to further describe Captain Nemo's crazy contraption, The Nautilus, than it is to actually weave an interesting story. After the first few chapters, I was bored, save for a few bits here and there, until the last few chapters when it began to pick back up again.I trudged on, however, anxious to finish so I can get to the next book, hoping that it will be less yawn-inducing. If you're like me and wanting to tackle those classics, save 20,000 Leagues for the end. Pick up Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World or War of the Worlds instead. Both are far superior. Heck, I'd even rather read Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde, at least it was shorter. But like I said earlier, I'm no expert in the classics, maybe I just missed the boat, err...submarine, on this one."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"The book begins when 3 men are suddenly thrown overboard by the ship they are traveling in and find themselves in a large metal submarine that no one in the world knows about. The men who run this ship seem to talk a foreign language that no one can quite dechipher. The only man they communicate on board is the Captain. On the submarine they have fantastic adventures and travel to places where they are the first people to set foot. They try to escape many times but always fail.

Side panel text gives background information about the author, pictures and story. These &quot;additions&quot; (which do not detract from, but only enhance the story) help the young reader (and the adult too!) put the story into context. It is like getting both a classic and a pictorial history book rolled into one! The text is easy to read. My daughter is now 9, and reading the books on her own.

I think you should read this book before you leave High School. On a scale of one to five, one being the worst and five being the best. I would give it a five. I really enjoyed this book. The characters were very realistic and had life and emotion so you could relate to the characters their fear their joy and their sadness. They are three-dimensional characters. Not some flat two-dimensional characters who not feel and just act. It's easy to see why it's a classic. The book has a lot of action and adventure and even some mystery and lots of suspense. If you love any of these things, you should read this book. I found the way Conseil talks strange. Talking always in the third person I mean. Who actually goes around calling themselves by their first name? Looking up all the different animal and plant names that appear in this story must have taken forever as well as knowing where all these places were. He amazing he can fit all this information into one book an make it interesting. From reading this book, it refreshed my memory of the places in the world. The time from they were captured until they escaped only lasted six months. It seems to see all that they did see would have taken over a year. They did travel 60,000 miles. 1 leauge = 3 miles.

Can't go wrong."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"This is Verne's classic novel about Captain Nemo and his submarine Nautilus. What really fascinated me when reading this story and other Verne novels was not only Verne's contributions to the science fiction genre, but his founding of a whole new genre, one that, as far as I know, he has never been given credit. I think Verne was the first to write the techno-novel, a work that is filled with technical details ala Tom Clancy. For this novel, Verne did considerable research to describe what was known as accurately as possible. Professor Arronax and his servant Conseil board a U. S. ship that is searching for a monster that has sunk a number of other ships. They discover that it isn't a monster at all but a submarine, captained by a mysterious man known only as Nemo (Verne will present readers with Nemo once again in &quot;The Mysterious Island&quot;). Arronax, Conseil, and an American harpooner named Ned Land travel with Nemo and see many wonderous things and have many adventures. Verne's &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea&quot; has gotten some very poor reviews over the decades since it first appeared in 1869. In many cases, it was because of the translation and not because of Verne. A number of the early translators inserted their own sections with their own ideas and opinions and deleted much of Verne's own words. So, readers should be aware of the translator. I read an excellent translation by Walter James Miller that was also annotated. Such an annotated volume can prove to be very helpful to teenagers getting acquainted with Nemo and his submarine."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"My first Kindle e-book (see also free book) and I loved it.

The hardcover is strong and the silk bookmark is useful. The only thing that bothers me (and is somewhat minor) are the footnotes. The translator added footnotes throughout the book to explain some words, names, and cultural references from long ago. Some were useful, but others were so painfully obvious and still part of modern cultural memory that I wonder why the translator even took the time to footnote them. Also, the translator mentions in one footnote that he chose to omit a passage where Jules Verne explains in great detail the books which are in Nemo's library. In English classes I was always taught that one of the most interesting aspects of a book is what the author had the character(s) reading. It may have been a long and painful passage, but I would have rather had the choice as a reader to skim over an unending list of French titles from the 1800's rather than have the translator make that decision for me.Additionally, there are questions included for discussion at the end of the book. Without getting off on too much of a tangent, the questions remind me of all that is wrong with shallow and inane stock questions in books. I'm tempted to cut the last few pages out of my copy.Despite my views on the footnotes and questions, I love this book and thoroughly enjoyed reading it. I highly recommend it.---Alex"},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"20,000 League Under the Sea begins with the world's seas being menaced by an unknown force. After several shipwrecks, the Abraham Lincoln is dispatched to kill what the world believes to be some kind of animal. After a battle with the \\"creature\\", the three main characters, Professor Aronnax, his servant/research assistant Conseil, and Canadian \\"King of the Harpooners\\" Ned Land are swept overboard. When they awake, they find that they are prisoners aboard the Nautilus, a submersible vessel under the command of the mysterious Captain Nemo and his equally enigmatic crew.Captain Nemo refuses to allow the three men to leave his ship, but otherwise treats them well. They are allowed the run of the ship and Professor Aronnax soon becomes quite taken with the research opportunities afforded to him by the submarine. His assistant Conseil is happy to do whatever his master wishes, but Ned Land becomes increasingly agitated and determined to escape as the story progresses. Dominating the tale is the figure of Captain Nemo, a man who has forsworn his allegiances to country and humanity to command his own destiny under the world's seas and oceans.The Nautilus takes the men on many strange and exciting adventures. Verne peppers the story with scientific detail. It's mostly fascinating, although the multiple listings of fish, fauna, and flora can become cumbersome at times. The novel is at its best when Aronnax is wrestling with the mystery of Captain Nemo and his motives, as well as his own conflicting desires to remain on the Nautilus and explore the reaches of the deep or to join Ned Land's quest for freedom.Stirring in places, the story of Captain Nemo and his amazing undersea vessel shouldn't be missed by any fan of science fiction/fantasy. After all, Verne helped create the genre. The version of the novel I purchased was the Signet Classic series translated by Mendor T. Brunetti, who also provides a foreword. Walter James Miller provides a fascinating afterward concerning the inaccuracies of previous translations."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"This book is a classic. No question. That's why I chose to read it. When it came out in the 1860s, it was science fiction and gripped the imaginations of many. A ship that could travel under the water! But reading it in 2010, much of the novelty of the book has been realized. We have had submarines for nearly a century.But even aside from that, there is little plot to the novel. It reads as if it were written by a committee at National Geographic. It's a survey of all the unique items and places in the world's oceans. The little plot there is involves the protagonist trying to escape from the ship. And the ending (not to ruin it...) is a total cop-out and disappointing.I was hoping this book would stand the test of time, like The Time Machine or even Around the World in 80 Days. But I found it a rather boring and drudging read."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"This is one of my all time favorite by the sea books.

The major flaws in this translation led to a slew of critiques by the scientific and literary communities (that did not refer to the original French).Fortunately now there is a new version:Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea/Completely Restored and Annotated. This translation is true to the original text that shows Verne's actual correct calculations as well as including the 25% of the text lost to English readers for over a century.

The story starts when a strange type of sea life surfaces and a crew is sent out to find what this creature is. When the creature is found, the crew immediately attacks it. The strange creature succeeds in destroying the ship. Two passengers, Ned Land and Pierre Aronnax, survive and board the strange creature, which ends up being a submarine, named The Nautilus. Ned and Pierre meet the captain, Captain Nemo, and they discover a whole new life under the sea, with the help of Captain Nemo. Captain Nemo hates war, and throughout the book. He uses his submarine to destroy all kinds of war-connected ships. The nature and stuff that Captain Nemo, Pierre Arronax, Ned Land and Conseil see under the sea seem so real. This is one of the best books I've ever read. I think this is a very fascinating and marvelous classic and truly amazing to any reader who enjoys suspense and excitement."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"This is Jules Verne's most famous novel, and it still holds up pretty well.

But I will say that Captain Nemo is a very intiguing character, and people interested in Victorian Era fiction should definitely get this book."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea is a masterpiece that should not be missed by anyone. In this book, the reader is taken on an unbelievable journey aboard the Nautilus, an ingeniously built submarine, venturing the mysterious waters of the world. Jules Verne chooses to describe marine life in incredible detail (or maybe even overboard in detail) in this fictional novel. One may wonder how much research Verne did on the ocean in order to write this story. I believe readers who find life under the sea interesting will best enjoy this book, but the rest may still be fascinated. Not only is this novel a great learning experience of the sea, it is also packed with surprises, which includes a visit to the legendary, sunken Atlantis. Verne even decides to include a bit of mystery in the story. During the sea-voyage, the submarine undergoes a mysterious collision that the captain refuses to tell. I found myself dreading to speed through the pages to complete the book, hoping the author would reveal the solution to this mystery towards the end. Even though I was greatly fascinated by this novel, I still admit that I was disappointed in some ways after completing it. After finishing the book, I had discovered that the title of this book might have been a little misleading. Instead of descending a total of twenty thousand leagues under the sea, the Nautilus actually travels a total of twenty thousand leagues submerged in the sea. One may even find the ending of the story a little too spontaneous and shortly written. As a conclusion, I must say that, even though I did encounter some disappointments, I enjoyed reading the book and I do not regret reading it."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"First of all, I was disappointed when I realized that we're going 20,000 HORIZONTAL leagues while under the sea (not to a depth of 20,000 leagues). But my main disappointment with this book is the lack of development or progression. It's just a travelogue. You could scramble the order of most of the chapters, and it would still read the same. And how dare Verne take us to Atlantis and spend less than two pages there? None of the characters is any different by the end of the book, and we never really find out what it is that makes Captain Nemo the way he is.That said, the nineteenth century science fiction is wonderful.

While the story is, actually, quite good, the language is somewhat stilted and the book takes a while to really get going. I think many young readers will be puzzled by the vocabulary and will be bored. Eventually, the story picks up. However, I was bored in the 1950's and cannot imagine that today's youngsters will do much better. I think that the Walt Disney movie is a much better bet if you want to expose your child to a story that was a true classic. This is one of the few cases where a movie has an advantage over the written word."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"The story basically begins with the very intelligent Professor Arronax calculating basic mesuremenets. He's a modern french biologist during this time period. The professor had somewhat of an understudy, an apprentice if you will, named Conseil. Conseil was just about as skilled as the professor as far as classification, and knowing so much information about just about everything. One day, the professor got a letter that invited him to go on a select trip to hunt the killer narwhal. Mysteriously, several ships had been rammed, and had a triangular shaped scar on the spot where the uncanny shipmates had decided that the narwhal hit. So Professor Arronax and Conseil went to examine the accidents.They get on the ship and meet a Canadian harpooner named Ned Land. He told them that he was the best at what he does, and that he was ready to take out the narwhal. After a while, they come across the infamous narwhal. They find it strange that the narwhal is about three times as long as the ship they're on, and that it glows. The professor's ship is attacked, and they are stranded in the ocean, they climb aboard the narwahal to find out that it is in actuality a submarine. They finally meet a strange man named Captain Nemo, who explains to them that it is his ship and that the professor, Conseil, and Ned Land can stay as long as they go with him on a trip around the world in his submarine, the Nautilus.

Somewhere near the middle its narrator captures the essence of the book with the following unintentionally prescient sentence: \\"To anyone but myself, who had a great love of the sea, the hours below must have seemed long and monotonous.\\" That's an excellent summation of Verne's story of the almost magical electric submarine The Nautilus, it's imperious and mysterious Captain Nemo, and the three outsiders who circumnavigate the globe in it. Basically, unless you have some kind of strong interest in marine biology, it is an incredibly tedious read. Granted, it is an impressive feat of imagination for its time (the 1860s), but the amazing technologies described don't pack any kind of punch for the modern reader, and the exotic locales are now the stuff of the Travel Channel.The story is very simple. There is some kind of large creature menacing sea traffic around the world, so an international expedition is launched to try and find it and capture or kill it. Among those joining this voyage are the famous French naturalist Professor Aronnax, his heroic servant Conseil, and legendary French-Canadian harpoonist Ned Land. When the American frigate leading the expedition finally encounters the beast, combat ensues and they are thrown into the water, only to wind up the prisoners of the Nautilus. Captain Nemo decides that having seen his vessel's interior, they must remain prisoners for life. Thus, they embark on a grand tour of ocean with this man who has forsaken mankind and its evil ways.Alas this tour turns out to be a barrage of naturalist classifications of everything they see, complete with Latin names and various characteristics. This is fairly evocative the first time, but by the third has gotten repetitive, and by the tenth just downright sleep-inducing. Not to mention a litany of latitudes and longitudes to mark their path, as if one were reading in one hand and following along with an atlas in the other. Which is not to say that stuff doesn't happen, it does--it's just not very interesting. They visit underwater forests, the South Pole, Atlantis, coral reefs, famous shipwrecks, encounter danger from a tricky passage, icebergs, giant octopi, and fierce island people, and yet none of it is particularly dramatic or well done.Matters aren't helped by stilted scenes where Professor Aronnax asks Nemo how some aspect of the submarine works and receives a lengthy lecture outlining the scientific basis and processes for how such and such works. There are far too many instances where Aronnax is simply playing the straight man to Nemo's genius: \\"Gosh, we're really in a jam now Captain Nemo, what are we going to do!\\" \\"My dear professor, yet again you underestimate the capabilities of the Nautilus, all I have to do is....\\" etc. In that sense, Verne's imagination is deployed in a relatively wooden manner which does little to make it compelling for the modern reader.Finally, the central conflict of the three captives versus their captor is lame. They're stuck, they can't do anything to escape, and that never changes until the merciful end, where they are whisked away yet again. Again, no tension or drama. The one really intriguing character is Captain Nemo, who rails misanthropically about mankind and refuses to divulge his nationality, and speaks to his crew in an unrecognizable language. Throughout, one keeps waiting for a revelation as who he is and why he hates the world of men, but other than brief allusion to his having had a wife and child who were killed, there's no payoff! This final straw is an infuriating end to a stultifying book. Sometimes the \\"classics\\" ain't what they used to be."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"So, nearly 150 years have passed since this book has been published... and much of it has become just boring.

However, the encounter brings more than he ever expected, as he is captured by the strange and withdrawn captain of a submarine ship and whirled around the world's oceans. The aquatic wonders he experiences thrill his academic soul, while the actions and motivations of his host leave him questioning both the individual and civilizations at large.Verne's underwater adventure is the latest novel I have read to my toddler at bedtime, and is far from my favorite. As we finished the third Verne novel we have approached I found myself lamenting a brilliant story bogged down by careless prose; I found that the language was flat and uninspired, and the sentence structure was unbelievably choppy. The failings of the writing itself took away from what would otherwise have been a book full of wonders, and I believe we will leave Verne buried once and for all."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"This version is Verne's original and it is the best.

And underwater boat was unheard of. By todays standards the book is not very exciting, but for its time it is very adventerous. The endless cataloging of the undersea life and the operation of the submarine all come out of the autor's head. There is one thing to note that I first read this book in grammer school and just re-read it.

Highly recomend."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"Confusing Title: My husband and I were talking the other night about the Jules Verne novel 20,000 Under the Sea and we both admited to having been confused by the title at one time. 20,000 leagues (60,000 miles or 111,120 kilometers) is 8.5 thousand times deeper than the deepest point on the ocean. 20,000 leagues is the distance the two men traveled on the Nautilus.Obsession Worse than Nemo: I remember in 6th grade a group of boys did a huge series of blue prints for the Nautilus based on the book. I thought it was a waste of time back then and still do but apparently lots of folks don't. The blue prints of the Nautilus feature in Clive Cussler's book Valhalla Rising. And there's an entire website devoted to blue prints and 3D models.Closing thoughts: I much prefer the sequel to 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. If you get a chance, read The Mysterious Island."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"Jules Vernes captures our imaginations in his tale of adventure and science. The narrator, Dr. Arronax, is a French naturalist who goes on an expedition to hunt down a mysterious sea creature spotted by many sailors. However, in an interesting turn of events, he finds out that the enigma that roamed the oceans is in fact a futuristic submarine (the Nautilus) built by Captain Nemo. Dr. Annonax, along with his Flemish companion Conseil and Canadian harpooner Ned Land, are held hostage on the Nautilus and through their time aboard they experience the great wonders of the seas. Giant squids, ice caps, pearl hunts, close calls with Papuan natives, are only a fraction of the exciting events they experience.Using Arronax as the narrator, Verne gives us a look into the mysteries of the deep seas. While Arronax often gets carried away labeling and categorizing sea life, it makes the narrative seem more authentic. I felt a little cheated about not learning the life story of the brilliant and enigmatic Captain Nemo. We learn that he is driven by revenge, yet we don't know exactly why and who is his unfortunate target. However, this lack of revelation allows the reader to create his/her own theories, which can be quite fun.This book may not be for action junkies, as shown by previous reviews. However, I recommend this book to readers who are curious about the unknown with an interest in science. It is an interesting and very creative read, and should not be missed!"},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"Jules Verne is one of the most captivating and poetic writers ever in existence.

Although for some the writing style may be too round-a-bout, I find it completely matches the story-line.

Arronax departs with his friend and servant Conseil on a journey to kill a \\"narwhal\\" that has been sinking ships across the globe. They travel on a boat called the Abraham Lincoln, which is sailed by Captain Farragut. There they meet Ned Land, a master harpooner. The Abraham Lincoln is hit, and Ned, M. Arronax and Conseil are launched into the sea. Ned surprisingly lands on the supposed narwhal, hence discovering is made of iron and therefore is a submarine vessel. The three men are taken aboard, only to find that they are prisoners there. Yet M. Arronax and Conseil find it pleasant to see a submarine world. But even they yearn for freedom. Swim with them in this watery book!Opinions:1. This amazing book tells a tale of adventure with a subsurface of mystery. There are ocean bottoms hit and secrets kept, poles reached and mysteries left unsolved. What really kept me going while reading this book was the sheer anticipation of what was yet to come. It is wonderful material for people like me to get their hands on. I like to learn a little bit about the world while still reading a book that is fictionous and fun to read. For example, it talked about the main characters going inside an extinct volcano while describing the chamber of the volcano in explicit detail.2. The book tells the reader a bit about what life was like 1866 while still being an adventure-themed and fun to read book. It described many daring actions and risks, while still giving facts on geography I never even knew about. It told me about how a boat was run back then and also spoke about some species of fish through Conseil's classification.3. Jules Verne never explained why the title mentioned 20,000 leagues. The Nautilus never went farther than 4000 leagues down under the waves.4. I believe that this book is meant for people ages 10+ because some of the things in there might not be comprehensible to a person aged 9 or lower.RecommendationI would recommend this book to people wanting to be oceanographers because it talks about some things you may not have known about the sea. Unearth more details in this 1866 novel!"},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"I have been a Jules Verne fan since I was a kid. There is something to be said about his incredible imagination and his grasp of scientific principles that were well ahead of his time. 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea is the voyage of Prof. Arronax, along with his companions Ned and Conseil, who have found themselves on board the Nautilus, an incredible submarine designed by the mysterious Captain Nemo. The Nautilus crew lives esclusively in the oceans and seas, surfacing only to replenish oxygen. Throughout the journey, they experience breath-taking sights, heart-pounding adventures, and perilous obstacles. Jules Verne does a beautiful job constructing this submarine world, even inventing new sea creatures to fit into his story. Scarcely a chapter goes by without some new or legendary creature sneaking in to liven up the seascape. However, I think where this story falls short is in its flow. I understand that the story is written from Prof. Arronax's point of view, which is that of a scientist, but each chapter contains several paragraphs of virtually useless information, be it readings from the nautical instruments or long lists of aquatic animals (including their class, genus, and species). This detracts from the overall flow of the story and I believe could have been left out. However, at four stars, this book is still very much worth reading!"},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"Sheer adventure narrative for the aquatic zoology and oceanography nerd.

It makes me want to pick up and keep reading the book, very preferable to just printing the downloadable version online."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"Having seen the movie a couple times this was the first time I read the book and was surprised to see a significant number of unexpected differences. Jules Verne's Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea is arguably the first technical thriller, launching a genre which has since grown wildly in popularity and includes most of Michael Chricton's work. It is a very imaginative book, the story of the mysterious Captain Nemo -haunted by an implied but never explained past - who has built for himself and his crew the submarine Nautilus to be free of the laws of man and to live successfully and sustainably on the bounty of the world's oceans, which he intrepidly explores in all its wonders. Inevitably he is chased by the main characters, Ned the Harpooner, Mr. Arronax the professor and Conseil his man-servant, in the frigate USS Abraham Lincoln. Unlike the movie the story is told entirely by Mr. Arronax and Ned is more a minor character, and a stolid Canadian as opposed to the boisterous and fun loving American in the movie. Also unlike the movie the Nautilus does not sink the Lincoln, but in a duel vents it with steam that throws our three main characters overboard whom are then rescued after the Lincoln, ignorant to the fact they are no longer onboard, retreats from the scene.Thus begins a promising story of mystery and adventure, the possible drama of Captain Nemo being chased by worldly forces in his incredible Nautilus, the tension between the captives who are experiencing the amazing wonders of the ocean depths firsthand and their captor who cannot ever let them go without losing his own freedom, and the chance for exciting adventures. While all of these things are delivered in the book, they are done so very anachronistically (obviously), with the drama, tension and adventure being there - and being very creatively crafted - but also being very subdued and literally drowned in an ocean of Mr. Arronax describing the latin names of the sea life he sees outside the Nautilus's window. This captures the fascination of the age with Natural History versus today's focus on excitement and adventure in these types of novels. There are many times were the book gets very, very dry as the author rattles of names that you have no idea what they refer to, and even if you google them the only hits you will get are the passages in the book itself! Based on this, the fact that this translation cuts out some 20% of the book is probably not a bad thing.Nonetheless there are some great moments of natural beauty and adventure. Jules Verne showed some incredible predictive power in describing the structural design, diving operations and maneuverability, and life support systems of a submarine, being basically spot on before anything beyond the Turtle of Revolutionary War heritage had ever been put to sea. The myriad undersea \\"terrains\\" the characters experience are particularly cool and fun. Relative to the movie the giant squid attack is underwhelming, but a much better scene that never made it to the film is one where after discovering the south pole (something Verne got wrong obviously) the Nautilus is caught in between two icebergs and must dig itself out before its air supply runs out. But there are some drawbacks too. There are some shockingly dark moments for a book aimed towards younger men from the 1860's which seem to imply they are leading somewhere and could have been great plot tension builders, but they are never fully fleshed out, and neither is the character they are supposed to be windows into, the reclusive, tortured yet brilliant Captain Nemo. The book ends quickly and inconclusively, feeling like a great set up for a story that ends as more travel log than character story or adventure yarn. Nonetheless the book is short and relatively easy to read despite it's older grammatical style which can sound very strange today.The job the publisher did however is spotty. The cover design of the book is very well done, but the editing is poor with many glaring typos throughout the text.All in all the movie is much better as a movie than a direct adaptation of the book would have been, with Ned Land turned into a main character that an American audience can connect with (unlike the highly intellectual and uninspiring Mr. Arronax as main character of the book or the turgid Canadian version of Ned Land), Captain Nemo is more explained as a character and pitted more against Mr. Arronax as two opposing sides of a moral coin, and the movie has a more solid story and conclusion. But the book has it's own advantages and overall is worth reading, especially for its historical significance."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"This one of the best Jules Verne books. It is a must read for everyone. Even my teenage daughter enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"I thought that the book had one of the best plot lines I've ever seen, reguardless of the fact that there is only slight building up to the climax. The only thing that I didn't think was that good about the book was that about every other page, Jules Verne would go into a paragraph description of the animals. For example, he would say something like: I just saw a tuna. But not the normal tuna, it was yellow-bellied, had dorsal fins that went at a downward angle, etc.\\" Otherwise, I thought it was a great read and well worth the money. I will be purchasing more of Jules Verne's books very soon. I highly suggest for you to read this book. Another thing, if you enjoyed watching the 1954 \\"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea Film,\\" I highly suggest the book because the movie only gives a small picture of what actually occurred during their submarine venture and the book tells you everything, and the occurrences are just amazing.The novel basically tells the story of Professor Arronax, Ned Land and Conseil who get taken aboard the Nautilus and experiences many adverntures, such as going to Atlantis, an underwater hunt, getting trapped in an ice block and much more."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"Verne is the original, there's no question about that. Frankly, Verne is science fiction for people who don't like science fiction.

Also, he imagines something very much like real-life diving equipment for the scenes on the sea floor and dealing with the squid."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS STORY TO ANYONE BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A GREAT UNDERSEA ADVENTURE BOOK.

This is probaly my favorite begining in any book I have ever read. Then Nemo gives Aronnax a tour of his submarine. It is the size of Moby Dick and is run by electric motors. Later in the book Nemo take Aronnax, Conseil, and Ned Land walking on the bottom of the sea. If you look at the origanal pictures in the book thier diving gear looks like modern scuba gear.

Even though this book was filled with information about electricity, how it gets it from the sea, how much the \\"Nautilus\\" weighs in tonnes, how the \\"Nautilus\\" can reach the speed of 50 miles per hour etc. it still was a marvellous book. Jules Verne puts stacks of information into this book. But here's the amazing bit of this information. This book was first published in 1871. 1871?Why 1871?Nothing like electricity was invented in 1871. Or other stuff. Jules Verne imagined science when hardly any of it was invented. None of it. None of it at all. That's why, 20,000 leagues under the sea and other of his novels were amazing.Also, the characters in this novel are likeable. The nature and the stuff Captain Nemo, Pierre Arronax, Ned Land and Conseil see under the sea seem so real while reading this classic. The peculiar but wonderful character of Captain Nemo makes this book wonderful to read.This book appeals to children and adults.In 1866, a strange thing at sea captures everybody by surprise. It is some sort of peculiar monster or floating reef. The \\"Helvetia\\", \\"Columbus\\", \\"Scotia\\" and \\"Shannon\\" all spot this creature. People wonder what exactly is it. Pierre Arronax, Proffesor of the Museum of Paris is called by Captain Farragut of the \\"Abraham Lincoln\\" to capture this gigantic cetacean with all these harpooners, especially one called Ned Land. Ned Land is strong and full of uncommon skill. He is also a Canadian. When Pierre Arronax falls off ship, after Land aims his harpoon at the creature, jets of water spray on the bridge of the ship which throws many people off into the dangerous waters. The propeller and rudder are broken. Two other people who join Pierre are Conseil and Land. The creature was actually a submarine called the \\"Nautilus\\". It takes the three into it where they meet the mysterious Captain Nemo...Further on they meet savages, giant octopuses and indulge with the wonderful sea life which makes this wonderful tale enjoyable. But all with Captain Nemo. The four take on a ride of their life. Thanks to Jules Verne people have been excited since. Buy this and treasure forever. I have an old 1954 edition.This probablyis his best book of all.

I've wanted to read this since I was a kid, and I am sorry I waited until I retired. Some of the biological naming discussions get somewhat tedious, but as a whole the story is great! However, don't think it is quite like the Walt Disney movie version, because it is not. It starts out that way, but proceeds through the story in a somewhat different way, and ends differently.

The story is generally gripping and the character of Captain Nemo is an interesting and nuanced one - neither truly villainous nor heroic - but Verne gets bogged down in some of the details. Yes, I know the main character and narrator is an ichthyologist, but do I really need all of the \\"World of Fish\\" moments where he describes - in excruciating detail - ALL of the fish and other marine life that the crew of the Nautilus encounter whilst journeying around the underwater world on their anti-colonial crusade? I signed up for an adventure novel, not a Jacques Cousteau special. Oh well, when it works it works well and Verne will have you interested to the very end. The translation from the French in this edition reads well and the paperback quality is good enough. Recommended, but prepare to skip large portions of \\"World of Fish.\\""},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"I was so excited that I found this book for free!

I also liked it that the translator(s) corrected errors they perceived in the book itself, and they gave reasons for such corrections. This showed that even at the publishing stage, mistakes can creep in. It is a pity that the 1878 (79?) translation by an English writer mangled the novel, but then he was English translating a French writer.......Good for students at school who may be studying the book for English literature."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"Still great after all these years. It was truly ahead of it's time. I recommend it for all to read, young or old."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"Jules Verne was a wonderful writer, I thought that this book would not interest me but I was so wrong!"},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"Jules Verne is one of, if not the most famous science fiction writer in history with a slew of well known books. I love science fiction and classic novels so Verne should be perfect for me, right? Well... I can't say that Verne wasn't influential and his ideas are spectacular which is why so many movies have been based on his books but I have yet to read a Verne book that exceeded or even met my expectations.First, all his characters, despite different names and motivations, are all the same; perfect English gentlemen. This is not uncommon for writers from this era but when a Canadian harpooner like Ned Land uses phrases like \`By Jove' it rings false. Rudyard Kipling wrote Captains Courageous 27 years later and created sailors that felt absolutely authentic. Verne's characters seem to be created for a specific purpose. Captain Nemo is there to explain in detail the working of his Nautilus and other inventions while Professor Aronnax's role is to gush over Nemo's discoveries. I don't believe that any of the other members of Nemo's crew ever say a single word in the book and are simply window dressing.The second big problem is that Verne's science is often dubious. I'm not talking about science that was still questionable in Verne's time but established science and physical facts going way back. Verne seems completely unaware of things like encumbrance or the effects of high elevation. In this book Verne's consistently and often dramatically increases the size of sea life. Also, it can be somewhat dull reading constant facts and figures about the speed, depth, volume of air etc of the Nautilus. The book just goes on and on with Nemo relaying fact after fact while M. Aronnax listens in rapt attention. It also spends a near eternity describing all of the flora and fauna and without an actual plot to pin it to it gets very dull. The layout of the Nautilus is very unrealistic with no apparent attempt to maximize the usage of space. Nemo has a full size organ in his spacious cabin. Actual submarines are very constrained spaces.In order to create a compelling story Disney greatly expanded on Nemo's quest for revenge which is barely mentioned in the book. Disney also greatly expanded Ned Land's role to the improvement of the story and did a very nice bit of casting having him played by Kirk Douglas. The famous scene where the Nautilus is attacked by a giant squid (multiple squids in the book) only occupies a couple of pages. Mostly the book is just the Nautilus cruising all over the world occasionally getting stuck. That's about it. It's as if Verne couldn't come up with a plot to wrap around his idea of a mysterious captain and his incredible machine.I have read quite a few of Verne's novels but this one may have the most anemic plot of them all. 20,000 is leagues is much more serious than \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\" and \`In Search of the Castaways' (which I really didn't enjoy) but it's not particularly compelling. This is a rare occasion where I think the famous movie version was an improvement over the book."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"I have seen the movie (needs to be remade wih today special effects come on Disney) and really enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"The other reviewers have noted how the editors...both experts on Verne and the Victorian era science that guided him.. have gone back to the original French manuscripts, collated them to use the best, most reliable, paragraphs and phrases from each, and annotated the book to reflect on Verne's social, political and technical background as if affects the story.If all this sounds like the book is some kind of dull scholarly treatise, rest assured that the novel as STORY is not harmed, but actually improved by the editors' restorations and fix-ups.My own path to Nemo and the Nautilus was watching the Disney film version when I was 11, then getting the Classic Comics version, and finally going to the available butchered translation. Even that version captivated me, and sent me to the dictionary to decipher some of the hifalutin 19th century phrases.Now, as then, I gloss over the endless catalogues of marine biology classification --- Verne as well as Victorian science fans were captivated by the then new interest in categorizing flora and fauna into genus, species, sub-species, varieties, etc. This stuff can be skipped without losing the story.What interests me is the adventure under the sea, and the way in which these fellows are able to watch the wonders of the deep through the window of a plush 1860s salon. I am also interested in how Verne envisioned the workings of the sub. Interestingly, in 1904, just before his death, he wrote an article for Popular Mechanics in which he updated his thoughts on the future of the submarine, based on the Simon Lake and John Holland boats of that day. He had to explain to readers that he was NOT the inventor of the submarine, as popularly believed.All in all, the editors have done a wonderful service in bringing the real \\"20, 000 Leagues\\" to light. I hope it will attract the interest of many bright and curious young boys and girls of the 21st century when the Sea Wolf and Virginia class subs of the USN have finally equalled the performance of the Nautilus of 1870."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"This is one of the most famous novels by Verne, and justifiedly so. A strange thing is happening in the seas of the world: a gigantic sea monster is terrorizing and sometimes sinking ships. The US government assembles a team of experts and sails around the world to discover the monster and catch it. Among them are two French scientists, Prof. Arronax and his assistant Conseil, and a Canadian harpooner, Ned Land. One day they fall to the sea while chasing the thing, and then are astonished when the monster rescues them. Alas, it turns out it's not a monster, but a machine that can travel under the surface of the waters. That is, a submarine, nonexistent at the time the book was written. So the three men become the prisoners of the enigmatic Captain Nemo and his crew. The \\"Nautilus\\" is a self-supporting device, lavishly decorated and the work of a genius, a strange one. The central question throughout the book remains: Why have Nemo and his people rejected all contact with their fellow human beings? What happened to him and to them to escape the world and become lonely travellers of the underseas? Mystery. During many months, our heroes travel around the globe, and in the way they discover Atlantida, hunt in submerged forests, rescue a pearl-gatherer, rest in a submerged volcano, and fight aborigines and giant squids. Prof. Arronax classifies and describes every creature they encounter, which slows down the reading between adventures.I took one star out of the book because it lacks a central feature of any great work of literary art: character development. To reach the highest literary glory, Verne lacks psychological depth, the exploration of human beings' motivations. I would have loved to know Nemo's story, his reasons for doing what he does. But it doesn't matter much. To read Verne is to come back home, to turn back the time and be a kid again, flying to that moment when one discovers the infinite possibilities of literature, chief among them the chance to live other lives and see the world anew. Verne and his characters have a unique charm, and in this book the fascination od the ocean is added."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"For some reason, a few of Verne's many works have become famous in the English speaking world and have even gained some kind of \\"classic\\" status. Unfortunately, these are in my opinion his more superficial and uninteresting novels. 20000 Leagues Under the Sea is a perfect example.Most people would have heard of the idea through some part of culture - the story of Captain Nemo in his submarine (Verne's alleged prophetic vision) and how one outsider is forced through circumstance to join Nemo and his crew on a host of adventures across the seas. This is fine, and that's what the book is. BUT, unlike many better Verne novels, this is ALL it is. It's an adventure story mixed with a description of the various wonders of the udnerwater world (including Atlantis). Don't get me wrong, Verne is good at describing all these things and it's interesting and certainly makes you think about worlds other than your own.What I love about Verne's works such as the Mysterious Island and the 500 Millions of the Beguma is that this is used as a vehicle for some deeper or more interesting messages. Here, the main \\"deeper\\" message is the study of Nemo as a recluse from society - a kind of conscienscious objector (or even hater of humanity if you will), surrounded by his cold machine-like submarine and the predator-like amoral underwater world. In the hands of most writers, this would be sci-fi schlock and it is only Verne that makes it into a good book - but this should not be the work he is renowned for.This book is actually the 2nd in a trilogy, the 1st being In Search of the Castaways and the 3rd being Mysterious Island and I reckon they get progressively better so read the third one!"},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"This book is about a man who finds an underwater secret boat.

The \\"narhwhale\\" which is really a submarine ran by Captin Nemo is going through boats and sinking them.The submarine went through a boat and three men got caught on top of the sub.Captin Nemo found them and made them stay aboard for a long time. Read about the remarkable journeys of the three men and how they lived off of the sea in 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.I liked how they left cliff hangers at the end of each chapter, it made you keep on reading and you couldn\`t stop because it was so good.

I give it 4 out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea ...Hmmm, where to begin my review? To be frank, I wavered for about 4 minutes on how to rate this book. Was it a 3 or 4? In the end, I chose the 4 star rating. This book had a wonderful story line, the characters, and the setting where also both wonderful. The things that really drug this book down where Verne's consistent descriptions of things that really, in actuality, could have been left out. He goes on and on classifying fish and giving very, very detailed descriptions of the submarine (The Nautilus), the way it worked, and the things on board. I guess I can understand this, I guess Verne was just trying to give a believable and complete description of the things the characters saw on their journeyIf you could, somehow, get an abridged version, I would reccomend it. This book is great and truth be told, it was worth my time reading it. I just think that unless you're a marine biologist or are just, for some reason, very interest in the classification of oceanic plant and animal life, that 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea would be best read, and probally more enjoyable with some of the 'unimportant to the story' detailed descriptions of the above-mentioned things ...in frank, LEFT OUT. Now, this is not to say that you shouldn't read this book, you should. I'm just forewarning the prospective reader that they will find some parts of the book to be 'boring' with VERY in depth classifications and descriptions. On the other hand, the story is one of great splendor and excitement. Try to remain focused on the story line and keep a clear mind that the descriptions are just Verne's way of trying to give the reader the most in-depth and detailed assessment of the voyage. Now, I know that what I have written so far is not a 'review'. I'm just trying to let people know what kind of a read they will be in for, if they so choose to read the book. Now, as for a real 'review' on what happens in this book? ...Nahhh, read it yourself. I will say this, 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea takes you to places,in your mind,betterthan any book I've ever read. You will become attatched to the characters every move and sit in anxiety, with great with anticipation, eager to find out what will happen next in this Sci-Fi classic. So, with all the above information on how the book will lag a bit at times ...I finish with this, Verne's descriptive writting leads many modern day readers into boredom and complaint. If you really open your eyes and embrace Verne's descriptive style, you will learn to enjoy this work, and have an admiration for this classic story and classic storyteller almost unequaled in all of literature. For what it is, 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea couldn't have been written better by anyone, ever. Keep your mind open and don't give up on it. I promise,you will learn to appreciate this classic ...I did"},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"this book is full of adventure and fun.kids below 10 dont miss it.i found the end quite disappointing.as we follow the prisoners in the nautilus i thought the climax would be full of action but the book finishes as such.there are many biological facts which may hinder the adventure for young readers.i also recommend around the world in 80 days for young readers which is more thrilling than this one."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"When was the last time you went to the sea and had an exciting adventure?

Outside of the three captives, no other characters were well-developed. I would have liked to have gotten to know Captain Nemo a lot better, and what happened in his past that led him to isolate himself from humanity. Since his character is never developed, Captain Nemo ends up being a one-dimensional character with an inexplicable aversion to civilization. The ending is a big cop-out, where no explanation is given in how the characters arrived where they end up. In addition, since the book was originally written in French, it was difficult to read at some points because the text is not well translated, and reads awkwardly. I expected a little more from a book that is regarded as a classic."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"This is by far Jules Verne's best book.

Aronnax, Consiel, and Ned Land partake in were vividly portrayed in the book. Also the Nautilus was really amazing, in two ways. First in how powerful the ship was, and second how Verne could have created the idea for such a vessel for the period of time he wrote the book.From the underwater forests of Crespo, to the Manaar Bank, then to Atlantis and the South Pole, the book made it feel as if I was traveling along with them. In addition to the locales, the Nautilus itself was amazing, with it's speed, strength and technology. On top of that, there was also, the walks on the bottom of the ocean which were described with amazing detail.Capitan Nemo was the most complex character I've read about in a long time. Throughout their time on the ship, Aronnax, Consiel, and Land never see much of Nemo, and when they do, he's not a man of many words. He is, however a man of great intelligence, skill, and wealth, who decided to sevre all ties with civilization, for reasons that appear unknown to us.Professor Aronnax began thinking some monsterous narwhal type beast is destroying ships in the ocean at the beginning of the story, so himself, Consiel, and Ned Land set out to discover what it really is, and find themselves amidst something completely different.This book was a treat to read with all it's adverture and exploring.

This new translation based on the original French texts is amazing, it moves quickly and I discovered things that I had never read in other English versions. You get more of Verne's politics here than in earlier translations including such memeorable phrases as: \\"The world needs no new continents, it needs new people.\\"The characters are well developed and you can indentify with all of them and how they view their effective captivity aboard the Nautilus. Captain Nemo is a wonderful character and Verne gives the reader just enough information about him to keep you enthralled but not enough to remove the mystery. The intro relates that Nemo was supposed to be a Polish aristocrat, getting back at the world for the the atrocities the Russians had commited against his family. But when Hetzel his publisher balked at the idea because of the new Franco Russian alliance Verne decided to remove any trace of nationality.What else can be said? The English is not archaic!!

And the book seems to be too plain, old, because it was written such a long time ago, and the author had no intention of making the lines exciting in a way we accept today, and which is also a result of too many unrelated stories been piled together without a common base, basically, the book has pretty much no plot. That's a reason you might consider not buying the book.But I liked the book a lot, I can not understand how can the author write one story after another that just get more and more surprising, and the way he brings out each story.

The dustcover of the Evertype edition shows - for some inextricable reason - a modern photograph of a stingray (where a squid, at least, might have had more relevance to the book).If I were just interested in reading the story I would probably buy the OUP edition which - like my copy of OUP's \\"Around the World in Eighty Days\\" (also translated by William Butcher) - could be expected to brown-up within a year or two as it's printed on cheap paper (the same as the Penguins of old). If I were buying it as a gift I would probably be tempted to select the Evertype hardcover translation by Frederick Paul Walters (even though I don't know what quality of paper it's printed on or whether the pages are sewn together in quires or just glued together like a cheap paperback)."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"This is actually my favorite book of all time next to Ivanhoe, To Kill a Mockingbird, The Man in the Iron Mask, and The War of the Worlds. I read this book in fourth grade and absolutely loved it. Now that I'm 3 years older, I appreciate it even more. Though there were some hard words, I loved the dialogue. There is even humor when Professor Aronnax explains how pearls are made and says, &quot;Yes, my boy, oysters can produce many sharks&quot; because he is scared to go shark hunting. Captain Nemo is a mysterious yet interesting character. My favorite parts are when they are at the sunken ship in the Mediterranean Sea, when they fight the giant squid, and when they are at Ceylon. Some of their other travels take them to the lost continent of Atlantis, a tunnel under the Suez Canal, and through the Great Ice Barrier. This is my favorite Jules Verne book, though it has some competition from Around the Moon and Journey to the Center of the Earth. This book is a must-have for science lovers. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves adventure and the ocean. Trust me, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"I thought that the book had one of the best plot lines I've ever seen, reguardless of the fact that there is only slight building up to the climax. The only thing that I didn't think was that good about the book was that about every other page, Jules Verne would go into a paragraph description of the animals. For example, he would say something like: I just saw a tuna. But not the normal tuna, it was yellow-bellied, had dorsal fins that went at a downward angle, etc.\\" Otherwise, I thought it was a great read and well worth the money. I will be purchasing more of Jules Verne's books very soon. I highly suggest for you to read this book. Another thing, if you enjoyed watching the 1954 \\"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea Film,\\" I highly suggest the book because the movie only gives a small picture of what actually occurred during their submarine venture and the book tells you everything, and the occurrences are just amazing."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"It's a great story, no question. However, this version is riddled with typographical errors, that I found very distracting. I'll think twice about getting another free book from this publisher."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea is a brilliantly crafted piece of art. Not only is it a riveting novel with a brilliant plot it is also an accurate prediction of the future. I have never read a book that is so flawlessly combines the disparate worlds of science and story telling. Verne's writing style grabbed me from the get go, yet he never sacrifices any detail. Verne pulls you into another reality and where you never know what is going to happen next. Even in its most technical moments Verne's masterpiece demands your attention. Most people know the gist of the story. Three men are held captive in an extraordinary submarine vessel, the Nautilus, led by the Captain Nemo, a man who has left the human world to live under the sea. If you read the book you will find that there is much more to this story than you originally believed. Verne is also very accurate in predicting how a submarine would work. His Nautilus uses many of the same devices as the real submarines of the future!Five Stars!"},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"In English speaking countries, 20,000 is considered a classic boy's book, but in France, it is considered a work of literature. The two translators of this version have gone back to the original French, and made a new translation. Turns out, the common translation that we are used to is full of mistranslations and ommissions of anti-English sentiments. Frankly, I didn't think the new translation adds that much more to the story, but I really enjoyed the footnotes and annotations. The translators take a boyish glee when they find and error or ommission that, to me, added a bit to the story. I'd recommend this version over the older translation. If you've read this story before, I think you will enjoy the annotations most."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"Jules Verne wrote this book in 1870. It has startling technological references (even in the concept of the submarine) but even more stunning was the Nuclear Reactor on board.I feel that some episodes of Star Trek (the original series) are models on Jules Verne, because behind the backdrop of the technology and adventure, there exists the social evils of slavery, colonialism and nihilism as well as genocide.The story is about Captain Nemo who is epic, driven and something good that is so strongly polar he is actually lead into a path of destruction - and his crew. The story is told through the eyes of Professor Aronnax. The usage of an observant intellectual to explain the dark pathos of a main character was rather popular in that era (think Watson and Holmes).In this instance it is important because Nemo destroys a vessel with all hands and then bows before a picture of his wife and children. The implication is that his family where kidnapped (or killed) as slaves.At anyrate, if you love steampunk culture, Star Trek social complexity, and classical literature you will love 20000 Leagues Under the Sea."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"For some reason, even after reading this book, my brain still translates \\"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\\" to mean 20000 leagues DOWN instead of a DISTANCE. What's wrong with me?Anyway, this book was a treasure. Jules Verne, the grandfather of science fiction, again shows that his is much more than a scientific mind. Verne is a grand storyteller, and this novel is his masterwork.Our heroes, Professor Arronax, his faithful compatriot Conseil, and the salty sailor Ned Land find themselves together in a hunt for a giant, mysterious undersea creature which has been causing havoc among shipping lines as well as towns along the coastline. Setting out to sea on top-of-the-line sailing vessel, the three men and the crew encounter the creature, only to have it sink their ship like so many others. However, as you probably know, this is no creature at all, but the most spectacular vehicle ever created by man. It is the Nautilus, a gigantic submarine, and the proud creation of the enigmatic Captain Nemo.Captain Nemo holds the three as his prisoner. They are instructed that they may never leave the Nautilus, yet will be treated with hospitality and respect by Nemo and his crew. The Captain keeps his word, and treats the Professor and his fellows to all the wonders of the ocean depths. Captain Nemo has made the sea his home, vowing never to return to the distasteful world on land. The Nautilus has everything you would need to live and prosper; infinite supplies of water through its seawater processing machines, and an abundance of exotic seafood dredged up from the deep.Captain Nemo himself is as mystifying and brilliant as his creations. He is one of the greatest villains ever put on paper, and Verne's skill as a storyteller brings him to life. Nemo's motivations are clouded in mystery. I can't stress enough how excellent this character is, and the sly way Verne allows for Nemo's true motivations to remain as unfathomable at the end of the novel as it was at the beginning.The Professor doesn't want to leave the Nautilus. He is enthralled by the sea life and the wonders of Nemo's brilliant submarine. Conseil goes where the Professor goes, and is pleased to assist him in their adventure. Ned feels like a prisoner. He longs to walk on firm ground again, and considers his imprisonment as a violation.The action is blended well alongside the exploration and discovery. This book reads and feels like a grand adventure in ways few books can equal. The language is crisp and clear and so is the humor, which is a unusual for a novel written well over 100 years ago. It flows perfectly in English as a result of a superb translation. If I were to single out one thing I disliked about it, it would be the detailed discussions of sea life in the undersea world. I still found Verne's descriptions of multitudes of ocean species fascinating, but some readers may not. What helps alleviate the (possible) boredom is to remember that readers back in the 1800 had NO TV and few had any way of experiencing the wonders of the sea as Verne describes them.\\"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\\" can be read by all ages. Most of Verne's books are recommended to younger readers, but there is no indication that they were WRITTEN for the young crowd. You certainly never feel like you're reading a children's book, not by a long shot. Anyone with a sense of wonder and appreciates the fantastic would enjoy the ride. I know I did."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"This is Verne's classic novel about Captain Nemo and his submarine Nautilus. What really fascinated me when reading this story and other Verne novels was not only Verne's contributions to the science fiction genre, but his founding of a whole new genre, one that, as far as I know, he has never been given credit. I think Verne was one of the first to write the techno-novel, a work that is filled with technical details ala Tom Clancy. For this novel, Verne did considerable research to describe what was known as accurately as possible. Professor Arronax and his servant Conseil board a U. S. ship that is searching for a monster that has sunk a number of other ships. They discover that it isn't a monster at all but a submarine, captained by a mysterious man known only as Nemo (Verne will present readers with Nemo once again in &quot;The Mysterious Island&quot;). Arronax, Conseil, and an American harpooner named Ned Land travel with Nemo and see many wonderous things and have many adventures. Verne's &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea&quot; has gotten some very poor reviews over the decades since it first appeared in 1869. In many cases, it was because of the translation and not because of Verne. A number of the early translators inserted their own sections with their own ideas and opinions and deleted much of Verne's own words. So, readers should be aware of the translator. I read an excellent translation by Walter James Miller that was also annotated. Such an annotated volume can prove to be very helpful to teenagers getting acquainted with Nemo and his submarine."},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"Sure the language has changed since it was written, and it was translated from French. But the ideas hold up great, the plot is cool, and the characters are entertaining. A great read, entertaining to see what J.V. predicted correctly and what was totally off. The introduction was pretty cr*ppy. It tried to make J.V. seem like a futurist without peer. One example - he predicted the escape velocity of a rocket. I believe an Italian dude figured that out in the 1600's.Want to read a good classic? This is it. Need to discover a tried and true sci-fi original?

But, of all his novels, the most wondrous, the most well known, the most popular and the best is 20,000 Leagues under the Sea.The book's plot is pretty well known to the literature world: Captain Nemo has built an underwater ship called the Nautilus. Three people land on the ship and are taken aboard: French Professor M. Aronnax, a famous French scientist, Conseil, his servant and Ned Land, a Canadian Harpooner. Some of the highlights of their incredible adventure include getting trapped under ice in the South Pole, battling giant squid, exploring lost shipwrecks as well as the lost city of Atlantis and encountering the undersea forests of Crespo.What is most amazing is that Verne's predicted how subs would work years later. Also, the U.S.S Nautilus went under the South Pole almost a century after Verne's Nautilus. The book is however not problem proof. It takes a while to develop. The Nautilus is originally mistaken for a sea monster. So a few are spent looking for this \\"Sea Monster\\". But this is forgivable. For can you name one great book that doesn't spend time developing its plot?"},{"Title":"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea","review":"This book is a great joy to read. It's a wonderful exercise in imagination and visualizing everything inside my head. So many things in popular culture today have been influenced by what's in this book. Before I ever read this book, I was was primarily familiar with it because of the part with the giant squid. So imagine my surprise to find out that that part of the book was just a few pages long! But that's perfectly OK, because the rest of the book has plenty of things going for it. Jules Verne had a very good imagination. His depiction of the submarine turned out to be quite accurate with regards to what actually was turned into reality during the 20th century.

It's clear and intuitive, but covers all the basics:-- chemical shifts for a variety of binding structures,-- the various isotopes,-- line-splitting and spin coupling,-- equilibria in chemical and physical state,-- Overhauser effect,and lots more. In other words, it covers everything needed for more advanced analyses, but does it without dragging the reader through every wave function. Somehow, the author packs all that into fewer than 90 pages without making it all indigestibly dense.To get the book's full benefit, you'll need some background in chemistry, including a little organic, and maybe some physics. You won't need a lot of either - the first or second college course in each should be enough. The treatment uses a little algebra, but not a lot in the direct line of its arguments. The real emphasis is on the basic phenomena: on the concepts of electron shielding, on effects of different kinds of bonding, and on interactions between magnetic nuclei.This book won't make you an analytic chemist. It could help, though. The text is well-suited for a prepared novice. It's illustrated with simple and descriptive diagrams. If you need to get the basic ideas of analytic NMR, fast, this book may be the best around. Other books cover advanced topics like NMR for protein structure. Read this book first, like an introductory chapter, and you'll have a much easier time with those more complex discussions.This much information at this price is an incredible deal - it has my highest recommendation."},{"Title":"Adventures of Riley--Tigers in Terai","review":"The combination of adventure and educational material in this book made it a great hit with my daughter and her friends, as well as the moms and teachers.

I found Grab a Broom Lord to be a breath of fresh air. In her usual light and humorous style, Ms. Goodman teaches us that it's not only our nature to be free from perfections, but it's the wonderful way that our Creator made us. He never intended for us to be perfect-after all, he has a staff full of angels that do just that. He made us just the way we are for a reason.As with Karon's other women's studies, Grab a Broom Lord is a short read but it's packed full of powerful insights-it may be little but it's loud! You'll learn how to overcome your need for perfection, deal with your past, live in the present, and embrace the future. But of course, without God's grace, none of this would be possible, would it? In fact, that's the lesson that I learned from this powerful little book. In my imperfections (and do I have a lot of them), God's love and power is manifested. Isn't that an amazing gift? Don't you want to learn more ways of glorifying Him?You'll find yourself as I did, reading this book over and again.

I bought this book whilst a student there, because many of the books of Marxist criticism available took a rather pro-Marxist view, of sorts. They mostly viewed Marxism as something about 'revolutions in the head' rather than as the rational project it was when written. Len Jackson shows how Marx has been 'dematerialized' in the mid to late 20th century by philosophers reducing Marxism to an ideology stripped of its most convincing doctrine - that of economic infrastructure determining social superstructure. Jackson is not a Marxist, and not being so deals very evenly with his subject in a way that does not assume prior knowledge of the subject."},{"Title":"Secret Agents Four","review":"I read this book over and over when I was a kid.

With the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle's focus on Alfred and the eventual establishment of his dynasty as kings of a unified England, Wessex has taken the spotlight in our understanding of this period of history. However, Wessex did not stand alone against the Danes.The central English kingdom of Mercia was a major source of support in the effort to re-conquer lands lost to the Danes. While dynastic accidents prevented Mercian royalty from competing for the crown of all England, Mercia was vital to the unification process. The history of this kingdom is represented by a much more limited set of surviving sources when compared to Wessex.Ian Walker attempts to redress this imbalance by providing a history of the Mercian kingdom. Most of the book focuses on the struggles with the Danes and the emergence of a unified England. Without the co-operation and consent of Mercia, England would not have been formed under the Wessex kings. Of particular interest are the sections on Lord thelred of Mercia and his wife thelfld, Lady of the Mercians. The daughter of Alfred the Great, thelfld's marriage to the ruler of Mercia helped ensure the critical co-operation between the two kingdoms in the darkest days of the Danes' hegemony. thelfld ruled Mercia in her own right for several years after the death of her father and husband - the only instance of a female to have done so in Anglo-Saxon times.After reviewing the history of kingdom from King Offa of Mercia to King Edgar of England, the book provides two chapters on the composition of Mercian society and the Mercian Church. Mercians in positions of power under Wessex and later English kings are given biographical treatment. A highlight of the book is its consideration of Mercian art in building, sculpture & literature. This is an excellent read and a much needed redress of the paucity of popular works on Anglo-Saxon kingdoms other than Wessex."},{"Title":"Mercia and the Making of England","review":"I was impressed by this book in its detail regarding the muddy middle history of the kingdom of Mercia as it was eventually joined with the other Heptarchy in forming England. Mr. Walker writes in a style that makes this dim past come alive. I would have rated this book higher had he spent a little more time laying the ground work for the 8th and 9th centuries by discussing the 6th and 7th Centuries. Particularly the contributions of Penda, Peada, Wulfhere etc. to the increasing power of Mercia as an economic and social power. Michael Woods \\"In Search of the Dark Ages\\" would make a nice companion book to this one."},{"Title":"Procedures in experimental physics, (Prentice-Hall physics series)","review":"Do you like scientific notebooks? I do. My first one was a book that I bought from Radio Shack called \\"The Engineers Notebook\\". It was packed with tables, schematics, drawings and explaniatory text. There was just enough information there to make something happen, and start you on your way towards understanding the science involved. Gosh, I love Scientific Notebooks.This is a classic notebook, by a scientist who was tutored in the basics of draftings. Thus it is well written, and beautifully illustrated. It is wonderful. It is the kind of book that you could pick up and open a page, and dream about making your own X-Ray machine...or maybe a portable backyard radio telescope.Buy this one for your children.

Normally the main lady drives me crazy but in this one she was pretty awesome. But the main guy, (there is no way I'm calling him the hero,) totally didn't deserve her. He had his issues and that's understandable, but I really think that Lindsey should have found a way for him to get around that and quit mopping around so much. And taking his anger out on women! I mean come on!The only other issue I had with this book was the fact that the couple announced their love for one another... and that was it. Literally in the last few pages of the book and it was over. I hate it when books do that!Now that I've commented on the biggest not so great parts I should say that there were also some really great things going on in this book. Like the supporting characters; great, great guys that all should have gotten their own stories but made this one enjoyable nevertheless.This was definitely one of Lindsey's better books and I absolutely recommend it."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"I truly enjoyed this book. I felt that I really got to know and care about the characters. I read it in one afternoon. I will tell you that I started skimming parts towards the end. The dilemmas just kept going on and on and on. She ran away just one time too many for me. But other than that (not a deal breaker as I know when to start skipping sections) I truly enjoyed this book! I would recommend you read it! Now on to the next one. Cheers."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"Johanna does a superb job writing to ensure the reader is captivated, the characters are realistic, the details and descriptions are clear. It is like watching a movie with the eyes. There is noone who writes a better romantic novel. A person can not go wrong buying any of her books. I have every book she has written."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"This is a crazy romance, but it keeps you on your toes from beginning to end. If you want to get out of your elimant, this is the book to read. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"The story is cute, kind of typical, but cute. The heroine definitely makes it though, as she is spunky and loveable. However, the hero frustrates me at times but overall he is great too and their travels and troubles along the way make the book fun and keep you hooked all the way till the end! You will be somewhat frustrated with the hero's pigheadedness at times, but it's a great read overall!"},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"I have been a Johanna Lindsey fan for 24 years now. It's hard to believe it's been so long. To this day, I do not have to read the back of the book to know if I want to buy it. I see it, I buy it, it's that simple. I got a little angry reading some of these bad reviews over a book I absolutely love, so I thought that I'd write my own. I guess not everyone can be a huge fan of Johanna the way that I am, but come on! Her heroes are just what you secretly wish a man was really like, though I have a terrible habit here and there for falling for the secondary male hero, but she always blesses me with his own story when that does happen. Her stories are easy reads, full of wit, charm, and wonderful characters. I thought Once A Princess was a classic beauty and the beast storyline. I thought there was plenty of depth on how two very beautiful people thought they were ugly, and the passion between them was just great. I have read this book 4 times, and I hold it up there with a couple of other non-Malory books as her best. Of course, the Malory clan are a force unto themselves! If you like strong characters, enjoy laughing when you read a good book, then do yourself a favor, pick up a Lindsey, in whatever time line you prefer, because she has them all, Viking, western, regency England, pirates, etc. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"While this is not my favorite Lindsey novel, I did find it one of the quickest and easiest to read. The plot is engaging, the characters are interesting, and there's great chemistry. I wish there would have been more emotional interplay between the H&H and I was annoyed at the extra \\"bad guy\\" tossed in at the end, but all in all I was satisfied with this book. This isn't award-winning literature and it's not the perfect romance (a little shallow and underdeveloped), but I can easily give four stars for entertainment value. It's a nice read for a Lindsey fan."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"Great story typical of Joanna Lindsey, keeps you wondering what the characters will do next.

One of the most entertaining books I've read in a long time. Johanna Lindsey is one of my favorite authors. Her characters are strong and willful, making you actually see who they really are."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"Almost all of the books I've read by Johanna Lindsey I've liked but of course there are exceptions to every rule. This one is on my top ten list though. I liked the characters because both the hero and the heroine were stubburn but they were people I could relate to. I find that a lot in her books. I felt the plot was interesting because it took you to more than one setting and described some of them. This made the book even more special. I rate it an 8 because though it's on my list there were some parts I didn't like. Including how Tanya was treated by her &quot;father.&quot;"},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"This book is full of charmful characters. I can't help but falling in love not only with the heroes alone, but with other characters as well. How can I help it when they are so arrogant, so proud of themselves, and so... incredibly charming? The heroes spirits, their passions, and their intense conflicts make this book special. Lindsey has mastered her craft again. The story reminds me of fairly tales, yet those fairy tales are much more realistic, far more romantic and... passionate. She made the entertainment that reaches its high quality. If you haven't read this book, I recommend you start it now. This book is the one you shouldn't miss. Also, I'd like to recommend another book in sequel, &quot;You Belong To Me&quot;. This later book brings back the characters you admire in &quot;Once A Princess&quot; while giving you another great intriguing story about one of the most charming characters I can't help but falling in love with since &quot;Once A Princess&quot;, Vasili Petroff."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"This is classic Johanna Lindsey!

The heroine is a princess who has been brought up in scallor. As a baby she was spirited away to America in order to escape some assasins but her mentor died and she has been brought up in poverty. When the story begins she is working as a tavern wench. In order to preserve her virginity from men who frequent the tavern, she hides her beauty behind layers of dirt. Now the hero, future king of her country comes to find her. On the orders of his father the king; he must return her to her rightfull place and marry her in order to become king. The hero explains that she is a princess but the heroine refuses to believe him and the hero is forced to kidnap her. The interaction between hero and spirited heroine is hilarious. First the heroine will not believe that she is a princess and insists that the hero is a kidnapper who is bent on selling her as a whore at a profit. Then the hero believes that the heroine is a tavern whore until the last. 'What good does it do to tell you anything. You won't believe anything. You insist on believing that I am a whore.' says the heroine. 'Even last night when I give up my virginity; you didn't notice.'.'I am sorry' says the shamefaced hero. Hilarious..."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"This book had to have one of the stupidest, no, THE stupidest heroine I have ever read. She disguises herself so they all think she is ugly, call her such to her face, yet she believes that 1. one of the men climbed a tree to peak in her window and that's how they know of the mark on her back side, and 2. they are kidnapping her to sell her to a brothel. As the book progresses, she still think this after they jump in a dangerous river after her to get her back. She escapes, and the brilliant girl makes it back home, only to find them waiting there (what a surprise) and that Stefan bought the tavern she grew up in and resold it for a major loss, so she has nowhere to return to. And still she thinks the above. Come on, how totally moronic can she be?I also thought he was an idiot, and didn't like how he called her a whore the whole book. Based on what? someone in the tavern their first night in town said that the dancing girl could be had for money. The fact that she doesn't behave like a whore the whole time they know each other doesn't make a difference. And yes, all they do is fight, argue, and kiss- and that part was bad, too- always forced. She comes across as white trash, and he, an idiot.I read JL's Hearts Aflame and thought it was enjoyable. This one is a piece of trash."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"I really wanted to like this book, and while it is an easy, breezy read, it is the first and last Johanna Lindsey volume I will touch. The heroine is a childish bore and while I admired her spunk at times she irritated me too much to really care about her. The hero calls her a whore the whole time which didn't make me like him much either and worst of all, it was impossible to understand the love they were supposed to feel for each other. It seemed very forced, contrived, silly. The one love scene here was OK but in the last third of the book, it didn't hold my interest much. Ms. Lindsey is in desperate need of an editor, too. The use of innards at least 15 times to denote Tania's sexual awakenings was so tacky...it was like a page out of the Hillbilly Guide to Colon Cancer...definitely NOT belonging in a romance novel. A drinking game in the making I am sure, since she uses the term so much it became hilarious.While this is a fast-paced easy page turner, it lacked something. A little waif becoming a princess has limitless possibilities...think of her awkwardness at the formality at court, hilarious! But that is an example of the missed opportunities here. I didn't believe the hero and heroine really loved each other. It just seemed like the author had her Barbie and Ken dolls out and decided to invent a little story."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"I thought this book was good, but not up to the quality of the Malory books, which are the best of hers by far. The hero, Stefan, really is handsome man, though he dwells on some minor scar tissue and for those marks on his face, women for some dumb reason find him completely unattractive. He also uses Tanya a time or two when he really just needs some anger management courses. He calls her a whore throughout the book without once asking whether or not she is, and she never bothers to inform him otherwise. The story could have been a lot better if his character didn't seem so shallow. I don't know about other people, but I'm a little tired of JL's always beautiful and perfect females. How many of us are really like that? It was a decent book to read once, but I don't think I'll pick it up again."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"&quot;Once a Princess&quot; focuses its attention on Stefan and Tayna. Stefan is the son of the dying king and is being forced to marry (against his wishes?) to a princess that he was engaged to when she was little more than an infant. Because of family hatred, the baby (Tayna) was secreted out of the country to be raised like a royal in America. Only her protector dies and leaves her in the hands of a cruel tavern owner who sees Tayna little more than a slave. Tayna grow up to be a very independent woman who is accustomed to life's hardships and cruel tricks. Is it no wonder that when Stefan shows up and tells her she is a princess that she doesn't believe him?From there it is a merry chase with numerous escape attempts (all of them failed). Finally they arrive in Stefan's homeland only to be greated by Stefan's mistress (I was a little disturbed by the caviliar attutidue the author portrayed to this subject) who tries to kill Tayna. Then out of nowhere (like 5 pages from the end) comes Ivan Stroboli, the last remaining member of a family that killed the rest of Tayna's family. He just appears in her room and tries to kill her, but Stefan shows up just in time, but for a totally unlreated issue.I thought the plot of the book was weak and if not for the constant fighting of Tayna and Stefan the book wouldn't have held my attention. I also thought that Ivan could have been integrated more into the book to give the plot a little more help and life."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"Though I read this book more than 11 years ago (I'm 26 now) I will NEVER get tired of reading this book. I've eliminated all the things that remind me of my ex but he just HAD to give me the an \\"like new\\" largeprint book WITH dustcover (a GORGEOUS pic of Tatiana and Stefan in the water) of Once a Princess and I knew I couldn't throw that book away!I've read this book a million times and I can't help but always breathing a sigh of contentment and sadness after reading. Sadness because the story is over and I want some more Stefan and Tatiana!!! If you see the picture of Stefan he is ABSOLUTELY gorgeous. I don't know what the heck they're talking about he is ugly with his scars. Stefana is absolutely hot too. Oh yeah, I actually scanned the picture and put the poster up in my room, hee hee and its only cellphone too.I like that whole fighting, antagonistic thing with the hero and heroine. And when Tanya reveals her beauty? Woohoo!!! That was such a wonderful scene and climax! I was almost holding my breath for their reactions!! And both characters had such chemistry!! It's almost like Beauty and the Beast another favorite of mine (and except Stefan is HOT in my opinion). The other characters in the book, like Vasili were great too. He's so funny. I have to say that Once a Princess is my most favorite Johanna Lindsey book and my MOST favorite book of all!!! I'm naming my children Tatiana and Stefan if I'm lucky enough to have a boy and a girl hee hee! I also recommend A Knight in Shining Armor by Jude Deveraux."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"This is one of my favorite romance novels of all time- I have easily read it 15 times and I will read it again.The story itself is decent. I personally enjoy fairy tale stories and stories involving royalty, but the thing that makes this book so good is Johanna's character developement. The heroine is strong and willful (something some of JL's older books lack) and the hero's friends are a great addition to the overall book.Then there's Stefan. He is possibly my favorite romance hero EVER. I loved the combination of strength and insecurity. His face was scarred in his youth, and though he has the confidence to run a country, he believes that no woman could ever get past his physical imperfections and love him. The heroine responds passionately to him (despite her efforts not to), but Stefan refuses to believe that it's out of any attraction to him. In fact, he's convinced she's a prostitute and that her response to him is out of sexual desperation. It sounds kind of depraved, but it actually works.This book is interesting, fast paced, and worth buying."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"Once upon a time there was a baby princess born in the small European country of Cardinia. Her name was Tatiana Janacek and her father was the king. Her life should have been an endless parade of balls, cotillions and fairy-tale dreams, but before her first birthday her world shattered. Her entire family was killed in a blood-feud that destroyed the royal house of Cardinia and her own life was threatened before it even had a chance to begin. So, the new king, Sandor, held a ceremony to betroth Tatiana to his son, Stefan, and then the only remaining Janacek was spirited away to the wilds of America. Unfortunately, the bad luck she'd faced in Cardinia followed Tatiana to the new world and the woman who accompanied her on the harrowing journey died the moment they reached America. Tatiana never had the chance to learn of her noble ancestry or even to know her own birthday. Left in the care of a tavern-owner and his wife, Tatiana grew up as Tanya Dobbs. In her formative years she suffered greatly at the hands of the man she believed to be her father. Beatings and emotional abuse were Tanya's constant companions. Now in her 20s, the man who abused her so grievously must depend on her for his care. With his incapacitation, Tanya is finally able to take control of her life and the tavern where she was barely better than a slave will soon be hers. Thus, the woman who should have been the queen of a country finally becomes ruler of her own destiny.In the land of Cardinia, king Sandor's health is failing. The rigors and responsibilities of ruling are taking their toll on him and he feels it would be in his country's best interest if he turns the reins over to his son, Stefan. His last wish as king, and possibly the last wish of his life, is for his son Stefan to journey to America, find the now-grown Princess Tatiana, bring her back to her homeland and marry her. Stefan is completely against the idea. Not only does he have no desire to marry a woman he's never met, he's sure the pampered princess will turn out to be extremely beautiful. Unlike most men who would be thrilled at the prospect of a beautiful bride, Stefan suffered an horrific accident when he was younger. While trying to save his younger brother from a pack of rampaging wolves, his face was disfigured. Left scarred physically and emotionally, Stefan has resigned himself to a life of scorn from beautiful women. Though reluctant, Stefan decides to honor his father's last wish and journeys to America with three of his friends.What follows is one of Johanna Lindsey's best stories as Tanya becomes accustomed to the idea that she's actually a lost foreign princess and Stefan learns that not all beautiful women are shallow and self-serving. I've always found everything about this book engaging. The plot, the dialogue, the characters, the setting all come together for an amazing read. Tanya is probably one of Ms. Lindsey's most likeable heroines. Tough, sassy, brave and completely capable of taking care of herself, Tanya's had to work for a living her entire life. Stefan is a unique hero, with deep emotional scars and he's the perfect compliment for Tanya, who has also suffered greatly in her young life. Together their love story is tender and touching. You'll cheer when they finally get together!Not only are the main characters some of the best in Ms. Lindsey's outstanding career, the secondary characters in the form of Stefan's personal guard are all intriguing, highly likeable men. You'll be thrilled to know that his cousin Vasili gets a story of his own (the sequel to this book, _You Belong To Me_) and you'll wish, as I do, that Ms. Lindsey would continue the story of Cardinia with the stories of Serge and Lazar.I've been a fan of Ms. Lindsey's work for over a decade. I've read each of her books numerous times and still savor each book like it's brand new. In fact, most of Ms. Lindsey's work is some of my all-time favorites in this genre. Such is the case with _Once A Princess_, the classic fairy-tale story of Tanya Dobbs, a European princess turned Mississippi barmaid and Stefan Barany, the arrogant king who wins her heart."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"I am always interested to read other reviews and I am often amazed at how books I think are fantastic are rated poorly and books I thought were merely okay are eulogized. This is one of those books I truly adored, finished and then picked up immediately again to re-read and savor. I think it is one of her best. The story is a fairy tale that even the heroine does not believe--long exiled princess, growing up unaware of her identity, is kidnapped by 4 absolutely charming men and told she is being brought to a distant country, her homeland, to marry the King. There is much humor and amusing dialogue, gripping love scenes, adventure and action. The King himself is a wonderfully drawn character, as are his 3 men. The pacing of the love story is well done, and never boring. Read it and judge for yourself!"},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"I have read alot of Johanna's books and enjoy most of them but this was not one of them. There was too much anger,hostility,and misunderstanding between the main characters throughout the the whole book. The WHOLE book!All the way to the very end. Now I dont mind at all books that have anger and misunderstanding when characters first meet and here and there throughout the book,but this was ridiculous. It's expected that there will be strife and misunderstanding between the main characters,it's what keeps a book from being boring(with a few exceptions). But these characters NEVER got along and it wasn't till the very end that their misunderstandings were resolved. So I cannot reccomend this book."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"This book is definitely a four star romance...I loved the plot &amp; the characters, and had a marvelous time reading the book. The heroine, Tanya (Tatiana), was found and brought up in a saloon in frontier America that she hopes to one day inherit. Fate, though, has other plans.Stephen, the hero, comes to America looking for the fostered off princess he is supposed to marry. What he finds instead is a skeptical barmaid loathe to leave her station.Typical Lindsey plot insues...heroine dislikes hero and gives good chase. Unfortunately (or fortunately), all ten escape attempts fail. You can't help but wonder why they run at all!No matter, all Linsey fans will get their money's worth as this book has an excellent shelf-life!"},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"Last night, at 12:30, I couldn't sleep and decided to organize my books. This being one of my favs of all time, I realized i hadn't read it in a while. I just looked at the beginning and started to read. at 8:10 this morning I put the book down with the largest grin imaginable on my face. I then had to proceed with it being my first day at my new job and nearly falling over with sleep every two seconds! But it was completely worth it. All that needs to be said about this book, is that you will fall in love. Not just with Stephan and Tanya, but with the 3 most charming companions. And for all of his arrogance, Vasili absolutly captured my heart. I first read this book years ago, and now, just today, by reading the reviews i have found he has a book of his own!! I nearly went beserk with excitement...I take that back, I DID go beserk. Now I know whats on my list of stuff to do tomorrow. I only hope someday Serge and Lazar are bestowed the same honor. But Johanna Lindsey, THANK YOU, you have made one woman very, VERY, happy. Imagine that feeling in your chest, where you just have to smile, and in that second everything seems perfect. This book will make you feel that, time and time again, no matter how many times you read it. Once again....all I can do is sigh."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"An unenjoyable book. The main characters were constantly fighting, arguing, misunderstanding and misinterpreting each other's words and actions. The heroine was particularly annoying, and by the end of the book (if you can make it that far) you feel no empathy or affection towards her. Definitely not a keeper."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"King Sandor of Cardinia is dying. He turns the throne over to his son Stefan and orders him to go to America to find his betrothed princess. Twenty years before, the previous royal family was nearly wiped out except for Tatiana, the infant princess, who was smuggled out to safety. Before leaving with her protectress, she was betrothed to Stefan. But tragedy befell the royal escapees. The princess' guardian died of a fever, leaving her in the hands of a cruel tavern keeper and his kind-hearted wife. Raised in this atmosphere, Tanya grew to be a skeptical and sarcastic woman often hiding her beauty so as not to attract men. Upon finding her, Stefan is stunned that this tavern whore could be his princess. He is aware that she is disguised, but unaware of the true beauty that lies beneath. Tanya disbelieves the story Stefan and his men are telling her and they must take her by force. Stefan believes that his disfigurement is the reason she pulls away from him, never realizing that Tanya has already seen past his scars and is undeniably attracted to this man who would disrupt her life.Tanya is not the whore the man believe her to be. Instead, she is a realist, a survivor, a woman striving to gain independence for herself and her future. Stefan is a man determined, a future king with an arrogant temper that he must control. Together they are made for each other. This story is a bit longer than most of her other books, but keeps your attention up until the end. I kept hoping that they would get things straightened out sooner. When Tanya does make her confessions to Stefan at the end, it is heartwarming and touching. A great story!!"},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"This story is simply amazing. Johanna Lindsey outdid herself with &quot;Once a Princess,&quot; a novel about a girl raised in a Mississippi tavern who is really a long lost Eastern European princess.Tanya is a splendid heroine. She is feisty, spirited, and witty, AND she knows how to stand up for herself. Stefan is her perfect match: dark and brooding with &quot;devil's eyes,&quot; the future king of Cardinia fights fire with fire, with some passionate results. The two are an excellent pair together and fun to watch.The fact that Tanya absolutely refuses to believe she's a real princess leads her into quite a few adventures as Stefan and his dashing companions escort (er, kidnap) Tanya back to Europe. Stefan's three companions are great characters, but the best is Vasili, the nasty conceited peacock who is so gorgeous women fall all over him. Of course, he gets his own book in the sequel &quot;You Belong to Me.&quot;What else can I say about &quot;Once a Princess&quot; but read it, read it, read it. It is my second favorite JL, the first being &quot;Savage Thunder.&quot;"},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"Two decades ago in a small country in Eastern Europe, a beautiful princess was born and christened Tatiana Janacek. But she was born amidst chaos for there was a blood feud between her royal family, the Janaceks, and another powerful clan, the Stamboloffs. After several of her family members have been murdered, and with her father, the then King of Cardinia, fearing for his own life, Tatiana was immediately betrothed to the son of Sandor Barany, who became king after the rest of Tatiana's family were murdered. As the only remaining Janacek, King Sandor sent Tatiana to America with a baroness as her only companion. But tragedy seems to follow Tatiana wherever she goes for shortly after reaching America, the baroness died from illness leaving Tatiana at the hands of an elderly couple, with whom she grow up in near poverty and completely unaware of her regal birthright.Fast forward to 1835 and King Sandor decides to abdicate the throne so his son Stefan could succeed. Now Stefan isn't too happy especially with the news that along with the throne comes his imminent wedding to the exiled princess. But worried for his father's fading health, he sails to America, albeit reluctantly, to bring his queen back home. But were he and his three companions in for a shock! For not only are they sent on a wild goose chase trying to find the princess, but when they finally do, it is to discover that she is not the pampered beauty they expected her to be but a feisty tavern wench who is completely ignorant of the circumstances of her birth. What astounds Stefan more is his instant attraction to Tatiana, who goes by the name of Tanya Dobbs. And for a moment, he is actually pleased that Tanya isn't the great beauty everyone claimed she would be, for he had long ago given up on beautiful women after being left scarred, both physically and emotionally, while trying to save his younger brother from being attacked by wolves. But that is another shock for him because Tanya's real appearance is soon unveiled. And this adds to the complication for he knows that he can't afford to lose his heart to the beautiful woman who he believes is repulsed by his appearance.ONCE A PRINCESS is a tale about a girl deprived of a regal upbringing through tragedy, and a reluctant king who must give her back what is rightfully hers. Tanya/Tatiana is a heroine who has suffered all her life from the terrible beatings of a man she grew up thinking was her father, yet it is also this tragedy that has moulded her into the courageous and feisty woman that she has become. A woman whose only ambition is to one day have full ownership of the tavern she grew up in and live an independent life without the ties of marriage. Stefan, on the other hand, is a man who must overcome his insecurities and believe that there is a woman who will love him \\"scars and all\\".This is a thoroughly enjoyable book. Tanya's attempts to escape Stefan had me laughing and cheering. I was held in suspense waiting to see how far she could make it just so she could drive Stefan and his friends demented. Stefan's friends, Vasili, Serge and Lazar also add to the fun, and then include a jealous mistress and a would-be assassin and you know you're in for an adventure.A delightful story with a nice ending, you will love how both characters find true love despite their initial qualms and mistrust in each other's intentions."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time. There's something about Stefan, he's mysterious, handsome, and takes in a lot without having to say anything. I like the fact that he wants to know if Tanya can want him without knowing who he is. I also like the way in which Stefan came to terms with his feelings for Tanya. He believes her past is sordid, but it truly no longer matters to him because he loves her and is looking forward to their lives together. This is a story I could read again and again. It's really that good!But... in the very beginning of the story, the author described Stefan as \\"disfigured,\\" which wasn't exactly true. As the story progressed Stefan was described as very handsome, and, like Tanya, I felt the scars on his cheek totally insignificant to the man he was. I didn't give them another thought - it was the author who kept on and on about them - for Tanya's benefit, I suppose, but it was annoying. I don't know why JL felt the need to make such a big deal about it. She might well have turned some readers off, thereby causing many to lose out on a very interesting story.Vasili was great! I actually reread ONCE A PRINCESS after reading his story YOU BELONG TO ME, and I liked and understood him much better.Also, another great book, better even than most of JL's books was THE ROSE OF ENCHANTMENT, Kathryn N Bender. It's one of those kinds of love stories you'll never forget."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"This is not one of Johanna Lindsey's best, in fact it is one of about 3 that I have been disappointed in. I didn't think that there was much of a story to it, and found it very hard to read. I found Tanya to be a bit too obnoxious. The sequel 'You Belong to Me', which is about Stefans'cousin Vasili is much better."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"First of all folks if you ever find a Johanna Lindsey story for $1.99 and you don't buy it you are not a romance reader not matter what you might think. This Ladies is the Queen of Romance.This story was again set here in America with a disposed Princess of Cardinia sent to America to avoid being killed as an infant during a blood fued of the royal houses. That alone should get your attention, but since it's a Lindsay tale that should confirm it.Love the entire tale although I thought she could have done with a little less in the way of escape and recapture of the princess. I thought Tanya (Titania) was a bit obtuse about her thinking otherwise it was a wonderful, wonderful story and I loved every minute of it. I especially loved the little servant who would not allow the prince to think he was marrying a whore. What a grand way to announce that little detail.Love it. Love it. Love it.You know what to do folks. BUY BUY BUY whenever and wherever no matter the price BUY when it's Johanna Lindsey doing the penning of the story."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"Johanna Lindsey always knows how to create a love story that draws you in. I love it that the heroine was not the normal perfect woman but someone with a tainted past. The tug-a-war between the two main characters is heart-warming and humorous making this novel the perfect read for someone wanting a few hours spent falling in love."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"This is the best book, It's funny, romantic, I would read it again. Johanna Lindsey books are a Joy !"},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"My favorite book of all time . I read this book at least once a year as well as any other book of hers I can find Linsey is an artist of novels"},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Lindsey really knows how to draw u in her novels. I like the H and h sexual tension. I enjoy the beauty and the beast with them also, that's always nice to read when they finally accept the love for each other. I'm starting the next book in series now I hope it's as good if not better!"},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"Once a Princess by Johanna Lindsey is a fairy tale with a twist!Princess Tatiana Janacek of Cardinia is the last living Janacek after a series of murder in her family line by the traitorous Stamboloffs due to a family feud. In order to save her life and to keep the line of the Janaceks alive, the newly crowned King Sandor devised a plan in which he smuggled the infant princess to the Americas and there to live and be raised as a person of high birth.This is in the hope that when she grew up and it is safe for her to return, her betrothal to his son will be in fulfillment and she will again sit on the throne where she rightfully belongs. But fate intervened and she lived her life not as a princess but a tavern manager!The right time came when the new King Stefan, given a missive by his ailing father, King Sandor, who abdicated the throne for him, to look for the long-lost princess. To their surprise and disgust, they found that their princess is not who they expected and this princess did not believe an ounce of what they told her.Once a Princess is a fairy tale for adults with a humorous take of a princess who did not believe in fairy tales and did not believe she is a princess while the new King of Cardinia who was averse to the idea of marrying a pompous and spoiled princess only to find himself in love with the princess he did not expect!The Princess is not your average princess but instead a hardened woman who learned to live her life the hard way. She is a woman driven by the dream of a life not answering to anyone but herself. Because of a different upbringing, her views in life are different which makes her a better match to the arrogant, short-tempered - albeit - desirable King. The new King, however, had demons of his own and has a personal conflict of accepting his short-tempered attitude which borders to violence - he didn't want to hurt his princess, after all.Johanna Lindsey takes us to the small Kingdom of Cardinia in Europe in a world of betrayal, trust, friendship, acceptance, and love. It is a fairy tale with a happy ending but what delights me the most is the journey of Tanya and Stefan and the difficulties they have to face and overcome to reach that happy ending."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"Good read, though somewhat unbelieveable.I liked it and the sequel was even better.The price also was great. If you like this book you must read the next one."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"Good book, quick read, fun group a people to experience. Don't forget to read the sequel &#34;You Belong To Me&#34;. I read the books back to back and enjoyed both stories quite a bit."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"I first read this book when I was to young to know what romance is, but the story compelled me. It was the fairytale I hoped it would be then and it still is now. Each time I read this book I love it a little bit more! All of Johanna Lindsey's books are amazing, but this one will always have a special place in my heart and on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"This book is great. Just thinking about it makes my was\\\\nt to read it again and again. This is a must read if you suspensful yet tantilizing books."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"Lindsey demonstrated that she could truly write on something so touching.

Johanna Lindsey is superb at storytelling."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"I loved the book and enjoyed every minute I spent reading it.It was my favorite book of Johanna Lindsey. The characters are lovable. The book was full with good humor, and, of course, passion.

I couldn't put the book down.. I will definitely read it again..."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"i liked this book (as with all of the JL books) but i felt like something was missing. their was two much mistrust between tanya and stefan. i could not really see how they could love each other when they barely talked to each other. when they did they would fight. thier was to many misunderstanding between each other. not till the very end (and i am talking the very end) do they actually talk to each. the good thing about the book is they took no time to get into the plot, and everything was revelant to the story. but i still recommend this book despite all because it has a intersesting plot."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"This is Lindsay's best novel. It keeps you interested the whole way through. Tanya and Stefan are great together. I have read this book five times and it just gets better each time. Once you read this book Tanya and Stefan will be in your hearts forever."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"I feel compelled to offer my 2 cents worth on this because I cannot believe what I have just tossed in the bin. I have read widely in the various romance genres for many years but somehow managed to miss Johanna Lindsey. Recently I thought I ought to give her a try since she figures on auto-buy lists and seems to be fondly regarded by many readers. To quote John McEnroe: \\"You can't be serious!\\"What tripe! This is a one-dimensionsal pseudo fairy tale written in a juvenile voice with undeveloped, cardboard cut-out characters who are totally unappealing. When it took 3 chapters of inane dialogue and action for the hero (if you can call him that!) to uncover an \\"inherited\\" (really, is this genetically possible?) birthmark on the heroine's bottom, I knew I had to stop before I completely embarrassed myself. Besides I was too bored to make the effort to turn another page.I know that sometimes bad authors (like Barbara Cartland or Diana Palmer, for example) have huge, loyal followings. I've been guilty of this sort of reading myself but have always been full of disgust with myself afterwards when I realised just how much valuable reading time I'd wasted. However, I have decided to get ruthless and bin these silly sad sagas without finishing them no matter what the book cost. If the H/H in a novel are TSTL, then it goes into the bin or on ebay and out of my life!Congratulations to the author for no doubt making a personal fortune by selling tripe to gullible readers, myself included. Never again for Johanna Lindsey"},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"I don't mean to offend anyone who loved this book (a lot of people dislike my Lindsey fave--Prisoner of My Desire), but it annoyed me to no end. The entire time I was reading it I was screaming at Tanya. I kept wondering when she was going to stop being so stubborn and nasty and I kept thinking: &quot;God, if she runs away AGAIN!...&quot; I like Stefan though, and how his close friends/cousin were in most of the novel."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"Once a Princess . Love this book I am a big Johanna Lindsey fan . I have all her books"},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"It was okay for me. Not her best, not her worst. I will read more from her though. Thank you."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"I received the promised merchendise quickly and in good condition. It is exactly what I was looking for."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"I love this book. The two main characters drove me crazy with all the resentment and mistrust at first. It made me want to read it that much more to see if they resolve everything. Johanna Lindsey is one of my favorite authors and I have never been disappointed by one."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"I liked the story alot, but I wish there was more &quot;meat&quot; to bite into. It seemed to lack a little in the plot development area. But if you love Lindsey, you'll like it either way."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"Johana gets her readers caught up in the story, so they won't want to put the book down. She has done it again in Once a Princess. Keep your imagination going and I wait for your next book."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"The concept was good, the execution was poor. Lindsey had a great idea for a plot but I could barely get through the book because of it's poorly written style. The characters lacked depth and I felt no emotion for them. Having read a few of her books, I don't believe she wrote this. And if she did, she must have written it within a week. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"one of the best ever written by J.L. It makes you believe in love, fate, and fairy tales complete with a prince and princess over and over again. It transports you to that certain period of time--I wish I was there!"},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"This was a very enjoyable read. But I gave this book a 4 and not a 5 because of a few reasons1. The misunderstandings were a bit much...there were times when I was wondering when it was all over. The characters seem to think that it is best to keep information from each other. The author over did it just a bit. However i was not dissatisfied. I was quite excited when I got to the part where everything is revealed and all the misunderstandings are cleared up.2. The ending was too abrupt. I wanted more of a fight and suspense between the characters. I was expecting Tanya to face more danger and have Stefan fight for her life...like any knight rescuing his princess. Only a few threats and punches were thrown....kind of disappointing.Overall I did enjoy the book and did not want to stop reading. I just wished the author would have written more for the ending."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"Overall, this is a wonderful book. I love the premise of a \\"lost princess\\" who by some very bad luck has ended up working in a sleazy tavern, only to be \\"rescued\\" by a king. What is great is that Tanya is believable in the sense that she doesn't believe that the foreign men are telling her the truth, (I mean who would believe a story like that??) and she tries VERY hard to escape them b/c she thinks they mean her harm. The book is actually much funnier than I remembered and much of this is due to the lovable characters and their chemistry as a group. I love the supporting characters as well as the main couple. The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is that the fighting b/t the couple went on too long, it could have been resolved much more quickly and realistically if people would speak to eachother instead of getting so angry over nothing and then avoiding eachother for LONG periods of time. Also, the fighting went on so long that it became a little difficult to see when exactly this couple fell in love, they certainly had a physical connection, and it was really sweet how protective and possessive Stefan was towards Tanya, but I couldn't remember why they actually LIKED eachother. Sadly this is somewhat typical of JL novels b/c she often focuses more on physical attraction b/t a couple instead of their non-sexual relationship. But still, this is a fun read and a cute story that I found entertaining."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"Although not my MOST favorite of Lindsay's books, it was definitely worth staying up to read. I really enjoyed the characters & found it to be a lot of fun. I enjoyed the chemistry of the characters & would not mind a follow-up novel!"},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"After a blood feud kills most of her family, Princess Tatiana Jacanek of Cardinia is sent to America to be raised in exile so that her family's enemies will never find her. Years later, King Stefan of Cardinia travels to Mississippi to find his erstwhile bride.The spark between Stefan and Tatiana is electric from start to finish. In the beginning, I just kept hoping that one of them would lay their cards on the table and stop playing games, but their catty interplay was part of what I liked most about this book. The chemistry between these two makes this book shine as one of my favorite Lindsey novels. I would definitely recommend it if you're in the mood for a solid romance."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"This is another on of my absolute favourites that I can read again and again. The characters are memorable and unique. The dialogue really gets to you and is humourous and witty. The herione really has spunk."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"I completely agree with reviewer &quot;Fairy Tales that Come True&quot;. She has said everything. I can't think of anything more to add. It's one of my favorites, and I have all of Lindsey's books."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"I thought that this book was extremly well written, with a great plot and some pretty passionate lead characters.Also a pretty interesting releationship between Stephen and his friends.Definately one of my all time favourites.Also had some pretty unexpected twists and turns. Highly recommended for any of Johanna Lindsey fans ."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"I absolutely loved this book. This was the first book I read by JL. It was very romantic, classic can't get the girl or the guy until it's almost too late. Tanya was awesome, so was Stefan. I loved it. I wish there would be another book for Tanya and Stefan."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"At least for Tatiana Janacek they do. A wonderful book! A beautiful, feisty, and skeptical heroine; A handsome, and frustrated hero; what more could you ask for? This book shows Lindsey at her best, funny, poignant, sexy, romantic, with a dash of adventure thrown in for good measure. After this I reccomend reading Vasili's story &quot;You Belong To Me&quot;. I also hope that we get Lazar's and Serge's stories too."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"When I read the first 30 pages of this book, I thought it was going to be completely stupid and I almost put it down. What a mistake that would have been! Before I knew it, I was completely rivited by Once A Princess -- I couldn't put it down! I absolutely loved it. If you like romance novels in general, you will love this one in particular!"},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"Enchanting! Charming! Sexy! Romantic! It Couldn't have been better. Very well written. But anyone who readed a Johanna Lindsey novel is never disappionted! She always delievers something to remember!"},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"I have read a lot of Johanna Lindsey and was sorely disappointed with this one. I had no love for the characters, no interest in the story after her second escape attempt, and no respect for the unrealistic self esteem issues of a KING for goodness sake! If the main female could have been honest about ANYTHING even ONCE through the course of this ridiculousness I might have cared even a little if she lived or died, much less got her HEA... which I'm still fairly sure she didn't deserve. The \\"twist\\" at the end was so stupid I rolled my eyes so hard I HEARD it! I feel it could have been enjoyable if I had a higher tolerance for stupid people, but I do not, so it wasn't."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"The basic theme of \\"Once a Princess\\" is good; but the author ruined it with a heavy emphasis on sex. I quickly lost interest and sent it back. If this is the best that Ms. Lindsey can do, maybe she should try doing something else. I am sure there must be a GOOD book inside her if she will just look for it."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"While not as riveting as the first time I read it years ago, Johanna is a classic when it comes to writing historicals."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"I felt like throwing this book across the room because it was infuriating to the end. I hate sarcasm. I liked the hero and heroine, but it was unbelievable how long the author dragged out all the misunderstandings. I enjoyed some parts but I was more annoyed than anything. I kept waiting for the part when they would be completely sincere and the truth out in the open. It failed. The pants with blood? She doesn't raise hell when his mistress kisses him in front of her? She thinks she is the butt of a joke for way too long, and he thinks to the very end that she is a whore. I still gave it 4 stars because the storyline. I had high hopes for this one, but in the end it was sadly forgettable. I would still recommend because it does have some great parts."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"I finally got around to reading this last week...and yet again Johanna Lindsey blew me away. If you like romance stories that begin with a betrothal/arranged marriage and the hero and heroine start out at odds with one another, you'll probably like this book. The hero is very dominant and determined to bring the heroine back to his country, even if it means chasing the heroine and dragging her back kicking and screaming. Don't worry, they fall in love along the way. The only thing that might bother some people about this book is that the hero does spank the heroine once and threatens to do it again a number of times - but compared to the abuse she suffered as a child, it doesn't really phase her. But if you're familiar with this author, you probably already know what I mean. I highly recommend this book to others...it's defintely one of those 'can't put it down' books"},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"I'm definitely starting to notice that Lindsey's strategy for reeling in her readers is FRUSTRATING, PROLONGED COMMUNICATION ISSUES between her two main characters. That being said, it was far more pronounced in this book than any other book of hers that I have read.One thing that really bothered me was the fact that Tanya's transport to her rightful home on the thrown in Cardinia took up 50% of the book. It wasn't until this halfway marker that the men finally get her on the ship and she FINALLY starts believing this \\"fairy tale\\" of a story, that she truly is a princess. But before that, the characters and us, the readers, must endure a 220 page extravaganza of her stubbornly refusing to believe what they say, her consistently failed escape attempts, and the new title for her, \\"Princess,\\" used so sarcastically by Stefan and his men. I swear, every page has a \\"That's too bad, Princess\\" OR \\"I'd like to see you try, Princess\\" or SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES! I was so done with it!As I said before, this novel is an excellent example of communication issues that can be present in male-female relationships. This is what happens when people aren't direct in what they say and what they mean. And of course, everything that Stefan says is misconstrued and misinterpreted by Tanya, and of course, everything Tanya says is misconstrued and misinterpreted by Stefan and all of the other guys. It's constant, and omnipresent, and does not go away. Not until the VERY END of the book, just before they're about to get married, do these two lovebirds sort out all their issues. So here I am, reading my heart away, dying, begging, praying that Lindsey will absolve my anxiety, and allow this couple some happiness for a few chapters before tearing it away from them. But alas, it was not to be. If this is Lindsey's strategy for reeling in her readers, then it's entirely effective. I was hooked, and I didn't stop reading until 1:30AM. And felt awake enough to write this review shortly afterward. But effective or not, it was maddening to go through and feel all of the frustration of having the main characters' understanding of one another be so far off for the entire novel. Maddening.Yet, I loved it. I hated it and I loved it. I would not read it again, I would not recommend it to someone else, but it certainly entertained me for the duration of the night. I couldn't put it down. I didn't like how obstinate Tanya was, but I loved Stefan's passion. I loved that he used this passion as a wild, wonderful outlet for his anger. I loved that his eyes glowed when he felt angry. But I did not love how predictable the passionate scenes became for Tanya, and it'd almost be as if she was saying, or maybe I was thinking, \\"Oh, his eyes are glowing, he's angry, here comes a whirlwind of passion and kissing and lovemaking. Right on cue.\\"Don't read it. Or do read it. It depends on whether you like Lindsey's suck-you-in-and-grip-you-until-the-end-and-it's-1AM style."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"I read this book years ago. I can re-read a johanna lindsey book over and over again that's how good she is. If you're under 30 you probably havent read her because she really fell off the map. I recommend you read all her old stuff because she is one the best romance writers out there. Also try old Judith Mcnaught, katheleen woodiwise and Julie Garwood.

I definitely enjoyed this book, reading it in a day and half. I just couldn't put it down. Stefan was a hero to swoon over (love those handsomely dark and intense men, yummy) and Tanya was so headstrong and brave. I really liked her. She wasn't the typical weepy, fragile heroine. She tried to escape several times knowing her chances of making it were slim, and she deliberately went against Stefan's wishes more than once even knowing the consequences. I loved that about her! No man was going to tell her what to do...Stefan and Tanya had me in stitches at times. The chemistry between them was incredibly strong and watching them fall in love was amazing. I could actually feel why each of them was growing to love the other more... I've read books in which the heroine loves the hero suddenly after hating him throughout the book and there just seems to be no reason for her sudden adoration. Not so in Once a Princess.Tanya's reaction at discovering she was a princess after how she was raised was very believable and I liked that. Stefan's friends each had endearing traits that truly added depth to this book. I felt I knew each character in this book and that to me is a sign of great writing.This one will be staying on my bookshelf and in my list of favorites... A great read!"},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"This is a story about a Prince who travels to 'collect' his Princess who is currently working in a bar because she was taken away as a child. Stefan is not an ordinary Prince, he's a man who doesn't think too much of himself as he has a scarred face. Tatiana, his princess, seems plain when he first meets her and he is pleased as he doesn't think a beautiful woman would want him. Much to the Prince's dismay, Tatiana is in fact beautiful but hides her beauty as she doesn't want to be accosted by the men at the bar where she occasionally dances. If you like stories where the male character has flawed looks but a great big heart, you will love this one too. Beauty is only skin deep. I think it's what's inside your heart that really matters and it takes a special someone to look past the flaws and see the person."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"Johanna Lindsey's work are always a joy to read. Her dialogue can make any story seem like a masterpiece but it just wasn't enough for me in this book.Stefan, the arrogant, scarred prince must seek out a woman he promised to marry at birth to appease his father. There's just one problem, she was spirited away to america when she was still just a baby and now has gone missing. In comes Tanya, a tavern wench living in the mississippi valley. Stefan realizes that she is his princess, after a few mishaps. Just one thing, Tanya doesn't believe she's this so-called princess for a minute. Oh and we can't forget that Stefan believes that she is a whore, since she danced at the tavern she worked at.though many thought this was a cinderella story, and yes i did find it charming, there were just to many glaring improbabilities that detracted from the story. first off Tanya is apparently this legenardy, helen of troy beauty but hides it behind actor's makeup. exactly where does a girl living in the mississippi valley in the 19th century get actor's makeup? i don't think she could just pop down the street to resupply. This makeup is also apparently the most versitile thing ever since it survives just about everything but having a flame thrower put to it.Second Stefan kept jumping Tanya every time he was angry. I know i know this was explained as a way to \\"channel his anger.\\" but it seemed to simple in a way and almost forced. and finally the ending just seemed to neat. it also seemed forced, bringing a new character three pages from the end and then like \\"oh he's dead. how are you dear?\\"did i enjoy this book? yes i did. i love lindsey's dialouge and dynamic characters but there were just a few to many \\"yeah rights\\" in this book for me to really place it on my favorites list."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"I just didn't like this book. I hated how she was referred to a whore the whole way through. She just didn't seem like a princess and her life just didn't seem believable in the least. I know this is fiction, but come on. So far I have only enjoyed two J.L. books, (the magic of you) and (love only once) I hope to find more that I like, but this wasn't one."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"I borrowed this book from the library, and am I glad I didn't buy it.From the first page to the last page, this book is one silly, stupid, and meaningless fight. I read the first several chapters and then I gave up. I skimmed through the rest, still hoping that this story would get better. But it was just a waste of my time. Stefan all throughout the story calls Tanya a whore, which really put me off. Not to mention all his angst over a scar on his cheek, one would think he had a hideous deformation or something. And Tanya was very childish and annoying. And both of them were selfish, and irritating.Even the supporting characters were shallow and selfish. All the characters are not likable in the least, and the storyline is pointless, annoying, and weak.Not good at all.If you enjoy reading romances that are meaningful, moving, suspenseful, adventurous, with good plots, entertaining and strong storylines with likable and real characters, then skip this silly book. Reading it is a waste of time. If you want to check it out, borrow it from the library, save your money."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"The author made the mistake of letting the \\"tension\\", misunderstandings, and false perceptions go on WAY TOO LONG. To the point, that I barely cared anymore when they finally \\"get together\\" (at p. 337, jeez!)...I was so annoyed by the whole thing. A good romance novel allows the reader to enjoy the couple playfully falling in love, even when there are misunderstandings and tensions, while reading the book. It was difficult to enjoy or like this romantic couple because the author never let their relationship develop beyond the misunderstandings and arguing....she throws a few bones to the reader with passionate kisses, but it never satisfied the reader's desire to understand if they were actually making an emotional connection; it never seemed that it was anything other than manipulation or lust. The author also wraps up some plot lines (like the attempts on the heroine's life) in the last 10 pages....way too contrived and unbelievable.Most of the action in the story takes place with Tatiana and Stefan's journey to Europe, and it's really not all that interesting, even when you figure in their annoying arguements. I would have liked to ready them stopping at a few places, New Orleans, European cities - some of those backdrops could have provided some interesting sub-plots. Or even how Tatiana fares and adapts to the court at Cardinia. But, it's not to be, instead I had to endure page after page of her attempted escapes Missippi or Natchez.The author had a good storyline, but she blew it by letting the couple flounder and plod along with their misunderstanding of each other, didn't allow the reader to savor a slow genuine seeming \\"falling in love\\", and wrapped up the plot too quickly at the end."},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"I read these books backwards not realizing that &quot;You Belong to Me&quot; was actually a sequel to &quot;Once a Princess&quot; so I was introduced to Alex and Vasili before Stefan and Tanya. I think both stories were fun and both couples enjoyable to read about. It's a tough call, but I think &quot;Once a Princess&quot; is the better story. I could really relate to Tanya's character - her disbelief at being a princess, her humor, her determination to control her own life. And Stefan - YUM! - his looks (raven haired; golden-eyed) were definitely to my liking and the scars just added to his character. His vulnerability and occasional lack of confidence was endearing as was the total loyalty and love for him displayed by his friends, Vasili, Lazar and Serge.The love story between Tanya and Stefan developed slowly and sweetly with both characters trying to delay the other in discovering their true selves - she with &quot;camoulflage&quot; and he with an identity switch. Usually I find myself preferring the male characters to the females in these stories (perverse, huh? but the women are usually spoiled or too high maintenance), but here I found myself rooting for both of them.The unsung hero of both books is Lazar. A keen observer, he's often the comic relief, the truth-teller, the one who makes the lead characters &quot;see the light&quot;. His character was sweet, funny and smart and a totally enjoyable supporting character. Every girl hopes her man has a friend like Lazar to bring them down to earth and keep him honest - especially with himself!"},{"Title":"Once a Princess","review":"This is my all time favorite Johanna Lindsey novel. The heroine is extremely bright and capable and undauntable. I loved that she didn't buy into what truly was an unbelievable story told to her by three obnoxious gentlemen.

That's the path to success.THINDERELLA: There's got to be more to it than that.Are you a Thinderella thinking you can diet for a while and control your weight permanently? Hello?! It's time to snap out of your diet dreamland and wake up to the reality that lasting, effective weight loss can only come when you not only equip yourself with the right eating plan but also a strategy for taking control of your weight for the rest of your life.This is precisely what internist Dr. Dennis Gage helps you do in his book entitled The Thinderella Syndrome. While there are thousands of weight loss books available from A to Z these days, Dr. Gage is one of the only ones who shows people how to get past that long-term barrier to lasting weight control with a clear and conciise step-by-step plan to do it.In my recent interview with Dr. Gage at my [...] blog, he mentioned the biggest health problem Americans face to today is \\"yo-yo dieting.\\" It's all a matter of keeping the same kind of intense enthusiasm and motivation AFTER your weight loss has happened as you did DURING your weight loss experience.This involves not just the physical changes in your diet and exercise, but also some specific behavioral changes that Dr. Gage discusses at great length in The Thinderella Syndrome. Additionally, there are some tangible and practical Dr. Gage teaches about making this lifestyle change stick, including the creation of a food record so you can see exactly what and how much you are eating. The truth about what you are eating will shock you!What I can appreciate about Dr. Gage's book is that he is not just another self-righteous doctor spouting out what others need to be doing for their weight and health. He has LIVED the very principles he wants others to follow with great success. You gotta respect anyone who walks the walk while talking the talk. That's what you get from Dr. Dennis Gage.Changing your bad behaviors can be a tricky thing to do, but Dr. Gage gives you the three R's to help you overcome them: Realization makes you face the facts about your current dietary habits; Regimentation forces you to inact ways to bring your diet under control; and the most important one is Reorientation which involves living a positive and lifelong healthy lifestyle that works for you.In The Thinderella Syndrome, Dr. Gage says it is better to develop \\"defensive eating\\" techniques through the use of the \\"Red Alert\\" system he uses with his own patients. When your weight gets to a certain level, it's time to get serious about bringing the weight back down. If you allow yourself to go above this amount, then you are merely giving yourself permission to keep going up and up and up...the ruthless cycle continues on for millions upon millions of people.In the battle against obesity, we need more people like Dr. Dennis Gage engaging the culture and sharing the vital importance of developing long-term, permanent, lifestyle choices that will help keep them happy and healthy for the rest of their days on Earth. This is THE message of the future as it relates to weight loss and health and I am personally glad to see books like The Thinderella Syndrome opening people's eyes to what it takes to control their weight forever. Isn't that what every overweight and obese person is desiring when they go on a \\"diet?\\""},{"Title":"The Thinderella Syndrome","review":"This book offers easy to follow techniques for permanent weight loss. The combination of behavioral techniques with nutritional and cognitive techniques sets this book apart from other weight loss books and diet plans.

I expected to spend a full weekend trying to figure out what this book has to say, but it dropped right into my preconceptions.Some questions are more unsettling than others, and the question of spirit in Heidegger is worse when Derrida makes it perfectly clear that Heidegger knew how to avoid the question in purely philosophical works, firstly in Sein und Zeit, but treated spirit like a bandwagen that \\"the leap\\" (p. 32) would land on for those \\"in the movement of an authentication or identification which wish themselves to be properly German\\" (p. 33) in his famous Rectorship Address six years later, in 1933. The key paragraph of that address pictures the Germans, for whom the \\"will to essence creates for our people its most intimate and extreme world of danger, in other words its true spiritual world.\\" (p. 36) My confusion about this doesn't really start until page 41, where \\"Spirit is its double.\\" The consideration moves to the Einfuhrung (1935) which \\"repeats the invocation of spirit launched in the Address. It even relaunches it, explains it, extends it, justifies it, specifies it, surrounds it with unprecedented precautions.\\" (p. 41). What has become a concern for Heidegger is \\"The darkening of the world implies this destitution of spirit, its dissolution, consuming, its repression, and its misinterpretation. We are attempting at present to elucidate this destitution of spirit from just one perspective, and precisely that of the misinterpretation of spirit. We have said: Europe is caught in a vice between Russia and America, which metaphysically come down to the same thing in regard to their belonging to the world and their relation to spirit.\\" (p. 59). The collapse of German idealism a century earlier was, to Heidegger, the problem of an age \\"which was not strong enough to remain equal to the grandeur, the breadth, and the original authenticity of this spiritual world, that is, to realize it truly.\\" (p. 60). I dropped a lot of German words from the passages I quoted, and the bracketed \\"[to the character of their world, or rather to their character-of-world, Weltcharakter]\\", for the benefit of those who might have thought that he already said that. Plenty of attention is paid to language, but of all the foreign words which might mean spirit, I'm barely aware of how the Latin word spiritus might be sung in church with a different meaning than how German philosophers arrogate about geistliche or Geistigkeit.Page 63 has a sentence on how the metaphysics of the latter word as well as the Christian value, \\"a word which will itself thus find itself doubled\\" form some \\"profound relationship with what is said twenty years earlier of the darkening of world and spirit.&quot; (p. 63). If you are following this, this might be the book for you, if you still want to know, \\"Heidegger names the demonic. Evidently not the Evil Genius of Descartes . . .\\" (p. 62)."},{"Title":"Of Spirit: Heidegger and the Question","review":"An open question in the (by now) standard readings of Heidegger is his relation to Geist - spirit. From prescribed avoidance to evangelical inclusion over twenty five years, what motivated this change in Heidegger's pronouncements on spirit?By following the formations, transformations, presuppositions and destinations of this sea change, Derrida once more opens the question of the question, that famous Heideggerian question or questioning which originates human kind: &quot;Human being is that being which questions the being of its Being.&quot;In reading any Derrida analytique, one is made aware all over again of the many echos surrounding every voice, every attempt to speak. This is particularly poignant with regard to Heidegger, and Derrida does not gloss over the German's naziism as much as trace the hubris of his fallen state.Is there a conclusion? There is no conclusion. It's enough to keep talking...not to interrupt."},{"Title":"Of Spirit: Heidegger and the Question","review":"The question of Heidegger and politics has plagued (and will continue to plague) continental philosophy since Heidegger's induction into the Recktorship under the Nazi regime in the thirties.Why did he? But, and perhaps more importantly, why does something like Nazism come up? What is it about the West that breeds this kind of pathological racism? And how could Heidegger, for all his time concerned with, and working on authenticity and inauthenticity get swept up in the most inauthentic political movement of the century?For Derrida, this kind of fascistic-nationalistic racism is not a problem of facticity, it is a problem of Spirit (Geist). Heidegger avoids the question and problem of Spirit, and it is a failure of his fundamental ontology and onto-theology.This is a fascinating lecture from the late Derrida, who investigates Heidegger in new and unfamiliar modes. He relates (what he and the majority of others perceives to be) Heidegger's avoiding (vermeiden), of the question of Spirit ( Hegelian Geist). Avoiding means the saying without saying, the writing without writing, using words, without using them.\\"No one ever speaks of spirit in Heidegger\\" (pg.4), well now Derrida has provided us with the speaking.\\"The question of spirit must be recognized in indifference\\" (pg. 19), and Derrida performs this with remarkable coolness, though not lucidity.This lecture is about spirit, about politics, about Europe, and about language. All students of Heidegger should read it, as it is one of the best."},{"Title":"Of Spirit: Heidegger and the Question","review":"This title is in beautiful condition and made me think I should buy only cloth.

Others, such as Gregory Elliott's book, might be more comprehensive (but be sure to get the recent edition of Elliott's book, which corrects some errors of interpretation made in the first edition regarding Althusser's 1970s position) but this book by Montag (and, in fact, all of Montag's books) really gets at the crux of what Althusser's theories of reading and ideology are about. Especially useful to those working in literary analysis - there is also considerable discussion of Macherey in here, and there are Althusserian readings of Conrad, Defoe, and Althusser's own 'autobiography' in here.You used to be able to download a sample of the main chapter from Palgrave Macmillan's website, so have a look for that, but there is more here than just that chapter.I would also strongly recommend Montag's books on Swift (The Unthinkable Swift), Spinoza (Bodies, Masses, Power), and the various edited volumes he has been involved with, especially the collection of Macherey's writings (In a Materialist Way). Literary studies students might also find the essay on Frankenstein in the edition edited by Johanna Smith very useful, and students of Foucault will be interested in a paper by Montag in Yale French Studies no. 88."},{"Title":"You and Your Assets: A Practical Guide to Financial Management and Estate Planning","review":"Finally, a book absolutely anyone can understand when deciding how and where to invest.

However, there are also those who argue that while there are poets attributed to Theocritus the bucolic poems in question are from another ancient edition of dubious authorship. Today, Theocritus is primarily of interest to those looking for the historic antecedents of homoerotic poetry; the poet wrote the 14th, 15th, and 17th Idylls in honor of his patron, Ptolemy Soter. There is also a poem to a beautiful youth that is considered from that perspective. My interest in his \\"Idylls\\" stemmed from Theocritus being one of only two other classical writers to talk about the murder of Pentheus depicted in Euripides's tragedy \\"The Bacchae,\\" the other being Ovid in the \\"Metamorphoses.\\" This particular poem is neither pastoral nor part of the bucolic tradition, so it may well have been written by the actual Theocritus.For those interested in pastoral poems about shepherds and their ilk, the most famous Bucolics are: I, where Thyrsis sings to a goatherd the story of Daphis, the herdsman who died rather than yield to the power of Aphrodite; VII, \\"The Harvest Feast,\\" which features a gathering of poets on the island of Cos; and a set of Idylls, VI and XI, which has Polyphemus, the cyclops from the \\"Odyssey,\\" in love with the sea-nymph Galatea. There is also a marriage song for Helen that will be of passing interest to teachers and students of mythology. The rest of the poems are of lesser interest both from the perspective of mythology and, I would think, of those who study ancient poetry, although several are interesting in that they were apparently commissioned by rather ordinary folk for loved ones. Such poems are of a dramatic or mimetic nature, offering poetic pictures of the ordinary life of the common folk of Sicily in the 3rd century B.C. Consequently, although a minor classical poet all things considered, there are several elements worthy of note in his work."},{"Title":"The Idylls of Theocritus","review":"Theocritus was a bucolic poet and native of Syracuse who has often been credited, by both ancient and modern critics, as being the inventor of the genre of pastoral poetry.

Longair are amongst my favourite books: I read them several times and every time I found interesting hints for my work. I'm waiting for the third volume for 3 years, but it's still missing from the bookshelf...The first volume (&quot;Particles, Photons and Their Detection&quot;) focuses on the interactions between high energy particles and matter, in order to help the reader to understand how detectors work. The theoretical approach is deep enough not to hide the &quot;dirty&quot; steps of the calculations, and some subsection requires good mathematical skills (well, not as much as for Russian books ;-).The second volume (&quot;Stars, the Galaxy and Interstellar Medium&quot;) focuses on the Physics of cosmic rays (CR) while they run through the Galaxy. The author takes the occasion to explain several very exciting items, from the proposed mechanisms of CR acceleration and high energy photons emission, to the diffusion through the interstellar medium and the Solar wind, untill the CR reach the Earth. Special emphasis is given to open problems -- only very few of them were solved in the meantime (Nov. 2001).The 2 volumes are well suited for advanced students in Physics or Astronomy, and are a good reference for researchers."},{"Title":"Everything You Know Is Wrong","review":"This book is an excellent source if you like to know the truth behind alot of great history.

Styles also vary from abstract and impressionistic to photo-realistic. It is a great source of inspiration and ideas.I like it that there is only one piece of artwork on a page and you get more information than just the size, surface, artist and title. Each artist writes about themselves and the artwork. I think these added remarks really help you understand appreciate the artwork better.Some of my favorites include an adorable bird on a fishing reel by Sylvia Westgard and a sunflower by Nancy Huges. I also loved another called Garden Party II by Priscilla Heussner featuring flowers floating in balloons. I enjoyed a portrait of ballet dancers by Thomas Thayer and an unusual fantasy tree with musical leaves by Mike Russell.In the back there is a glossary and a directory of artists in case you wish to contact them. The variety here shows off the wonderful range of possibilities in this medium. This makes a great gift for any colored pencil artist or enthusiast."},{"Title":"The Best of Colored Pencil","review":"I have all the Best of Colored Pencil I-V books. I saw this and of course just had to have it too. At the time I tried to purchase this book, the prices started going crazy, over $1000! Every time I tried to buy one at a reasonable price under $75(about 4 times) the seller canceled the order and re-listed it at an outrageous amount. I would caution you against doing business with CentralKYbooksupply as they were the most unethical, cancelling my order with them at Barnes and Noble under $70, and re-listing here the same day over $1000. At the time of this writing the prices have fallen significantly. The book is not worth over $75 in any market.Finally got my hands on a copy under $50. The book is beautiful. Yet I noticed something too familiar about it. It is an exact copy, page for page of book #4 that has the picture of Koi on the cover. I even contacted Vera Curnow with the Colored Pencil Society who helped put book #4 together and she replied to my email that she was aware that book #4 was reprinted years after it's first printing as a softcover. If you look for book #4, you can usually find plenty of copies much cheaper than the prices recently asked for this book. The books have different ISBN numbers on the outside cover. If you look inside this book's copyright page, you'll find it has the same ISBN number as the other book #4. They ARE the same book, identical page for page. The only difference is the book with Koi on the cover is hardback, this white flower one is paperback. If you look at the white flower cover zoom in close up and you can make out the blue '4' after the title near right edge of book.Most of the pictures in any of the books from this series is available for free at the Colored Pencil Society of America website. If you spend a little time looking at their galleries of past exhibits, and check out the member's link to their personal galleries, you'll find nearly all the pictures in these books.I prefer to actually have the book in hand, but do not need two copies of the same thing. Wish I had known that it was a duplicate before I purchased it. The description should have mentioned that it is a re-print of the other book.Hope this helps you from making a very expensive mistake. These books are very nice indeed to own. None worth over $75 especially since the images are available for free on the internet if you look for them.

After the King Solomon's mines, Quatermain is back in England, where his son dies, and he's eager for new adventures. With his two best friends, Good and Curtis, they depart again to the heart of Africa, where they expect to discover a nation of white people undiscovered until now.This story, while a classic Haggard tale, has not all the good elements \\"King Solomon's mines\\" had. There is fighting, there's thrilling, but this book is somewhat slower. This might be because Allan Quatermain, telling the story in his point of view, is older, close to sixty-five years. In fact, there are some really anoying parts, where Quatermain is extra-shy and puritan, almost to the point of being ridiculous. And, as another reviewer wrote, there's no point in writing about a white race, civilized, organized and secret, in the heart of Africa, instead of a more plausible black one. This can only be excused in historical contexts. Back in the late XIX century, Africa was such a type of novelty and unknown that people thought almost everything could happen in there. But, today, if the reader doesn't have an open mind and doesn't know his History, this can be interpreted as pure racism, which is not. Haggard wrote this book in a time where the biggest thing about Africa was Livingstone trying to find where the Nile came from.So this is how this book should be taken. A classic adventure.Grade 7.6/10"},{"Title":"Allan Quartermain (Electric series)","review":"Hi, I bought this book as I had not come across the title before in any Haggard listing.

Rider Haggard's famous tale of KING SOLOMON'S MINES. It is as every bit entertaining and delightful as its predecessor. Along with being an entertaining tale, it is at times educational in its descriptions and details of Africa during the late 1800s. It is also, just like KING SOLOMON, an intriguing example of the imperialist racist attitude of the British in Africa. A great story to further understand the racist beliefs held by Europeans toward Africans in the 1800s-1900s."},{"Title":"Allan Quartermain (Electric series)","review":"Many of you will have read King Solomon's Mines by Sir Henry Rider Haggard. The majority of you will have found the story as spell-binding as one of the incantations of old Gagool herself! Allan Quartermain is the sequel to this first adventure in darkest Africa and, like the original, throws up a fine selection of genuinely 3-D characters. Quartermain, the great hunter, tells the tale but his English companions, Curtis and Good, and the old Zulu Umslopogas are all beautifully drawn by this master of Victorian ripping yarns. If you have an ounce of romance in your soul, read this book! Please note, the DREADFUL movie bearing the same title has virtually no connection with the book and certainly should not deter anyone from reading the novel."},{"Title":"Allan Quartermain (Electric series)","review":"The book, Allan Quartermain appears to be the last of a series of books penned by H. Rider Haggard about the exploits of a fictitious Englishman and African big-game hunter. In it, the leading man, Allan, is a bit more philosophical about life and his place on earth, and we follow his last great adventure in deepest, darkest Africa before he passes on, fully satisfied with his life and accomplishments, to the final Beyond.Once again, Quartermain teams up with his good friends, Captain Good and Sir Henry Curtis, this time around to find a fabled lost race of people(whom Quartermain later suspects as being a lost tribe of Persians when he finally finds them). Once in Africa, the intrepid English trio re-unite with the Mighty Umslopogaas, a bloodthirsty Zulu warrior and loyal friend and servant who also happens to have a heart of gold. Then, the Fabulous Four sally forth, and take on in short order a tribe of savage Masai, save a proper English damsel (of course very much in distress), undertake a perilous journey to an uncharted region of Africa, and inadvertently begin (and bloodily end) a civil war amongst the lost tribe they have sought.Without a doubt, the best character in this book is Mighty Umslopogaas and his trusty axe, Inkosi-kaas. Quartermain also puts in a good showing, especially as the old sage entangled in palace intrigues charged with amorous feelings and their attendant, homicidal jealousies.The first third of the book reads quickly, and is packed with action, while the second third gets bogged down in descriptive detail of the lost tribe- its people, customs and the land it occupies. The final third works the reader up to a rousing finish, and we see Mighty Umslopogaas bearing deadly Inkosi-kaas with skill and valor. England nor America could never hope to produce and officer and a gentleman as fine a soldier (and a man) as The Mighty Umslopogaas, who singlehandedly saves the Queen of the Lost Tribe and her kingdom to boot.In this final outing, Quartermain's age and dering-do finally catch up with him, but he has just enough mettle left in him to save his old friend Captain Good from the greedy paws of the Grim Reaper. And yet, though he lived loudly, Quatermain manages to exit the Stage of Life quietly with his friends Good and Curtis at his side, and by story's end, Good resurrects his sea legs among the Lost Tribe and Sir Henry manages to snare the Queen's heart and hand in marriage. All in all, the reader doesn't feel bad about the ending, and comes away thinking that all worked out as it should have.High adventure never gets better than this. Haggard wrote at a time when expansionism and imperialism were all the rage, and even then, his book were viewed as sensationalist. Now we know better, or at least we should, but back then, Haggard still managed to give Africa and her people, via The Mighty Umslopogaas, a small slice of dignity that many during his time were reticent to the point of belligerence to give. Haggard's Umslopogaas takes his rightful place in literary history alongside many noble, yet magnificient and exotic savages much like his contemporary, Robert B. Parker's Hawk of the Spenser mysteries, does today.In sum, this book and the others preceding it, make for good escapist fun, and writers today are hard-pressed to top, let alone equal, these classic masterpieces."},{"Title":"Allan Quartermain (Electric series)","review":"I can't say much about the story - I've only made it to Chapter 4.

Well..."},{"Title":"Allan Quartermain (Electric series)","review":"In the introduction of this book, Sir Henry Rider Haggard illustrates the differences, or rather the similarities, of the well-to-do &quot;civilised&quot; lady and the &quot;savage&quot; African. It is the recurring theme throughout the book and one which grates with today's reader. This novel is more like an early &quot;equality of man&quot; essay rather than the ripping yarn of &quot;King Solomon's Mines&quot;.I do not know if the author was being radical at the time, or whether he was on some form of race agenda, but it sits ill with the modern mind and it sits ill in this story. There are glaring inconsistencies such as the treatment of the &quot;savage&quot; Masai after the battle and the fact the that the race he finds in the middle of Africa is &quot;white&quot; and &quot;civilised&quot;. If he is trying to make the issue of the African also being able to be civilised, why are the civilised Africans not black?The story, however, is a reasonable read, and although occassionally plodding, the plot can be exciting. Of particular note, the tunnel scene and the final battle at Milosis are thrilling. Of rather less interest are the love lives of Curtis and Good, but these do not irritate as much as the race issue.I may be expecting too much from a text over 100 years old, but the issue of race was largely ignored in &quot;King Solomon's Mine&quot;, and the book is much better for it. &quot;Allan Quartermain&quot; ceases to be a harmless story of adventure, and instead becomes a rather contrived statement of the author's ideals."},{"Title":"Nature's Chicken: A Book for Animal Lovers","review":"In this wonderfully illustrated book, Mr. Burroughs tells about the horrors of todays chicken-farms and factory farms in general.

One idea in her book served me well throughout my career as a teacher and administrator. The concept was that of giving students choices. By giving two options--both of which are acceptable to you, the teacher--the student exerts his/her own power of decision making. The strategy is so positive and it works!

This is a play based of from Caroll's works.In this one-act fantasy play Alice's Adventure Under Ground by Christopher Hampton, has a style of surrealism playing with the imagination of a child. This play is based off and is adopted from the writings of Lewis Carroll. This leads it to have a logic all of its own, and presented towards the nonrealistic side of life.This takes place in a fireside room in Christ Church where Lewis Carroll sits in loneliness to his thoughts. He looks up to a mirror where he sees Alice inside of it for a second before she disappears and he sets up tea. A moment or so later there is a knock and Alice enters the room. He proceeds to tell her stories that draw her into some of tales of Wonderland and as this happens, he and three others become all of the characters Alice would encounter in that strange land of logic. There is no costume change, just physical performances transform them from classy 1860s people to the bizarre people of unique logic.Although the stories are presented from Alice's adventures of both books, the setting remains inside the room and it is though the imagination the transports us beyond the logic. The room seems be made up slightly abstractly, but it should have a sense that view comes from the eyes of a child. They would turn structure into a twisted surreal image of itself, trying to make it into a not unfriendly place of plain innocence.Lewis Carroll in this play has that same kind of purity we can see in several conversations with Alice. Like when Alice is trying to convince Carroll the she isn't someone named Mabel, because she knows more things than her. Carroll tests her out.Carroll: What's four times six?Alice: Thirteen.Carroll: Is London the capital of Paris?Alice: Yes.The logic from the books play nicely in all of the childlike scenes, always it creates wonder in common sense and tearing apart the ideas of what adults may think a proper. It reminds me of the purity of the movie Charlie and the Chocolate Factory where what may seem true to life is not a constant everywhere. Only through our imaginations, can we let ourselves free from structure and see things with new eyes. Everything real will be surreal and that will become the normal"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures Under Ground","review":"I was under the impression that this would include the original illustrations. . but unless there's a magic way to see them, there are none.

I got this book because I wanted to know how he got his start in Show Biz with his first Broadway stage acting job.In Chapter two page 18 he talks about his start on Broadway. This was in a play Produced by Franklin and Stoner titled.\\" Hotel Alimony'1933. Donald M Stoner and his partner Irving Franklyn had just come from Hollywood (read that \\"Escaped\\")after producing a good B Black and White Train Mystery. This movie at \\"talkie\\", was called, \\"The Phantom Express\\", it as a hit and they were in the money, however it was also the depression and due to cash flow problems escaped the bank credit collectors by ending up in New York. As Sheldon writes: of the show; \\"the play was a disaster\\"! The good news was he made out Ok getting the only good reviews for his humor if only a small part he did get noticed and survived. Later Sheldon tells of going on to Hollywood and fame.I enjoyed the book as my father Don Stoner was the real Producer of \\"Hotel Alimony\\" After the show bombed, his name was in all the NY Variety news papers during that time. The press had a field day after the producers were sued by the two old ladies that claimed .\\"Breach of Promise', rather a silly ending to the Broadway stinker. (no pun intended). Years later Stoner/Franklin were the two Flin-Flam models for the successful movie and the Broadway play which the title was of course... \\"The Producers\\". Yes it is true my Dad swindled a few older ladies by winning and dining them to put money in a show he and his partner knew would fail. They accomplished this by not putting much of the collected funds into it. Sheldon relates how they pocketed the money after only 5 performances. Be-live it or not.Leonard went on to do films as the type cast heavy in the film \\"Guys and Dolls\\", becoming a top television actor/ producer.

Mihkel Mathiesen's book is a much needed, albeit not exhaustive, review of the leading environmental issues of the past forty years. It presents a sad legacy of irrationalism, lies and fanaticism triumphing over truth.He begins with the DDT ban and works his way through acid rain, the asbestos ban, the ozone hole and, finally, to global warming. In each case he points out the distortion and, on the part of government officials, withholding of scientific evidence, which refutes the claims of the environmentalists.I was especially surprised concerning the events and lack of scientific information on the part of Joseph Califano, William Reilly and the Environmental Protection Agency concerning the asbestos ban. I was unaware that there are three different types of asbestos and that 95% ever used is the harmless form, chrysolite or white asbestos. Typically with environmental issues, the news media, our much vaunted \\"Fourth Estate,\\" failed in its duty to \\"inform the public\\" concerning this issue. Fear and panic sold much better than truth.The most extensive chapter is \\"Catastrophic Global Warming.\\" Mr. Mathiesen presents the history and scientific findings on both sides of the issue. However, in the end, the environmentalist side comes up wanting.I have several criticisms of the work. There is no table of contents or index and I would like to see more references. The forcefulness of the Introduction may put off all but the converted.Despite this, Mr. Mathiesen's book is an important and welcome addition. The points raised by this book deserve clear, honest, rational answers. It is too bad that our politicians and news media have for so long ignored the issues raised here by Mathiesen.I recommend this work for anyone interested in clarity and truth in environmental issues."},{"Title":"Global Warming in a Politically Correct Climate: How Truth Became Controversial","review":"Mr. Mathiesen has given us a very simple, easily understood overview of the inner workings of so called &quot;green&quot; groups and the way the media is manipulated to keep us all in a constant state of agitation and anxiety over the &quot;state of the world&quot;.

The graph of the Vostok ice-core derived temperatures is especially revealing. Even more revealing is the cliche-filled review below by the poseur scientist wannabe from the Netherlands. He demonstrates clearly the self-serving condenscension that Mathiesen writes about. No honest scientist would demonstrate such bias. The scientific community is not certain that warming is anthropocentric. I know that for certain from atmospheric scientists with whom I am acquainted.I only give the book four stars because it delves too much into other environmental scams (after all the title is &quot;Global Warming...&quot;) but the information is interesting and useful.

Instead these so called \\"enviornmentalists\\" engage in smear tactics as a means of disuading people from knowing and learning the truth about the enviornment. The true goals of these so called \\"enviornmentalists\\" is to scare people into giving up our hard fought liberties and freedoms and turning our Nation into an undemocratic socialist State where only the elitists have any power or privilege.

But, the book is lucid and informative.What gives the book credibility for me is the righteous indignation it seems to have aroused from the reviewer from the Netherlands, who refuses to identify himself (other than claiming to be a major scientist) and fits Mathiesen's descrition of the genre perfectly; full of wide ranging claims to worldwide acceptance by credible scientists, except of course those who Mathiesen has cited in his book who the reviewer dismisses as lunatic fringe.This book should certainly be read by anyone in a government policy making position. Before billions (pounds, roubles, dollars, even French Francs) of taxpayers' monies are spent on CO2 reduction, we taxpayers have the right to ask &quot;are we getting what we are paying for?&quot; Mathiesen's book starts a healthy dialogue: that is worth it all by itself."},{"Title":"Global Warming in a Politically Correct Climate: How Truth Became Controversial","review":"Still another nail in the coffin of anthropogenic global warming.

The sycophantic reviews extolling its virtues sadly ignore a number of important facts.First, check the citations. What we find is a veritable who's who of contrarian nonsense, from the much lamented Dixie Lee Ray to perhaps the worst book on the subject of the environment ever written, \\"Rational Readings...\\" edited by Jay Lehr. With very few exceptions, Dr. Mathiesen is entirely reliant on non-peer reviewed sources to support his arguments. Why so? If this book was to be taken at all seriously by my peers in science, then why not provide an exhaustive overview of the state-of-the-art studies in the respective fields? This would mean a disproportionate number of papers from very rigid journals such as Science, Nature and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, which reject something like 93% of the manuscripts they receive on the basis of the their scientific quality. Comic books like \\"21st Century Science and Technology\\", which rely on idealogical bias rather than scientific accuracy are completely discredited by the scientific community. This could be why most anti-environmental garbage ends up there - if these papers are so comprehensive and credible, wouldn't it be prudent for them to be published in the pages of the most respected journals?For this book, the entire content is therefore undermined by the dubious sources of its material. The author is speaking patent nonsense when he claims that no molecules of CFC's have been found in the stratosphere; there are dozens of studies I will very happily present to him if he so wishes in quality journals. The same is true for other environmental \\"scares\\" he wishes to debunk. By 1963, over 100 studies (published - oops, there I go again - in peer reviewed journals) showed a link between asbestos and cancer. Most scientists also do not refer to global warming as \\"catastrophic\\", an intentional misuse of the term by the author. Although global warming will undeniably affect the functioning of many of the world's ecosystems, and already is doing so, we are not yet sure to what extent the consequences will be catastrophic, although in some ecosystems there may be highly deleterious consequences. Let us just say that it is one of many examples where humanity is experimenting on its own life support systems.Quite honestly, this is one of the worst \\"science\\" books on the environment that I have ever read, and this would include trash like Gregg Easterbrook's \\"A Moment on the Earth\\" and Bjorn Lomborg's \\"The Skeptical Environmentalist\\". As awful as these last two books are, at least the authors attempted to cite some relevant studies in reputable journals to support their hollow arguments (even though neither author, like Dr. Mathiesen, has contributed anything at all to the debate beforehand in peer-reviewed journals)."},{"Title":"Global Warming in a Politically Correct Climate: How Truth Became Controversial","review":"This work reminds me of the work of 'scientific' creationists, who write with great zeal about how science has covered up the 'proof' of Creation.

This is the type of propaganda which has kept the American public in doubt about whether global warming is happening and whether humans are contributing to it. I showed the book to a few professors at various colleges and they were shocked that people believe the stuff written in this book.

These people and/or their children will be hunted down and face severe punishment. What should the punishment be for propaganda for world destroyers and cannibals of their own species? What did Hitler's propaganda minister get for supporting the death of just 20 million in death camps? The future will be hell and so will the criminal justice system. Why should the guys who perpetuated this mess be allowed to fly off in their Lear jets to the remaining livable parts of the planet and live like kings while billions suffer? Why should their offspring be allowed to prosper? This is much more severe than the media manipulation that the tobacco industry conducted. That only killed a couple of million people in the later parts of their lives. Keep notes of who was involved in this environmental disaster in the making and save it for their trials.Every one of over 900 \\"peer reviewed\\" scientific studies that came out last year concluded that humans are affecting the climate via carbon dioxide.

The pictures are all right, but not captivating and I'm not confident that they would keep a child's attention. As the title of my review reads, this is an adequate book to add to your library of deafness, but to stand alone as the sole example of a deaf child or deaf person...NOT recommended. :v("},{"Title":"I Have a Sister, My Sister is Deaf","review":"Jeanne Whitehouse Peterson's book, I Have a Sister: My Sister is Deaf, is a great children's story about a young girl who is deaf told from the perspective of her sister. The book goes through different everyday activities and explains what the deaf sister can and cannot do. Even though the book points out a long of things that the little girl cannot do because she is deaf, I like that they point out of lot of things that she can do but in a different way than people who do not have her disability. For example, she may not be able to hear the radio playing, but she can tell that it is playing by touching it with her hand. In my opinion, the book does a good job of showing inclusion in school and society. The girl has friends and classmates at her school who accept her as part of their class. They get excited for her when she makes accomplishments, and they want her to do well. Her sister also is able to see her as a special kind of sister rather than just seeing her as different. She understands there are things her sister who is deaf can do that she would never be able to do. She cannot block out the scary noises of a thunder storm or show expressions with her body language like her sister who is deaf can. As a future teacher, I would definitely use this book in my classroom to talk about differences. I would read this book in a large group and then talk with the children about how we all have different abilities, different things that we are not so good at, and things that make us special. I might have my students think of things that make them different and special as compared to their classmates. Overall, I feel that I Have a Sister: My Sister is Deaf, is a very appropriate book to introduce disabilities and differences to children as well as to promote inclusion is the classroom. I would recommend it to any teacher."},{"Title":"I Have a Sister, My Sister is Deaf","review":"The product arrived early and in good condition. It's written in 1984 so it is dated. We were hoping for it to cover more about the social aspects of having a deaf sibling and less on the communication. If you watch kids, even hearing ones, they learn to communicate just fine regardless of their language."},{"Title":"I Have a Sister, My Sister is Deaf","review":"The second that my assistant teacher read the title a memory popped into my head. It reminded me of the time when I went to a ham shoot and I met a very nice lady who had been wearing hearing aids. Did you know she actually won a ham!This is one way that I didn't like this book. First of all, the only thing with the pictures is that they are black and white. I think this book will be better if the pictures were colored. Another is that this book is too short for me. This book only has about 25 pages and there aren't a lot of words on a page. If you are interested in action or comedy books then I wouldn't recommend this book to you. I would recommend this book for ages about 4-8.Now to tell the positive side of the book. I like how the author chose to write about deaf children because they have to be noticed just like everybody else. I also like how the author wrote about a deaf child because they are no less of a person than us. I liked how the author Jeanne made \\"the deaf one\\" play the piano because it shows that deaf children are no different. This book made me feel both happy and sad because for one this is a young child who has this disability and this book made me happy because she could still do the things we could do.This book takes place at 3 or 4 places that include school, home and in the backyard/outside.The way that I would describe the deaf sister is she has long black hair and is about the age of 5 years old. She can't speak right because she can't hear what she is saying. The other sister is the hearing sister. She has long black hair too. She is a little older than the deaf sister. She is about 8 or 9. This older sister is very caring for her other sister because she doesn't go play with her other friends, but plays with her instead. She doesn't pick on her or do anything mean to her, but is kind. I think that the deaf sister and the hearing sisters get along very well and probably like playing together to show that the girls both love each other. I'll tell you that I learned so much more about deaf children by reading this book."},{"Title":"I Have a Sister, My Sister is Deaf","review":"This book is about a lovely book. Most of the book is about the deaf sister. She has long black hair and is short. One other one is the hearing sister. She also has long black hair and she is tall. The hearing sister is very responsible. Also she is very kind. They both look as if they have an Asian background. This takes place in school, a field and at home. One of the events that happened was when the deaf sister started to play the piano. She started to feel the vibrations of the keys. She just wanted to sing while she played only if she can hear it.All of the drawings are very artistic. They are descriptive. All of the pictures are in black and white. I loved how this book was about a deaf child. Also it shows how a deaf child lives. One of the things I would change is that to make the characters have names. This book also reminded me of my cousin because the picture in the book looks like her. I would please ask you to buy this book. One last thing this book would be most appropriate for ages 4 to 6."},{"Title":"I Have a Sister, My Sister is Deaf","review":"This book is about the concept of living with a deaf, or hearing impaired, family member. Two Asian seeming sisters, with long, black hair are the main characters throughout the book. The older sister, seeming about ten years of age, cares for her deaf, five year old sister. The deaf sister must learn to listen to others through lip-reading and hand gestures. The mother of the two daughters is with them for some parts of the book, but the father is never mentioned.I liked how this book taught others that being deaf doesn't make someone weird, or a freak. I enjoyed the section of this story when the kids at school are very encouraging and supportive of their deaf sister, but I found the story slow and the pictures boring.I would recommend this book to kids ages 4-7, as it is a short picture book. I think it would probably be an effective way of teaching younger kids about people with disabilities. I can relate somewhat to this book, as I am about the age of the older sister, and go to school."},{"Title":"I Have a Sister, My Sister is Deaf","review":"This story is about a young deaf girl who is about 5 years old and who has an older sister who is around 12 years old. They both have long silky straight black hair. The best part of the book is that it had a lot of movement in the pictures. However, the pictures were black and white and some were shaded in. They had nice big backgrounds in the story too. I recommend this story for little kids between 6 and 8 years old. If you read this book you will find a lot of things you will like. This book reminds me of my great grandfather who is losing his hearing and it looks a lot like my house in the inside."},{"Title":"I Have a Sister, My Sister is Deaf","review":"This book that I've read has not attracted me. It has only earned a two star rating from me. The characters in this book are a deaf girl, her mother and the non-deaf girl. I will tell about the deaf girl. The little deaf girl has silky, long black hair. She is severely deaf in both ears. The girl (deaf one) is very special to her family and she is about 5 or 6. Now, I can tell you about the other girl. The girl has long silky hair, and obviously is not deaf. The little girl is very thoughtful to her deaf sister. And, the girl is a lot older than her sister, she is about 11 or 12. The children's mother appears to be Asian like her children. She also has black hair like her children. The mother has been also very helpful to her deaf daughter.This book takes place in many places, including an important place: their home. It also takes place playing on the monkey bars, in the grassy field, stalking deer and in the tree in their yard. Books that I know only take place in one place. That is the one thing I don't like about it, but I have many more reasons why I don't like it. In this book, the children don't even have names.In this book, I loved the illustrations. It was Asian culture but the black and white paintings look excellent with this type of book. That really caught my eye. If I had to recommend this book I would to children between the ages of 5-9, but I wouldn't recommend it if you're 10-14. It wouldn't be your type of book."},{"Title":"I Have a Sister, My Sister is Deaf","review":"This book, I Have A Sister, My Sister Is Deaf, is about a deaf girl. The deaf girl's sister is very supportive with her deafness. The deaf girl is about five years old and she has long black hair. The sister of the deaf girl is older and she also has black hair. She is about twelve and she is very caring. This book mostly takes place in the house, outside and at school. The illustrations weren't very descriptive and they were black and white.Some things I really liked about this book is that the deaf girl was treated fair. Another thing I liked about the book was that the deaf girl's sister was very supportive with her deafness. I wish my sister was as nice as her. One thing I didn't like about the book was that the story seems short but it is very long. Those are some things that will help you decide whether you should buy the book or not."},{"Title":"I Have a Sister, My Sister is Deaf","review":"I would not recommend this book. I like one thing out of a lot of things and that is I liked how the sister understood how her sister had a disability and didn't treat her strange. But on the other hand, I didn't like 3 things. I didn't like the pictures. They made no sense. Two, I think the two sisters should have had a name. Three, they should have had ages. I would not recommend this book if you like humor, action, mystery or all of them together. But, for people who like to learn about disabilities, this is a good book for you."},{"Title":"I Have a Sister, My Sister is Deaf","review":"I recommend this book for ages 4 and up. It's about a deaf girl, one girl who can hear, and their mom. The mom helps the deaf girl to read lips. The author's purpose for writing this book is for people to learn how hard it is to be deaf. The illustrations are in black and white and the picture tells you mostly what's happening. I wouldn't recommend this book that much, but for kids 4 and up it would be a good story."},{"Title":"I Have a Sister, My Sister is Deaf","review":"Well, Jeanne Whitehouse Peterson, I am ashamed. As the author of the book, I'd expect better. This book was two thumbs down. This book was about a girl, who had a deaf sister. It talked about her life, and there was no as you would say \\"problem\\", as in nothing bad happens, except for the fact that the girl is already deaf. The whole thing was basically placed at their home and at their school. Jeanne showed how it was like being deaf, and did a pretty bad job at it. The deaf girl would have gone to a school for the deaf, not a normal one, and she nearly perfectly spoke. It was wrong, all wrong!! I believe this story, if that's what you'd like to call it, is recommended for little kids, mostly three to seven. But, probably the part I hated the most was there was no comedy or action! All it spoke of was of sorrow.To add to the sadness, the story was black and white. Very good illustrations, but otherwise, the whole thing was bad. I also knew what a deaf person's life would be like, well almost. Either the author is oddly deaf, or she hasn't a clue what she is talking about! The book really had nothing towards my life, except for the fact that I have a sister. Overall, I wouldn't waste my money on this garbage. Like I said, toddler treasure, ten year-old torture."},{"Title":"I Have a Sister, My Sister is Deaf","review":"This book was about two sisters and one is deaf. The other sister tries to help her sister do normal every day things. I really didn't like this book because it was so slow. It was also very serious and it needed a lot more description. But I would recommend this book to kids ages 6-8. There were two main characters in the book. It didn't tell ages but I think one might be five and the other around 10. I think the theme of this book is that people are deaf and no different. These illustrations are kind of boring and they need a lot more color. This book took place at home and their school. This story really didn't remind me of any personal connections."},{"Title":"I Have a Sister, My Sister is Deaf","review":"This book takes place at two girls' house and at their school. One of the girls that can hear is older. The one that is deaf is only 5 years old. This book teaches kids to learn more about this great book and about deaf people. The pictures were in pencil. But were detailed. I like all the stuff about deaf people in it. I would change just one part when the 5 year old takes some pair of sun goggles off of her sister."},{"Title":"I Have a Sister, My Sister is Deaf","review":"I've read this book aloud to children ranging from 2nd to 5th grade, and with most of the classes it has stirred wonderful discussions. The book reads aloud beautifully, and encourages the children to think about what it would be like to be deaf. Some of them have 'full deaf' family members, and they shared their experiences in communicating with them. We often stopped during the reading to practice saying silently 'pajamas' and 'bananas,' to experiment with conveying emotions with our faces, and meaning with our eyes. The author writes about her sister, 'She is special. There are not many sisters like mine.' Well, there are not many books like this one. The writing would also make an excellent model for children to follow in writing about a family member or friend."},{"Title":"I Have a Sister, My Sister is Deaf","review":"I read the book called I Have A Sister, My Sister is Deaf by Jeanne Whitehouse Peterson. The main characters are 2 sisters. One of the sisters is deaf and there is an older sister who can hear. The author's purpose is that she's showing you how you're not very different from people who can hear. This book is about a deaf sister and an older sister that can communicate with their hands and expressions. The book's illustrations are black and white. The deaf sister can't hear colors.Here are some things that I really liked about the book: I liked how the deaf sister was special in her own way and how the deaf sister couldn't hear the thunder at night and the older sister did. Here are some things I didn't like about the book: I didn't like how the older sister wore the big sunglasses because they looked like clown's glasses. This book reminded me of my own life because my great granpa has a hearing aid."},{"Title":"I Have a Sister, My Sister is Deaf","review":"This book was okay. Some parts I liked. For example, I liked that the kids at school were nice to the deaf girl and didn't make fun of her because of the way she talked or the fact that she was deaf. One thing that I didn't like was that the sisters didn't have any names. This book reminds me of how my sister's friend is deaf. My sister treats her no different than how she treats her other friends. The book's illustrations are in black and white, but they are very well drawn. At least I think so. The book is about a girl and her sister that is deaf, and how they care for each other. I think the author wrote the book to teach children and adults how deaf people live their lives. Also, to show us how it feels to have someone close to you who is deaf. Finally, that people are no different."},{"Title":"I Have a Sister, My Sister is Deaf","review":"I read the book I Have A Sister, My Sister Is Deaf. I absolutely hated this book. It is about two sisters. The younger sister is deaf. The author shows how being deaf is no different than not being deaf. The older sister, who is not deaf, treats her sister like a regular person who isn't deaf. They play together very well.I didn't like this book because it lacked description and detail. I also didn't like this book because the pictures were dull and they had no color. I also didn't like how the author didn't give the characters names because I thought they should have names.The only thing I liked about the book was how it made me grateful to not have a disability. I would recommend this book for ages 3-6."},{"Title":"I Have a Sister, My Sister is Deaf","review":"I thought this book was terrible. First of all, I couldn't picture the girl. I couldn't tell who was the deaf girl because all the people looked the same. This story takes place at the girls house, also at school. The characters are the deaf girl who lives a different life than me. The next character is the deaf sister's sister. She is older than her sister and different but not by much. The final character is the mom who has to take care of the deaf sister and the other sister.The deaf sister is about 5 years old and she can do many things that I can do. She can run, jump, climb and go to school. She can't do many things I can do. She can't listen to the radio or the T.V. That doesn't make her a bad person or different.That is just a brief description of this book. I don't recommend it to anyone. I wouldn't recommend it because the pictures are horrible. Also because I don't like the theme. The author is telling you about a deaf girl's life. This doesn't remind me of my of my life at all. That is why I say don't buy this book."},{"Title":"Follow the Directions & Draw It All by Yourself!: 25 Easy, Reproducible Lessons That Guide Kids Step-by-Step to Draw Adorable Pictures & Learn the Important Skill of Following Directions","review":"I really love this book.

There are lots of drawings, including some fun seasonal & holiday-related options.I noticed my son's pre-K teacher uses it in her classroom.

Even some of my new age-y friends have trouble understanding when I describe sitting in a room full of white people wearing turbans, chanting in Sanskrit and waving their arms around for 90 minutes.

I kept reading...hoping upon hope that Shamdasani's words would hold me spellbound and captivated.I seek truth in its simplest form, but did not find it here. While I am certain that Shamdasani's intent was to provide the reader with an intelligent read, his need for intellectual diatribes created, in stead, an emotional abyss; I found that I could not connect with his analysis without great intensity of focus. Frankly, I didn't have either the time or the inclination to work that hard to grasp the connections.Had Shamdasani employed simplicity of thought and content as his guides, the average reader might actually benefit from his wisdom and intellect."},{"Title":"The Psychology of Kundalini Yoga : Notes of the Seminar Given in 1932 by C.G.

Her reward for strong reporting led to her publisher's mother-in-law demanding her exile across the I-70 corridor, Broken Yoke because she embarrassed the older woman who was seeing the Director of Humanity Haven.At about the same time that the mother in law of the \\"Pope\\" excommunicated Dani, Rafe D'Angelo has come home to Broken Yoke to provide a stable home for his five years old daughter Frannie. Rafe knows he has his work cut out for him as he only recently learned that his weekend tryst with Ellen led to a daughter; now Ellen demands Rafe take over raising their child. Besides needing to connect with his daughter, he also must make amends with his family especially his father after a dozen years away to help him provide loving stability to Fannie. However, as he struggles to connect, Rafe sees Dani, a woman he met when they worked, albeit her undercover, at the Native Sun Casino; he wanted her then and desires her even more now. However, he places Frannie first while she places a story she investigates ahead of their relationship as that should return her to Denver.The fully developed key characters make for a fine contemporary family drama with a solid romantic subplot. Rafe is a wonderful character who feels inadequate with his daughter, but thankful to his family for their help though he remains somewhat estranged from his dad. Dani is ambitious, but also finds herself in conflict with falling in love with the father and his accordion playing daughter while wanting to return to the big city journalism.

The author cleary describes the processes and tools needed to build stop motion armatures. What is disappointing is the quality of the book itself. I have a few books for which I have paid fifty dollars for (The Illusion of Life: Disney Animation, Ray Harryhausen: An Animated Life, Industrial Light and Magic: The Art of Special Effects) and I have never had buyers remorse. The same cannot be said here. The cover belies the interior quality. This book is approximately one quarter inch thick with poor quality paper stock which I can only describe as better than a childs coloring book. All of the photographs are black and white. Many are extremely grainy with contrast that is too high and resolution so poor that it is hard to see what is being described accurately (See figures 2-10, 3-4, 3-5, 3-10, 4-9, 4-10, 4-13 as examples). Not what I expected at this price point. The same information also applies to Stop-Motion Puppet Sculpting. I strongly suggest you either buy used or take what I have written into consideration before purchasing new."},{"Title":"Stop-Motion Armature Machining: A Construction Manual","review":"I was very reticent in purchasing this book after reading all of the reviews. It is true that the pictures are not the highest resolution, are in black and white and the total number of pages is few. However that doesn't negate what a wonderful resource this book is. This is the first book I have seen that goes into such depth in how to machine armatures from aluminum and steel. Other books gloss over this process. This text is focused solely on that process which is exactly what I was looking for. If you are looking for text that covers the whole scope of stop motion animation, this is not that book. However, if you are looking for further insight into this specialized process, this book is a great investment."},{"Title":"Stop-Motion Armature Machining: A Construction Manual","review":"This one-of-a-kind text is a wonderful primer on machining your own armatures.

Each page has one or two sentences with words that are easy to sound out or easy sight words. The pictures are actual photographs of what appears to be a five or six year old girl. There's also a parent page at the back which tells what words were used in the book and gives little phonic hints to help your child read those words. The story is about a girl who makes a mess with paints -- something all kids can relate to. My child loved the feeling of accomplishment at being able to read a real book. What fun."},{"Title":"I Like Mess (Real Kid Readers: Level 1)","review":"My six year old Kindergartener and I have read a few of the Real Kids Readers Level 1 books since she is starting to &#34;read&#34; site words, and decipher letter sounds through phonics. This book is the perfect mix of both methods for any beginning reader since the sentences are short, the words are simple, and there are a few harder to pronounce words mixed in (ex. makes). This is a short book with photos of real kids and a silly storyline - which seems to attract my small readers! Overall I like this since my daughter is very proud that she can READ a book at last!! We plan to get more soon."},{"Title":"I Like Mess (Real Kid Readers: Level 1)","review":"My 3 year old daughter loves this book and all the other level one books in the Real Kids Readers.

Nothing intrinsically wrong with it, but the story of a girl and her mess was just not for us.Level-wise it is a book with very simple sentences and vocabulary, suitable for some of the very earliest beginning readers. See below for a sample from the book so you can judge for yourself.I am Tess.I like mess.I like mess a lot.Oh, Yes!This is Jill.She is a pill.She says my messMakes her feel ill.Four Stars. [B-].

It carries the fragrance of the inner sanctuary, being written by one who was obviously acquainted with the glories of God's presence in the secret place.This warm-hearted Scotsman covers the subject in eight excellent chapters, which not only provide wonderful examples of prayer, and moving incentives for prayer, but also helpful instructions regarding prayer. The first chapter deals with &quot;The Life of Prayer,&quot; and particularly the arduous nature of prayer. This will encourage the one who feels weary in well-doing. Don't give up! Chapter two, on &quot;The Equipment,&quot; deals with the necessity of a quiet place, a quiet time, and a quiet heart, with special instruction on how to cultivate the latter (a. &quot;recognize our acceptance before God through the dying of the Lord Jesus;&quot; b. &quot;confess and receive the enabling grace of the Divine Spirit;&quot; and c. &quot;in the beginning of our supplications to direct our hearts toward the Holy Scriptures.&quot;) This chapter has much with which to feed the soul. The third chapter covers &quot;The Direction of the Mind&quot; with three helpful directives for your concentration: I. realize the presence of God; II. be honest (and real) in your dealings with God; and III. come in faith. Chapters four through six deal with three aspects of our engagement with God: worship, confession, and requests. Each chapter is rich and eloquent. And Chapters 7-8 cover the rewards of prayer: &quot;The Hidden Riches of the Secret Place&quot; and &quot;The Open Recompense.&quot;I have read this twice now and it is still worthy of another thorough reading - in fact, I've placed it on my &quot;Master Book List&quot; - a short list of books which I would like to master in my life-time. I'd highly recommend this to anyone who is serious about God."},{"Title":"The hidden life of prayer","review":"This was one of the best books I have read in my life.

In an era when the notion of patriotism gets batted about like a ping-pong ball, it's interesting to take a look back on how the actual face of treasonous activities rears its head. Walker provided the then Soviet Union with the most sensitive of Naval intelligence concerning U.S. nuclear submarine communications and deployment. Moreover, the strategic ad-vantage the U.S. enjoys with its ability to monitor the exact whereabouts of each sub in the Russian fleet was also compromised when they were given the secrets to our tracking methods. The leaks forced the U.S. to spend $100 million dollars to rebuild secure communications. The shrinking and aging of their fleet may have ultimately been the best counter to the Walker's actions or at least made them moot by now.So who was John Walker? How and why did he convince his friend, his brother and his own son to commit treason against their country? Why did his estranged wife turn him in and where did the security process fail in the first place?Jack Kneece, a former Associated Press reporter, attempted to answer these questions with usually fascinating (but at times frustrating) results.A story like this works best when we get under the skin of the main character - we want to know why he sold out his country. Kneece's approach to explaining Walker's behavior and influences are sometimes heavy-handed. For example, in describ-ing Walker's high school days as a movie usher he says: \\"The steady diet of movies fed his impressionable ego Johnny began to live in a dreamworld of heroic and daring accomplishments - the daring-do he saw on the silver screen\\"There is also a seemingly endless stream of tales relating Walker's penchant for practical jokes and drunken exploits. Some of these stories have attribution, others do not. And that's the problem; one doesn't know if one's getting second-hand braggadocio or revealing insight into a man's behavior.Aside from this, however, the book makes interesting reading when describing submarine life and the machinations of espionage and the difficult battle to stop it."},{"Title":"Family Treason: The Walker Spy Case","review":"If you're interested in espionage, you will be fascinated to read about the motivation and m.o. of the Walker family, and how investigations and interrogations were conducted at the height of the Cold War."},{"Title":"Cheiro's language of the hand: A complete practical work on the science of cheirognomy and cheiromancy containing the system and experience of Cheiro","review":"Includes photos of famous people who Cheiro worked for!

One is the author's first-hand account of the anarchist Makhnovist movement in the Ukraine shortly after World War I, which had to fight both the Red Army under Trotsky, and the reactionary White Army. The other part deals with the anti-authoritarian rebellion at the Kronstadt naval base, which was brutally crushed by Trotsky's soldiers. If one is interested in learning about anarchist resistance in the early days of Bolshevism, I would highly recommend this work, as well as The Makhnovist Movement, by Peter Arshinov; The Russian Anarchists, by Paul Avrich; and The Bolsheviks And Workers' Control, by Maurice Brinton."},{"Title":"The Unknown Revolution (Kronstadt 1921 / Ukraine 1918-21).","review":"Voline (Vsevoled Mikhailovich Eichenbaum)was born in 1882 and died in 1945. He wrote a protracted book titled THE UNKNOWN REVOLUTION based on sources and his personal experiences during the Russian Revolution(1917). Voline was clear that the actual revolution was established BEFORE the Bolsheviks such as Lenin (1870-1924) and Trotsky (1888-1940)ever arrvied in Russia. This book gives a clearer detailed treatment of these events.Voline argued that the sailors at the Russian naval station at Kronstadt were the actual revolutionaries by intimidating Czar Nicholus II (1894-1917)to abdicate in favor of the Kadets and Kerensky (1882-1970). Voline stated that the \\"Soviets\\" or enclaves of workers and farmers resisted efforts to continue \\"business as usual\\" especially by \\"keeping the peasants and workers in their place.\\" What these organized workers and peasants did not know was that their self proclaimed \\"saviors\\" Lenin, Trotsky, etc. were planning a more centralized authortarian regime. What should these determined \\"libertarian\\" men should have known was that the Bolsheviks were going to undermine the workers and peasants similar to what Father Gapon did during the 1905 Revolution when Russian troops massacred peaceful demonstrators which helped undermine Czar Nicholus'reputation.Voline carefully exposed how the Bolsheviks usurped their way to power and thwarted any spontaneous efforts at local government and actual politcal and economic progress. For example, the Bolsheviks reduced the number of men defending Kronstadt by pleading for these men to fight the Whites (the Russian supporters of the Czar and status-quo)which weakened the men at Kronstadt in an eventual showdown with the Bolsheviks. The Bolsheviks took control of the housing which the men at Kronstadt had repaired and made fit for living, and the Bolsheviks left the housing fall into ruin again. The Bolsheviks dictated that unless they (the Bolsheviks)were in charge of any changes, such changes were illegal and \\"counter revolutionary\\" For those who may sympathize with Trotsky, such sympathy is unwarranted. Trotsky ordered the attack on Kronstadt where the actual revolutionaries were located and ordered the massacre of all of those who survived the military assault. He announced prior to the assault on Kronstad that he would shoot the Kronstadt residents \\"like partridges.\\"The Bolsheviks feared the Soviets of workers and peasants because the latter operated independently of the Bolsheviks and had social and economic successes which the Bolsheviks could not match with their clumsy ineffective bureaucracy. Yet, the Bolsheviks had to carefully undermine these Soviets and avoid open confrontation until \\"the right time.\\" As an aside, Voline showed how unware Trotsky was in that he(Trotsky) could not define the term Soviet and only used it later when it suited his political vocabulary and agenda.Another bona fide revolutionary whom Voline showed respect was the Ukrainian revolutionary Menkho (d.1953). Menkho rose to the a position of leadeship during W.W. I when he organized armed reistence against the German invaders and their collaborator the Hetman. Voline was clear that it was Menkho and his men who actually stopped the White armies in Eastern Russia, and the Bolsheviks, who were defeated by the Whites, later claimed credit for what the Ukrainian leaders did. Lenin & co. then undermined the spontaneous movements in the Ukraine by turing the Kulaks against the peasants and later the peasants against the Kulaks when Stalin & co. moved against the Kulaks between 1928-1933.One of the problems with this book is its organization. Voline gives a detailed history of events from 1905-1917, and he gives credit to the men at the Kronstadt naval station for actually starting the revolution. Then Voline advances the book giving a detailed account of the dismal failures of Stalin's Five Year Plans for which managers were arrested and shot for collasal failures (1930s). Then Voline reverts to events in the Ukraine which occured before the mass murder of the Kulaks during the 1920s. Voline should have included the problems during the Stalin regime as the latter part of the book which would have helped improve its organization.One point that Voline made is that the purge trials, the Gulag concentration camps, the Lenin-Stalin Terror were not over ideology or political differences. Voline saw these purges, mass arrests, and concentration camp brutality as part of \\"palace revolutions\\" rather than any fundamental politcal changes.While this book is not well organized, it is still well worth reading. Voline separated the Anarchists and the Bolesheviks re organization and political ideas. Voline undermines the childish textbook view that the Russian or Bolshevik Revolution was an even flow of events but a bitter political contest among different political parties over who would or would not hold power. What Voline should have realized that a major reason for the failure of Czar Nicholus II's immediate successors is that they tried to keep Russia in W.W. I. Voline should also have realized that the Bolsheviks got support when the Americans., French, Czechs, Japanese, etc. landed troops on Russian soil. The Bolsheviks took advantage of citing \\"foreign oppressors\\" threatening Russia which helped unite the disparate political parties to the advantage of the Bolsheviks. Still, this book is recommended."},{"Title":"The Unknown Revolution (Kronstadt 1921 / Ukraine 1918-21).","review":"Despite the criticisms below (by the other reviewers)(the only one I agree with is that Voline's books is not organized that well, a bit anarchic, pardon the pun):) this book however is very readable, unlike many histories... It is well-rounded, and excellently argued. But by all means read other books on the subject too! There are excellent recommendations in the other reviews. But this one is probably the most readable and an incredible find that will open your eyes. A classic!the reader may have a hard time being sympathetic to the Bolsheviks after this, considering the anti-democratic authoritarian, oppressive, and even cruel acts of Trotsky and Lenin that one will learn in this book. One learns quite clearly that too many Marxists pin it only on the tail of the donkey by the name of Stalin, let it be known Lenin and Trotsky were also asses.....One learns in this book that there is hope. That there may be a real participatory democratic alternative that has been attempted and with short-lived but undeniable success. History will show you if you only look for it in the right places.When you're done with these heroes. Next go for the Spanish Civil War for more inspiration (start with The Spanish Anarchists: the Heroic Years, by Murray Bookchin and a whole new world of history will open up to you!Enjoy, be critical, and become conscious!!"},{"Title":"The Unknown Revolution (Kronstadt 1921 / Ukraine 1918-21).","review":"This is a landmark work as the first comprehensive account of the Russian Revolution from the perspective of an anarchist that lived through it. As such, it has inspired some impressive scholarship on the anarchist presence in the revolution.But the book itself is a royal mess-- it's sprawling, clumsy, belabored, tendentious, self-aggrandizing, and sparsely annotated.The first 170 pages of the work, comprising Book I, contain a ham-fisted 'synopsis' of Russian history leading up to the revolution, and should be skipped by anyone with an encyclopedia at hand.In Book II, Voline takes 250 pages to lay out the differences between Bolshevik and Anarchist revolutionary practice, and presents some interesting anecdotal accounts of the way Bolshevik repression was carried out against the Anarchists in the years after 1917. Voline makes the anarchist case against the Leninist model of revolution forcefully and convincingly, arguing for the importance of the free exchange of ideas, the initiative of the masses themselves, and the alignment of ends and means. His perspective on the corrupting nature of power is amply supported by his examples from the period. But his ideas are layed out in a highly repetitive and rambing manner, and his account of daily life under Bolshevik rule is so one-sided as to verge on absurdity. Also, his near silence on the extent of anarchist contributions to the revolutionary ferment of the period leads the reader to believe that though the anarchists may have been harshly persecuted once the Bolsheviks seized power, they had done precious little to challenge the Tsar's domination in the years before 1917.In the final Book, Voline presents the history of the sailor's rebellion against Bolsheviks on the fortress island of Kronstadt, and the Makhnovist peasant movement in the Ukraine, respectively. He amply supports the position that these were both genuinely revolutionary anarchist uprisings against the unaccountable power of the Bolsheviks, and not Bourgeois-controlled counter-revolutions, as the Bolshevik propaganda machine painted them. But again, for a 300 page account, Voline delivers suprisingly little historical substance.As a jumping off point for an anarchist critique of Leninism, this book is fundamental, but as readable history it is deeply flawed. Interested readers might do better to look into more modern histories, particularly the writings of Paul Avrich and Alexandre Skirda."},{"Title":"The Unknown Revolution (Kronstadt 1921 / Ukraine 1918-21).","review":"A reader should take under mind notes of Alexandre Skirda aboutVoline.Voline had been one of intellectualist if Makhno was the &quot;practical&quot; peasant revolutioner.Between them had been no sympathy.But not Voline led mass of peasants in revolution struggle to death , but just Makhno who could find trust of common people.In opinion of Voline-intellectualist-Makhno is &quot; an ignorant,uncultivated,uneducated fellow &quot;.Voline discredited Makhno as one with &quot; blind confidence in the peasantry, distrust of al the other classes of society;a certain contempt for intellectuals,even anrchist ones&quot;.Makhno practical revolutioner didn't trust opinions of Voline intellectualist at all.For this reason opinion of Voline about Makhno are partial and they can't be trustworthy.Nestor Makhno had accuse Voline of dishonesty.. as I think not without reason .Makhno &quot;simple&quot; &quot;muzhik&quot; knew instinctively&quot;complicated&quot; feelings of his fellow Voline-intellectualist full of jealosy ;and at the same time;admiration for someone who is full of genius in action and precise of thinking out of theorizing of intellectualist.Book of Voline can be a good information about historical events , but it is not true about personality of Nestor Makhno."},{"Title":"The Unknown Revolution (Kronstadt 1921 / Ukraine 1918-21).","review":"I read this a while back.

The first is the anthropology of language, namely the connection between languages and the phenomena of nationalism and national identity. The second field concerns nationalism and national identities in the Arab Middle East, especially the relationship between the Arabic language and national identity. This book embodies a rich effort to examine the works and ideas of prominent thinkers and scholars in the field of nationalism studies by examining its applicability in the case of the Arab nationalism. Moreover Sulieman uses a wide range of primary classical and modern sources, some of these sources have received only minor attention from scholars, despite their indicative content in studying Arab nationalism and the question of identity. Bu using these sources Suleiman shows how language has played an active role in shaping an Arab nationalism that had clear cultural character.The book studies also territorial nationalism in the Arab Middle East and how this relates to the language issue as a factor in the conceptualization of national identity. In particular the ideas of Greater Syrian, Egyptian nationalism and Lebanese nationalism."},{"Title":"The Arabic Language and National Identity: A Study in Ideology","review":"This was a gift for the Egyptian Dig student in the family, who wants to learn more.

As I have a large interest in theological readings ,I would read more work by same author."},{"Title":"Archetypal Heresy: Arianism through the Centuries","review":"This book is laudable in its coverage of the \\"original\\" 4th century Arianism, as well as its revival among British intellectuals in the 18th century, the most well-known being Isaac Newton. Readers interested in a thorough summary of the same substance/similar substance debate, as well as the subtle differences between an \\"Arian\\" and a \\"Socinian\\" will not be disappointed.The work bears a strong signature of Oxfordian \\"ivory tower\\" isolation, pronouncing Arianism dead and gone, when the impetus for publication of the book probably came from the immense interest in a resurgent Arian viewpoint. Arianism simply refuses to go away.The actual doctrine of the Trinity is a thorn in the side of modern Christianity because it is A)rather hard to grasp for those who spend their lives outside a seminary, B)not obviously supported by the New Testament narrative, C)smacks of Platonic philosophy and the \\"trinities\\" of pagan gods,and D)seems to have popped up during the Nicene period and is thus associated with many of the \\"errors of Constantine\\" and his interference in the early Christian church.With the \\"bloody bishops\\" gone, and the political pressure of adhering to a Trinitarian creed no longer as intense as it once was, a belief gap between clergy and laity may be widening. A number of \\"ordinary\\" Christians, quizzed on their beliefs vs. various articles defining and Arian dogma might say, of course Jesus Christ is a \\"secondary\\" divine being, created by the Father for the purpose of salvation, and of course the Holy Spirit is only the active force of the Father in the world and has no personality in and of itself.One might ask at this late date if an Arian or Trinitarian confession really matters to the continuance of the Christian community. It will be exciting to see if the \\"gatekeepers\\" one day simply scrap the Trinity concept due to lack of interest and Biblical support.Remember, just as our ancestors fought over the \\"one iota\\" of difference between the words \\"homoousia\\" and \\"homioousia\\", without the Trinity, a Trinitarian becomes an Arian!"},{"Title":"Urban Space And Representation","review":"This is a really useful text for students trying to get to grips with urban studies. The authors give a challenging but accessible introduction to the ways in which urban theory has met with literary and cultural studies. The book then covers a refreshing range of cities and texts (nice to see more than the usual New York, London, LA) and often the familiar cities (like Paris, New York) are made different through the subjects discussed - Brooklyn and Harlem rather than downtown Manhattan, Parisian banlieues rather than the city of light. The book has some unusual pieces - discussion of disability, essay on skycam technology - and places - Singapore and Birmingham (one extreme to another?). Though it's undeniably theoretical it stays user friendly and as a guide to the multiple meanings of representation in cities it wins out."},{"Title":"Drive","review":"I have already read this book three times and I find I get something new each time.

Because it's not really about basketball. It's about people, relationships, fears, and desires. And then, as I've already said, there's the words and syntax that just flow out of Roberge like it's so freakin easy.

Though the backdrop is an intriguing Gulf Coast basketball team, it's more about the struggles and irresistible urges that drive people to survive and connect. Coach Ben Thompson's voice drives the plot, but the pages turn because of Roberge's players who get under the reader's skin. Uncle Chicken, the Daddy Warbuck's symbol of all things corporate and disgusting is truly Robergian: creepy, sexy and weird. Bone, Money and Hedda are in turns dignified and defiant. As for the writing, Roberge's sentences sing. They're thoughtful and compelling from the snappy dialogue to tense scenes with Sean and Uncle Chicken.

In \\"Drive,\\" every movement and instant on the court is described with precision, rhythm and grace. But Drive is not just about basketball and while many of the scenes in this story take place around players and playing, this is actually a book that asks a lot of serious questions about human potential, talent, love, friendship, pain and loss. Roberge's Florida swampland is whimsical and Technicolor bright, his characters surreal and hilarious. The Late Night TV Fried Chicken Baron known for hawking his wares on in a \\"Hee Haw\\" suit is the sometimes avuncular, sometimes terrifying team owner; the beautiful topless housekeeper has a Ph.D in Post-Structuralist Feminism and a penchant for tying men to beds and leaving them stranded for hours, and the local homeless guy carries a sign that says \\"Safer than a Picnic in Zagreb than Urological Surgery at Sister's Hospital.\\" There's a playful goofiness in these slight distortions that's fun but unnerving- a sort of unpleasant truth about despair and the kind of restless hope that is profoundly human. Some passages in this book are disturbing because they reveal those experiences we all feel but rarely allow others to witness. Others are deeply moving because Roberge manages to articulate those glorious experiences the rest of us cannot describe in words."},{"Title":"Drive","review":"This book was fabulous and included everything one should: an engrossing story, colorful characters, a realistic setting, a likeable but [weak] hero, kinky sex (but not too much), forward energy, humor, and beautiful language.

One of the best books of the year. Great characters; killer dialogue--they should make it a movie."},{"Title":"The way of the storyteller","review":"The handful of other reviews here are not very substantial. I'm not an oral storyteller; I'm a writer looking for help with pitching stories. So my perspective on this book differs from other reviewers.First, the positives. Ms. Sawyer is a passionate and eloquent advocate of oral storytelling as an art form unto itself. She draws on a lifetime of experience and travel to argue that the art is worthy of an approach by practitioners that is reverent, rigorous, and passionate. She advocates that storytellers study subjects like music, voice, folklore and culture to deepen their art. There is also a fine selection of folk-tales that comprises the entire second half of the book.All of this is very good--but in my opinion amounts to little more than a pep-talk for librarians who want to tell stories to children. As proof of this I would cite that when Ms. Saywer revised the book in the Sixties she only added two chapters, one on children's literature and another on adding poetry (for children) to the story hour. Telling stories to children is a fine ambition--it's just not one this reader shares.However, there is plenty in the book that can be applied to other storytelling venues. But, as the author herself admits in the introduction, she has not written a practical manual on storytelling.So if, like me, you are looking for practical tips on ways to improve your storytelling (and not just deepen your appreciation for what storytelling can be) then you can safely skip this book."},{"Title":"The way of the storyteller","review":"Although Ruth Sawyer's quaint \\"The Way of the Storyteller\\" is more a book about verbal storytelling than it is about written storytelling, there is still much wisdom to be found in its pages.Sawyer's passion for stories shines through the pages and her rich experiences in interpreting the written word provide some useful guidance for authors. She explores the ancient roots of storytelling and shows how today's stories are inseparable from the patterns of the past.Sawyer talks of four invariables in story telling:ExperienceThe Building of BackgroundThe Power of the Creative ImaginationA Gift for SelectionExperience is what gives a story teller the ability to make the difficulties of her art seem simple; experience comes with writing and writing and writing until the techniques of the art are so ingrained they become invisible.The building of background is what enriches a story; the opportunity to gather a wide and varied background lies anywhere one looks.When an artist brings his creative imagination to bear on his material and - from something abstract, from something without form or meaning - transforms it into a real work of inspiration for others to enjoy, this then is the power of the creative imagination.Sawyer talks of a storyteller knowing which stories to select before entertaining her listeners. There must be an acceptance that some stories are not yours to tell, but belong to another who can tell them better. This gift of selection, too, can apply to writers: what suits one writer's voice may not suit another. And the gift lies in knowing which story suits your own writer's voice.Written in 1942, revised in 1962, what I found most poignant about Sawyer's recounting of the art of storytelling was her concern that novels - stories told in written form - have become marketable commodities and, as such, have become commonplace. On completing this book one cannot help but wonder if the current woes besetting the publishing industry have their roots in the fact that, for both author and publisher, profit is now placed above the ancient art of storytelling. If the novel is good enough, it will naturally sell as many copies as any author or publisher could ever want.The one thing I've taken away from this book is that - to be a true teller of stories worthy of all the story tellers who have come before us, from Homer to JK Rowling - the story itself is what matters most. What happens within its boundaries must be inevitable: every story must have an inner integrity and, to have a chance of being read and enjoyed many times over, it must leave the reader completely satisfied by a tale well-written.\\"Books are man's rational protest against the irrational, man's pitiful protest against the implacable, man's ideal against the word's real,... man's revelation of the God within him...if the first Prometheus brought fire from heaven in a fennel-stalk, the last will take it back - in a book.\\" (John Cowper Powys \\"The Enjoyment of Literature\\" as quoted by Ruth Sawyer in \\"The Way of The Storyteller\\")(Read September 2009; review posted here from my blog)\\""},{"Title":"The way of the storyteller","review":"The literature will help you see the big picture.

His books (most of which are collections of sermons preached in one of his two pastorates)are the most important in my library next to the Holy Scriptures themselves. For me to read him is to experience personal revival with each page. This collection of sermons from 2 Peter is not exception, however there are some marked differences to point out. He preached this series of sermons right after assuming the preaching duties at Westminster Chapel from Dr. Morgan. Morgan, who was a great devotional preacher and author, was not the analytical, verse by verse expositor that Dr. Lloyd-Jones was becoming. Lloyd-Jones knew this so to begin to ease the congregation in to his style he did this series in which he covers more verses per message (in his magesterial expositions of Ephesians & Romans he could spend weeks on a single word or phrase!)and also did not attempt to fully expound every verse.For this reason this book will serve as a great introduction to the Doctor for the newcomer, and for those familiar with his preaching it is an interesting & educational glimpse at his development as an expositor."},{"Title":"Expository Sermons on 2 Peter","review":"Not a commentary, but a good expository treatment of a very under-appreciated book of the bible. Not enough good companion books exist on this excellent but tiny book of holy scripture. Only other companions I use are the R.C.

Carson's Pillar commentary is good too.Here the good Dr Lloyd-Jones as always gives good biblical exegesis and I recommend this book wholeheartedly, it's worth every penny.I also recommend finding the excellent audio sermons on 1,2 Peter and Jude by R.C.

She begins to have sensual dreams of a bronze hunk who calls out to her to come to him. Hard physical exercise fails to eliminate the plea until she pinpoints it coming from a nearby cavern.As crazy as it seems to Lenore, she cannot help investigate the &quot;source.&quot; To her shock, she has either totally lost it and is hallucinating or she has found a gorgeous but wounded man inside the cave. Jonallo needs Lenore's help to survive. Beyond that she insists on assisting him when Jon tries to find his sister and save his planet. As Lenore and Jon become acquainted on two levels, they fall in love, but he comes from some place that is light years ahead of earth.WHISPERS IN THE WIND is an exciting futuristic romance that stars two intrepid, but hurting lead characters.

I have never wanted to throw a book away more. I thought it would be a wonderful futuristic romance but it never lived up to the cover.

The eight, held together by a psychic bond, had encountered a severe solar storm immediately following translation through a transitory window to the planet Earth. The storm had broken their concentration and scattered the Octet far beyond Jon's psychic reach. Only one small warm light glows in the darkness. Too injured to heal himself, his mind searches for aid. If only he can make the woman come to him.The dreams are back, a new one this time, yet another manifestation of her deepest desire, to have a child. Lenore had sought refuge from her mental exhaustion in a rustic cabin in the Canadian Rockies, to enjoy mindless pursuits, to escape three years of dreams about the child.....the child that need her help. That dream was gone, replaced by another.It was a deeply erotic dream, fulfilling a deep desire that she didn't even know she had. Warm, passionate, gloriously handsome...he teased her senses, bring her to the height of desire, then withdrawing from her. \\"Come to me\\", he called. Where? She must be going insane to think for even one moment that this was real. Yet the dreams come, like the other, even when she is awake.She is compelled to search a mountain cavern that she and her best friend had discovered as children. Empty, just as she knew it would be. She would spend the remainder of the night in it's shelter, before returning to her real home in the city. So much for escape from stress!Morning does not find her alone. A beautiful and badly injured man is sharing the cave, sharing her mind -- a stranger.....yet not. He is Jonallo, of Aazonia, a galactic law enforcement officer, leader of the Octet sent to apprehend a cosmic drug dealer, who had poisoned souls throughout the galaxy. The criminal had kidnapped Jon's twin sister over three years ago, taking with him the experimental telepathy enhancer she'd been developing. The enhancer allowed him to translate without an Octet, through smaller and less stable windows, making it easier for him to travel between Earth and Aazonia, to reap and distribute the botanicals used to formulate the addictive chemicals.Though she finds it all hard to swallow, there is something about Jonallo that makes it impossible to refuse him. She feels a deep connection. It is as if she's always known him, known of his kind. Connection is what Lenore has missed all her life, having been abandoned by her mother, left behind with a distant, unaffectionate father. Time is of the essence, the window they had traveled through would soon close, not to reopen for another decade. She would help him find his Octet.But then he would leave, wouldn't he, leaving her emptier than ever before?WHISPERS ON THE WIND is a story that makes you want to believe...in love, and in life on other worlds. The bond between Jonallo and Lenore is inspirational, as is their courage, honor, and their willingness to sacrifice their own happiness for the good of others. The well deserved happy ending will bring tears to the eyes.

I had read books by this author in the loveswept line and thought she was entertaining and charming. She doesn't know how to write this genre and I struggled to finish it - it just didn't improve. One major problem with the book is the narrative style where the author attempts to explain new technologies compared to present day while everything takes place 50 years in future. Some of the characters also constantly use cliched old-fashioned methods throughout the book like woodburning fires, cooking foods, driving vehicles, etc and comment on how much better life used to be when people did these things - what is the point of reading a futuristic book where everyone wishes they were in the past? If i wanted to read about people enjoying the past i would read a HISTORICAL book not a FUTURISTIC one. I can't think of a single instance the heroine enjoyed any technology she used in the book - when on her vacation she went to a primitive cabin and chopped wood and made the food sound awful. The ENTIRE book would have flowed a lot better if set in present day America without all the extraneous fake disasters and technologies that are poorly incorporated. There were also major problems with the paranormal aspects of the book - the descriptions were unbelievable and contradictory. There are so many minor characters in this book that you can barely shake a stick at them and you hope the villain will kill a bunch off just so they stop interferring with the storyline. Also the maternal urges and the child are sickeningly sacchrine. I would return this book if you haven't read it yet. If she was trying to set up a sequel to this book it didn't work I never want to read about any of the characters again and I resented the minor characters for making me learn a bunch of names and details that could have easily been combined into one person they were so flat and one dimensional.

This was one of those things for my mother. I think it's a pity this book is only priced around .01. To me, it is absolutely priceless. This book established many of the philosophies I have carried through my life from when I read it at age twelve--it is the single most influential book I read.Ruth Vaughn, a pastor's wife and a writer, put together this book for burgeoning Christian (or any Judeo-Christian faith) a series of instructional essays on what they will face in life and what choices they can make. My favorite essay is on the difference between being POPULAR and popular. It talks about the flashy, bubbly, high-school celebrity sort of POPULAR and how--if that has been God's gift or calling for you--how you should handle it. On the other hand, she talks about popular--the girl who is most reliable, the one that holds confidences and hands, and gives rides home, encourages the discouraged and how both have their place. It says that in both situations, your response to everyone should be \\"THERE you ARE!\\" in both your manners and demeanor. How many 12-year-old girls do you know who would benefit from that concept???Another essay of tremendous quality is on waiting until marriage. That's right--the big A word--abstinece. But what does it mean, abstinence? Does it mean \\"just wait until later\\" or can waiting--especially for the believer--mean something more? Ruth takes her own story and delivers a beautiful and flawless picture of her own experience, and includes some important examples of how your sexual decisions as a young woman can affect you.I wrote this review because it is a shame there isn't one already written. I lost my copy in college as it got passed around the dorm, with even the girl's boyfriends commenting on what a great book it is.

He cites Catch-22 by Joseph Heller as a case in point: &quot;If, right after World War II, someone had written a nonfiction book on the ambiguities of war and the atrocities committed by the supposed good guys...such a book would have been difficult to publish. But...artists can be sly. They can point to things that take you outside traditional thinking because you can get away with it in fiction.&quot;This makes me think of the movie Fahrenheit 9/11 and how remarkable it is that Michael Moore has broken through that wall to bring forth a nonfiction artistic statement about the current administration and war. I think Zinn would be pleased. Now if only someone would make some of the movies he suggests in this book (the story of Emma Goldman, the Ludlow Massacre, the Phillipine-American war to name a few)."},{"Title":"Artists in Times of War (Open Media Series)","review":"Dr. Zinn does a great job in this collection of essays letting a new generation understand that an untold section of American history involves, as Dr. King put it in his last speech, &quot;our right to protest for right.&quot; This manifesto which urges people to speak out on what's going on no also includes historial precedents of this in his discussion of stories Hollywood doesn't tell (It$ not hard to gue$$ why). But in either case, read this book and then FIGHT THE POWER!"},{"Title":"Artists in Times of War (Open Media Series)","review":"Where is our public debate about excesses of government? If the radical perspective in national affairs continues to be hidden, what then? Zinn deserves prizes and accolades for bringing the radical perspective to the fore in this book at this urgent time. Like sheep, our nation wanders, but nonetheless follows the well-oiled public relations machine of our American president who spins and grins his way into the projection of power that is his prime directive.Zinn provides a very different, critically important lens through which we might view life in these United States and our impact beyond our shores. He calls for the artist in each of us to be voice of those who are &quot;collateral damage,&quot; left behind or otherwise choose peace, while the genius-not at the helm chooses war.He speaks to the impact of the US rushing pell-mell into the maelstrom of a consumerism that transforms our nation-state into a market-state with increasingly more losers and fewer winners, and a state of public affairs and policy determined by a smaller and smaller group of corporate and business imperatives in a global Realpolitik.Zinn gives us a strong reminder of that separate, but critically important reality of everywoman and -man that is more arresting than the cable that brought W's plane to an abrupt stop on the carrier.Had enough?

An artist's role is to tell the truth as he or she sees it. True artistic endeavors are truth, whether music, painting, sculpture or writing - truth through emotion or satire. Artists show us the truth whether we can see it or not. Joseph Heller told the truth of war, even when war was still patriotic social obligation.

The text is clearly written and illustrated with numerous current examples. Unlike many other books on strategy, this one does an excellent job of integrating internal organizational issues with considerations of market competition. Most importantly for me, perhaps, is that the treatment of how strategy is actually carried out in large organizations rings true, giving me a high level of comfort with the relevance of the material.

We use this textbook in our Strategy course.My opinion is that this textbook is very valuable. I have ready it very carefully, and it has had a tremendous impact on the way that I approach strategic issues. However, the book is poorly organized and the writing is opaque at times. This means that the benefits of the book become apparent only after careful and repeated readings.The most important content of the book consists of the frameworks it provides. But these frameworks are not consistently labeled, numbered, or organized -- so the reader has to go to get great effort to pull them out and categorize them. Once found and understood, these frameworks are very valuable. I hope that future editions of the book will do a better job of explicitly enumerating and organizing these frameworks.In summary, if you are willing to put in the time to carefully read and digest this book, it is highly valuable. But a superficial reading will be of little benefit.As a final note, this textbook is much enhanced if it is read in conjunction with the many business school cases it references (such as EMI and CT scanners, or Disney and diversified acquisitions). The book itself provides only a few examples."},{"Title":"STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT","review":"This is a very accessible introduction to strategic management.

I was therefore not surprised that the book has the latest academic concepts, nor that there are many current examples drawn from high-tech and electronic commerce.

You can get a lot out of it by going through it once fairly superficially. But what I like is that I keep get more out of it when I go back to any chapter and read it more carefully. The authors have simplified but clearly a lot of thought has gone into each paragraph so that if you read it with care you pick up the nuances.The book balances consideration of factors internal to the firm (with a very nice treatment of what the authors call &quot;ARC&quot; - architecture, routines, and culture) and external factors.

However, the whole problem I had with it began in the first chapter, and five later, I'm simply disgusted. I'm an MBA student and along with classes in Import/Export and International Business Law, this is my last prior to graduation. In other words, this is the last of a multitude of texts I've read over the last six years of business study so I do have a clue. I also am graduate level in three languages other than English (and they are not my native tongue), so I'm well read overall...Anyway, I immediately noticed as did another reviewer here, that this material is comprised of basic business concepts, but the twist lies in the fact that every simple concept was made into something extraordinary through use of flowery language. I've felt that every simple aspect of business design, structure and operation is developed into some enormously complex &quot;concept&quot; and the more I read, the more I am insulted. The text takes very simple examples of what an overall operation within the world of business might be comprised, and makes them difficult to understand and boring. I read a chapter, awake, read it again and mumble &quot;so tell me something new...tell me something I don't know...&quot; If you cannot improve upon the wheel, why try to reinvent it? I'm really sorry guys, but this is a miserable work. Don't take it too personally. I'm sure that people who want to sit around smoking fat cigars and talking about business &quot;concepts&quot; will surely be impressed, but I am a student who wants real-world advice about running real businesses. This is fluff pure and simple and presents nothing new in management strategy aside from other ways to word simple ideas. Perhaps my education has been so progressive that this is all old hat and so, my problem...I think not. Better luck with the second edition.

I wish it was more quantatitive and analytical (microeconomic analysis of porter's 5 forces etc.).This is definitely a non-technical and conceptual orientation to business strategy. If you want to learn how to think of business strategy without getting involved too much with the analytical aspects of it, then this is a fine book.I felt the authors relied too much on examples for explanations. Instead of providing a concrete definitions, paradigms, and analysis, the authors often resorts to using only examples.What's missing is the manual on how to win in competitive zero sum game situations. It leaves out some key strategic principles such as concentration of forces, encirclement, divide-and-conquer, and feinting to gain victory. Instead, the authors espouse gaining competitive advantages (capabilities and positions) and finding ways to sustain them as a way to a sucessful business strategy.The book teaches you how to move chess pieces and positioning them where they might be advantageous, but it doesn't quite tell you the grand strategy of how to move all the pieces in conjunction with the strategic objective of killing the opposite King.

The only logic I can posit is that the authors were more interested in writing a scholarly text than a readable one. Although many concepts are made unnecessarily complicated, the biggest grip I had is with the writing style. The examples only loosely tie in with concepts, and flowery \\"professor-speak\\" obfuscates relatively easy concepts pointlessly. And in their effort to be PC, they'll switch pronoun gender from \\"he\\" to \\"she\\" or \\"him\\" to \\"her\\" multiple times, even in the same example. Just sloppy. But the text covers the basics, so it gets 2 stars."},{"Title":"STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT","review":"\\"Strategic Management\\" is an in depth study into the basic concepts of managerial strategy. Subject matter includes industry analysis and trending; strategic resource and core competency identification; and impacts on market share by changes in product offering. This is an excellent reference book for a business student to keep beyond classroom use or for a reader familiar with business topics. It provides straightforward explanations and insight into strategic planning for an organization. I am not certain what some may be seeking but this book is not Cliff's Notes on Management. This book does not afford you a \\"See Dick run\\" sentence structure so a mastery of \\"flowery\\" words is appropriate. In addition, for those impressed by their own education level, this book may be a bit basic. However, similar to some others, I am also well read, having a Bachelor's and Master's in Engineering, and an MBA; but I found the book to be quite worthwhile."},{"Title":"STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT","review":"This is a new textbook in the crowded field of business strategy texts. I had high hopes for a book authored by three excellent faculty members from Stanford's Graduate School of Business. The topic coverage is well targeted and includes such process issues as managing strategic change, aligning incentives, and the managers' roles in implementation. Unfortunately, most of the concepts derived from economics are illustrated with examples straight from an introductory undergraduate text in microeconomic principles. I would be embarrassed to use this book with my undergraduate strategy students or with my executive education seminars."},{"Title":"STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT","review":"In my case, I was looking for a good book on the subject in order to learn by myself, so I found this book. The result was totally disappointing, if you aren't taking a course based on this textbook I'd recommend to look anywhere else. The book and the software included are designed as a student's material for a formal class.The content of the book is really wordy and boring however, the cases are interesting and the learning center is an excellent resource for practicing. I think that the results you'll get from this book will depend completely on your teacher's skills to translate the concepts in a more simple way.I'd recommend &quot;Gaining and Sustaining Competitive Advantage&quot; by Jay B.

This author has an incredible wealth of knowledge about Asperger's, and has put the information together amazingly well. I have Asperger's, and so do at least 9 people in my family that I know of, including my son diagnosed at age 3. Most of us have gone on to achieve advanced degrees in our special interests, but none of us can hold an actual \\"job\\" due to lack of social skills, so we work for ourselves. Nothing was more horrible than junior high school and high school years for all of us. I went to school only about every other day, had tons of work to \\"make-up\\" and quit schools, and once was expelled. It wasn't an easy journey having AS.I agreed with everything that Mitzi Waltz said on this page, as well as in the entire book. She didn't write on page 298 that it was \\"fact\\" that there was a coorelation of ASD's to the immune system, but she used the word \\"perhaps\\" as she knew research was being conducted on the subject. Refer to the medical journal article that later came out in 2005 from the UC-Davis MIND institute finding a coorelation to the immune system for those with ASD's: [...]As far as immune systems go in my AS family, the AS/ADHD ones lived near 100 with no major health problems \\"perhaps\\" because they let their anxiety out through rages and tons of physical exercise (my father was always digging unnessary holes with a shovel in our yard or knocking out walls in our house and lived into his mid-90's). The quieter AS/ADD family members who didn't physically or verbally take out their extreme anxiety, I saw come down with illnesses like leukemia and reumatoid arthritis. Other health problems we suffer from are bulimia nervosa, locked jaw from teeth clenching, extreme hypertension, esophagus disorders, etc.This author put together a fabulous book, and I have book marks all through it, pursuing help for my Asperger/ADHD son and just a better understanding of so many things. Even though based in England, she has a wealth of knowledge of USA services. Out of dozens (more like 100s) of books on the topic of Asperger's, I still find it to be one of the most helpful books I have in my collection. So many other books are about the symptoms and the diagnosis, stories of those that have lived with ASD's (which are great \\"I'm not alone\\" therapy to read), but this book actually outlines real plans of action that I really appreciate. It includes information on assessments to request, how to approach IEPs, medications, support groups, and so much more. The index is huge.The interesting thing about living in a family of AS, is that some AS members are extremely quiet (like me and one of my brothers) and just want to be left alone, then there are the ADHD sensory seekers that just want to bug the hell out of you like my other brother and sister did, either physically or verabally. Extreme resentment of each other was a big problem, and no one really got along. The ADHD ones had the rages the most. I tried to run away several times from home as was tired of being beaten by my AS father and brother. I must have said a million times, \\"Stop IT!!!\\" \\"Leave me alone\\". Now I'm saying \\"Stop It\\" & \\"Leave Me Alone\\" to my own kid now who has similar behavior, and hits others (not learned as I've never hit him -- well, one slap after he nearly cut his sister's finger off with scissors was the exception). After time-outs didn't prove to be enough for him, we now also added in \\"Mommy time-outs\\" so I can go get 5 minutes of peace when needed, even if it's just from being annoyed to death with his monotone humming or owl hoots. My son respects and follows my time-outs too, to allow for my ears to stop ringing and for me to calm down as well.Being AS and raising an AS kid isn't easy (my husband \\"caretaker\\" talked me into kids as I had protested). I told him I had some genetic disorder in my family not knowing it was called Asperger's. At least there is help now for those with AS and it is now recognized. My daughter is neurotypical, but it's hard to teach her that there are going to be different rules for her than for him (ie, he can't sit at table with people for more than 3 minutes, but she can). She's also learning many of his behaviors, that I constantly have to teach her not to do. Plus they are hitting each other numerous times a day, and the time-out chairs are almost always in use when at home.This book is a great resource of information to help those who have family members or themselves with an ASD. We are about to embark on our pharmacology \\"merry-go-round\\" as she refers to it in book next, as various medications have helped tremendously within our family. We are also about to embark on first real IEP, after only having interim IEPs. He is going to be \\"mainstreamed\\" with an aide next year. For early intervention, my son was placed in a private facility - a reverse inclusion classroom, but all kids have some kind of disability, even though non-disabled were encouraged to enroll, but did not. So we ended up with 3 teachers and 3 students with various disabilities. But my son is happy, learning, and not as much a behavioral problem in this small setting as he is in a group of 20."},{"Title":"Autistic Spectrum Disorders: Understanding the Diagnosis and Getting Help","review":"Thank you to the writer of the response to \\"the author states opinion as fact\\".

The fact that Bettleheim was wrong about \\"refridgeratormothers\\" does not mean that there are no mothers of autism-spectrum children who haveautistic behaviors. The occurances of allergies and resultant sinus problems are certainly morecommon in persons on the autism-spectrum. And there are a number of medical conditionsthat have a genetic component that are commonly co-morbid with autism-spectrum disorders.None of these facts would actually imply that \\"being a parent of an autistic child willcompromise their health!\\" Parents are no more responsible for the specific genetic makeup oftheir children than they are responsible for whether a coin they toss turns up heads or tails. Infact, the genetic traits associated with autism are now believed to be also so stronglyassociated with extreme skill in science, mathematics, engineers, and related areas. Genetically speaking, people who are severely \\"classically\\" autistic are massively similar to those who aresciences \\"whizzes\\" (and, of course, both autism and strong science skills often occur inthe same people).Additionally, parents with autistic behaviors and traits are of great benefit to their aut-specchildren, as such parents have more ability to empathize with them. It certainly was/is true in my relationships with my parents!The above statements re family traits and co-morbidity can be confirmed by looking up a fewof the following (in order of ease of reading):Grandin, Temple 1995. _Thinking in Pictures_ (chapters 9 and 10).Silberman, Steve 2001. \\"The 'Geek Syndrome'.\\" _Wired Magazine_ December 2001.Delong and Dwyer, 1988. \\"Correlation of family history and specific autistic subgroups:Asperger's syndrome and bipolar affective disease.\\" _Journal of Autism and DevelopmentalDisorders_ 18: 593 - 600Smalley, McCracken, and Tanguay 1995. \\"Autism, affective disorder and social phobia.\\"_American Journal of Medical Genetics 60: 19 - 26_The Biology of the Autistic Syndromes_ by Christopher Gilberg and Mary Coleman (seesection III: \\"Diseases that Have a Subgroup of Patients With Autistic Symptoms.\\")"},{"Title":"Autistic Spectrum Disorders: Understanding the Diagnosis and Getting Help","review":"Pervasive Developmental Disorders : Finding a Diagnosis and Getting Help, is misleading, at best, lacking many multiple issues parent needs to consider.

Also, that parents of ASD children have a \\"slightly higher incidence of depression and other mental disorders..and health problems in general, perhaps related to an underlying immune system dysfunction.\\" THIS IS NOT A MEDICAL FACT AT ALL!

It was researched and written on the campus of the University of Edinburgh where he did his graduate work years ago. The essential thread of the book can be found on page 34 when he writes \\"the pervading purpose of our lives is to become involved in creative relationships to mediate grace to others.\\" In the next sentence he adds, \\"Communication of hope to individuals is the calling given to every Christian.\\" From there he goes on to discuss the teachings of Jesus and the incidents recorded in the book of Mark. In talking about faith, he notes \\"When we dare to pray for his vision and attempt it by his power, that's when the adventure begins\\" (p. 109). On leadership, he observes, \\"Every leader must learn how to implement his vision without threats of force, authoritarianism, or loss of livelihood\\" (p. 129). A segment of the book addresses the necessity of rest. Ogilvie says it is vital to productivity. He talks about the practical application these principles have had in the work of his church members in Los Angeles, California. Meeting with other believers is not meant to be a ritual, religious exercise. On the contrary, he says \\"The fellowship of God's people is meant to be therapeutic\\" (p. 204).

He tells you to use a transister radio and turn it down lower and lower until you can hear the radio at it's own level and this development will enhance telepathic ability.This book is a maater piece and was written for the everyday person to develop their own Psychic abilities, and as of the year 2004 there is incredible new research and university studies taking place on basic psychic phenomena that would suggest Mr. Dubin's easy to read ancient brain power and manifestation techniques aren't a bunch of hog wash.The basic point of this book is to give you &quot;TELECULT POWER&quot;, which it will and you will notice changes and be able to manifest anything you want in your life just like magic, but with the power of your mind and ability to use another world of energy that can make objectice reality perceptive and physical realities.I urge you to pick up this book if you want a one of the kind treasure, you should be so lucky to own such a complete occult classic such as this MASTERPIECE, I give it five stars and if Mr. Dubin ever reads this, I say to you sir, thank you for this book and your new one, Healing Foods of the bible, I have found your books to be well researched, referenced, and layed out in a very practical matter, thank you.- EVERYONE BUY THIS BOOK, IT IS TRULY STUNNING! -"},{"Title":"Telecult Power; The Amazing New Way to Psychic and Occult Wonders,","review":"there's a chapter in this book that i read. that said, these little people will help us. and i try it one time, and it seem to have worked but my book got misplaced. i think that i was onto somthing. but i can't be sure. i need that book back."},{"Title":"Telecult Power; The Amazing New Way to Psychic and Occult Wonders,","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

Of all the books, &quot;The Way of the Wolf&quot; and &quot;Return of the Wolf&quot; are my personal favorite books of all time.(But I might be biased, Martin is a personal friend of my mother--she was his typist on the first 2 books!)"},{"Title":"The Way of the Wolf: The Gospel in New Images","review":"This is the second time I have made multiple purchases of this book. Martin Bell has unique ways to express the Gospel, through poems, stories, music and more. I delight in sharing his insights with others who are searching for spiritual support in order to face today's focus on self. My two favorite stories are \\"Barrington Bunny\\" and the first appearance of the great silver wolf, and the description of God's \\"Rag-Tag Army.\\" Prepare to laugh and cry, and to sit for extended periods meditating on what you have just read."},{"Title":"The Way of the Wolf: The Gospel in New Images","review":"This book has been around for a long time and I find it an excellent read every time I pick it up. The stories help you see the gospel in ways that are not usually considered. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Way of the Wolf: The Gospel in New Images","review":"Each of the chapters in \\"The Way of the Wolf\\" is guaranteed to be a hot discussion with any group. It's difficult to say which is my favorite because they are all highly fascinating. It is a new way of looking at and relating to the Bible. I would rate this as an excellent tool in managing highly interesting material for your church discussion groups."},{"Title":"The Way of the Wolf: The Gospel in New Images","review":"This is my all time favorite. In teaching classes,I have used the stories in this book for both adults and children. Martin Bell is a master storyteller. The stories can be read by anyone, but they are especially good when linked to the Christian faith. I would highly recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Way of the Wolf: The Gospel in New Images","review":"A masterpiece. Bell retells the Gospel stories in simple yet profoundly power ways. I first read it twenty years ago and yet it still moves me each time i read it."},{"Title":"The Way of the Wolf: The Gospel in New Images","review":"I got this book at a Presbyterian church in the Seventies, probably through the youth group. After twenty-five years I still cry every single time I read 'Barrington Bunny'. As Barrington is turned away from others' Christmas festivities and family gatherings, I promise myself to remember that there's people out there at Christmas who have no one. \\"The only bunny in the forest...\\""},{"Title":"The Way of the Wolf: The Gospel in New Images","review":"I was read this story by my camp councelor at a church camp when a teen. 'Barrington Bunny' touched me so profoundly,that I cried for years whenever I thought about the story. Yet it taught me very valuable and useful lessons about life,people, love and sacrifice. 'Barrington' is an excellent,bittersweet story to teach any young person or adult about the meaning of TRUE love and they'll never,ever, forget it."},{"Title":"The Way of the Wolf: The Gospel in New Images","review":"Barrington Bunny's story still brings me to tears everytime I read it. It left such an indent on my soul. Bell truly fits the Zuni proverb, There are no truths - just stories. Truly, Spirit's love lies within these tales."},{"Title":"The Way of the Wolf: The Gospel in New Images","review":"A marvelous collection of parables. &quot;Barringtion Bunny&quot;, a Christmas story, is great with senior high church groups for reflection. This is the best known story in the book. &quot;What the Wind Told Thajur&quot; is a story of spiritual enlightenment with universal values. &quot;Wood and Nails and Easter Eggs&quot; is an Easter parable. It is the best fictional Easter story I know."},{"Title":"The Way of the Wolf: The Gospel in New Images","review":"This book contains some very thought provoking stories. I read Barrington Bunny to my grandchildren at Christmas and soon the adults come to listen. If we could all live our lives like Barrington what a wonderful world we would be in. I have bought this book for many of my friends because I think getting the message out is what we all need to do."},{"Title":"The Way of the Wolf: The Gospel in New Images","review":"I found this book interesting yet somehow dated. The tone reflects the disenchantment or sensitivity of the 60's. This short volume is filled with poetry, music, allegory, and parables. Perusing the current offerings of religious writings in my favorite bookstore, this book may get lost among the more straightforward, textural approaches of current spiritual content. I think I would have liked it better if I had read it in the 70's."},{"Title":"The Way of the Wolf: The Gospel in New Images","review":"I first read this book in the 70's and it certainly reflects the Christianity of the 70's. It is clever but when Bell is on it has a surprising depth. I recommend it because through his stories and poems, Bell will challenge your faith while reassuring you that pain and doubt come with the territory."},{"Title":"The Way of the Wolf: The Gospel in New Images","review":"I bought this book after hearing Barrington Bunny on the radio one Christmas years ago (this is a replacement copy for the one I loaned out that never found its way back). I think this book will appeal to anyone who is drawn to Christian mysticism and enjoys stories. The book does not preach &#8211; instead Martin Bell's stories reach past the intellect to directly touch the heart."},{"Title":"The Way of the Wolf: The Gospel in New Images","review":"If you have young children, the book WAY OF THE WOLF, is an excellent book to read, tell, discuss with them. My favorite story is Barrington Bunny in this book. I have used this with numerous children. I have found it a lovely book to give to parents or children starting school. I was very happy to find it at Amazon because I had forgotten where I found it at."},{"Title":"The Way of the Wolf: The Gospel in New Images","review":"This book is a great memory. I originally heard the cassette version of this book 30+ years ago. I'm glad to have the original now so I can share it with my children."},{"Title":"The Way of the Wolf: The Gospel in New Images","review":"The book arrived just as promised. The book was a gift so I can not say if the book is a good read but I heard it is very good. I would order from the seller again!"},{"Title":"Martin Yan's Invitation to Chinese Cooking","review":"Wonderful book lots of great receipts to try. Loved Yan on TV and his books are just as much fun as he is."},{"Title":"Martin Yan's Invitation to Chinese Cooking","review":"This book was recommended by a friend. I have not had good luck with Chinese Cooking but this book along with Yan's 'Chinese Cooking for Dummies' has really helped."},{"Title":"Martin Yan's Invitation to Chinese Cooking","review":"I have over 200 cookbooks, and at least 40 of them are Asian, but this is my favorite Asian cookbook. The recipes for the Duck Salad with Seasonal Fruit, and the Spicy Spinach Salad are worth the price of this book alone. This is my favorite Martin Yan cookbook."},{"Title":"Martin Yan's Invitation to Chinese Cooking","review":"this book has lots of super delicious recipes, and their easy to follow too. 1 of my fave recipe books 2 thumbs up! :O)"},{"Title":"Martin Yan's Invitation to Chinese Cooking","review":"This is one of my most used, most favorite cookbooks and believe me, I have a lot of cookbooks. I love this book b/c every recipe tastes great! I love the pictures, the text, everything! Do yourself a favor and buy this book. Just the soup recipes alone are worth the price but really, every recipe I have ever tried is great!"},{"Title":"Silent Journey : Life Within a Deaf Family","review":"Silent Journey is a delightful look at the challenges of living with deafness throughout the 1900's. My heart broke with every story of discrimmination they faced, and rejoiced each time they overcame another obstacle. I couldn't put this one down and finished it in 2 days!"},{"Title":"Silent Journey : Life Within a Deaf Family","review":"In times where family values are often questioned, this story demonstrates that a strong family can overcome any challenge.It was amazing to read; the different struggles of two deaf parents raising 3 &quot;hearing&quot; kids and the creativity they used to overcome typical family problems.This book will really hit home, a must read for every family member!!Bravo!"},{"Title":"Crescendo","review":"From the back cover:\\"Ellen Farrell screamed as she raced her little car down the highway -it felt terrific to let off all that steam! Then she noticed she had company: an utterly gorgeous driver was keeping pace with her, and giving her the most devastating smile she'd ever seen! Conductor Armand Dante was no ordinary pick-up: he was dazzling -and the romantic hero of Ellen's secret dreams. When he sent her flowers on her nightshifts at the hospital and embraced her as the sun rose over the Potomac, she just had to fall in love. But could she cope with society column gossip and the hordes of adoring fans who wanted to share the man she'd chosen for her own?\\"It had promise, but I didn't much like this one. I thought the conflict was a bit contrived, being mostly that Ellen feared being in the public eye. It was simply not too interesting."},{"Title":"The Law and Martial Arts (Literary Links to the Orient)","review":"I found this book enjoyable and informative, but I felt it lacked a lot of what I really expected from it. It covered in detail as best as it could some topics of question such as state laws and general self defense legality issues. But, I found that it lacked substance when referring to the main question on any martial artist's mind...WHAT CAN I LEGALLY DO TO DEFEND MYSELF? I found that the book seemed to focus more on what would happen to someone who was attacked by a martial artist, than what would happen if someone was hurt while the martial artist was defending himself / herself. Most of the court cases involved someone with prior martial arts experience that had committed a crime. All and all it was an okay read, but I felt it hazed over a lot of the questions and important detail a martial artist should be concerned about. Things like the consequences of disarming an attacker and then retaliating with the weapon, or the ever popular question on the mandatory registration of black belts as deadly weapons,that is so often spoke of. All in all I would say it is not a must have, but a step in the right direction for legal education for martial artist."},{"Title":"The Law and Martial Arts (Literary Links to the Orient)","review":"Mr. Brown clearly knows his Judo and martial arts history, but the book lacked the substantive legal analysis I was expecting. Like any good attorney, when you don't have the law you argue policy, and that is what this book is, mostly. There isn't much law on point, but Mr. Brown does an excellent job addressing some policy issues any martial artist/instructor should be thinking about.It makes sense that he is a professional editorialist. His writing reflects strong opinion and interesting viewpoints, which the reader must ultimately discern for herself.The writing is not at all what I expected, but it serves its purpose well. I had expected more hard, technical writing. Mr. Brown has a wimsical tone, similar to a radio host's, that suits the book's subject matter fine. The minimal primary sources and average scholarly writing was a tad disappointing for me personally, but it makes his book accessible, which is just what this information should be for fellow martial artists. Mr. Brown has done the MA community a service by making this important contribution. If you want to discuss potential legal issues with your students, and you should, Mr. Brown's book is a good starting point."},{"Title":"The Law and Martial Arts (Literary Links to the Orient)","review":"This book contains information that every martial artist should know. You do have to dig a little to find out basically what you can and can't do to defend yourself, and I would have liked to see it organized a little better and have presented the information a little more straight forward. It still leaves the reader a little fuzzy concerning what he can and cannot do as far as self-defense goes.I would have found it more useful if it just spelled things out for the reader. For example if you are attacked by a armed mugger, you can do A, B, and C, but not D and E. But our laws to too hazy to make things that clear I guess. I found the last chapter to be the most useful. This is good information to know, but don't let it get in the way of doing whatever you need to do to defend yourself or your loved ones in an actual self-defense situation.Bohdi Sanders, author of Warrior Wisdom: Ageless Wisdom for the Modern Warrior"},{"Title":"The Law and Martial Arts (Literary Links to the Orient)","review":"Like the title suggests this book is about the law as it pertains to the martial artist. The author does a fine a job covering issues like assault and battery, duty to retreat, weapons, and more. In short this is a very good starting point, however this book needs updating because since it was written state laws regarding martial arts weapons have changed and we now have what it is known as \\"castle doctrine\\" which this book doesn't address. I would recommend this book and one of the good know your rights videos and/or books to start out with. As a basic guide and a starting point this book is great but incomplete given current legal developments, it is one of those cases where the devil is in the details."},{"Title":"The Law and Martial Arts (Literary Links to the Orient)","review":"If you are a person who trains in the martial arts you need to read this book. Did you know kicking someone with a shoe on is an attack with a deadly weapon? That is why Billy Jack took his shoes off.This book can drag a bit but will give you good info to help in understanding the law so you dont go to jail."},{"Title":"The Law and Martial Arts (Literary Links to the Orient)","review":"For the most part, I was very disappointed and this was not what I was hoping for. I was hoping for examples and thoughts on the law for martial arts when used in self-defense situations. Brown did not really present any of these cases, which either leads me to believe (1) the true martial artists that practice their skills strictly for self-defense do not or have not had law suits against them (criminally or civilly) and/or (2) true martial artists do not get into alterations. Many of the cases Brown presents in the book are very old. Some of the cases are absurd. He cites cases where a person who has practiced martial arts was involved - and the crime was usually one they initiated (such as robbery or rape). First off, I would not consider any of these people martial artists, since they are not using their skills in the way it was intended. These are just people who happen to know techniques taught in martial arts, so I disagreed wholeheartedly with his using those examples and citing those persons as martial artists. Brown does cite some relevant cases, but then does not tell the outcome of those cases. I also did not understand his point on Ninjas at all. He explains how Ninjas were trained assassins and are trained to kill and then goes on to state if called or act like a Ninja this can be used against you in trial. Seems common sense to me that if you act and dress the part of an assassin that you may be called that in a trial (and probably should be expected to). I was also disappointed on his section of the law in states and martial arts weapons. Seems it was taken verbatim out of the law books with all the legalese language. Would have been nice if tit was written so a layman could understand easily. Brown does present and provide some good examples on what is considered excessive force. Brown also does ask some interesting questions and brings up some interesting thoughts such as should a martial artists announce to an attacker they are trained so the attacker is aware and understands what he is getting into. He also believes that someday martial artists may be considered deadly weapons. He does believe that martial arts training can and will be brought out in trial, but that belt rank should be of consideration, which is a valid point in my book. I might recommend this book to someone totally uninformed and ignorant; and for that reason alone have rated it two stars and not one."},{"Title":"The Law and Martial Arts (Literary Links to the Orient)","review":"For anyone who practices martial arts, this book is a real eye-opener. If you ever wondered about what you can and can't legally do with your skills, this book will answer most of your questions. This is information all instructors should make their students aware of."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner the Low-Carb Way: Healthy Menus, Recipes, and the Shopping Lists That Will Keep the Whole Family at the Dinner Table","review":"I think this is the best investment I have ever madeLeanne's cook book is not just saving my dinner butwe can have leftovers for lunch and I don't have tothink about menus or make a shopping list with 2 smallchildren helping.
