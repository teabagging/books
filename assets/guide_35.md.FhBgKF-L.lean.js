Priced right,too!"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Mark Twain is one of my all time favorite writers. He knew how to tell compelling stories and he had a clever wit. Tom Sawyer is a fun tale based on some of the experiences of his childhood in Hannibal, Missouri. Twain always had keen insights into human nature. He related a story where Tom had to paint a fence on the orders of Aunt Polly. At first, the kids in the neighborhood ridiculed him for having to work. Tom turned the tables by making it seem like he was really having fun. He got several of the kids to paint the fence and pay him with goods in exchange for the \\"privilege\\" of painting the fence.The book is much more light-hearted than the social commentary of Huckleberry Finn. There are stories of Tom wooing new girl Becky Thatcher. There are stories of Tom getting in trouble with the draconian schoolmaster. Tom disrupts Sunday School proceedings and church services with his shenanigans. Tom, Joe Harper, and Huck Finn are superstitious and adventurous. They went on an excursion on a nearby island and had the whole community thinking that the boys had died. There was the drama of the boys catching Injun Joe with buried treasure. Becky and Tom got lost in a cave and this was a tense moment in the story. In the end, Becky and Tom were saved, the treasure was found, and Injun Joe was killed.The story was light and humorous at times. The story was tense and dramatic in spots. Overall, this is a literary masterpiece of the highest order. I read this book over and over again as a kid. It was my favorite book growing up. Twain's depiction of a childhood in Missouri was that it was full of action, adventure, some of the angst of growing up, and many carefree moments of pre-adolescence."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I'm not sure that one should rate such a great piece of literature as Mark Twain's Tom Sawyer, for it is truly all-time classics.

He's in love with this young girl named Becky Thatcher. He teaches her how to draw. Tom and his friends Huckleberry Finn and Joe Harper discovered a secret island. They go off onto that island to live like pirates. Tom saw Injun Joe, a killer hide a treasure on the island and the only clue was a number 2. They were presumed dead until they came back just in time to attend their own funerals. They were caught and punished for their actions.I recommend this book for other readers that are my age because this book teaches you that it is bad to lie. Tom Sawyer lied a lot. Hs stole jam from his Aunt in the beginning of the story. He had to lie to his aunt to get away and get to their secret island to be like pirates.My favorite part of the story was when Tom, Huckleberry Finn, and Joe Harper went off to their secret island and live like pirates. Nobody was with them and except themselves. It was funny how they came back on there own funerals. Tom's aunt got so mad at him for running away from home. This is a great book to read."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This book - along with its sequel, The Adventure of Huckleberry Finn - are treasure of American literature, and have added immeasurably to the lexicon of popular fiction. You can see in this book the incredibly wide influence it permeated: countless images that are prevalent in it are now commonplace not only in literature but also in television - and, indeed, everywhere. So much so that, if you are just now reading this story, you may find it hackneyed and cliched. And it certainly can seem that way... but what you have to realize is that this is the book where those very cliches were CREATED. The book is simply that influential. It's a timeless, universal tale. Although it may have been reading mainly for children, it can - and should - definitely be enjoyed by everybody. The imagination in the writing and the sheer adventure and narrative drive of the story will fascinate children of all ages, and may very well spark an early love of reading in their lives. There is a reason why Tom Sawyer is one of the most widely prevalent works of literature among young children. However, the book exists on a whole other level. The character of Tom Sawyer symbolizes the child in us all - what we once were, or what we'd like to be - again, perhaps - and the innocence that we have all so irretriably lost. The book also has, as is always the case with Twain, a masterful wit prevalent in the writing. Keen observations on society and human nature - not to mention the none-too-subtle comments on religion and superstition that are in this book, and rarely noted (the book is quite a good satire of religion in its own way - completely different from the way Twain later did it in works like Letters From The Earth) - and contains many bits of wit and interlaced commentary that will surely be lost on younger readers, but which older and more perceptive readers will enjoy immensely. The book exists, and is excellent, on many different levels. This is truly an American classic, and an essential read."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Tom Sawyer was just a normal, old-fashioned boy. He hated school, yet he loved to play hooky. He was disciplined, but he broke the rules. Tricks and prans are what this boy was all about. Misbehaving, yet loving, Tom loved adventure. In theis book, his adventures are told and his thoughts unveiled. It's all about school and hooky, pranks and punishments, rules and regulations, villains and desperate adventure, all seen through the eyes of a young and lonely boy.This book is underestimated for its powers to put the reader in a state of fantasy. For me, it broke the rules of this world and exposed the boundaries of imagination. I obviously loved the way Mark Twain set up this story of this young boy and his attitude towards life. It gave me a different perspective on the world, and I now have an opinionated mind on what happens in this world today. Tom represents the inner child that everyone holds within themselves. However, he is free and lives the dreams we all wish we could.Though there are many \\"Kodak moments\\" in this book, there is one part that really captured my mind. When Tom fell in love with the new girl, Becky Thatcher, it just seemed like a spark of puppy love and nothing more. But, when he asked her about getting engaged, I just hit the floor laughing. It was so preposterous that I really didn't know how else to react besides laughing my head off. This bit just showed me how imaginative Mark Twain could really be. It's not everyday a boy and girl at that young age would get engaged!"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Have you ever done any dangerous adventures with any of your friends? Well here's a chance to give you a hint how Tom and Huck pass their day inventing their crazy adventures. The Adventures of Tom Sawyer was a great book because I liked the way it went, it wasn't slow at all and it was a book that was filled with actions and scary parts. Tom and Huck are two guys that live in this place with a similar look like a forest. It was a place were Tom and Huck Finn were free to make any of their dangerous adventures. I think that Huck did a great job by living alone near the graveyard. A great part is when Tom and Huck play \\"Marbles\\" and \\"Ring taw\\" with all of his other friends. Some days Tom ate supper and Huck came by him for dig hole in the bar and find turtle eggs. Tom loved to practice his clever art painting fences, indulging with magic.Tom loved to stay with his older friens Huck, so one day they decided to have a camping and Tom aunt Polly and his mother looked for hi day and night. This kids were full of adventures. An adventure that they loved to do was visit the grave yard which that is on ething I wouldn't do in real life. Tom loved to organized escapes from his over bearing aunt Polly. Even if Tom was at a Fire at a family meeting at a murder or at a reassure hunt he still needed to organize an escape to hook up to Huck. The part when Huck was under the river bridge with Tom and camouflage with mud all over their body and also when Tom falls with Becky in to the bridge.The chapter that I liked the most were chapter one because it tells how Tom is before and after he meets his dearing friend Huck, another chapter that I really like was when Tom first meets Becky on his first day of school. Toms first day of school was a tragedy because for Tom wakind up was so hard thinking of his day and thinking that it is just the first day. Well adventures could happen but fun adventures are hard to do."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I have enjoyed reading this book very much.

It is an energetic tale of a mischievious boy, based on Twain's own youth, with some fictional items thrown in. The story follows Tom Sawyer as he goes from antagonizing his Aunt Polly, to searching for treasure, from conning his peers, tohanging out with his best friend Huckleberry Finn. His life changes dramaticaly though when he and Huck witness the brutal murder of a man by a notorious lawbreaker. The lawbreaker, an Indian named Joe, blames the murder on the town drunk, Muff Potter. Can Tom go against his oath with Huck to stay quiet, and proves Muff's innocence? Or will he keep quiet and send Muff to his death, just to safe himself from the murderous Injun Joe? You will have to read the book to find out!In my opinion, this is one of the greatest books ever written. Mark Twain has a way of describing the intricacies of childhood behavior so that kids know what he is saying, and also at the same time, he can describe the same in an adult, refined, manner so that grown ups can fully comprehend what is going on. If you have not read this book yet, you are truly missing out on a well written classic. This novel has been read for over 100 years, and I believe that it shall be read for another 100 years."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain. The town where Tom lives is Hannibal which is on the banks of the Mississippi river.Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn are the main characters in this story.something that Tom and Huck see in the graveyard which gives them lots of problems.I thought the the book was ok but it lacked seriousness and i gave it one and a half thumbs up"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"There seems to me to be an exorbitant number of reviewers who reject this book simply because they find it childish. To quote Mr. Twain from another of his works, &quot;It seems to me that it was far from right for [these critics] to deliver opinions on [Twain's] literature without having read some of it. It would have been much more decorous to keep silent and let persons talk who have read [Twain].&quot; While this excerpt was originally aimed at the critics of James Fennimore Cooper, I find that Twain has been rejected with an equal lack of judiciousness.Perhaps these wayward critics were just too excited to enter the narrative, or perhaps the first few pages of their copy were absent, or perhaps they find solace in embarrassment, but there is a Preface to Tom Sawyer that explicitly states that the novel was written with the sole intention of a youthful audience in mind--and if adults found pleasure in it, so be it. Apparently some people find it necessary to disregard this caution in an attempt to simply find fault wherever possible. I suppose that's acceptable; it's the human way.But for those of us who decide to take the time and read Tom Sawyer, we discover a story that--while not as merely limited to a younger demographic as Twain accuses--is indeed a simple recounting of one particular boy's youthful adventures. Of course this book doesn't involve the critical satire of some of Twain's other books, but can you really denounce a novel purely by an aspect void from its original intent?Tom Sawyer is simple. It's the adventures in a boy's life. It's fun. If Mark Twain had any inclination of a motive directed toward a more mature audience, it was primarily an escape to lost youth, lost innocence--or, inversely--the lost, unwitting wickedness that consumes the mischief of the young trickster. It is merely a series of adventures--that is to say, as adventurous as a small-town boy's life can be, and trust me you'll be surprised.For those of you not heeding the caution of the preface and pursuing the novel without restraint, there's no wonder you might feel a mite disappointed. Moreover, begin this novel without a hint of whimsy, joviality, regret of maturity, and humor, and you'll no doubt chastise Twain for a worthless piece of literature. The veritable goldmine that lies within this tale isn't its structural beauty, or its thought provoking plot, or--by a long shot--its intelligent characters; what makes this story a classic is the undeniable fun, the escape to bygone days of irresponsible madness, the return to youth that we are all driven further from with every passing second.In short, Tom Sawyer is what it appears to be, nothing more, nothing less, fun and youth personified in 200 pages of delightful and improbable adventures. Don't be too critical on a work that goes well beyond its meager intentions by accusing it of substandard plot and little moral value, because what prepubescent life has a ubiquitous and mind-blowing plot? What prepubescent life form ever cared about morals, following them, expounding them, or learning them? Perhaps the depth of Twain's novel is all in the challenge to the reader: Are you willing enough to let yourself de-mature from where you are now? Do you have the courage enough? Or does youth frighten you? For those readers hesitating at these questions, it is to you that I recommend this book with even more vehemence: this book may be your salvation from miserly apathy."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I love this bookYou should really get this bookLoveLoveLoveLoveLoveLoveLoveLoveThisBook"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I read The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn long before reading Tom Sawyer, something I probably should have done in reverse.

In addition, Tom Sawyer is one of the most endearing characters in American fiction. This wonderful book deals with all the challenges that any young person faces, and resolves them in exciting and unusual ways.Like many young people, Tom would rather be having fun than going to school and church. This desire to enjoy life is always getting him into trouble, from which he finds unusual and imaginative solutions. One of the great scenes in this book has Tom persuading his friends to help him whitewash a fence by making them think that nothing could be finer than doing his punishment for playing hooky from school. When I first read this story, it opened up my mind to the potential power of persuasion.Tom also is given up for dead and has the unusual experience of watching his own funeral and hearing what people really thought of him. That's something we all should be able to do. By imagining what people will say at our funeral, we can help establish the purpose of our own lives. Mark Twain has given us a powerful tool for self-examination in this wonderful sequence.Tom and Huck Finn also witness a murder, and have to decide how to handle the fact that they were not supposed to be there and their fear of retribution from the murderer, Injun Joe.Girls are a part of Tom's life, and Becky Thatcher and he have a remarkable adventure in a cave with Injun Joe. Any young person will remember the excitement of being near someone they cared about alone in this vignette.Tom stands for the freedom that the American frontier offered to everyone. His aunt Polly represents the civilizing influence of adults and towns. Twain sets up a rewarding novel that makes us rethink the advantages of both freedom and civilization. In this day of the Internet frontier, this story can still provide valuable lessons about listening to our inner selves and acting on what they have to say.

This book was actually written before \\"Huckleberry Finn\\", and in it we are introduced to Huck and Tom Sawyer. It is an adventure story like \\"Huckleberry Finn\\", but it takes place mostly in the town where Huck and Tom live. In it we meet Tom who is the mischievous ringleader of this intrepid duo. He almost drives his long-suffering Aunt Polly to distraction with his antics and crazy schemes. We meet Huckleberry Finn, Tom's best friend, and a social pariah to the village mothers. We also meet Becky Thatcher, Tom's sweetheart. Twain's characterizations are truly wonderful, and this book comes alive. This book and its' sequel are not just books for boys. They both display rich native humour and shrewd observations of human character. This book also is an idyllic one as it displays early American village life when times were much simpler and less frantic. Young and old alike can enjoy this look at this earlier and much simpler time."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is considered one of the greatest works of American literature partly because it reflects so perfectly the culture of mid-1800s America. In a period where thoughts of gold and silver drove men West and industrialization had not yet begun, Twain was able to describe small-town life in detail.With the publishing of the Adventures of Tom Sawyer, Mark Twain introduced the two immortal characters of Tom and Huckleberry to the \\"Hall of Fame\\" of American literature. Written around 1870, the novel initially began as a series of letters from Twain to an old friend (Letters to Will Bowen) about their boyhood pranks, schooldays, and childhood mischief. In his preface, the author notes that Tom Sawyer is drawn from real life, but is a combination \\"of the characteristics of three boys whom he knew\\".Although based on Twain's own personal experiences as a child, critics have suggested several other sources for the novel, including Southwestern humorist, George W. Harris. However, the novel is clearly indicative of the folklore surrounding life on the Mississippi River. Tom's adventures are closely tied with ghost lore, haunted houses, witchcraft, and animal lore; this theme of the superstition and folklore is a common thread in many of Twain's works and exhibits his firsthand knowledge of the popular beliefs of inhabitants of the Mississippi Valley.This story concerns Tom Sawyer, who is a mischievous child and has an intense desire to enjoy life, and not to take things too seriously; which usually results in trouble following just two steps behind him. Throughout this book, Tom makes friends, breaks engagements, runs away, witnesses a murder, and ventures to find lost treasure-all in his home town. Tom falls in love with Becky Thatcher, a new girl in town, and persuades her to get \\"engaged\\" to him. Their romance collapses when she learns that Tom has been engaged before-to a girl named Amy Lawrence. Shortly after being shunned by Becky, Tom accompanies Huckleberry Finn, the son of the town drunk, to the graveyard at night to try out a \\"cure\\" for warts. At the graveyard, they witness the murder of young Dr. Robinson by the Native American \\"half-breed\\" Injun Joe. Scared, Tom and Huck run away and swear a blood oath not to tell anyone what they have seen. Injun Joe blames his companion, Muff Potter, a hapless drunk, for the crime. Potter is wrongfully arrested, and Tom decides to help him. So he tells the truth at the court but Injun Joe manages to get away. Scared to death Tom, Huck, and Tom's friend Joe Harper run away to an island to become pirates. While frolicking around and enjoying their newfound freedom, the boys become aware that their relatives are sounding the river for their bodies. Tom sneaks back home one night to observe the commotion. After a brief moment of remorse at the suffering of his loved ones, Tom is struck by the idea of appearing at his funeral and surprising everyone. He persuades Joe and Huck to do the same. Their return is met with great rejoicing, and they become the envy and admiration of all the children. After that Tom and Becky get lost in the cave, and their absence is not discovered until the following morning. The men of the town begin to search for them, but to no avail. Tom and Becky run out of food and candles and begin to weaken. The horror of the situation increases when Tom, looking for a way out of the cave, happens upon Injun Joe, who is using the cave as a hideout. Eventually, just as the searchers are giving up, Tom finds a way out. The town celebrates, and Becky's father, Judge Thatcher, locks up the cave. Injun Joe, trapped inside, starves to death .A week later, Tom takes Huck to the cave and they find the box of gold. The Widow Douglas adopts Huck, and, when Huck attempts to escape civilized life, Tom promises him that if he returns to the widow, he can join Tom's robber band. Reluctantly, Huck agrees. When Twain ends The Adventures of Tom Sawyer with the clause that going any further would make it the \\"history of a man,\\" he implies that even the most childish of sorts those who embody imagination, ingenuity, and innocence must grow up.The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, written by Mark Twain, is truly a timeless story that has the capability to intrigue all ages. Twain slips many moral and ethical issues into this novel, satarizing topics such as religion, school, adult maturity, and human hypocracy. His wit and sense of humor add a clever edge to the book. The tale is very dramatically wrought, and the subordinate characters are treated with the same graphic force that sets Tom alive before us. There's plenty of humour which keeps you smiling throughout the story.I believe it's a highly entertaining read. I most guarantee that you'll love this book as it's beautifully written and provides a fascinating plot. The story of a carefree boy is so refreshing, one reads it with a longing for the way things used to be."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The advetures of tom sawyer was on of the greatest books I've ever read.

IT also taught me what it was like to be a kid 150 years ago."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Good fiction writers don't use clich&eacute;s, they create them. Twain ranks right up there with Shakespeare at adding to the English lexicon. But unlike Bill, Mark is all ours. In Tom Sawyer he captured the very essence of small-town American life in the 1800s. Where Shakespeare gave us phrases to repeat for centuries, Twain burned images in our combined psyche: rough little school-hating boys with frogs in their pockets and adventure in their minds; snobby pig-tailed young ladies in frilly skirts; no-account town drunks; a hard-working and god-fearing populace; hilarious superstitions. One could argue that the Little Rascals and the Andy Griffith show are direct descendants of this influence.When I first read this book as a kid, I enjoyed the underlying adventure story, but missed the incredible wit and allegory. The book is fantastic on so many levels. The tale leads the clever and precocious Tom Sawyer through a series of minor incidents as he outwits friends and family in his never-ending quest to avoid work and school. He is also romantically drawn to the new girl in town, Becky Thatcher, the judge's daughter. The plot heats up when he and his low-life friend Huck Finn sneak into the cemetery at night to exorcise warts with a dead cat--but end up witnessing a murder by Injun Joe. The various plot elements all weave together in true brilliance for a very satisfying conclusion. Twain even allows his young character to do something everybody at one time or another wishes they could do: witness his own funeral. This is a national treasure. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Outline of &quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer &quot;: Just as the title suggests, the book is about the adventures of Tom Sawyer. The setting is in the 19th century in Mississippi, USA. Not unlike most boys in those times, Tom Sawyer, Huckleberry Finn and their friends love to explore caves, fantasize about being pirates, digging up treasures etc. Unknowingly and much to their guardians and parents concern, they run into dangerous situations.Comments: I wish I could have joined the gang on those adventures. Mark Twain did a terrific job in telling the story as an adult narrator, completely absorbing the reader, liberating the fantasy of one's childhood, yet also echoing the superstitions, prejudice and fears in adulthood; no wonder it remains one of the most popular modern classics."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Any book by Mark Twain, AKA Samuel Clemens is a book worth reading.

And on top of that, Tom Sawyer is a great adventure story. In some ways it isn't really a \\"Great novel\\" with a capital G, and it's not one of my all-time personal favorites, but it is a darn Good one.Grover Gardner's narration of this audio edition is excellent...his deliver isn't over the top (as some interpreters of Twain tend to be), but fairly straightforward, letting the story speak for itself, though lively and engaging.

He's in love with this young girl named Becky Thatcher. He teaches her how to draw. Tom and his friends Huckleberry Finn and Joe Harper discovered a secret island. They go off onto that island to live like pirates. They were presumed dead until they came back just in time to attend their own funerals. They were caught and punished for their actions. Tom and Huckleberry Finn saw Injun Joe, a killer hid a treasure on that island. The only clue was a number two. Injun Joe died tough by starving to death. Tom told Huckleberry that he followed Injun Joe one day and saw that he buried it in the cave he died in. Tom and Huckleberry found the treasure box and looked inside of it. It was filed with coins, guns, and a pair of moccasins.I recommend this book for other readers that are my age because this book teaches you that it is bad to lie. Tom Sawyer lied a lot. Hs stole jam from his Aunt in the beginning of the story. He had to lie to his aunt to get away and get to their secret island to be like pirates. He also told to Huckleberry Finn that he didn't see where Injun Joe hid the treasure.My favorite part of the story was when Tom, Huckleberry Finn, and Joe Harper went off to their secret island and live like pirates. Nobody was with them and except themselves. It was funny how they came back on there own funerals. They also saw Injun Joe on that island and were he buried his treasure. Tom's aunt got so mad at him for running away from home.

I also like when his aunt made him paint the fence but he didn't want to so all his friends would come by and he would kind of conn them into painting the fence.

Tom skips school and has some incredible times with his friends Huck Finn and Joe Harper.Some of these adventures are re-enacted fantasy (such as playing pirates) and some are real (such as witnessing a murder). Kids of all ages will therefore like how they head to an island for their piracy. Of course they have so long a fun-time there that they are presumed dead--only to return in time for their own funeral!The murder is bad news but discovering treasure is good news--beyond their wildest dreams.

It's moderately entertaining as an adventure yarn, but overall it's very dull."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Mark Twain has to be approached with a grain of salt, as he is quite the satirist and many of his narrative points are quite \\"tongue and cheek.\\" I consider Mark Twain one of the best satirists about life, and, because he can put such a witty twist and spin on the simplest and more complex things in the world, he is one of my favorite authors. I've seen countless film renditions of both Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer, and I've read The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn many times and have read some of Twain's other classics (The Prince and the Pauper, Pudd'nhead Wilson), but this was the first time I actually sat down and read Tom Sawyer. Therefore, it pains me to admit that I wasn't as impressed with The Adventures of Tom Sawyer as some of his other works.While clearly the book has some humor, adventure and escapism, it seems to have little in the way of focus, meandering around Tom's mischievousness through various episodes. Sure, there is a bit of loss of innocence and coming of age in Tom, as he does become more mature when he sees the pain and trouble he's caused people close to him (like his aunt, for instance). However, this change of character is brushed over minimally, with more of the focus on Tom, Huck and their gang's adventures and Tom's \\"love\\" for Becky. I don't think this book can hold a candle to The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, which is much deeper and more meaningful, and has a well-deserved classic status.Sure, Tom Sawyer is a fine read in some ways, and has murder and adventure and some humor and wit, but really there is not much to be gained from the book other than entertainment, entertainment that comes in the form of random episodes that don't really revolve around the central plot (the murder). In the book final stages, we finally see things tie together a little, but mostly the novel feels almost as if it is a series of short stories strung together rather than one novel. There are moments where we see Tom's conscience catching up with him, and feels a sense of moral obligation to help the man wrongly accused of murder, but these are minimal and mostly we just witness the adventures of a mischievous kid.Still, it's Twain, and for that reason alone I would recommend. I guess it just wasn't as good as I had envisioned.3.5 stars"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"One of the books arrived in bad conditions, it seemed they had spilled some kind of liquid on the book and some leaves got crinkled.

Tom has a very imaginative mind which he puts to good use when he gets his friends to whitewash the fence rather than do it himself and he is amply rewarded as a bonus . Sadly Mr. Twain's Literary Success did not match his endeavours into his financial affairs. He went Bankrupt after being conned by too many people into \\"Get Rich Quick Schemes\\" and was forced to go on a \\"Lecture Circuit\\" tour of the world to pay his debts.He also had the opportunity to invest in the newly invented telephone which he declined as he felt it had no practical usage.

Because there is no way I'm going to be able to add anything to the thousands of things already written about it. What I instead aim to do is to get you to read the thing, if in case you already haven't. (There, see, here I go imitating the darn thing, and an awful job of it too, no doubt.)The first thing I would tell you is that the book is an \\"adventure,\\" which, well, you've probably already figured out, that word being in the title and everything. The point is, the plot just rollicks along, with Tom and Huck witnessing a murder, running away from home, and finding a buried treasure. So if that's all you're interested in--a good plot--well, here you go. Okay, okay, it's maybe just a tiny little bit improbable, especially the treasure part, but again, it's an adventure and it'll keep you on the edge of your seat and don't let this stop you.The next thing that's real good about this novel is that it almost perfectly captures boyhood: the wild swings between joy and despair; the bravado of confrontation; the excitement of sneaking out at night; the pretending to be cowboys and pirates; the fascination with bugs and dead cats; the monotony of school and church; and the constant, never-ending, daily conflict between doing the right thing and the wrong thing. All of this is familiar to anyone--boy or girl but particularly boy--who has had the happy experience of being a young human-being in America.What's also great is the way the book captures time and place, giving us a rare glimpse into a rural America that existed a hundred and sixty years ago. A rural America in which an apple--or for that matter an apple CORE--was a real treat. Tom has two sets of clothes: the ones he wears every day of his life, and the \\"other\\" ones, those he wears on Sundays. Nobody, and I mean NOBODY, wears shoes during the summer. Here is a description of the village \\"pariah,\\" Huck Finn, the first time we meet him: \\"Huckleberry was always dressed in the cast-off clothes of full-grown men, and they were in perennial bloom and fluttering with rags. His hat was a vast ruin with a wide crescent lopped out of its brim; his coat, when he wore one, hung nearly to his heels . . . ; but one suspender supported his trousers; the seat of his trousers bagged low and contained nothing . . .\\" You get the idea. The wayward son of the town drunk was \\"idle,\\" \\"lawless,\\" \\"vulgar\\" and \\"bad.\\" Naturally, all the boys looked up to him.The book is also ridiculously funny, but I guess I'm not going to go into that. Look. There's nothing more for me to say. If you haven't read this book, then do it. Not because some teacher told you to, or because you've been told it's grand literature or some other such nonsense, or, God forbid, you think you might learn something. Hang it, you need to read this for no other reason than that the book is just plain old fun. Why, I've read it about ten times over the years and I still think it's fun. In fact, more so maybe than the first time I read it. So there. Nothing more, nothing less, and let's just leave it at that."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Now that I have completed The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, I can see why it is such a renowned classic. It tells the story of Tom Sawyer, a carefree boy who looks for nothing more than to have fun in life. Mark Twain called it a \\"hymn\\" to boyhood, as it is an accurate depiction of the life every young boy desires. His adventures vary from the many runaways, to his cleverness with chores (the whitewashing of the fence) and the chilling witness of a murder. His many experiences, have aided his transition from an immature boy, to a well versed, developed young man. Many lessons can be learned from this classic tale. Through his actions Tom displays an enviable character who has no regard for rules and society. His lighthearted spirit, subconsciously questions, what are rules if they are not broken, and what is \\"society.\\" The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, is truly a timeless masterpiece which will withstand the test of time, and provide excellent literature for generations to come."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, by Mark Twain, is a very tricky book. It portrays the image of a child's novel, when in fact it is an equally great read for adults. Yes, it is a story of childhood, but it inspires adventure for the young, and revives it for the old. Something that everyone needs to do.Murder. It's a serious thing no matter what age you are. Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn both knew this when they witnessed the homicide of Dr. Robinson while they were attempting to rid themselves of warts at the town graveyard. Injun Joe committed the murder, but he took advantage of Muff Potter's drunkenness and Muff gets blamed for the crime. Tom and Huck decide to swear by an oath of blood that they will never tell a soul, but when it finally comes down to it, Tom breaks the oath in order to testify that Muff is innocent and that Injun Joe was the real culprit.Unfortunately, Joe escapes from the courthouse in the nick of time and Tom and Huck begin to fear for their lives. In this fright, they run away for quite a long time, and the townsfolk start believing that they're dead. One night, Tom sneaks back to his house. As he's peaking through the window, and finds his Aunt Polly weeping over him with sorrow. He realizes that he should come back home, and he happens to return on the day of his funeral, surprising everyone. Now that he's become the envy of the town, his former love, Becky Thatcher, takes a liking to him again, and they get lost in a cave together. While the two children's families' search for them, Tom and Becky stumble across Injun Joe hiding out in the cave. With a lot of luck, they make it out of the cave as fast as they can, escaping Injun Joe once again. The town closes the cave up when they find out that Joe is stashing himself inside and he dies of starvation.Mark Twain disguised this book as a simple story, but its crafty slang and emotionally stirring power tells me otherwise. Reading about a serious, horrific event such as murder, through the eyes of a young trouble-making boy, is a perspective that will bring out the child in everyone, no matter what age they are and no matter what they're expecting the book to be like."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I recently learned that there are some \\"sanitized\\" versions of \\"Tom Sawyer\\" out there and almost blew a gasket. YOO-HOO, SOMEBODY!! ONE DOES NOT \\"SANITIZE\\" MARK TWAIN! Putting out a bowdlerized version of Tom Sawyer is an abomination on the level of \\"colorizing\\" vintage films. \\"Tom Sawyer\\" is a classic that should be read uncut and uncontaminated. Twain is an American legend, who created in his eponymous hero an American icon, and as if Tom himself were not enough, Twain went even further and introduced us in these pages to the incomparable Huckleberry Finn. Is there anyone who has read \\"Tom Sawyer\\" who hasn't on some level identified with its hero? Tom is a lovable rogue, an incurable romantic who has to deal with his loving and nagging Aunt Polly, chafes under the constraints of school and its tyrannical headmaster, cons his friends into whitewashing Aunt Polly's fence (probably the best loved chapter in the book), runs away with Huck and turns up safe and sound at his own funeral, saves a condemned man's life, and like every other red-blooded American boy, searches for buried treasure (and unlike any other red-blooded American boy, actually finds it.) Twain created some unforgettable secondary characters; Tom's Aunt Polly, his smarmy little cousin Sid, Becky Thatcher who loves/loathes Tom by turns, and the wicked Injun Joe all stand out, but in Tom and Huck, Twain created two of the best loved figures in American literature, of their own time, our time and all time. The book deserves to be appreciated in all its unsanitized glory; this is the version to read."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The Adventures of Tom SawyerPhilip ChangWith an amusing plot and unique characters, Mark Twain draws you into his beautiful novel, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. It ensnares you in a world of giddy fun and of bold adventure with its surprising outcomes and laughable jokes.The novel begins with an overview of the notorious Tom Sawyer, and works its way into his witty and valiant adventures alongside his buddies, Joe Harper and Huck Finn, such as the time he, Joe Harper and Huck Finn retreat to &iexcl;Jackson&iexcl;s Island&iexcl;, causing everyone to think they had drowned in the Mississippi. They return later just to secretly attend their funeral and to make a dramatic return. Another example of Tom Sawyer&iexcl;s lust for adventure is when he teams up with Huck Finn and decides to steal stolen money from a dangerous murderer. Huck Finn, another important character, also gives the reader a few surprises, as he saves a widow, while putting himself in grave danger.All in all, the novel is great story, yet with a few obtrusive words that you might find unsuitable for small children and some odd words that a child might not understand, the majestic power of this novel might be taken away. Yet, the novel can be read and enjoyed by everyone in the family."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Hi,My name is Ella James. I read this book for my 8th grade summer reading. Adventures of Tom Sawyer is a fantastic book. This has to be the best book I have read. I do have to say though for those readers who love to read through a book quickly (i do to) you really need to read this book slowly in order to understand his thought process and the story. This book is for any advanced reader who likes adventure at a nice quick pace. This book CAN run slowly in some parts but that just explains the book. I loved this book...Tom Sawyer relates to anyone in different ways. His thought process can be of an adult sometimes and that just drwas you into the book even more. One thing i found out after this book is the fact that Mark Twain drew in some of his own experiences growing up on the banks of the mississippi river. I know that for some people who hate to read and have to read this book. READ THE BOOK!!!! you WILL enjoy this book if you give it a chance. I cant wait to get my hands on hucklberry fins adventures. So read this book and i swear..IT WILL BE WORTH YOU TIME!!!ENJOY EVERYONE"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Mark Twain's story of a boy's life in a small town on the Mississippi River is worth reading for many reasons. First of all, it is just plain fun. Tom has many amusing adventures, such as the famous white-washing incident. The imaginations of the children are fully engaged; in a world without even picture shows, radio, or recorded music, much less TV or video games, the boys and girls of St. Petersburg do not lack activities to keep themselves entertained. There is also a dark side to this world, as exemplified by the murderer Injun Joe (here some of the unfortunate racism of the period sneaks into the narrative) and the many superstitions of the children.Another reason to enjoy this novel is for its anthropological qualities. Twain took care to replicate the speech of that place and time as much as he could, and he claims that the beliefs and activities of the children (though not the specific plot developments of the novel) are accurate, which provides a fascinating window into life in the early 1800s. Yet another strong aspect of the book is Twain's portrayal of the psychology of boys. We can follow Tom's developing moral sense over the course of the story. In the beginning, he is largely amoral, his sense of ethics confined to feeling guilty over something he has already done through selfishness or impulsiveness. The murder in the cemetery and his awareness that an innocent man is going to be hanged presents him with a genuine moral dilemma, and the path he travels on his way to doing the right thing is believable and compelling.This book is rightfully regarded as a classic of American literature."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I have a boy in my class who would never finish a book. He just wasn't interested in any of the typical novels that third graders read. One day he picked up Tom Sawyer and he read it every day until he had finished the book. Now he's reading it a second time. Something about this story really appealed to him in a way that no other book could. The text level is typical for third grade. The print size is large. There are lots of black and white pictures. It tells the story of Tom Sawyer in a way that a third grader will understand."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I recently read The Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain. In the novel Tom Sawyer is the main character. He is very mischievous and likeable. He is also very smart. He has many adventures throughout the book with Huckleberry Finn who like himself always finds a way to get into trouble. He falls in love in the book with a girl. His life is endangered on a couple of occasions in the book, but he always manages to survive.My favorite part in the book is when the townspeople think Tom is dead but he is alive enjoying himself on the river. In the middle of the ceremony of his death he bursts in on it. Everyone turns around to look who it is and is shocked to see it is Tom from the dead. I liked this part because it was unexpected and funny. My least favorite part of the book is when Injun Joe is plotting to kill someone. I didn't like this because I was afraid something evil was going to happen. My favorite character in the book was Tom Sawyer because he was funny and he had a knack for getting himself out of trouble.This book is full of adventure and anyone can read it and enjoy it. This novel is a must read for anyone who enjoys a great adventure. Once you have finished the book you will want to read more. After finishing this book I would recommend reading Huckleberry Finn because it is the same kind of book including the same characters including Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I read an awesome book called The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.

You will have to find out so read the book."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Mark Twain's celebrated classic, &quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&quot; is one of the most endearing stories to come out of American literature. It's simple story about a mischeivious boy with a wild imagination and zest for doing everything he is not supposed to do has thrilled readers for 125 years.The title character, Tom Sawyer, has a knack for getting into trouble, and then finding a way to avoid punishment. In fact, that is how the story begins. Tom has stolen some jam, and his Aunt Polly is looking for him. When the two confront, and punishment for Tom is imminent, Tom uses his cunning to trick his aunt in turning around, thereby giving him enough time to escape her grasp. And even when he is faced with punishment, as in the whitewashing incident, he finds an ingenious way to avoid the tedious work.What we know of Tom is that his parents are dead, and that his Aunt Polly, his mother's sister, has been caring for him ever since. This insight makes is clearer to understand Tom's mischevious demeanor. That, and Aunt Polly's lax treatment and constraint on the boy. She feels so sorry for him she allows Tom to create a certain amount of trouble for himself, thinking, perhaps, it is his way of dealing with his parents death. Not at all uncommon, as many children today in similar situations act in the same manner as Tom, and often are treeated in the same manner by their gaurdians as well.But, in reality, Twain based Tom on himself, and his own childhood. Twain was never motherless. Aunt Polly represents Twain's own mother, in many respects. Her kindness and understanding, and also her tenacity in doing right, and punishing where and when it fits the crime.The town, the people, and adventures in &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot;, are mostly based on Twain's own childhood experiences, &quot;with a few exagerations&quot;, as the author states. The girl Tom falls head over heels with, Becky Thatcher, is based on Twain's childhood sweetheart, Laura Hawkins. Tom's best friend, Huck Finn, the outcast citizen of St. Petersburg, reviled by the adults, and loved by all the children for his independent ways, is based on a boy named Tom Blankenship, who was the son of St. Petersburg's town drunk. Sid, Tom's half brother, who is as &quot;disgustingly&quot; good and moral as Tom is mischievious, is based on Twain's own younger brother, Henry. Incidently, Henry was never as moral as Twain depicted Sid as being.The four predominent adventures, intertwined, are simple, which helps make &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; all the more enjoyable to read, because it becomes easier for us to imagine ourselves doing the same things as Tom and his comrades.In the first adventure, Tom and Huck steal away in the dead of midnight to see if a dead cat really will help cure warts. They must enter a graveyard, where a dead man, bad in life, has recently been buried, per the instructions in the superstition.However, Tom and Huck have come upon a grave robbery. Muff Potter, Injun Joe, and Dr. Robinson are looting a grave. When Injun Joe demands more money, a scuffle ensues, and the boys witness the half breed murder the doctor. After fleeing for their lives, they swear an oath to &quot;keep mum&quot; about the murder. But when Muff Potter is accussed of the murder, both boys are racked with guilt.The second adventure involves Tom, Huck, and another friend, Joe Harper. Tom, believing he is unloved by the world, and having had a terrible fight with Becky Thatcher, decides to run away from home. Huck and Joe are in agreeance; Joe because he is in a similiar situation with his mother, and Huck because he is always willing to participate in such adventures. They all steal away to Jackson's Island, where, for a couple of days they have loads of fun, even watching a riverboat drag for their bodies. When Joe and Huck become homesick, Tom reveals a secret to them which keeps the two on the island long enough for his plan to work. Some readers have called this plan childish and immature, and even insensitive. To each their own, perhaps.The third adventure happens when Tom gets up the idea to hunt for buried treasure. Huck joins him, and they begin their search of all known haunted houses; for that is where treasure is most likely to be found, as Tom knows from the books he reads. Their luck grows when they spy Injun Joe with a box, claimed to contain money Murrell's Gang had hidden away years earlier. But before they can take the box, Injun Joe hides it away in a mysterious location which Tom and Huck begin a search to find.This fourth adventure interrupts the hunt for treasure. Tom is eager to join Becky's party near McDougal's Cave. As part of the arrangement, the cave is explored. However, Tom and Becky, having slipped away from the main party, have become lost. A desperate search for a way out is made. Along the way, Tom spies Injun Joe in a lower part of the cave with the mysterious box. Not knowing it is Tom, he flees. Eventually, a way out is discovered, and after a week of recooperation, Tom takes Huck back to the cave, where he saw Injun Joe, and where he is sure the treasure is being kept.And, of course, the story ends happily; and spurns a sequel, &quot;The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot;, another truly great American classic from the pen of Mark Twain."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The narrator can make so many different character voices sometimes I could not believe they were done by only one person."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Once again the word boring rears it's ugly head. In looking over the reviews that people have written, I have seen the word boring being used quite often when describing a book including this one. What is most upsetting is that it is often stated by high school students. Why do we continue to require high school students to read books that are obviously over their heads? Not all teenagers fit into this category, but when we raise our children on mega doses of television, and bombard them with advertising, what do we expect? Reviewing books is such a subjective task, and everyone is entitled to their opinion. However, the word boring says more about the person using it than the book being reviewed.

In the Adventures of Tom Sawyer, you get to experience the exciting and sometimes unusual life of Tom in his youth.From skipping school to go swimming, to running away from home to become a pirate, Tom is no stranger to adventure. However, both Tom and his friend Huck happen to be at the wrong place at the wrong time and happen to be witnesses of a murder. He and his friend Huck truly have the time of their lives in this adventure and it makes you longing to know what happens next at every turn of the page.The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is a fictional novel set in the mid 1800s and was written in the same style as Mark Twain's other novel, Huckleberry Finn, as most words are spelled differently than their actual correct spelling. In other words, it makes you feel like you are actually living in the South and speak in the same slang-format as most Southerners.This book is fairly similar to one of Mark Twain's other novels, the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. If you have not read the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and you enjoy reading the Adventures of Tom Sawyer, I highly recommend that book as well.All in all, the Adventures of Tom Sawyer is a fantastic read and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a suspenseful adventure."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I got this one dollar edition of Tom Sawyer simply because I was writing a paper, and I needed to verify the notion I had in my memory of the character of Becky Sharp.

But then she made him do it. Well, when he went outside and started painting he got really bored because he was watching all the kids playing at the end of the street. So when some kid came up and started talking to him, Tom conned him into painting the fence so Tom could go and play with Huck. Huck's his best friend. The thing I liked about the book was that it had a lot of action in it. It seemed like there was alway's something going on. I also never got bored reading it. Another thing I liked about it was that it wasen't too short and it wasen't too long.

Adults need to be reminded of their childhood and remember the crazy things they used to do. Children should read this book because Tom does things they can only dream of. Their are many aspects you will enjoy about this novel.The story of Tom Sawyer is about crazy fun adventures. Tom is a misunderstood child who is tricky and sly like when he gave his cat painkillers. He tricked kids into giving him things so they could they paint the fence he was punished to paint. He also witnesses a murder and nearly gets killed for it. There are many more adventures that he goes on with his friends like Huck. The excitement never ends.I learned that we must cherish our childhood, for it is merely a waning period in our short life.

Tom vowed that before the week was up he would win her love. He skipped down the street, his head full of romantic plans and adventures."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"\\"Although my book is intented mainly for the entertainment of boys and girls, I hope it will not be shunned by men and women on that account,for part of my plan has been to try to pleasantly remind adults of what they once were themselves, and of how they felt and thought and talked, and what queer enterprises they sometimes engaged in\\".The author's preface to the novel first published in 1876 and the fact that the book is still being read and enjoyed by young brats and grown-ups alike is a testimony to Mark Twain's success to make it one for all ages. \\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\\" is the trajectory of a mischievous, fun-loving young American lad's adventures, misadventures, frolickings and danger-seeking experiences across a vast expanse of the sky called life and who has transversed several decades of time to represent a typical adolescent and indeed the child in our heart.Over the vastness of time Tom Sawyer has travelled to represent an ideal child and is instilled with all elements that actually make up an ideal kid:he's a prankster, he gets into troubles, he fools his friends, he hates studies and work,he invites myteries and dangers unto himself, he adores the rough, he has touches of the higher and deeper human emotions. The appealing exemplar of \\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\\" lies as much in the various mischiefs and tomfoolery that Tom gets himself stuck into as in the universal structure of a typical child's fabrication that Tom is patterned with.From its very beginning, this the \\"history of a boy\\" gets the reader deeply involved in it. The eponymous protagonist of this classic outsmarts Aunt Polly in all possible ways and in her hopeless and dire situation, we smell out the pleasant agony of all mothers. \\"Every time I let him off,my conscience does hurt me so;and every time I hit him my old heart almost breaks\\",Aunt Polly---that eternal effigy of tireless and consistent restriction---remarks. Living in St.Petersburg,a village along the Mississippi river, Tom Sawyer can't be restrained by anyone or anything and aong with his bosom friend Huckleberry Finn, Joe Harper and his boyiosh notion of love,Becky Thatcher,laces the whole essence of life with unmistakably conpicuous humorous as well as dark incidents.Tom fools his friends whilts whitewashing the fence and mahes them dire for an onus that simply is a tire,Tom loathes Sidney, his half-brother,for his meek, untroublesome and complaining ways,fights with Alfred Temple,the new boy in town,goes abdconding with Huck and Joe for a week to metamorphose into a pirate only to return to the despaired Aunt Polly's arms in the most dramatic fashion possible under the sun. Tom exhibits numerous childish tricks and boyish sacrifices to lure and then re-lure Becky towards him,witnesses a horrendous murder committed by the half-breed Injun Joe and then heroically gives evidence in court,and ultimately finds his treasure.\\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\\" is a highly entertaining, enthralling and awesome classic which brings out the child that resides in us all and diffuses it into the character of Tom Sawyer, a motherless imp. The read seems to be immensely amusing as we feel that it's not Tom but actually us ourselves who experince those adventures. The reader conforms that he,and not Tom,fools his friends, that it's he who's a runaway to remote Jackson's Island,that Becky is really his own love garbed in children's garments,that the treasure Tom and Huck discovers is actually the one he had been forever longind to excavate but couldn't. The impact of the book is severely pleasing---the reader comes back again and again to those fiascos where Tom bemuses Aunt Polly,where Tom plays silly to attract Becky and where he's punished by his aunt when his tooth is left \\"dangling by the bed-post\\".The beauty of art lies in it providing a window to our own souls and this feature was stolidly exploited by William Shakespeare in \\"Hamlet\\", Bartolome Esteban in \\"Boys eating Grapes and Melon\\" and Sir Paul McCarthney in \\"Yesterday\\". Tom Sawyer and his massive array of tricks and buffonery releases us from the hardshness of the unfeeling world to peep into the attic of our childhood.Humorous,amusing,witty \\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\\" might be but underneath this deceptive sheet dwells a much sullen layer where subtle sarcasms and direct taunt float freely(you may call it \\"mark twain\\" if you like). The homelessness of Huck Finn resonates with the lonesome destitution of numerous young kids, dukes are on one occasion compared to robbers and the unbecoming of wealth is exquisitely expressed in these words of urchin Huck:\\"Looky-here,Tom,being rich ain't what it's cracked up to be. It's just worry and worry,and sweat and sweat,and a wishing you was dead all the time\\".The philosophies that Tom learns amidst a kerpuffle of hilarisity are simple but powerfully packed with the hidden intent of truth. He learns that to impel a person \\"covet a thing\\",you simply have to make it \\"difficult to attain\\",he comprehends his aunt's unmeasurable love for him when he intrudes upon her anguished conversations with Mrs.Harper and shows a maturation beyond his years when he consoles and supports Becky during their exploraton of the McDough's cave. The distranfiguration of Huck as he fails to adapt himself to the demands of monetary pleasure ais an added touch of a grave underminaqtion in the novel.That the term \\"nigger\\" used on many occasions in the book embellishes its nature through unfair apparent abuse to the black community should'nt detract us from realising the more humane and lighter side of life. Adventure stories in general, and those having boys as their theme in particular,have always stood the test of time. For in those mischievous,romantic and noble lads we discern a fair reflection of our very own boyhood days. Take for instance James Mathew Barrie's \\"Peter Pan\\", the boy who never grows up. In real life,we search vehemently for a Peter Pan outsise us and tales about Tom Sawyer or Huckleberry Finn compels us to look for a Peter Pan inside us. The great Indian Nobel Laureate Rabindra Nath Tagore once remarked of a painter in our heart who keeps on painting a difficult picture of life. And that painter is Peter Pan or Tom Sawyer or Huck Finn or any of the children from Enid Blyton's books. And that artist is not didfficult to discover. As Judge Thatcher says to our hero in the novel,\\"Well,there are others just like you,Tom,I've not the least doubts\\".SUBHANKAR MONDAL, UG STUDENT, BANGALORE, INDIA"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Think about this for a sec...Your going to a grave yard at mid night with a friend to see if devils are really and if there take the body of a dead man who died a couple days befor.

Well if he did, it probably wouldn't sound like Tom sawyer's childhood. The story The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is the story of a boy named Tom Sawyer and the adventures and problems he faces with his friends. Whether it was his first love or trespassing and getting caught by adults he faces all kinds of childhood problems. The story also includes his family Aunt Polly and his half brother Sid. The other characters who are in the story are Becky Hatcher and Huck Finn. The author Mark Twain included parts of his own childhood into the story. He also used most of the characters to show personalities of his own family.I would recommend this book to readers who are in sixth grade or higher. while most of the content in the book is appropriate, some of the slang term they used would not be understandable to younger readers. For example, the word \\"lick\\" appears many times in the story. The word has many meanings like to beat up or to call oneself. It shows that in some quotes like \\" I'll lick you good\\" or \\"that's the name they lick me by\\"Overall, This was a great book.

Tom lives with his aunt, ever since his parents died. Tom is a mischievous boy, but is also a very creative boy. He bargains with other boys who thinks painting the fence is fun. Tom later teams with Huck Finn and pretends to be pirates. The real adventure begins, when they encounter Injun Joe. It is said, that there is hidden Treasure. However, Injun Joe has already discovered it. Huck and Tom are determined to get their hands on the hidden Treasure.This book is a very humorous and creative story. I like the way the author uses the old- fashioned language. It is some what awkward to read, but it becomes more enjoyable to read. The sentences are long and very detailed. For instance, \\"And when the middle of the afternoon came, from being a poor poverty-stricken boy in the morning, Tom was literally rolling in wealth. He had besides the things before mentioned, twelve marbles, part of a jew's-harp, a piece of a blue bottle glass to look through, a spool cannon, a key that wouldn't unlock anything, a fragment of chalk, a glass stopper of a decanter, a tin soldier, a couple of tadpoles, six firecrackers, a kitten with only one eye, a brass doorknob, a dog collar-but no dog-the handles of a knife, four pieces of orange peel, and a dilapidated old window sash.\\"This story is very exciting. I like the different mysteries and adventures in this book. I think the author needed a lot of imagination to think of all of these wonderful ideas. This book gives the reader an eerie feeling and a thrill. Sometimes the book even gets frightening. For instance, \\"In his uneasiness Huck found himself drawing closer and closer to the alley; fearing all sorts of dreadful things, and momentarily expecting some catastrophe to happen that would take away his breath.\\"My favorite section of this book is when Huck and Tom tries to follow Injun Joe to find hidden treasure. I also enjoyed the last section of the book when the two of them goes in to the cave. This is my favorite part because it gives you a very eerie feeling. This is a fantastic adventurous book to read.

This story shows the amazing adventures of a young boy and his trusty companion. What I enjoyed reading about this story, was that Tom was fearless. His friend Huck, was a kind of delinquent, who brought Tom along for the ride. When Tom and Huck ventured into the graveyard for a remedy for their warts, and when they came upon Injun Joe and a few others, you could feel the tension and fear in the story. Twain drags you into the story, and describes in such deatal, you get chills. There were several themes in this story. Times of tension and fear would be when Tom and Huck swore on an oath not to tell about something they had witnessed, but there were also times of adventure. This part of the theme would come out when they sailed to a deserted island to become pirates. There were also feelings of silliness and romance whenever Tom was at school. Tom was very flirtacious with the girls at his school, and somewhat of a trouble-maker in the classroom. Finally, the feelings of emotion; they would show when Tom's family mourns over his death. This book relates to my life when Tom is this teenage kid, who is kind of scared to take risks. But when Huck sort of trains him to be a daredevil type kid, and to love danger, he reminds me of my peers and myself in a similar situation, and other situations that kids face today.

Mark Twain captures the essence of growing up in this classic. This is definetly a book for children. However, adults might find it enjoyable as well. The plot is simple. I would recommend this book to a kid over the age of 9.\\"Tom Sawyer\\" is the story of a young boy's adventures. From tricking his friends into painting his fence to testifying in court, to finding a fortune in gold, \\"Tom Sawyer\\" is an exciting book. Tom, after blaming Injun Joe for a murder, is constantly afraid for his life. Also, Becky Thatcher is the apple of Tom's eye, a constant character that adds to the story. Tom gets into all kinds of trouble. He gives painkiller to a cat, attends his own funeral, and gets lost in a cave. Finally, when Tom escapes and Injun Joe gets locked in the cave, Tom and Huck retrieve Joes's stolen gold.In short, \\"Tom Sawyer\\" is an excellent example of fine literature.

Huck and Tom saw the whole thing, and are sworn to secracy. That is until someone finds out that Tom and Huck saw the murder.Huck and Tom are from a small town called Hannibal, Missouri. Like I said earlear, this book is wonderful for young people, because your little kids are just like Tom and Huck. But I strongly recommend that you are an advanced reader before you read this book.

My main criticism with the book is that there is no cohesive story. Instead there are several stories that are not connected to each other at all. The non-connected stories are funny, but there is no relation between them. It isn't until the book reaches the end where Twain begins to craft a cohesive storyline. It's definitely filled with some hilarious moments and great characters (Tom, Aunt Polly, and Huck), but as a whole I wouldn't classify this as a classic work of literature. For that you would have to read Twain's masterpiece \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.\\""},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Sure, this is a story about a boy. It is also a sharp delineation of the American character, a myth that includes episodes that harken back to Plato, Homer, the Old and New Testament, among other influences. The Adventures of Tom Sawyer presents a new kind of hero, a distinctly American hero, to world literature. From his low estate, due to his poverty, youth and incivility, Tom Sawyer surveys the grand vista of small town American life - and, by extension - America, and by his innocence and natural kindheartedness, redeems it from bigotry, intolerance, hypocrisy and all the ills that attend it. It is through Tom Sawyer's eyes that America is revealed as fresh and vital, even though in the novel he has no standing or prestige in the society. He eventually earns his prestige by a series of adventures that draws the town together and elicits it's highest potentialities. Tom Sawyer is the catalyst and the figure around which the Town realizes it's own highest ideals.All this freight is carried by a novel that takes the form of a 'young adult's book,' the kind of book that would be a staple of elementary and junior high school cirricula for a hundred years. It is a testament to Twain's capability as a writer to have written one of the truly great American novels in the disguise of a children's book. In this, it imitates it's protagonist, who incorporates in his child form the entire cultural history of America up to that point."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The book was above average.

The way in which the dialogue was written made the story seem more authentic, but the characters' poor English made me cringe (I suppose that is understandable for the time period it takes place in). The story started out slowly, not seeming to go anywhere. There were plenty of anecdotes about Tom's \\"adventures\\" during his childhood, but the plot only became clear after the book was halfway over. Some parts made no sense at all; they seemed like they were just there to fill the page (which isn't necessarily a bad thing). I didn't really laugh at the funny parts when I read them. They were long and drawn out. No single line was funny in itself; I had to read several pages to understand. I didn't laugh until I turned the situation over in my head after reading. As I mentioned before, it had a VERY slow start. It was dead until Chapter 25 or so (there are 35 chapters total), then it fizzled and died again.

I've been reading all of the volumes I'm putting in the kids library. As you might imagine, some have aged better than others, (\\"Last of the Mohicans\\" qualifies as a real chore). \\"Tom Sawyer\\" holds up remarkably well. There is great depth here, but also great early reader entertainment value.A younger reader can just enjoy the adventure, excitement, and hi-jinks of Tom and friends.

When Mark Twain wrote it, he intended for it to a children's book. Today, it has evolved into a classic. Twain gave Tom a certain flamboyancy that will intrigue a child, and a sincerity that will entertain an adult. He (Twain) combines a boy's wild side with a deeper, self-indulging character. The byproduct: Tom Sawyer. I recommend this book for everybody.Tom Sawyer is a boy who hates boredom, so when there's nothing to do, he creates his own recipes for success...or disaster. Crafty and shrewd, Tom will pursue everything-be it love or be it murder. Tom, along with his comrade Huck, witness a killing, vacation (without permission) on an island, and track down $12,000 cash. When uder Tom's influence, boys will do anything-even chores!The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is full of messages. I think Twain was trying to emphasize how children should be allowed to be children.

The plot is not very complex, nor are the characters that rich. But for what it is, mainly a children's book that has a tendancy to make adults whistful about their own youth, it works fairly well. Clearly not Twain's best (I am partial to _Connecticut Yankee_ as well as, of course, _Huck Finn_) but all in all a decent book, and one that should not be overlooked. The main reason for the missing star in my review is the introduction. I was hoping for something a bit more substantial. In actuality, it is short and not very informative. The glossing is all in the back of the book and none of the glossed words are marked in any way, which makes the reader guess which words might have extra meaning, or have changed in some way over time.

The superstitions are hilarious, but I can say that they didn't really help the book much.

I think that I might have enjoyed this book at a younger age, but for now my rating is as it is."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain, a classic, is slow to get started, the characters are hard to personally identify. It seemed more the script for a cartoon than something that could have actually happened. As the story progressed, however, I found myself genuinely laughing; at the end, I was glad I had listened. Would I listen to it again - I think so.Tom Sawyer (Adventure Classics in Audio)"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Tom Sawyer was my first adventure book I read as a young boy. As a adult, I am reminded of the mischief and cunning and adventure sought by young Sawyer. I also wish many would not try as they do to remove and sensor this book from Public School due to some racial content. The treatment of blacks and even the terms when referring to blacks are important elements of American History; not necessarily proud, but important as we have evolved so much and need to educate and remind ourselves of the past, both pleasant and non-pleasant.Mark Twain must have had quite a thesaurus available as his usage of words and grammar puts many a contemporary writer to shame.I bought this specific publication of Tom Sawyer, instead of the free classics because it had foot-notes that described many key words, sayings using appropriate historical context of the mid 1800's. For under a $1, how can one go wrong for a book that brings back memories of a 10 year old, now 30 years ago."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I think this book was the best book for reading counts because the characters are funny and some of them get into alot of trouble. I like the way the author writes the story. He makes the characters sound interesting and the situations that they are in don't sound boring. I think if people don't like to read as mush as other people do, they will enjoy this book. In this story, there is a boy named Tom Sawyer , who gets really gullable people to do his work for him. He also gets himself into alot of trouble. For example, Tom and his friends went to an island and they decided not to return home. Their family was getting worried and they were searching for them all over the town. Soon they asumed that they were dead. On the day of the funeral they returned, and of course, they got into alot of trouble. I reccomend this book because it is exciting and adventerous.

This historical fiction has everything I'd look for in a book and so much more. Mark Twain has included action, mystery, romance, and even comedy. \\"Tom Sawyer\\" is on par with the work of Homer's Iliad and the Odyssey, and deserves it place in history. The vivid descriptions in the story make the characters seem real, and makes the back hills of Missouri come alive. The plot never gets dull, and it even gets more exciting as the story goes on. The book is told through the eyes of a child, increasing the interest of the book. Everything seems filled with danger, and every odd and end is a treasure to behold. If you want a story that will enchant your every emotion, and makes you feel like you were just a child, pick up \\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\\" by Mark Twain. You won't be disappointed.-Jason"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"\\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\\" is a story about a young boy named Tom Sawyer and his friend Huckleberry Finn, who both manage to find adventure and often get themselves into mischief while doing so, as is the case when one night while at the town grave yard, hoping to clear some warts Tom and Huck witness the murder of one Dr. Robinson. The murder is mainly carried out by Injun Joe, but he will later blame his drunken partner Muff Potter for the crime. Upon witnessing the crime, Tom and Huck quickly decide to run away and live in the woods near the Mississippi river. While there both Tom and Huck agree by oath of blood to never breath a word to anyone about what they saw that night; tom will later brake this promise but only to save Potter.Soon Tom hears that Muff Potter will be tried for the murder of Mr. Robinson; although Potter did not do it Injun Joe will set up incriminating evidence at the seen of the crime to make Potter look guilty. Potter being hung-over and having little recollection of what happened the previous night also makes him look guilty. Tom soon comes to aid of Potter and testifies that Injun Joe killed Robinson; Injun Joe barely escapes the court house. Fearing for their life Tom, Huck and Tom's friend Joe Harper escape to the woods of the Mississippi river, and for some time \\"become pirates\\" through imagination. Being gone for so long, the villagers of St. Petersburg come to the conclusion that while rafting on the river, Tom, Huck, and Joe all drowned.Tome then make a visit to Aunt Polly's house late at night, seeing that there is still a light on in the wee hours of dusk Tom investigates to find Aunt Polly, Sid Mary and Joe Harpers mom; toms sneaks into the room and manages to get under the bed. There Tom hears and realizes what sorrow has be-fallen Aunt Polly and Mrs. Harper; along with the rest of the village \\"He warn't bad, so to say-only mischievous. Only just giddy, and harum-scarum, you know. He warn't any more responsible than a colt. He never meant any harm, and he was the best-hearted boy that ever was...and she began to cry.\\" Tom then travels back to camp where Huck Finn and Joe Harper reside, he then convinces them to return home; both boys agree hesitantly.Tom, Huck, and Joe return just as their funeral is in the midst; soon the three boys become the envy and sole focus of the town. Becky a former fling of Toms reconciles with him and they are one once more, they sneak to the cave together become lost. Tom searches feverishly for an escape route, he doing so he comes upon Injun Joe who is hiding out. After much searching Tom and Becky find an escape route, return home where upon Tom tells the entire town where Injun Joe is. Judge Thatcher closes the Caves, and slowly but surly Injun Joe starves to death never to pose a threat to any other living thing.This book is amazing, Mark Twain is able to deliver a powerful, emotional story to his readers; a story filled with adventure, mystery, suspense, and intrigue. After reading it I felt like going out and searching for my own adventures. \\"The Adventures of Tom sawyer\\" is an adventure in itself, but not in a bad way. When you read it, your emotions get going, it makes you think and speculate what's going to happen next; if a book can do that and more just in the case of this book, then I believe it should be red by everyone, children and grownups."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Tom Sawyer was a great book! I really enjoyed it.It might bring alot of memories to your mind of your young childhood.It displays the characteristics of a young boy in the 1800s who is experiencing the adventures of childhood. It has a wide variety of dialects and characters who can make you feel histarical,sad, and anxious. It is a great book for the young reader, and gives a detailed idea of what life was like in that time.Twain displays a great amount of sociality from his time,and is known for his writing.Guaranteed, you will love this book after reading it.

It is fast reading because of the extravaganza of adventure. The description of setting and the way of speech is astounding and helps you picture the1800's way of life. For example: \\" His cap was a dainty thing, his close-buttoned blue cloth roundabout was new and natty, and so were his pantaloons. I adored how this book did not directly tell you the setting, but you had to figure it out throught the eccentric dialogue.

Not so Tom Sawyer. This is a breezy and light-hearted book which takes the reader on a journey through the innocent and universal adventures of boyhood. Mark Twain was a writer who was completely in touch with his &quot;inner child.&quot; I doubt that any adult could read this book without recognizing pieces of themselves in the thoughts and actions of Tom Sawyer, Huck Finn, Becky Thatcher, and the other characters. They dig for buried treasure, play with captured insects during class, and keep the adults in constantly revolving states of worry, agitation, and relief.Humor abounds throughout this story. Every chapter practically commands you to smile and reminisce about your own childhood adventures. Serious morals about honesty, compassion, greed, love, jealousy, justice, and responsibility are numerous here as well, but they are presented in such a quaint and unpretentious manner that they are easily digested by readers of any age.

And it was a free download."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"After watching a documentary on the life of Samuel Langhorne Clemens, I grabbed the first Mark Twain novel that I could find from the shelves of the local library, to read a story written by an author famous enough to have his own documentary. The idealized boyhood of Clemens provided the stories for The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, by Mark Twain. The novel celebrates the life and times of Americans, particularly those living in communities along the mighty Mississippi River. Twain uses the twangy Midwestern dialect for local flavor to tell the story.The novel is based in St. Petersburg, MO - a small Mississippi River town similar to Twain's boyhood home of Hannibal, MO. Twain set the novel in the 1840s, during the time of the Second Great Awakening and the American Reform Movement, which included abolition of Slavery and Temperance. All of these topics are interwoven in the novel in small doses, so the reader can get a sample of the times, while reading a story focusing on the hijinks of youth as they grew up on the frontier.Many of the stories have taken a life of their own since Twain penned them to parchment. Running away from home, getting lost in a cave, and tricking others to do your work are all childhood stories. Trading gadgets for tickets to turn in for a genuine Dore Bible is a less common story. With this novel, there is an additional element of danger added by the villain of the story, Injun Joe. When Twain wrote this novel in the 1870s, an American Indian was the handiest villain of the times. Forty years ago, a typical villain of the times was a Soviet. The sixties-era cartoon Bullwinkle starred a Russian villain named Boris Badanov.After reading The Adventures of Tom Sawyer as an adult, some thoughts come to mind. Tom Sawyer wasn't that noble taking the punishment for Becky when she tore the Grey's Anatomy. Despite being friendly to Huck Finn, Tom is sometimes condescending to him. In fact, a critical eye might mistake Tom Sawyer for a bully. Twain equates conspicuous consumption and other ostentatious behavior to the \`showing off' of kids, delivering a subtle message to parents. The scene with the cat swiping the toupee from the head of a teacher whose bald pate had been painted in gold, reminded me of scene in Carrie where the title character is publicly humiliated on stage at school.Many of these thoughts are taking The Adventures of Tom Sawyer a little too far, but it is important to realize that times and standards are different today than they were in the 1840s. Settlers on the frontier fought more often and more viciously than a barroom brawl of today. Frontiersmen let their fingernails grow longer, and hardened them by exposure under a candle. Bare-handed frontiersmen used the chipper fingernails as a weapon to gouge out the eyes of an opponent when meting frontier justice."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I have read this book several times.

I never knew America had such a talented writer. I always thought that all the great writers came from England. But when I found out that Mark Twain was from America, that stereotype was immediately blasted out of my mind. The tangles and scrapes that Tom and Huck found themselves in was described so well by Mark Twain that I felt I was right alongside them when they discovered a treasure, or when they went on a quest to be pirates. The only reason that I did not give this book five stars was because the olden-day setting was hard to relate to, so some of the vocabulary, terms, and accents were hard to understand. But I caught on. This a must-read for anybody of any age, if your'e 11, like me, or 90, or anywhere in-between, I guarantee you will enjoy this book. A true classic!"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I believe that one of the factors that makes a piece of literature or even a movie a masterpiece is how well the reader can relate to the story. This is definitely a book everyone can relate to.The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is a literary masterpieces, written in 1876 by the famous author Mark Twain. Tom Sawyer is a mischievous young boy who lives in the small town on the Mississippi River called St. Petersburg. The story line is simple, the book reads like a biography or a memoir of a summer in Tom Sawyer's life.Tom Sawyer seems to be the precursor of and the template for misfit kids such as Dennis the Menace, Malcolm in the Middle, and Calvin and Hobbs. What makes this story great is that Tom Sawyer represents everything that is great about childhood. The book is filled with Tom's adventures playing pirates and war with his friend Joe Harper. Tom has a trusted friend, Huck Finn, who few of the adults approve of. The book is filled with ideas of how the world works, such as how pirates and robbers work, that are so innocent, they could only come from a child. It is a story filled with action, adventure, ingenious ideas, love, and schoolyard politics. The whole story is seemingly a complication of what people did or wish they did during their childhood.The book is a little difficult to read at first. Personally, it takes me a little while to get used to the 19th century dialect in the book. Other than referring to persons of African decent in derogatory terms (which I'm sure uses terms even young children already know), the book would be an enjoyable read for people of all ages. I highly recommend this book for anyone looking to feel young again, if just for a few hundred pages."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I recently auditioned and landed the part in the play \\"Tom Sawyer\\" (as Widow Douglas because I'm too tall to be Becky.) As anyone would do, I investigated this role further, and found this book quite charming. Now, don't get me wrong, I like a good novel now and then, but I can't stand those \\"classics\\". I am currently being forced into reading \\"Silas Marner\\". Just steer clear of that one and read /this/. Tis wonderful (Widow Douglas is THE best character in the book.)"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Light- hearted, funny,inventive and full of warmth. These are just some of the good feelings you can sense flowing from the pages of Tom Sawyer. Though Huck Finn is regarded as one of the highest American novels ever, Tom Sawyer gives off these good feelings with a more consistant and loving attitude then Huck Finn, Tom Sawyer's darker sequel. The novel centers mainly around two boys, the main character Tom and his friend Huck. These two boys just want to live in a world of adventure, fun and peacfulness, but the introduction of a murder and the attacker's safe getaway sharply snaps the boys into the harsh realities of a twisted world. However, Twain elegently puts small events of comic relief and highly amusing antics, and then combines them with master storytelling to create a great novel."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"In this book, the author, Mark Twain shows his insights into humanity by portraying them through the eyes of a naive young boy. Twain shows the flaws in humans by nature and also the good side of humans. The flaws are more of a focus in this book in my opinion, flaws that are poked at by satire. Many things, everyday things, are turned into a satire in this book. Although some things are blatantly made fun of, the literary device of satire is one used most often to do so. Things that are part of everyday peoples' lives, such as religion, are portrayed in a comical spoof way. The feeling that Twain had a bad experience with organized religion is one that every reader should get from the text. Or, perhaps it is his belief that organized religion is for those superficial and shallow. The kind of people that are insecure about what other people think of them, so since others are going to church and getting involved they will too. I feel the same way that Twain does about this such thing. All in all, his use of this literary device strengthens the book, giving it not only substance but entertainment value. Twain is able to take a random and normal setting and make it special to the reader. Set in early southern 1900's America, a place where not very much went on, he took the life of a young boy and made it entertaining, good literature. Tom Sawyer, a typical misbehaved young boy growing up through grade school, is the protagonist of this book. Twain makes him a literary character that one can never forget, a simple character, yet one that will always parallel someone that one may encounter. This book is filled with many unforgettable characters, such as Tom, Aunt Polly, and Huck. Twain is undoubtedly one of the best American writers that has yet to write, many of his writing styles and techniques have been the basis of many other stories. He wrote at a time where fantasy was almost not appropriate. The status quo of literature was one that showed the real truths of life, this most likely because of the aftermath of the Civil War. This period of American literature is called Realism, because there was no fantasy, there was no romanticism and there was no outrageous fiction. People wanted to see the cold hard truth in that grim time. A country always has to grieve after such a thing as a war, and it is a process. From this process of grieving we were given the period of realism. Twain was, and is, the most popular author of this period, because his writing was simple, yet so entertaining. In this particular book, he used many literary devices to strengthen his text. All throughout the book Tom is portrayed vividly in the reader's imagination, reminding us all of simpler times. Twain's satire of this period is humorous and enjoying to read. Twain pokes fun at the popular things of his time such as, convention and proper etiquette. The literary device of satire backs Twain's text and enhances the reading experience of the book."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is a book that looks to capture the innocence of childhood. From collecting dead cats and brass door knobs, to trying to impress his crush in Sunday school, Tom Sawyer is always good for an adventure. He lives with his aunt Polly and his half brother Sid, but his orphanhood doesn't stop him from causing trouble.Whether it be faking his own death or being the only witness to a murder along the course of this book, Tom finds his way into different sorts of adventurous mishaps. Throughout the novel Tom matures and experiences many rites of passage. It is fitting that his final step to being a man would have him looking death straight in the eye.The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is a very smooth read. With every turn of the page there is mystery, suspense, and humor. Twain does a marvelous job of keeping the reader interested in the story. His biggest accomplishment in writing this book is to create an appeal to all audiences, and he did it beautifully. This novel should be recommended to anyone who has never experienced The Adventures of Tom Sawyer."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"In Mark Twain's, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, the reader encounters something so precious, so wonderful that it takes 256 pages to explain--youth. The innocence and jovial spirit that defines this novel bubbles through the bindings. The main character, Tom Sawyer's love for mischief and games like \\"playing pirates\\" reminds every one of what it was like to be young.In this adventure one also encounters adult like conflict, even dealing with mortal danger, such as Tom being chased by the dangerous Injun Joe. We identify with this danger and we are inspired by Tom's courage; he truly acts without fear, with youthful confidence. This puts more emphasis on the carefree mentality of childhood.Finally we see the values that were once instilled upon us when we were children. The image of Tom Sawyer's legendary \\"white fence\\" is something in the mind of every parent when it comes time to punish their own children, the decision of Huck Finn to accept cultivation and civility, and the ethical integrity of Tom to testify against Injun Joe. These events and decisions truly speak louder than words.

I was uninterested, and I did my comprehension homework out of SparkNotes. That was a big mistake.When I read the book, a few days before the test, I loved it. I read chapters over and over again, appreciating the beauty of it all and the use of language.After the first few pages, you will be pulled into this story and held by only your curiosity and interest.

You can really get a feel for the culture of 1840's Missouri with this book, especially since since the characters speak with their various regional accents. This is a perfect book to read if you are studying antebellum America.Most of the characters are professed Christians, but they have a plethora of creepy superstitions. Also, the majority of the children are very confused about the afterlife, for they are quite afraid of ghosts. I first began reading this book when I was eleven and many of the parts that are supposed to be funny were actually quite frightening to me.If you read \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" you will discover that Huck is about fourteen, which I assume would mean that all of the main children are about that age. I think that considering the superstitions and the romance, fourteen is a good age to read it.I really like the cover on this copy. I don't care for the illustrations inside, but there are only about three, and this is a fairly long book so it's not that big of a deal.Overall, this is a wonderful book.

Can he find his way out of the cave and~~ the way to the treasure? I agree with Mark Twain's decisions and ideas. I believe that I would be doing the same thing if I were in his position. His decisions are able to happen; yet The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is such a good book. I would recommend this book to people who like adventurous books, and likes classics. It leaves you at so many cliffhangers that you can help but read all of it at once, for the people who like cliffhangers.~"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"\\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\\" is a true classic. I loved the abridged version as a child and decided to read it in the original form as an adult.It is a lively, charming and light-hearted story about a rebellious young boy (his age is never stated), who thrives on playing hilarious pranks and is constantly getting in trouble for disorderly conduct of the most original kind. Under it all though he has a good and generous heart.Huckleberry Finn is introduced as a dirt-poor, uneducated and disreputable boy whose mother has died and whose drunkard father has abandoned him. An instantly endearing character to the reader, he is nevertheless shunned by the adults of \\"civilized\\" society, who warn their children to stay away from him because \\"he was idle and lawless and vulgar and bad\\". Tom, like the rest of the respectable boys is under strict orders not to play with him.Not surprisingly, Tom \\"played with him every time he got a chance.\\"Thus begins a deep and enduring friendship that remains the central theme for the rest of the book.The book is part memoir and part social critique against prevailing attitudes and hypocrisies, but mostly it is a witty and charming story jumping blithely from one adventure to the next, and told in deceptively simple but deftly crafted language. Therefore it is thoroughly enjoyable, even when the subject matter is inconsequential. I loved his description of a rather one-sided contest between a poodle and a \\"pinch bug\\" in the middle of a chruch service - it is a minor event in the book, but absolutely hilarious and a joy to read and re-read. It is quintessential Mark Twain writing at the pinnacle of his wit and style. An excerpt: \\"Presently a vagrant poodle dog came idling along, sad at heart, lazy with the summer softness and the quiet, weary of captivity, sighing for change. He spied the beetle; the drooping tail lifted and wagged...\\"No wonder this book has remained a favorite for generations. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Tom Sawyer is one of the most endearing characters in American fiction. This wonderful book deals with all the challenges that any young person faces, and resolves them in exciting and unusual ways.Like many young people, Tom would rather be having fun than going to school and church. This is always getting him into trouble, from which he finds unusual solutions. One of the great scenes in this book has Tom persuading his friends to help him whitewash a fence by making them think that nothing could be finer than doing his punishment for playing hooky from school. When I first read this story, it opened up my mind to the potential power of persuasion.Tom also is given up for dead and has the unusual experience of watching his own funeral and hearing what people really thought of him. That's something we all should be able to do. By imagining what people will say at our funeral, we can help establish the purpose of our own lives. Mark Twain has given us a powerful tool for self-examination in this wonderful sequence.Tom and Huck Finn also witness a murder, and have to decide how to handle the fact that they were not supposed to be there and their fear of retribution from the murderer, Injun Joe.Girls are a part of Tom's life, and Becky Thatcher and he have a remarkable adventure in a cave with Injun Joe. Any young person will remember the excitement of being near someone they cared about alone in this vignette.Tom stands for the freedom that the American frontier offered to everyone. His aunt Polly represents the civilizing influence of adults and towns. Twain sets up a rewarding novel that makes us rethink the advantages of both freedom and civilization. In this day of the Internet frontier, this story can still provide valuable lessons about listening to our inner selves and acting on what they have to say. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I read this book when I was almost fourteen, just an ordinary modern teenage girl. But any one can read Tom Sawyer and really love it. It has many MANY a funny part. Tom has many fun times with his friends and their imaginations have no limit. The reader gets to learn about boys and girls(mostly boys) that lived more than a hundred years ago. What really appealed to me was the fact that the lives and minds of children then are not too different from children today. Kids today are obsessed with television. Kids back then were obsessed with books and too commonly took make believe for reality. They played tricks on one another and commonly bugged adults or the opposite gender. Often times, they were very superstitous and strongly believed in ghosts and magic. The reader is also swept away by the many adventures of Tom and his friends. Many of their adventures are a part of imagination, pretending to be pirates or Robin Hood. But Tom and Huck do get to have a few real adventures, specifically with the murderer, caves, and river island. The story doesn't have much of a plot or significance, but that is the way it was meant to be, for the story is funny and tickles the reader. It satires and plays with life. I highly recommend it to everyone, for it is important to know the relationship between our time and the past, boys and girls, youth and adults, the mature and immature, and every opposite. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I have read this book numerous times and still enjoy pulling it out every now and then. From boyhood, teen, and adult years I have never seemed to outgrow the adventures of Tom Sawyer. Some of my favorite parts of the book are when there are no adventures at all and it's just every day life. For instance the Sunday morning church service cannot be called an adventure, but Mark Twain made it come to life with Tom's stumbling in front of the Sunday school after trading for tickets. David and Goliath indeed. Of course no service would be complete without the dog and the 'pinchbug'.Every boy has a Becky Thatcher sometime in his life and it's fun to look back at your own childhood as you relive Tom's romantic exploits through his eyes and your own.Of course Tom's adventures wouldn't be complete without his bosom pal Huck Finn. They become pirates on Jackson Island, witness a murder, and find buried treasure in a haunted house.With other colorful characters like Muff Potter, Injun Joe, Aunt Polly, and the school master (\\"Who tore this book!!!\\"), this book by Mark Twain will live forever and be a favorite for adults and children alike.And remember, anyone who lies will steal sheep!"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is one of the best books I have ever read. The language,the thinking,the adventures-all of it was just incredible and enjoyable. The only thing this book needs is more pages! Mark Twain's skill in writing has created a book that all ages should read (or have it read to).Mark Twain reactivates the life and actions of a boy in the mid-1800's,and showed me that kids should be who they are- not what they will be. This is a classic for every generation to read and enjoy.Mark Twain's,The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, tells about a boy loving and living his life to the fullest. Tom Sawyer is the kid that the world has seemed to forgotten. He is the kid who always get in trouble but continues to have fun with life. In this book, Tom does everything from being engaged, to watching his own funeral, to witnessing a [death] and finding treasure. Twain's creative character finds fun everywhere in his little town in Missouri, as do his friends. The storyline is basic, but it is a piece of the past that everyone should hold on to.In The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, I learned mainly two things. The first thing I learned was that you can make life fun with just about anything if you use your imagination. Life is too short and precious to be wasted. I also learned that where you least expect it [help or protection], you might just get it. This book was just amazing-filled with unique characters, exciting events, and how a town can pull together to help those in need."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Its a classic!

I've been reading several from the series of Classic Starts to my 4 and 5 year olds. Together we've read hundreds of books and the Classic Start series has brought some great stories within accessibility to us. We read Call of the Wild, the Jungle Book, and Tom Sawyer, and we're reading Moby Dick and Treasure Island from the series.This story is just a hit for adventuresome boys. There's some allegory and metaphore for the more sophisticated audience, but it doesn't depend as heavily on it as other great stories because it starts right off with a grizzly murder, and goes on to a haunted house, buried treasure, a deep labyrinthine cave, a vengeful villain, and some real respectable type heroes."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This November 2011 publications was decribed as \\"a beautifully-designed new edition of Mark Twain's classic THE ADVENTURES OF TOM SAWYER\\" and it was far from new, IMO. Based upon this statement, the publication date and the new'ish looking cover, I thought this may be a good read for a 6th grader. I was wrong.I wanted my son to read some of the classic adventures, which The Adventures of Tom Sawyer clearly qualifies. I was hoping it would be an easier read, with vocabulary that a most modern day kids could understand. I read the 1st few chapters only to be disappointed. I knew right away this \\"new edition\\" would not register well with a middle school aged child.A fabulous story but not a good read for the younger generation."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Really poorly bound, or maybe the pages just aren't cut properly. In any case when the book is closed, on the long edge the pages are not flush and even. I don't think the book will fall apart, but it just seems sloppy. Also there are distracting 'notes' throughout the book. These explain some of the 'old fashioned' terms used, but I think are unnecessary and certainly not part of the original work."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Samuel Langhorne Clemens, better known as Mark Twain, was born on November 30, 1835. He is best known for \\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\\" and \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\". Twain grew up in Hannibal, Missouri, which would later provide the setting for Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer - albeit under the name St Petersburg.\\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\\" was first published in 1876, but is set in the 1840s. Tom's two best friends are Joe Harper and Huck Finn. Joe is a similar character to Tom, a leader of men in the school's playground. Huck, on the other hand, is viewed with dread by the town's mothers. (Naturally, he's a likeable character with a good heart, and is adored by all the schoolchildren). He is the son of the town drunk and has to look out for himself : he sleeps wherever he can find shelter, doesn't go to school or church, is a world-class-swearer. The golden-haired Becky Thatcher, though, is someone is desperate to impress : the new girl in town, Tom is head over heels with Becky from the second he sees her.Tom and his younger half-brother Sid live with his Aunt Polly, his dead mother's sister. The two boys are very different. Tom is an imaginative boy who isn't keen on school and is always getting up to some sort of mischief - although there isn't anything malicious in his makeup. Sid, meanwhile, is quiet, well-behaved and loves to see Tom get into trouble. Chores and the inevitable punishments are constantly getting in the way of Tom's schemes - and, as the book goes on, both Tom and Huck become more afraid of the dreaded Injun Joe.A quick and easy read, one that brought back a lot of memories. (All the superstitions and the solemn oaths, how you were always so unfairly treated as a kid - and the world would always be a better place if you could only run away). Absolutely recommended."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"\\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" was Twain's somewhat serious tale of a boy coming of age on the Mississippi River. It was also a wonderful social commentary of the times in which it takes place. \\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,\\" on the other hand, gives us a fun glimpse into the life of one young boy in a fictitious town on the Mississippi River in Missouri. It's definitely the funnier of the two novels, even though it deals with the very real dangers of running off alone, thieves, murderers, and even slacking off on memorizing Sunday school verses. Tom gets into trouble without even thinking about it. He, Huck Finn and a wonderful cast of characters spend their days cutting class, playing pirates, pretending to be Robin Hood, get lost in a cave and even hunt for treasure. It's a grand tale told on a grand scale and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys adventure in the Americana vein.**Potential Spoiler**One character that I'd like to single out is the murderous Injun Joe. As loving and protective as Jim is in \\"Huck Finn,\\" Joe is completely the opposite. He strikes fear into Tom and all of his friends and is the primary catalyst for much of the second half of the book. He's one of the best villains around and his fate (as far as children's books are concerned) is one of the most upsetting. It's amazing how Twain could find a perfect fit for such a wicked character in such a fun book.**End Spoiler**I'm sure that an intellectual could digest this book in greater style than I and reveal countless points on morality, religion, ethics, etc., but for most readers (young and old), this is simply a great adventure. Whether you're fourteen or forty, you'll love this book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Outside of slavery and the plantation economy, no other images of the South so predominates American culture as those from this book; sundays sitting in a hot church in over-starched clothes, lazy weekdays fishing at the local pond, the town drunk rambling thru the streets, one-room schoolhouses, and extended families who share gossip and responsibilities. The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is probably one of America's greatest books, and is probably the first work of Twain's that many Americans encounter at school. Coming in at under 300 pages, this book focuses on the live of one Tom Sawyer, as he navigates school, family, romance, church and the other important issues of a boy's life. Rife with comedy and commentary on life, this story also foreshadows other books by Twain's. Tom's adventures with Huck alludes to the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. The troubles Tom gets in is a good lead-in to the Jumping Frog of Calaveras County. The comedic social commentary about life and society foreshadows The Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court. Most impressive about this book to me is the recreation of the language and dialogue. All in all, this is one of the best books out there."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is an excelent piece of classic american literature.

Tom Sawyer comes to play as a regular boy in the countryside who wouldn't finish painting a fence when told by his aunt to do so. Being lazy and spoiled, Tom doesn't always listen to his elders and even tries to escape his educational life. After school, Tom goes to his friend Huckleberry Finn to trade some belongings like a fallen tooth and a tick that's already found a home on Huck's skin. As if trying to get out of religion school wasn't the worst Tom could do to his education, his amateur skills at flirting with young girls would lead him to some tight spots. Tom falls in love with Becky Thatcher, a girl in his school. After a small incident between Tom and Becky, Tom and Huck witness a murder in front of their eyes by a northern half-breed named Injun Joe. Not telling the authority for fear of Injun Joe's wrath, the two boys become part of a pirate group away from home.Twain's example of death occurring before Tom's eyes is something that could be brought to thought for Tom's personality. Because Tom is occasionally lazy and spoiled, he seems to often take his life for granted. And when he witnesses the loss of a life, his whole outlook changes and he's on an adventure away from home and having to live like an outcast as he tries to find a way to take down Injun Joe and reveal any secrets of the half-breed's criimes. So how will Tom do it, will he be able to get with Becky once more, and will he be a different and better person? It's not at all hard to find out, for the book has large print and coan be completed in half a week or less.

Boy, it was on of the best books Iv'e read in a while. So let me tell you about the book. some of the main characters in this book are Huckleberry Finn, Tom Sawyer, Injun Joe, and Becky. Tom and Huck are 2 adventures boys who are willing to get in trouble any day just to get rich or find something amazing.Injun Joe is the bad guy in this story he steals and sometimes he killed people. Becky is a new girl who moved to Tom's area. Tom thought she was atractive and he liked her.This book is told by Tom Sawyer.This book is about a boy named Tom. Tom was a trouble maker and he was in it alot. His friend Huck was pretty much the same kind of kid.One day Tom was carrying this potion that soposively cured warts if you went to the old town grave yard at mid night .Huck didnt beileve him. He wanted to see for himself. At Mid-Night of that night they went there and they saw two men it was Injun Joe and his sidekick. There was also a third man. He was a docter. Joe was asking him alot of questions. Joe stabbed the docter because he wasnt giving him the full truth and joe got fed up with it. He stabed him with his sidekicks knife and left it next to the docter. The boys were so freaked out they ran as fast as they could back home.Joe's sidekick got arrested later that day because they found his knife. On they went to court. At trile Tom told the jury that it was not the sidekick who killed the docter it was Injun Joe. As soon as he said this Joe ran out the court house.Afterward, no one could find Joe. They offered rewards for whoever could find him. At the same time, Tom went looking for burried treasure with Huck. While doing so they spotted Injun Joe wandreing the streets in a disguese. While Tom was looking for burried treasure so was Joe, But Joe, actually knew where it was. He dug it up and left it a while ago.Now he came back for it. While digging Joe was talking to his sidekick about were they would go next. As Huck and Tom listened they found out were they were hiding out.For the last week Tom had been looking for the box, but could not find it. It wasn't in their hide out. A couple of days later Tom went exploring in a cave with a group of people from his class. Tom and Becky got left behind. The next day Joe was in the cave but he didnt get out because he died of starvation. Tom and Huck found the tresure and buried it next to the widows shed. That is where the story ends.\\u0003Tom Sawyer reminded me of me. I always love to go on adventures to find things and to explore the world around me. Tom was also good at talking people into doing things just like me.I would recomend this book to 4th grade and up. It's a great book for people to read because it sucks you into the story. It makes you want to know what is coming next. As a matter of fact I might read the other books in the series.This book is different from alot of books I read. I just couldn't stop reading it. I really cared about the characters. I felt like I knew them . This book was AWSOME!By: Max Mordini"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I read this book back to back with The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. It would be easy to compare and contrast the two stories, as they stand alone as novels in writing style but overlap slightly in story line. One similarity of both novels is neither seems to have a plot, as though the novel is merely made up as a series of stories. That is, until the final crescendo, which ties up all the loose ends of the earlier exploits.In Tom Sawyer I found what may well be the most animated character I've ever read. His energy was contagious; his adventures left me anticipating each turned page; his friendships made me envious to not grow up on his street. I found him deeply imaginitive, intellegent, sincere and ideal. I felt I earned insight into boys lives from reading his pages.I would read this book again and again, just to get to know Tom better."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I really enjoyed Tom Sawyer. When compared to Huck Finn, on the other hand, it failed in comparison. Tom Sawyer seemed to be much more of just a story, with no real moral or theme behind it. It was just a tale of two boys adventures. But it was still very descriptive and well-written. It was a quick read and a fun story, something that anyone can read and enjoy. It had alot of action and adventure, which made it fun to read, and not hard to get through. I recommend Tom Sawyer."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Tom Sawyer is an excellent classic that I think everyone should read. No matter what your age, this book is inspiring to everyone who reads it. It brings back childhood memories for the adults, and is applicable to every kid's life. Tom is an energetic boy from the early 1800's of about 13. He is forever searching for trouble, and he nearly always succeds. Join Tom, his best friends Huck Finn and Joe Harper, along with his new girlfriend Becky as they find themselves witnessing a murder, deserted on an island, and lost for days in an immense cave. This book isn't one where you can just go on living without ever reading it all the way through. Give it a try...I bet you won't be able to put it down!!"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The Viking Press edition of this book illustrated by Claude LaPointe is an absolute must for school libraries! One of a series called The Whole Story, the book has glossy pages literally filled with colorful illustrations ranging from famous paintings inspired by the adventures in the book to line drawings of flora and fauna mentioned in the text to photographs of cooking utensils common in the period, you name it! In other words, for students and teachers who wish to supplement classroom presentations, this book is a gold mine! I now hope to add others from the series to my collection."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I read The Adventures Of Tom Sawyer. I liked the book a lot. It had a lot of adventure and was exciting. Also, had some funny parts in it like when Tom got in trouble for skipping school and he had to white wash a fence. He tricked every one to help him by telling them it was fun and refusing to let them try till they offered him something in return as in like a red juicy apple then after a while he pretty much had the whole neighbor hood of kids doing it.Tom has a whole bunch of adventures like when he went to an island with Joe and Huck Finn and was gone almost a week and every one assumed that they all drowned so they had a funeral for them. During their funeral they came back and every one was so happy. When Tom and Huck Finn snuck down to the graveyard at midnight and witnessed Injun Joe kill some one and Injun Joe framed his partner for the murder and Tom as a witness claimed that he saw Injun Joe kill that man.I would recommend this book to some one who would get a kick out of an adventure story."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Light- hearted, funny,inventive and full of warmth. These are just some of the good feelings you can sense flowing from the pages of Tom Sawyer. Though Huck Finn is regarded as one of the highest American novels ever, Tom Sawyer gives off these good feelings with a more consistant and loving attitude then Huck Finn, Tom Sawyer's darker sequel. The novel centers mainly around two boys, the main character Tom and his friend Huck. These two boys just want to live in a world of adventure, fun and peacfulness, but the introduction of a murder and the attacker's safe getaway sharply snaps the boys into the harsh realities of a twisted world. However, Twain elegently puts small events of comic relief and highly amusing antics, and then combines them with master storytelling to create a great novel."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This book is a great story of an adventure from the somewhat twisted perspective of the juvenile mind.

You know the type. Old english words, and the use of old words or objects. But to my suprise, the book had a present day feeling. The book could have taken place in the 1990's and be virtually the same. The characters are detailed and realistic. They dont do or say anything out of the ordinary. It gives you the feeling of being there. The setting and the plot are very well done as well. The activities are very well timed. They dont happen all at once.

While I loved Tom's spirit (especially his superstitious nature and all the details about his folk beliefs), the organization of the book was just too episodic for me. I found myself thinking wistfully ofThe Mysterious Stranger, which I read just a couple of months ago.

The setting in this book takes place in various places including caves, school, church, and the graveyard. The time period is in the early 1800's. The protagonists are tom sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. Injun Joe and Muff are the antagonists. The major plot of this book was that he saw Injun Joe kill the doctor while they were grave robbing. The rising action of this book was when they went into the mansion, and go to the graveyard. The climax to me was when they witness the murder,go through the cave, and they find Joe.The style of this book was full of adventure and a lot of exciting moments. The point of view was in 3rd Person. The painting of the fence was one of my favorite parts of this book. The theme of this book to me is to see what the perspective on school, feelings, imagination, adventure, and life in the eyes of a young teen. I thought this book was pretty likable and would rate it 3 stars. Me being a fan of science fiction this was somewhat boring. I really like the whole fairytale idea.

I also initially couldn't recall any details about the book. So I re-read the book. As I learned, Mark Twain grew up in a southern slave state. He also traveled to lots of places that helped him form the background of his novel.After I read this book, something came to my mind, because I didn't have a similar kind of experience with a slave system. You can not have any idea how to handle this situation. As for me coming from the small and free island of Taiwan, it is shocking to me. From my point of view, America has the most equal society. How could it really happen is disconcerting. All men are created equal upon birth. Can anyone tell me why one is destined to be slave when they are born?No matter how, it did happen the fact that we couldn't do anything about the slave system in that age. Anyway, the book was very interesting it is just like you were there with Tom Sawyer and joined his life in a small town of Mississippi. This book also made me realize what it would be like to live in the 1850's. One more thing, about this book, it is not easy to understand because of the dialect of the writing."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This book is pretty good, interesting.I probaly wouldn't buy this brand new, I wouldn't search for it, but thats my opinion. if I saw this book at a used book store I'd buy it. this book is very adventurous.

In this review, I will not attempt to analyze it from any pretentious literary perspective, but rather as just another novel.In this novel, Tom Sawyer, a boy who lives with his aunt on the Mississippi River in Missouri, has all kinds of adventures, most of which involve misbehaving in some way. The Adventures of Tom Sawyer does not seem to be a coming-of-age story, as it initially may appear to be. Certainly Tom has many experiences that theoretically lend themselves to the maturation process, but at the end, he lapses back into his more childlike behavior. He is a \\"bad boy\\" when the book starts, and he is a \\"bad boy\\" when it ends (albeit a wealthy and popular one).Twain's wit is what carries this book. He can write a clever sentence like nobody's business, and his dialogue, characters and story developments are all highly entertaining. Even though there's not a lot going on here plot-wise, the story grips the reader.The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is an enormously entertaining book, and if taken purely for entertainment value, will not disappoint any discerning reader."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"We wanted to get a hard-cover Tom Sawyer for our son, one he could treasure for a long time. This edition looks handsome enough, and has a ribbon bookmark, which is nice. It was a little disappointing that this all-American classic was printed in China. The book warps back and forth with changes in humidity; that's something I haven't seen any other book do. The story about how the illustrations were done is what hooked us; they are nice enough, but they are very small and there aren't so many of them. They really don't bring the book to life as we were imagining they might."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"THE ADVENTURES OF TOM SAWYER is a good book. The author Mark Twain writes about a boy named Tom Sawyer together with his friends, Joe Harper and Huck Finn, go on awseome adventures.Tom Sawyer faces a lot of problems and troubles that the average boy takes on. For instance, he faces girls and experiences love; he one day meets a girl named Becky Thatcher and really falls for her. He also faces boys in fights. He likes to tease, is rowdy, and is just plain naugthy. But there are some things that they face that the average boy won't dare take on. Like the adventure to the cemetery where he and his friend witness something and do some detective work. Another is when they all run away to a distant place. See how it all turns out. The last adventure is when Tom and his friend Becky Thatcher gets trapped in a cave with the town's most wanted man.Read to see how they survive.This book is interesting. I invite you to read it."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"&quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&quot; is a wonderous tale of childhood, mixed with fact and fiction, from Mark Twain's own life, as well as those of several childhood friends. Tom Sawyer is the mischevious, imaginative, intuitive child we all once dreamed of being, if only for a day. Huck Finn is the outcast, shunned by the adults, and envied by all the children. Becky Thatcher is the girl that steals away Tom's heart, and breaks it more than once.Here is a brief summary of the four distinct adventures intertwined within the main story, including the graveyard adventure, The Jackson's Island adventure, the treasurehunt adventure, and the cave adventure.In the first adventure, Tom and Huck Finn stroll out to the graveyard along midnight attempting to cure warts with a dead cat. They inadvertanly come upon a grave robbery, perpetrated by Injun Joe, Muff Potter, and Dr. Robinson. When Injun Joe demands more money from Robinson, a fight ensues, and Muff is knocked out. To Tom and Huck's horror they witness Injun Joe murder the doctor. The two flee moments before Muff comes to, and Injun Joe lays the blame on him. Tom and Huck swear an oath never to tell a living soul what they saw; something which later on weighs heavy more on Tom's shoulder's, than Huck's.In the Jackson Island adventure, Tom, feeling rejected by Becky Thatcher, and the world in general, runs away from home with Huck Finn and his bosom friend Joe Harper. On the island the three children hunt, play, fish, and learn to smoke, until becoming home sick. Tom steals away in the middle of night to find out wether or not his family misses him. Not only does he discover that they do, much to his delight, but that they are presumed dead, and will be holding a funeral for them. A plan is born in Tom's mind, namely to attend their own funeral and make a grand entrance. And what an antrance they do make!In the treasurhunting adventure, Tom and Huck hit upon the idea of searching for treasure. Tom is certain there must be some kind of fortune hidden somewhere within the abandoned homes of St. Petersburg. When he and Huck explore one such home, their adventure is interrupted when two men arrive. One man is a stranger, the other man, a &quot;deaf and dumb Spaniard&quot; seen around town of late turns out to be Injun Joe, much to the boys horror. These men are at the home planning a job when Injun Joe finds an actual treasure buried long ago by Murrell's Gang, it is supposed. Tom and Huck are awe-struck at such a glittering sight; but are heartbroken when the men leave with the treasure. From that moment they begin a dangerous mission to track these men, in the hopes of stealing away the money.In the final adventure, Tom, and Becky Thacther, become lost in the cave they are exploring during a picnic. There is an immediate rush to find a way out, which only leads to further confusion. Suddenly, the two realize they may die in the cave, if they can't find a way out. Their struggle continues as they search deeper in the cave. Becky, weak with hunger, pleads with Tom to go on without her. However, he is too much the chivalrous one, and refuses. In their plight, Tom sees a shadow and calls out, as he runs toward it. His relief is rapidly turned to shock when he sees the face of the man - Injun Joe. Luckily for Tom, Injun Joe does not recognize his voice, and makes a mad dash for safety. Tom and Becky are left to continue their search, and when all hope seems to be fading, a way out is finally found."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"There are some classics which, upon reading, you can easily see the reason for their acclaim, and their ability to persist and live on through the literary ages. And then there are others which are somewhat more mystifying. To me, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer belongs to the latter.\\"Adventures of\\" is a fitting choice of words, as the book is less concerned with a single unifying plot than it is with detailling the various episodes in the childhood of a Southern boy. There is a small attempt at a larger story with the \\"Injun Joe\\" plot that pops up now and again, but most of the book is still concerned with the mischievous pranks and antics of a boy who is not bad but simply very naughty.In fact, part of my dissatisfaction with the novel comes from this \\"bad boy\\" approach. I can understand that many might find Tom Sawyer's mischief quite amusing in an \\"oh aren't little kids precious\\" sort of way; since I don't find such behavior nearly as cute as most, the overly-pleased tenor of the narrative voice was largely lost on me. Then again, Twain states in the preface that the book was mainly intended for boys and girls, and perhaps as an entertaining yet lightweight piece of children's fiction it's more successful.In the course of my research, I've come to understand that the sequel novel, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, is generally agreed to be vastly superior and universally acclaimed, but that Tom Sawyer is the more read work of the two. I'm kind of at a loss as to why this might be; why wouldn't the universally preferred novel be the one that's most widely read?I expect I'll move on to Huck Finn someday, and see if I can understand the appeal a bit more. As this was my first read of anything from Mark Twain, I was enormously underwhelmed."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Not as described.

But like most books which fall under this moniker, a book is classic either because people loved it or because it broke literary ground. In this case, people loved reading &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; and still do.This brings with it different languages and anachronisms then we are used to, indeed Tom does use the N word a few times but you will note that the narrative author does not... Twain felt is what Sawyer would have said in the 1840's. Why this causes such consternation I do not know - people do not seem to object to the numerous corporal punishments done in the schools. Anyhow, I shall stop ranting about political correctness. Because this tale does not worry about being poilitically correct, one of the many great things about it.In a lot of ways this tale is about a simpler time in American life and the life of a young boy. It tells the tale of Tom Sawyer growing up, it is a simple story by one of the best American authors of all time. It is often funny (the dog interrupting the sermon being a particular favourite of mine), occasionaly moving and rich in detail. The narrative is at times deep - Tom's guilt over Muff Potters being a perfect example and captures the mind of a boy becoming an adolescent. It gives a glimpse of life on the Mississippi a hundred and fifty years ago (or at least a perception of that life from forty years later).Twain knows his craft, he knows how to weave an enticing yarn. So why not do yourself a favour and pick up a classic today?"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"&quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; is a great story, but what truly makes this or any other work by Mr. Clemens is that he is able, with perfect precision, to show the psychology of life; in this case, the psychology of an adolescent boy, and his interactions with other similarly adolescent young people. Once again, the story is fantastic, but it is the essence of Mark Twain himself which is most brilliant."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is an ok book because i had to read it in class to pass the seventh grade.

Some people actually like the book for the book, so all you people that say the people who liked this book are only saying that because it is a classic, you are wrong.

When Tom speaks the truth he is now being stolked by the real murderer. At the end the murderer is killed, Tom and Huck find a buried treature and become rich and happy because their &quot;adventure&quot; is over.

This classic, written by Mark Twain, portrays a boy who could talk people into doing just about anything.

Throughout the book you follow Tom through his crazy adventures and are always excited to find out what's around the corner. This is a great book for ages11 to 100.

Great buy."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer was our family book club's June selection. In preparation for our &quot;meeting,&quot; my son wrote the following:You've probably heard of Tom Sawyer, but have you ever thought about him? For example, have you wondered, \\"Is he like me somehow?\\" Or when somebody mentioned Tom Sawyer, have you thought \\"Oh, yeah. I've heard of him. Protagonist in one of Twain's (Clemens') many novels. Little rascal.\\" Sure, Tom is a rascal, but he's not bad; he's nothing more than a boy looking for more than the world can give him.Twain keeps this \\"history of a boy\\" (p. 208) simple: We do not witness a complete bildungsroman (\\"growing up story\\"), which makes the story arc easy to grasp and leaves Twain the ability to revisit the characters as adults. He concludes, \\"Some day it may seem worth while to take up the story of the younger ones again and see what sort of men and women they turned out to be; therefore it will be wisest not to reveal any of that part of their lives at present.\\" (p. 208) Twain also makes Tom's story more enjoyable by jumping in every now and then, putting his own opinion into the storyline. For example, in \\"The Pinch-Bug and His Prey,\\" a chapter about the townsfolk going to church, he notes, that the \\"solemn hush\\" of the congregation is \\"only broken by the tittering and whispering of the choir.\\" He continues, \\"There was once a church choir that was not ill-bred, but I have forgotten where it was, now. It was a great many years ago, I can scarcely remember anything about it, but I think it was in some foreign country.\\" (p. 31) The author also makes the scenes in the book match the words on the page. For example, in describing a school pageant, he recreates the boredom of the event by describing (in some cases, repeating) each dull speech. This is the opposite of his style in, say, the chapters concerning Injun Joe, which are exciting, suspenseful, and far from dull.Another thing that adds a little \\"jazz\\" to the book is that Tom teams up with none other than Huckleberry Finn, the bad influence on the kids of the town. \\"Huckleberry was cordially hated and dreaded by all the mothers of the town, because he was idle and lawless and vulgar and bad - and because all their children admired him so, and delighted in his forbidden society, and wished they dared to be like him.\\" (p. 38)As well as a great book to introduce Twain to kids, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is a novel for anyone who enjoys adventure, humor, and a partial love story, all in one package. At the top of my adventure story list, this book gave me two weeks of enjoyment.

The threats such as \\"my brother could thrash you, with one hand behind his back\\" etc are so amusing and it is so well written that the reader can easily take an instant dislike to this 'new kid' and be delighted when Tom eventually comes out on top, in the ensuing struggle.Thoroughly enjoyed this return to my childhood and can recommend this book to adult or child."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"As an American youngster I grew up hearing bits of wisdom from this great novel but never was required to read it in school therefore I never picked it up to read.

The first being a simple story of boyhood adventures the second as a subversive multi-layered literary masterpiece. You can see this dichotomy clearly from the other reviews on this book.Mark Twain is able to write a seemingly straightforward adventure book that consistently questions and pokes fun at the conventional wisdom of 19th century America. He rips on the hypocrisy of Christianity, slavery, class structure and most of the widely accepted paradigms of American society.I love his sense of irony and the subtleness of his ascerbic wit. My guess is that even when he wrote this book most of his readers did not understand the subtler messages he was conveying. Good for him, otherwise it probably would not have been the best seller it was.I urge the readers of this book to really take a look at the subtext. You will find a treasure chest of thought provoking jabs aimed at American society that are, for the most part, still relevant today."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This prequel to The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn focuses on Tom Sawyer. The story chronicles the day to day events of the protagonist, and with Twain's vivid imagery and colloquial style, it will seem like you are there with Tom.The first time I read this, I found this simply to be a rather light-hearted book with some drama mixed in with romance, perfect for kids just reaching their tens and beyond. The most I got out of it was the plot, how Tom becomes a hero after seemingly on a whim, decides to run away onto an island where they can do anything they want. Later, upon his return, he testifies against a murderer and finds hidden treasure. (How can someone not blame me for not saying that that this is almost a kid tale, reminiscent of the Hardy Brothers... brings back nostalgic memories).Anyways, when I read it again, this time older, I found this to be a classical tale to be a bildungsroman. The telling of the story of the growth of a boy, named Tom. Twain incorporates many symbols within the story, filling into the archetype of the bildungsroman structure, from the village, the gold, to the cave. While the village could be interpreted to be a minuscule model of the United States, it could also be simply the place where Tom experiences his growth. The cave symbolizes the trial that he has to pass in order to reach into adulthood and be incorporated into society as a full-fledged adult. The gold that Tom finds in the end, may well also be the end of his journey and the reaping of his rewards. It is his happy ending.This book, construed with the image of a small town in America and written in that colloquial style too, simply enthralls the readers and lures them in. It should be read by all children of all ages, well, considering that when they actually have the ability to read. Twain's book may not need to be limited to just children, as it also has some rather mature themes and motifs underlying the story. These may include the presence of society's hypocrisy present within the story, the presence of crime ranging from misdemeanors like playing hooky and all the way to murder, to messages about freedom, how society may inhibit that freedom.These are some things, to think about, regardless, I strongly urge anyone with the slightest possibility of buying this book to purchase it. It may also be purchased in conjunction with its sequel. A warning, however, the second book is not as \\"adventury\\" as the first, because its themes are a little bit more mature than the first."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I first read this book in high school and at the time, I found it boring and didn't like reading it, but then again I was forced to read it for English class.

The Adventures of Tom Sawyer chronicles the day-to-day happenings of a young boy in Missouri and his mischievous and playful antics about town. Tom Sawyer is a rascal. He has no qualms about cutting school and romping in the forest to play pirate or tricking his peers into wanting to whitewash a fence (which I found totally hilarious!). Despite his reckless and selfish ways, he is a character that arouses feelings of sympathy and amusement.I found myself sympathizing with his woes (of course, all which came about because of Tom Sawyer himself) and smiling at his antics and beliefs (his superstitious beliefs, for instance his belief that burying a dead cat in the graveyard at midnight will cure warts!).Interestingly, I found that in reading this book I started recalling my *own* childhood and the games and activities I participated in as a little girl. This book doesn't have any great moral lesson to teach the reader, or some profound idea to enlighten us with. It's allure lies in its ability to compel the reader into looking back on one's own childhood with feelings of nostalgia and longing for the carefree and innocent days of childhood where anything is possible. This is a book of pure entertainment. Twain wrote a brief preface to the book and he stated that this was one of his reasons in writing this book: to hopefully create these kinds of memories in the reader, to have the reader wistfully think back on their childhood and remember the way they once were as children.Anyways, the book was very easy reading, the language simple to understand and not flowery in its descriptions. The characters and locale leap from the pages and come alive. You are there with Tom Sawyer and are privy to life in a small town off the Mississippi, and it's all so vividly and simply told, that when you reach the very last page and finish, you wish the story could go on and you could get more glimpses into Tom Sawyer's world. In fact, the next book is The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, and although it's not a sequel to this book, it does continue with some familiar characters introduced in The Adventures of Tom Sawyer."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This book is a great example of what makes Twain one of America's most belvoed writers. Twain's unique sense of humor and his keen insights into human nature shine through in this book. Twain's style is wonderful, the characters are dynamic and the plot never hits a snag. Twain has created a novel here that is light enough on the surface to entertain young readers yet contatins enough substance to speak volumes to an adult audience. You are sure to love this one is you have read any of Twain's other works. If you haven't read Twain, delay no further--this book is the perfect starting point."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Ever since my dad first read this timeless classic to my sister & me as kids, while camping in our trailer during the summer, it has left its indelible impression upon my imagination. How I too wanted to shove off from shore on my \\"skiff\\" and have my own adventures down the Mississippi! I know of no other book that so wonderfully captures the essence and joy of carefree boyhood.When I say \\"carefree\\", however, I am not forgetting the grim and serious elements of the novel. But these work just as well as the sunnier and funnier parts. In fact, just when the narrative needs it, a murder comes along which boosts the plot most effectively, giving it a shot in the arm. And speaking of the darker aspects, does not Injun Joe have to rank highly on the list of greatest villains in the history of literature? I can assure you that as a boy listening to the cave chapters, his menace was palpable and unforgettable.Unfortunately, literary snobs have often found it fashionable to belittle Tom Sawyer as inconsequential and a 'lightweight' seen against the towering greatness of \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\". I couldn't disagree more. (I love 'Huckleberry Finn' dearly, and hope to review it one day as well, given the time to do it justice.) I read a quote in a foreword that I thought was very insightful: \\"Huckleberry Finn is a greater book, but not a better one.\\" I think this is exactly so. Extol the greatness of HF by all means, but don't make the mistake of downgrading Twain's other masterpiece, just because its theme is not so weighty and grave. In fact, the episodic nature of the telling of Tom Sawyer fit Twain's particular brand of genius perfectly (whereas there were some sub par stretches in Huck Finn).Loved it as a boy, love it no less as a man. Thank you, dad, for imparting such an enduring gift."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Mark Twain (1835-1910) has rightly been given the cognomen \\"The Lincoln of Our Literature.\\" In his 1876 novel \\"Tom Sawyer\\" he introduces us to Tom and his mischevious and independently minded friend Huckleberry Finn (who would star in his own novel in 1880 which is considered Twain's masterpiece).Tom Sawyer and younger brother Sid are orphans being raised by the dimit Aunt Polly and her daughter Mary. Tom is a wild and wooly lad eager to use trickery to ease his way through life in the mythical Mississippi River village St. Petersburg(based on Hannibal where Twain had lived as a boy). In this book, which is one of the most famous so called \\"boy's books\\" ever written Tom is engaged in such adventures as:1. Getting village lads to give him gifts for the \\"privilege\\" of painting Aunt Polly's fence. Tom is adept at using reverse pyschology on his peers! The fence painting episode is one of the most famous scenes in all of American literature.2. Playing pirate on an island in the river with his good friend Huck Finn and Joe Harper. The boys have rich imaginations and also enjoy playing Robin Hood and his merry band of Sherwood Foresters.3. Tom and Huck witness a grisley murder in an old graveyard. The murderer is Injun Joe who is the villain of the piece.4. Tom and his friends spend so much time on an island that Aunt Polly and the townsfolks think they have drowned. Tom shows up in church to the wonder and amazement of his friends.5. Humorous scenes occur in Mr. Dobbin's one room schoolhouse where Tom and Becky both get into trouble,6. Tom testifies at the trial of an innocent man accused of the crime while Injun Joe jumps out of the window in a successful escape.4. Tom and his girlfriend Becky Thatcher are lost while on a cave expedition picnic. They finally escape but Injun Joe who is hiding in the cave is not so lucky.6. Tom and Huck play detective and dig up a treasure chest located in the cave containing $12,000 which they split50-50.Mark Twain narrates the story unlike in \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" where Huck is himself the narrator. The Missouri he portrtays was by any means idyllic. During this short book there is a murder; slavery is a social norm and Huck is abused by his alcoholic father. The rape of the Widow Douglas is also insinuated as Injun Joe wishes to revenge himself against her for her judge husband's giving the Indian a public flogging. Twain uses some Midwest dialect including the use of the \\"n\\" word. He was good at developing comic incidents and telling a good story. This is his most representative book; while not as profound as Huckleberry Finn is is a good read for both young readers and adults who wish to return to a distant past through rereading a true American classic. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"To read this book, to me, makes me get very reminiscent of my childhood. I never conned young boys into doing my chores, nor did I wind up on a big adventure that led to being stuck in a cave like Tom and Becky did, but the elements of mischief and adventure in this story are key characteristics that I believe anybody can trace back to in their childhood, especially for boys. With that being said, Mark Twain tells the Tale of Tom's childhood will such detail that it makes me a little bit sad that that part (Tom's part) of my life is over and will never come again.Set in the 1800s, this book is an interesting portrayal of life in towns along the Mississippi River in that time period.

While many view this novel as a mere boy's book, Twain argued that it was meant to remind adults of what their own childhood had been like. While we all might not have lived a life like Tom's, many of us can enjoy the adventures that we do share with this one of a kind character.One chief complaint with \\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\\" might be its lack of plot. Twain, whose previous writings were disjointed narratives at best, had trouble confining a story to a plot which is evident in this novel's episodic nature. Many are familiar with the most famous scenes from the novel - the whitewashing incident, the trouble with Injun Joe, Tom's love for Becky Thatcher, Tom and Huckleberry Finn attending their own funeral, and when Tom and Becky get lost in the caves. While Twain did seem to jump from episode to episode, what ties this novel together in the slimmest of fashions is the secret knowledge that Tom and Huck know about Injun Joe and how they will reveal that or keep it a secret.Scattered throughout these episodes is Twain's biting critique of the cruelty and hypocrisy in society mixed in with the innocence and humor of Tom's plights and misadventures. \\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\\" is a truly original American masterpiece that captures the local color of its time and place but is able to transcend those boundaries to appeal at a universal level. Showcasing middle America at a time when New England was the literary world, Twain transformed nineteenth century American literature and all of the literature that was to follow."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"If you have never read the adventures of Tom Sawyer, you absolutely must grab up this reprint!

At the time I had read only one or two chapters. I am sure had I read the complete novel then I would have loved it. My main problem with the book is that as an adult I cannot savor Tom's adventures nearly as much as I could have when I was a child.Tom Sawyer is a very bright and mischievous lad. He often causes his poor Aunt Polly much grief, even though Tom never tries to upset her out of spite. Tom is a boy, after all, and is not much different from many boys then or today. _The Adventures of Tom Sawyer_ is written by Mark Twain particularly with adolescent boys foreseen as the book's major readership, many of whom would probably identify with Tom. Dressing up and pretending to be a pirate, or a reknowned robber such as Robin Hood is the stuff of adolescent dreams. The writing is, of course, very good and Tom, and his friends, especially Huck, are picaresque and quite likable. Young Becky Thatcher, Tom's would be girlfriend, is as sweet and as exasperating as an adolescent girl could or would be. Becky cannot decide when to scorn Tom or when to turn him into a hero. Tom can occasionally perform heroic deeds.The famous scenes are all there: Tom getting his friends and his goody-goody half-brother Sid, to whitewash the fence so that Tom could shirk his responsibilities, the Becky and Tom segment in the caves with the nefarious Injin Joe, and Tom and Huck, both presumed dead, blithely walking into the church to attend their own funerals.

The book is fantastic with much needed suspension and twists, like having a young childish love thrown in with terrible, mischievous boys. Then showing the loving sides of the most wretched people like Huck who comes off as hating the world and everyone in it. When Huck and Tom go back into the cave to get the treasure but Huck learns to realize that money will not make him happy is a very good lesson hidden within the book. The ending is the rough part it starts good with Injune Joe dying in the cave, which is all together weird and does not keep the nature of the book going. Then after the treasure parts the book just ends abruptly with no real closing almost as if there isn't going to be another novel to expand on but it doesn't bring a real definite closure to the boy's lives and what they are all about after their experiences, just that they want to be robbers.

Williams, and published by Piccadilly Books, Ltd. copyright 2010.I am VERY pleased with this edition's keeping to the Mark Twain's original manuscript and the use of (from my understanding...and by the looks of it) wonderfully-used original illustrations. I mean, really, the size of the book, typeface and insertion of the illustrations are artfully done and flow very nicely.The thing that makes me sick about this book, is that it is less than 1-month old and falling apart DURING my first reading of it. Such a fun, beautiful and timeless book deserves to be printed accordingly. A classic deserves a matching binding and cover quality that will withstand numerous generations of readers effortlessly.Specific problems I have had with my copy include: (1) The pages are bound together unevenly. I had a mind just to send the book back to amazon when I saw this flaw, because I knew they would right the problem immediately. My kids saw some of the illustrations and cover, however, and were so ready for me to read it NOW, that I kept it and decided it would just be an imperfect addition to our library. But more imperfections promptly presented themselves. (2) Because of the uneven binding job, the cover tore at the bottom where there are no pages to hold it up (the unevenly bound pages \\"slant\\" to full starting at the front cover back). (3) The cheaply-laminated cover has ALREADY started curling apart at both corners (front and back), and in the middle (front and back), where I hold the book to read it.This edition was unfortunately not available in hardcover.

We claim to have not found yet the great American novel, but, this comes close. It just reaches out, captures me, and sends me back to my childhood and Tom's.

As the title suggests, I found out that this is a story of the adventures of a young boy named Tom Sawyer, who grows up around the Mississippi river. The genre of this story follows that of countless other books about a protagonist's extraordinary adventures, which gives us plenty of morals through the character's adventure. Since I, personally, enjoy reading adventure stories, I thought that this book would be very interesting to read.From the reading, I discovered many morals that the book teaches us; I found plenty of strengths in this book. The biggest strength of this book is that the author appears to portray Tom Sawyer's growing process, from his childhood to his adulthood through many events. In the story, the protagonist, Tom, is a disobedient character undermining the adults' order. Tom always wants to escape from situations where he has to follow the order and disciplines of adults; he envies his friend, Huck Finn, who possesses indolence and freedom in his life. However, the decision he makes to run away with his friends to an island to become pirates changes his behavior and life; later on, his escape to an orderless world allows grow out of his childhood and become mature.There were plenty of events in Tom's adventure that causes Tom to move from his youth to maturity and enter adulthood. For example, Tom and his friend witness the murder of Doctor Robinson by the half-Indian, Injun Joe, and helped to acquit Muff Potter by responsibly telling the truth to Judge Thatcher. During one summer when Tom and Huck come across Injun Joe again while hunting for buried treasure, they are not scared but are able to spy on Injun Joe by disguising themselves. Also, when Tom goes on a picnic to McDougal's Cave with Becky, they become lost in the cavern. After a few days of searching, Tom finally finds a way out instead of giving up. By these many difficult challenges, Tom learns to be a responsible, courageous, and determined person as an adult. By the end of the story, Tom is no longer an immature disobedient child, but an advocate of respectability and responsibility. I found that he becomes mature in his behavior, which is shown by his urging of his friends to wear tight collars for Sunday school and to follow good table manners. Tom has finally embraced customs of society and sacrificed the freedom of youth.I strongly recommend this book to people who like to read thrilling adventure stories, most likely to young readers, because it is filled with all the elements of a young boy's life. In the beginning of the story, Tom is an energetic and audacious boy, always in and out of trouble. People will enjoy reading about the pranks and exploits of Tom's mischievous childhood. However, readers will also learn from Tom's character. Despite his insincerity and poor behavior, he tries to do the right things and overcomes his hard childhood. The author's most important message is that people will grown up to be faithful and responsible through his or her childhood whether or not he or she was insincere and bad."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"&quot;Children's&quot; literature is frequently wasted on the young. &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; is no more a children's story than is &quot;Catch-22.&quot; At one level, the plotline is a classic boy's adventure tale, but there are other, more interesting levels.It is a sly, wry expression of Samuel Clemens' (that's Mark Twain's real name for you 6th graders) lack of respect for society, social norms, religion, organized education, Sunday school, and probably civilization in general. I am sure that Clemens whole-heartedly agreed with radicals like Thomas Jefferson and Patrick Henry. The pages of &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; fairly drip with the venom of a Victorian curmudgeon.The writing in this book is superb. I would say &quot;luminous&quot; if I weren't afraid of sounding like a dust jacket. As Clemens wrote in &quot;The Literary Offenses of Fenimore Cooper&quot;, &quot;(...) when the personages of a tale deal in conversation, the talk shall sound like human talk, and be talk such as human beings would be likely to talk in the given circumstances, and have a discoverable meaning, also a discoverable purpose, and a show of relevancy, and remain in the neighborhood of the subject at hand, and be interesting to the reader, and help out the tale, and stop when the people cannot think of anything more to say.&quot; In his writing, he followed his own advice.The other, non-Y2K characteristic of &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; is that the book spends a fair amount of time on description, atmosphere, and reflection. Given some (but, thankfully, not all) other reviews by the Nickelodeon generation, we might conclude that any text requiring more attention span than Donkey Kong is too much of a challenge. I delight in the intricacies of the English language - even when it includes a few 19th century anachronisms - and relish its use in the hands of a good writer. I am willing to delay the next action scene for a couple of pages of thoughtful narrative, and &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; gives us plenty.Both of my kids love &quot;Tom Sawyer.&quot; They and the other kids like them give me hope for the 21st century."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"When I started this book I didn't find it especially good.

It is set in the mid-19th century, in a small town along the Mississippi River. Twain takes the reader into the mind of a carefree, innocent boy who views life as a perpetual hoilday. That character, Tom Sawyer, has an intense desire to enjoy life, and to not take things too seriously; which usually results in trouble following just two steps behind him. Tom is an electrifying little boy; one who chases girls, likes adventure, does not like church, school, or rules, has a vivid imagination, and uses his power of persuasion to help talk his way out of almost anything. Throughout this book, Tom makes friends, breaks engagements, runs away, witnesses a murder, and ventures to find lost treasure-all in his home town. Although he is a lovable character from page one, we see Tom grow as a person throughout this novel. Mark Twain does an excelleny job of hitting issues that many kids can relate to, but at the same time, he writes about many issues adults can relate to as well. Twain slips many moral and ethical issues into this novel, satarizing topics such as religion, school, adult maturity, and human hypocracy. His wit and sense of humor add a clever edge to the book. I would recommend The Adventures of Tom Sawyer to anyone, but mainly for a family reading, or adults take interest in reliving life as a child. This novel will force you to think about society today, and the book's pricipal themes seem to be problems that civilization will forever have to overcome. I would recommend this novel to anyone who is looking for a good read."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Tom Sawyer lived in small town St. Petersburg off of the Mississippi River. He was raised by his elderly Aunt Polly a simple-mannered, and kind hearted women. He and his best friend, Huckleberry Finn, kept Aunt Polly on her tip-toes through out the whole book. They were constantly sneeking around and causing some sort of trouble. What I liked about their friendship is that Tom looked up to Huck because he was pretty much independent at his young age. Although they got into some things that they should not have, they handled themselves very well.Tom and Huck have many different challenges, but the hardest challenge of them all was keeping the secret of the death of Dr. Robinson. They swore secrecy, in blood, to each other that they would never speak of what they saw. In my opinion, what they did was wrong. They should have done the right thing and told the authorities.My favorite part of the book is the way Tom pursued the new girl town, Becky Thatcher. Becky is the daughter of the new and well-respected Judge Thatcher. The Thatchers brought up Becky to be proper in her ways. Tom is the total opposite but the two of them just click. I like how she does not disreguard Tom because of his lifestyle. She see's past that.Injun Joe was probably my least favorite character of the book. He hated people because of the way they had treated him harshly in the past. So he seeks revenge during the story. When Tom and Huck swore to secrecy to the murder they had seen it was Injun Joe that had actually committed the crime. Injun Joe attempted to blame the murder on the town drunk Muff Potter. Judge Thatcher and the rest of the town believe the words of Injun Joe throughout the trial until Tom finally breaks the secret seal that he and Huck had together.I really think that Tom did the right thing by finally saying something about the murder. There are some other characters that stood out to me in this book but these were the real keypoints that I thought I should point out."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This is the classic tale of a boy's life in St. Petersburg, Missouri (based on Mark Twain's [Samuel L. Clemens] home town of Hannibal, Missouri), on the banks of the Mississippi River (I believe the time frame is pre-Civil War). The original manuscript of &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; was the first American novel to be submitted to a publisher in typewritten form. Tom is living in the house of his Aunt Polly with the irritating Sid, who turns him in for playing hooky from school. Tom's punishment is to whitewash a thirty-yard fence, nine feet high. With legendary skill and deviousness, he is able to get his friends to complete the onerous task! Later, he and his good friend Huck Finn go to a graveyard to swing a dead cat (to get rid of warts). They witness Injun Joe murder the town doctor and see Joe set up the evidence to appear that the drunken Muff Potter is the assailant. The boys hide out on Jackson's Island and the town believe them drowned. Of course, at their funeral they appear, falling right into the middle of the ceremony. At the trial of Muff Potter, Tom proves Potter innocent; but, Injun Joe escapes. At a town picnic, the boys (as well as Tom's girl Becky Thatcher) get lost in a cave, find Joe's treasure, are rescued, and become heroes. And, unfortunately, respectable. Tom and Huck represent typical boys, having their own adventures and dreams. It is sad to think that, in today's world of behavioral psychologists, counselors, and some teachers, both Tom and Huck would be considered abnormal and some physicians might even prescribe certain drugs to &quot;calm them down.&quot; And, they are just being boys. The adventurous spirit of Tom and Huck should be celebrated, not repressed! Not enough adults read &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; or &quot;Huckleberry Finn.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"In 8th grade I had to read this book but I didn't really care for it because I had to read so it was more like work than fun. However I didn't return this book back to school, along with Treasure Isalnd. Many years pass and I decided to give this book another try. This time around I liked the book because I wanted to read it and I wasn't forced to. There really isn't that much adventure in the story except when Tom witnesses a murder, runs away and gets lost in the cave. The story deals more with Tom in his daily life like dealing with his family, going to church and school and falling in love.

Based on Twain's own boyhood in Missouri, the book introduces the young hero Tom Sawyer, his beleaguered Aunt Polly, friend Huckleberry Finn, sweetheart Becky Thatcher and the villainous Injun Joe. Its success inspired bootlegs, imitations, stage and film versions, radio and television adaptations, recordings and comic books. Twain himself wrote the sequels Tom Sawyer Abroad (1894) and Tom Sawyer, Detective (1896) and gave Tom a featured role in his masterpiece Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884). Field has recorded many of Twain's works, played him onstage, and written, composed and directed his own musical adaptation of Tom Sawyer. The reading is over eight hours long on seven Audio CDs."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is a great classic about a mischievous boy named Tom Sawyer. Tom hates to be clean and doesn't want to go to school. He lives with his mean aunt, his brother Sid and his sister Mary. Tom's best friend is Huckleberry Finn, a boy who doesn't have any parents and is completely free, and Becky Thatcher, Tom's girlfriend. When Tom grows up, he wants to become a robber or a pirate.One of my favorite parts is when Tom falls in love with a girl named Becky Thatcher. When Tom first saw Becky, they were immediately engaged. After the engagement, Tom made a critical mistake by talking about his other girl friend, Amy Lawrence. Becky realized that Tom was already engaged and started crying. Tom tried to comfort Becky but he failed and the girl said she hated him.Another day, Becky was sitting in the classroom at recess when she saw that the teacher's locker that held his favorite book was unlocked! She opened the locker, took out the book, and started reading. Suddenly, Tom came in to the room. Becky was so surprised that she accidentally ripped a page of the book.After class resumed, the teacher took out his favorite book and started to read. He noticed the ripped page and asked the classroom who did it. Tom knew Becky was going to be caught. Then, the boy made a heroic act. \\"It was me who did it\\" he said confidently. Tom was punished and the teacher ordered him to stay at school after the other kids left. Becky was waiting outside of the school when Tom was finally released. \\"Tom, you are so noble!\\" she said.I also like the part when Tom becomes a pirate. Tom ran away from his home and went to a nearby island. He brought with him his friends Huckleberry Finn and Joe Harper. On the island, the boys got to do whatever they wanted from swimming all day to smoking tobacco.One day, the boys saw a ship that seemed like it was looking for somebody missing. Suddenly, Tom realized that the ship was looking for them! The people back in the city thought they were dead! Tom swam back to the city to investigate one night. He crept in to his house and saw his Aunt talking with Mrs. Harper, Joe's mom. Tom heard that the funeral for them would be on Sunday if they were not to be found. The boy hatched a idea. They would come back to the city when the funeral was happening!Tom swam back to the island. The other boys thought Tom's idea was magnificent and he was a genius. On Sunday, the boys sneaked in to the church. Tom's aunt, Mrs. Harper, and other citizens of the city came to the church for the funeral. They were all weeping. Suddenly, the boys appeared out of nowhere! Tom's aunt and Mrs. Harper were overjoyed that their children were still alive."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Little wonder that Tom Sawyer, Huckleberry Finn, Becky Thatcher, Aunt Polly and Injun Joe have been elevated to the status of icons of American literature and culture.Who among us, as playful children, did not scramble over a fallen down tree pretending to be swashbuckling captains of an English privateer scanning the Spanish Main for easy pirate loot? Who among us does not recall the first embarrassing onset of puppy love for a young girl in our class and the steadfast internal decision to not let our young male friends know about any such foolish feelings? Who among us does not recall playing hookey for a day, laying in a sunlit field staring at the moving clouds with a blade of grass between our teeth? Who among us does not recall running away from the yoke of parental supervision and realizing, probably within the hour, how lonely and frightened we really were? Who among us does not recall swearing blood oaths of eternal friendship with our closest mates and swearing to keep secrets even under pain of the direst torture? Who among us cannot recall the trepidation and almost overwhelming fear of overhearing an adult conversation to which we were not supposed to be privy? Who among us does not recall ever escalating games of \\"dare ya!\\" and \\"double dare ya!\\"?While we all can recall, in some distant sadly fogged fashion what we experienced when we were children, only a master wordsmith such as Mark Twain could place us right back inside the mind of a young boy and so brilliantly re-create the charm and delight that was boyhood in frontier North America! No ... never mind that! \\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\\" was set in frontier North America but there are some things that are timeless and universal. The experience of boyhood is one of them.If, like me, you are one of those deprived, unfortunate few who somehow went through school without experiencing the joys of \\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\\", I cannot suggest strongly enough that you rectify that oversight at the earliest possible moment. Highly recommended.

Tom Sawyer is the original prankster, who gives the readers a glimpse into a boy's psyche. This light-hearted account of a lad's childhood reveals the superstitions that boys follow under and the games they partake in. From robbers, to pirates, to even an imitation of Peter Pan, the gang that entails Tom Sawyer is bound to collect trouble.The Adventures of Tom Sawyer begins in rural Mississippi, where the world of Tom Sawyer revolves around summertime fun and playing hooky. At home he has a family based association, where his Aunt Polly, younger brother Sid, and older sister Mary are supportive. Though when his Aunt Sally gives an unjust punishment, and his relationship with Becky Thatcher turns sour, Tom runs away to a remote island with his friends Joe Harper and notorious Huckleberry Finn. There he feels the pangs of homesickness, though decides to endure it when he plans to fake his own death. Arriving at the church during his funeral was one of my favorite parts, making the conflict of emotions more potent when you could feel the vast relief of the congregation, but also the fury of this bogus hoax.The main adventure that streams throughout the novel is the incidents following Doctor Robinson's murder. With only Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer as the sole witnesses, the truth is suddenly twisted when the boys take a vowel of silence and Injun Joe tries to pin the murder on Muff Potter, the town drunk. With every scene following, the boys live in terror with the possibility of facing the half-breed, but the series of events domino into the perfect ending where pauper boys become rich kings."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Have you ever wondered what life was like back in the 1800s? In Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain, you can feel what life was like back then. The genre of this book is adventure. I gave this book a 5 star rating because of how descriptive the author is in the book and how much suspense and adventure there is. Also, the characters in the book are very interesting and always keep you wondering what they'll do next. The main characters in this book are Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn, two boys who always find a way to create trouble and make life interesting. In this book, Tom and Huck spy on two criminals who look suspicious. Tom and Huck eventually find out that the two criminals are hiding treasure in a cave so they go on an adventure in the middle of the night to try to find the buried treasure and become rich.I really enjoyed reading this book and you would like it too. I really like the way the author writes like the way they used to talk back then. It might be challenging at times to understand but it is very interesting to read. I also like the way that the author makes the characters so interesting and surprising. This book has a great plot because there is always an adventure in every part of the book, even in the beginning. I would recommend this book to all strong readers who feel up to the challenge to read this difficult book. I took the challenge and I ended up loving it.-TMP"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain is the ur-young adult novel that serves adults equally well. I distinguish it as YA because of its salient attributes: young protagonist in charge; a world seen from the child's perspective; adults not so prominent or in charge or particularly admirable; strong use of dialogue; and a structured episodic plot that is fluent with satisfying cause and effect action. The world Twain creates is airtight and every action, every character is faithful to it. Not a hair out of place. On top of this, Twain's narrative voice twinkles with wit and irony worthy of any adult literature. Really, this is a book for all ages, all time. It is funny most of the time, and when it is not so funny, it is thrilling or poignant, though the poignancy is kept to an unsentimental minimum.Published in 1876, Twain conceived this more as a historical novel set as it is in his visitable past of an antebellum slave-holding community on the Mississippi. Slavery is part of the background fabric evident in how Tom and his friend Huck Finn channel small town social attitudes they are too young to evaluate, though Huck reveals something of a rising consciousness more fully explored in the later novel devoted to him, which is much more an adult level fiction. If Tom's unabashed goal is to successfully manipulate his environment for fun and personal gain, Huck's is the attainment of personal freedom. Mostly, this is a very sunny view of a boy's life in an idyllic setting that yields more than enough adventure.I haven't returned to this book since 4th grade. I know I enjoyed it much more this time around, especially the satire of small town education. The unabridged Dover Thrift edition is decently crafted with no adornment. There is no critical introduction, only Twain's own original preface. The sequels published some years later are not included in this volume."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This is a great copy.

Tom and his mate Huck Finn get up to all sorts of mischief and there are some genuinely funny moments (like when Tom attends his own funeral). Mark Twain has a knack for taking you back to the days when you were a child - and wishing you were still there (I'd love to spend my days fishing, playing pirates, goofing-off and making mischief). There are a few adult themes that get touched on (slavery and racism) and the church comes in for some mild satire. The follow up book - \\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn\\" - is also a teenager's book but has much more to offer in terms of adult themes and is a little bit darker.A timeless classic for all ages.

Since then I've read a lot of Mark Twain's short stories and a few of his novels. Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is one of my favorite books and I've read it a pile of times but until now I'd never revisited Tom Sawyer.One of the things I love about Twain's writing is just how real and honest everything feels. Very quickly I felt myself pulled into the world of St. Peterburg. I absolutely love the flow and tone of the language. It's just so fluid and friendly. I love Twain's narrative style as he makes commentary on situations or behaviors. I can almost hear his snarky voice as he satirizes the sanctimonious behavior of some of the adults as set against the devil-may-care (yet very superstitious) attitudes of the children.I vaguely remembered bits of the larger plot of the story but as I was reading I was struck by how much this book is a compilation of shorter stories instead of one single big plot piece. Admittedly there is the overall thread of Tom and Huck and their adventures with Injun Joe, but that particular story thread often goes many chapters completely forgotten, much in the way a child will forget some of their worries and cares as soon as the next big adventure comes along.This book is definitely lighter in tone than Huckleberry Finn. It's not addressing heavy topics like slavery. But it still has plenty of weighty segments alongside the frivolous fun. There are plenty of subtle morality lessons as well as very dramatic scenes. I really enjoyed the tension as Tom and Becky sat in the dark cave watching their candle go out or the suspense as Tom and Huck sat upstairs in the haunted house waiting for Injun Joe to come up the stairs and find them hiding there. These segments were a fun balance to the light hearted adventures of boys playing pirates or whitewashing the fence.While not as outrageous as Huckleberry Finn, there are segments in this book that may be potentially offensive or off-putting to some readers. The boys do observe a grizzly murder, though it isn't described in ghastly turns. There is also a lot of talk about superstition and witchcraft and sneaking out in the middle of the night for special ceremonies for luck or play. Beyond these elements (which are quaintly fun and characteristic of the world at that time and place), the boys also run away from home and spend days cussing and smoking and when they do return home they only get mild chastisement. Tom comments how he's going to impress the other boys by pulling out his pipe and smoking around them. While the behavior doesn't get much more applause than this (and it actually makes him very sick the first time he smokes), it doesn't get particularly villainized either, which could certainly be a cause for shock in some readers. I think as long as the reader understands the context, it shouldn't be a problem. And if a parent or educator is giving this book to a young child to read, it could be a good teaching point.Being a fan of Mark Twain, I certainly have some bias, but I can wholeheartedly recommend this book. I plan on pushing it on my unsuspecting children and hope they enjoy it as much as I do. It's a true pleasure to go romping around with Tom Sawyer and his friends as they get up to adventures and into and out of trouble. If you've read it before, pick it up again and find old friends. And if you've never read it, you should definitely give it a read. It's tons of fun and definitely stands up to the test of time. As a note, there are a lot of Abridged versions out there (presumably to remove some of the potentially offensive segments). Do yourself a favor and read the unabridged version. You don't want to miss any of the fun.*****5 out of 5 stars"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This book is for a child 8 to 9 years old.

They tend to play very roughly with others, play sports and toys than focus on other things and can play tricks on people very smartly. I have been there myself with my my two brothers. But there has one true character with that mischievous feeling and that is Tom Sawyer. He's sneaky, witty and even makes trouble and tricks people. For over 135 years, Mark Twain's iconic novel has truly become an American classic.In the novel, we meet our hero Tom Sawyer who has lived with his Aunt Polly and cousin Mary his whole life, along with his younger brother Sid who sounds like the opposite of Tom. Later while painting a fence, Tom manages to trick some of his friends to do it for him with success. On a boring Monday morning, he seems to not be his usual self when a sore tooth occurs and his aunt takes it out herself with more pain than before. After that, he meets Huckleberry Finn, who is another iconic character by Twain, with a dead cat who is just like Tom but only he's hated by almost the whole town and they talk about what's been going on and at school, he faces a problem with a girl. Then one night while out in a cemetery with Huck to do a ritual to cure warts, they get into a scuffle with savages and it ends with a drunk doctor killed and Tom and Huck running away to an island near the Missisippi River. But when spreads around, their troubles are only beginning.I found \\"Tom Sawyer\\" to be very incredible and truly unexpected, even though I was hoping for it to be more cheerful. The story goes in a steady path and then grows more serious and more heartfelt. No wonder it became a classic for Mark Twain. Tom and all the characters in the story are all written very well and are very convincing. For anyone who enjoys a classic read will find this novel unforgettable.

Originally published in 1876 it is a testimony to its quality that this timeless story is relevant 136 years later. Through reading, one realizes just how Dennis the Menace, Heathcliff, Calvin & Hobbs and even Bart Simpson all borrow from Tom Sawyers blueprint all while simultaneously allowing the reader to remember what it was like to be a kid.I read the unabridged and annotated Big Read: Alabama edition of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. This edition doesn't deviate from the original writings and provides interesting trivia about the original manuscript. Initially the 19th century Southern dialect was difficult to comprehend, however once a few chapters in, I was so engulfed it was as if I grew up as one of the gang.Although a classic, there is a blistering downside to this tale. I had an extremely hard time digesting the racial insensitivity of the 1800's. Every time an African American is mentioned, he is referred to as a n*gger. This is utterly repulsive. On more than one occasion I almost stopped reading due to feeling disrespected. While I would sincerely like to believe that Twain did not intend any harm when using the term, the reality is that the word n*gger was used to belittle and insult. This made me realize the other harsh reality: when this manuscript was originally written during the slavery era, Twain did not intend for me to read, appreciate or enjoy this work solely because of my skin color.Tom Sawyer is classic American literature. Although extremely difficult, if you can bear the racial insensitivity of the 1800's, this work can be appreciated and enjoyed regardless of age, race, creed or color."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I like this book 100 good because,it teaches you a lot about bad and good things in life you have to denie"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I first read The Adventures of Tom Sawyer as a child, and I fell in love with the plot and the characters right away.

And it's not just for kids. Twain says in his intro that he wrote the book not only for children, but also for adults, to help them remember how they acted and thought as children. Although there are very, very few readers who ever acted as Tom Sawyer does, the story still works. Heck, it doesn't even matter that it is not entirely believable, because the reader is having too much fun following the adventure. And although it is not a \\"deep\\" book, Twain still manages to insert the occasional Twain-ish penetrating insights into human nature.

I recommend this book to people who are in 7th grade. This book is the greatest book I've ever read."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Tom Sawyer has been an American classic since the 19th Century, and it continues to be as we begin the 21st Century. I believe that Mark Twain is our greatest author, and while Huckleberry Finn is generally regarded as the ''greater'' work, Tom Sawyer stands on its own as a true masterpiece.I could go on forever about what's great about Twain and Tom Sawyer, but I'll share just the highlights. First, Tom Sawyer will forever teach us what life was like in the early-mid 19th Century. Tom lived in rural Missouri, as did Twain himself, and the setting along the Mississippi River will be forever lodged in American culture, thanks in part to this book.Second, I appreciate the fact that Twain doesn't take himself or his characters too seriously. Tom Sawyer is a book, as Twain says, ''about a boy.'' It chronicles Tom's fun adventures, some of which have no point other than to show how boys had fun in that day and age. Our children today might not find tick-running or playing with dead cats all that intriguing, but they might just see that kids of any day and age will use whatever they have for fun.Finally, I like the language. Heavens, the language used in Tom Sawyer would not be appropriate today, but like the book itself, it can be fun. I teach 8th graders, and while I wouldn't tell my students to go out into the hallway and get ''fagged out'' while pursuing their ''queer enterprises,'' we sure have fun with terms like those when reading the book. Yes, our language has changed over the years. What was once ''bully'' became ''the cat's meow,'' then ''cool,'' and finally whatever our kids today say. I'll bet Tom would find some of the things we say today to be funny as well!If you like good books, fun books, and meaningful books, then read Tom Sawyer, by Mark Twain. It is a classic piece of American literature that has and always will stand the test of time, even if the language has evolved."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"127 years after its initial publication, Mark Twain's The Adventures Of Tom Sawyer (1876) remains the definitive account of American boyhood. Bright, sassy, dauntless, charming, and shrewd, Tom embodies the archetype of every healthy, mischievous, and extroverted American boy.The book's plot, probably better known to most readers today via cinematic versions of the story, is uncomplicated. Tom tricks and antagonizes his beloved, easily outraged Aunt Polly, develops a frustrating crush on young schoolmate Becky Thatcher, tricks his pals into doing his chores, reinvents himself as a pirate on the Mississippi, and, with Huckleberry Finn, runs afoul of Injun Joe when they unexpectedly witness a murder in a graveyard at midnight. Like every good story with a traditional structure, the narrative offers a series of contrasts, here between the comfortable, familiar, sunlit world of St. Petersburg and the events that occur when curious Tom strips back daylight's veil and peers into the community's secret life.Interestingly, with The Adventures Of Tom Sawyer, the clever Twain was writing about present day (1880s) America, but simultaneously already portraying that era in nostalgic, sentimental terms. Thus, today's readers may find in a double nostalgia in the novel: the first, their own, focused on a longing for America's mythological \\"simpler times,\\" and the second a reflection of the homey, intimate, bumpkin - , eccentric - , and \\"character\\" - ridden American small town that Twain provided for the readers of his own era. By writing so powerfully about boyhood, Twain offers readers of all eras yet another powerful provocation towards nostalgia: that for one's own lost childhood, youthful initiations, and passages from innocence into adulthood.The novel contains seductive, lulling passages of great poetic beauty, such as the following: \\"He entered a dense wood, picked his pathless way to the centre of it, and sat down on a mossy spot under a spreading oak. There was not even a zephyr stirring; the dead noonday heat had even stilled the songs of the birds; nature lay in a trance that was broken by no sound but the occasional far - off hammering of a woodpecker, and this seemed to render the pervading silence and sense of loneliness the more profound. The boy's soul was steeped in melancholy; his feelings were in happy accord with his surroundings. He sat long with his elbows on his knees and his chin in his hands, meditating. It seemed to him that life was but a trouble at best, and he more than half envied Jimmy Hodges, so lately released. It must be peaceful, he thought, to lie and slumber and dream for ever and ever, with the wind whispering through the trees and caressing the grass and the flowers of the grave, and nothing to bother and grieve about, ever any more.\\"However, most of the book is written in a tone of buoyant theatrical artificiality: in episode after episode, Twain carefully sets his audience up for the punch lines to follow, and does so in a fashion that unabashedly reveals his own calculation as well as his intention that the reader be able to predict exactly what is to come. Even the narrative's tragedy - leaning moments are eventually punctured by corny, charming, tongue - in - cheek humor which seems to suggest that life, when well balanced, is primarily a pleasant affair of straw hats, freckled skin, rolled - up dungarees, molasses candy, indolent summer days, fishing tackle, white picket fences, and lovely chintz wallpaper.A defining moment in American literature, the Adventures Of Tom Sawyer is an evocative, light, and fanciful book littered with shrewd social commentary and fragments of wisdom and insight composed by an American master at the height of his powers."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"\\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\\" is often overlooked by its cousin \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\". The former unlike the later offers no great moral advice or social satire other then the Twain wit invibed in every one of his stories. The reason that this book will be remembered is that Tom is a romantic. Whereas Huck can look at a Sunday school class and only see the sceane in front of his eyes Tom sees a band of travlers ready for plunder by his pirate gang. It is also extremly funny when these two views of the world clash, making this book fun for the entire family."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"This book has become part of American culture and folklore, and should never be forgotten. Tom lived in a small town on the Mississippi River in the mid-1800s. His idyllic life was full of boyhood adventures. He believed a dead cat could cure warts, you got engaged to a new girl every few weeks, and rules were for the unimaginative. We all know the major events in the story - the whitewashed fence, Injun Joe, finding buried treasure; but the real story is the glimpse of life as it was so long ago. The villagers were honest, straight-forward folks who knew everybody's business. They looked after one another and led moral lives. Kids were expected to push the limits while they could, and then grow up. The rural, folksy dialog is so colorful that it's a must for reading aloud.I recommend this book to adults. The dialog is so rich and charming and its view of childhood so wistful, you'll want to run away on Tom Sawyer's raft."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"In this great tale of two boys that are in seek of adventure and treasure, Mark Twain outdoes himself. Filled with rich langunge and wonderful stories, this book is a winner.One thing that I really enjoyed about this book is the many twist and turns in the plot. There are also a variety of charcaters with different personalities, and traits about them. I think that every one could relate to at least someone in this book. Mark Twain takes the ordinary lives of two small town boys and chages it a little to make it interesting, and a book that I oculdn't put down. I thoroughly enjoyed reading about people like me, and what they go thorugh. It is a delghtful tale that people of all ages will enjoy."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"THE ADVENTURES OF TOM SAWYER by Mark Twain, is mainly about the adventures, thoughts, and feelings of a young ambitious boy during the ninetenith century. Mark Twain shows fantastic examples throughout the story of boyhood adventures. It will remind readers of their childhood expierances, which was the authors main purpose. This lovely novel is one I would highly advise young people and adults to read and remember always."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I first read this when I was about 12 years old and bored out of my mind one summer. I discovered an old tattered copy among my father's faded leather-bound tomes on a shelf in our hallway. By the end of the first chapter I was hooked. This was the first, and remains one of the very few books I've EVER read that I literally could not put down once I got started. I remember effortlessly reading over 100 pages of it one day (and getting a stiff neck as a result) and being amazed that I was able to read so much in a few hours and that I even enjoyed every minute of it. This is the ultimate book for reluctant boy readers. Tom and Huck are two of the greatest character creations in all of American literature. And their adventures are sheer pleasure to read. Once the reader finds himself in the graveyard with the dead cat at midnight, that's it. He's a Twain fan for life.To this day I find Tom Sawyer a much more fun book to read than Huck Finn. And I think that even for today's Internet and MTV generation, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer can rival anything, even the ubiquitous Harry Potter books for holding a reluctant reader's interest. 25 stars out of 5!!"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"It being the Fourth of July, or Small Explosives Day as I call it (training kids early to think bombs are fun can pay off with trillions of tax dollars, no questions asked), I am reminded of my favorite American, Mr. Sam Clemens.I remember it was a hot July day, I was five or six and happily wandering the local library, and I saw an old copy of Tom Sawyer on a shelf. I'd heard of it, saw the cover of a kid with a slingshot in his back pocket, and said, \\"This is for me!\\"I have never looked back.Huck Finn is a deeper book, no doubt, dealing with deeper issues, while TS is all about the joys and pains of being a kid, and especially the joys of being a smart little rebel. No other book ever made America seem more appealing to me.Twain understands what this country was meant to be, could be, should be, might be. He knows what kids are about, and how much smarter than adults they can be. From Tom Sawyer to Letters From The Earth rises and falls an arc that few artists of any nation can touch. Twain knows that this is the best and the worst country on earth, full of truly good-hearted if misinformed people who would love to trust their leaders if they could.Above all, Twain lets us laugh at ourselves while seeing our foibles in the light of day.There's a game where you pick three figures in history you'd like to have dinner with. I always used to choose Christ, Buddha, and Shakespeare. Thinking about it now, I might have to go with Twain at the head of the table.Alas, to be betwixt Twain and Shakespeare...o, to lean back and listen. And laugh.Thank you, Mr. Clemens. You will always be the real Uncle Sam."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"As a 75 year old senior citizen who never took the time to read the classics when growing up I decided to go back and start with The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. I enjoyed the way in which the author used the dialect of the times in which these young men grew up in the South. Will move ahead and read Huckleberry Finn and then switch over to The Last of the Mohicans."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I think it is odd that this book is considered a children's book. I doubt very much it can compete with today's supernatural and flashy offerings for that demographic. The trouble is, the experience of the young protagonist will seem alien to most any child raised today who probably will never experience the freedom of just roaming the countryside, adult-free, and playing with sticks and frogs and their imagination.For me, however, I was brought clearly back to the banks of the Hudson and the woods and fields of the Stillwater, NY of my youth. Twain captures so well the endless potential of those years and it is such a shame that society has lost them. If Huck Finn is a better book in general (and it is), one cannot deny that the bloom of youth is captured few places better than in Tom Sawyer.I will say that, now that I have met Tom Sawyer, the end of Huck Finn becomes no less tiresome. It seems a parody of Tom, and does not strike one with the same sense of truth that the same behavior in this book does. Maybe I am a nitpicker.Twain is an excellent storyteller."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is an OK book. It tells of a mischievous boy named Tom Sawyer having adventures with his friends. Reading this, I can relate to Tom and so can some adults. If you are an adult and you want to be nostalgic, I would recommend this book. Tom experiences feelings that normal kids do, so though this book was about days of the old, modern day children can still relate to him.Tom and Huck Finn both go through many adventures. Such as going to find treasure and going to the graveyard at night thus leading to the plot of the story. Discovering a murder by Injun Joe, Tom then has self conflicts within him. This story is very detailed and has very indulging word choice.Overall, this book's charisma on readers really depends on the person's appetite for a nostalgic and relation type story. Because you can relate or be nostalgic about the past, back to the days of your youth filled with mystery and wonder. I like this book but not enough to love it."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Heck of a fun tale. No great meaning behind it, though. In fact, Twain basically killed this character in Huckleberry Finn, using him as a symbol for then contemporary society and its silly rules, like slavery. Can't help thinking about that when I look back on this."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Tom Sawyer - A mischievous masterpiece from Mark Twain. Most of his best works have been relegated to children. A classic literature book for the higher schools in my town, the book is social commentary in a way that is exciting and thrilling. The racial tension, criminal action and the law attempting to deal. Tom has been bred to fear God and dread the Sunday school. Tom is an ordinary boy who sees dreams, tell lies and play mischief in his own ignorance. From playing pirates on a deserted island to attempting his own funeral and from exploring a cave to digging for treasure in a haunted house. Tom is an exceptional genius with friends who go even for danger adventures. He and his pal Huck Finn stumble on a midnight murder, Tom almost meets his match Joe - Almost a fun book and Tom's romantic folly never really have any dire consequences.Tom Sawyer is sure to leave an impression stamp on younger minds. Especially, those who have learnt the book in Supplementary reading in English as there has been indepth study on the characters and book episodes. I learnt my share and found this book at times boring like Tom himself felt bored in the life he lived but later on, there is so much excitement to grip to the adventure.

It allowed for easy readability and understanding of an American classic."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Mark Twain's great American classic cannot be classified as any other than children's literature, but don't let that scare you more advanced readers away. This book is nothing other than a joy to read, and I am glad I made the effort to revisit this memorable read from my youth. Light-hearted fun and mischief, along with brilliant looks into the psyches of young boys put this book up around the most enjoyable one I've read in a long while.As Tom and Huck live out their fantasies, and go through a series of good times and bad, the reader is taken on a nostalgic tour of what it means to be a kid (pre-Nintendo). When the slightest discomfort can seem like the end of the world, the adults are the avowed enemy, and imagination is your greatest tool of all, the world is a much simpler place (and somehow more exciting). I strongly suggest finding the time to take this tour again and remember what it was like being Tom Sawyer.As to the reviewer that didn't like this one (can't believe Twain made any money off this one??), I'd suggest trying it again when you're not forced to by your teacher. Reading for fun is always much more enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"When I was a li'l kid I always use to watching cartoons.Probably my most sought after one was this.It's not because it was simply a good one.But because it teaches every child some important morals in their lives.The Adventures of Tom Sawyer reflects the old american way on how a country boy survive the struggles of life and while living with his aunt.Mark Twain somewhat pictured his childhood life in Mississippi,where boys or children had more fun under the sun than watching TV most modern kids do.I've had fun reading this book as it didn't give me any aspect of boredom and mostly gave me a wonderful time of imagining what is the life of kids way back time.We can all tell that Tom Sawyer was such an adventurous boy that he and his friends got caught up in a situation they had never been.They're so curious about their nature that sometimes it leads to some trouble.It was a thrilling ride to go through events which a boy may not solve it by himself.This book definitely was one of Mark Twain's most realistic books.And is a MUST HAVE for kids seeking good books to be remembered.It has all the good lessons that we can't teach our children through words or actions.It gives a child a peek on how his age lived in a non-technological era.I love this book and will always go down as one of my favorites all time."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I read the books years ago. Probably I may have been in school then. But the book still has a great impact on my life. The orphan childhood of Tom, his relationship with his Aunt. His adventures with his friends especially with Huck Finn on whom another book has been written about. I think such a book would really be enjoyed by kids of 13 years and younger. This has and will always be one of my best books ever."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Tom Sawyer and his adventures are surely some of the most prolific in all of American history. The stories of his jaunts are something every child growing up in this country has heard and been engrained with countless times.For myself, this is my first time sitting down and reading this eternal classic in my life. I m 23. While I had a strong familiarity with what happens throughout the book, it was still a story that took me back to the adventures I had during my own childhood and the ones I wished I had because Tom did them.The finest moments in the novel come in the interactions of Tom and Huck and the language they use to speak with one another. Its charming, hilarious and outright brilliant. I ve yet to read Huckleberry Finn yet, but its on my nightstand as we speak waiting to be cracked. I cannot wait.If Huckleberry Finn is Twain's masterpiece, then Tom Sawyer must be his complete joy and excitements pouring out onto the pages. The sense of possibility and wonder are so profound throughout, that you can't help but think its every childs right to cause a mess going about their adventures and explorations.Entirely due its title as Classic and a necessary read for anyone wishing a strong backbone in the American language."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"I probably don't have to tell you much about Tom Sawyer.I mean, you likely already know about: Huck Finn; Injun Joe; Becky Thatcher; the island; the caves; the painting of the fence. Tom Sawyer, like Mark Twain, is Americana.But what I do want to report, in my small space here, is how wonderfully true Tom Sawyer is. He and his friends live and breathe in this novel, and in reading it, you'll remember a lot of what you've forgotten about what it's like to be young and (relatively) care-free.Mark Twain is known as a great \\"humorist.\\" I'm not certain what that means exactly, but the best I can come up with is that his writing is funny because Twain actually sees things for what they are and writes them down accordingly. Tom Sawyer is \\"humorous\\" because Twain somehow remembers what children feel, and how they think, and what they do and why, and the novel is true to them. Not too long ago, I read Crime & Punishment, which is called one of the \\"greatest psychological novels of all time\\" because of how it gets inside its main character's head and describes his emotions and thoughts. Tom Sawyer does this no less skillfully, the main difference being that Crime & Punishment concentrates on dark and brooding states whereas Tom Sawyer shows us the light-hearted and whimsical.Otherwise, Tom Sawyer is excellent from start to finish. The characters are all interesting, the episodes funny and adventurous--it is simply an enjoyable novel all the way through, and should be on everyone's reading list. The debate continues as to who is the United States' greatest novelist: Melville? Hawthorne? Hemingway? Steinbeck? Twain? Tom Sawyer puts forth a compelling argument for the latter."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer can still stir ones childhood sense of freedom and adventure. Paul Newman's oratory is a simple trustworthy rendering of a great classic and his voice has a sense of familiarity to it that adds strength to this Audio CD.I purchased this CD to listen to on the family vacation / road trip this summer. I knew my wife and I would enjoy listening to Paul Newman reading Tom Sawyer, but I was not sure how our four children would fair. Having to Compete with Game Boy and the car DVD player Mark Twain's Tom Sawyer looked like a long shot.In fact when I made the children shutdown all their gadgets and listen there arouse; at first a loud protest however within five minutes all four children where enthralled with the story. I was somewhat surprised to see how much fun we all where having and how quickly my kid's imagination took over. When Tom, Huck, and Joe Harper sit down to rest around the campfire and reflect upon their first day as Pirates on Jackson Island, how they have escaped forever the drudgery of school and every day chores to fish and run muck, my oldest son (Age 10) had such a look of satisfaction and contentment that I knew he had been rite there along side them.

It was long-winded, confusing, and was written in an odd dialect that sometimes made it very difficult to discern what the author was saying. I'll admit that a lot of the time I would mostly be using context clues to get through the confusing language. (at this point, you're probably wondering why I rated the book 4 stars...I'm getting to that) You see, although the language was oftentimes difficult to understand, the storyline itself was quite entertaining. Most people have probably heard of Tom Sawyer's punishment to whitewash the fence, and how he tricked his friends into doing it for him, but reading about why he was being punished, and how exactly he went about doing the tricking was HILARIOUS! I wish I could be half as clever as Tom! Huckleberry Finn was also an interesting character, and when he and Tom met up, you better watch out, because trouble was coming to town! Another reason I liked the book in the end is that it had some good life lessons included within the story. I don't think it's my place to tell you what you should learn by reading the book - that's for you to discover yourself after you read it! I will say that I have learned to try to keep a positive outlook on life. Tom Sawyer is a classic, although it may be frustrating and confusing at times, it will still be worth your time and energy to read. I sincerely hope you give the story a chance, and that you learn as much as I did from reading the book!P.S.

Or how about the great School Exhibition when all the young ladies read their truly awful compositions, and after which the schoolmaster's wig is snatched off to reveal..."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"Author Mark Twain (1835-1910) captures the essence of childhood with this beloved tale of Missouri youngsters growing up along the banks of the Mississippi River in the 1840's. Tom Sawyer is a clever youngster and prankster, a bit lazy, and on the prowl to impress girls, use imagination, and seek adventure. His antics include getting others to paint a fence for him, occasionally avoiding school, and leading other kids as imaginary pirates and robbers. His aunt Polly represents adult stability, which perhaps explains Sawyer's attraction to another young rebellious sort named Huck Finn. I felt the best part of the book was when Tom and Becky Thatcher were trapped in a cave and sought to escape without encountering a desperate killer named Injun Joe. But other readers may be more attracted to sections of the book that describe Tom's daily activities and antics.This story should be of equal interest to children and adults alike. It has timeless elements such as childhood fantasy, coming of age, young crushes, excitement and danger. This book was first published in 1876, yet children then and today share more characteristics than one might assume."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Courage Literary Classics)","review":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is the story of a mischievous boy of the 1800's who goes through many adventures and represents the spirit of a true boy. Tom Sawyer is the classic troublemaker. He tricks other kids into doing his chores and plays hooky with his friends. At home, he steals sugar, he plays tricks on his Aunt Polly, and he even feeds Painkiller to the cat, making it livelier than usual.Tom Sawyer has many mischievous acts, but one of his most famous is when he tricks other kids into whitewashing his fence. Tom hates whitewashing the front fence so when a boy walks by, bragging that he has no work to do, Tom says, \\"What do you call work?\\" and pretends he likes whitewashing the fence. Eventually, the boy wants to whitewash the fence so badly that he even pays Tom in fishing hooks, marbles, etc. to do it. Soon, almost every boy in town comes to pay Tom so that they can whitewash the fence. After a while, the fence has three coats of whitewash, there is no more whitewash left, and Tom is literally rolling in his riches.Tom also has a time of puppy love and he follows Amy, a girl from school, around. But Tom's obsession with Amy soon stops and awhile later, Tom meets Becky, another girl at school, and falls in love again. Tom and Becky go through fights, but they make up each time. They even get lost in a cave together.There's a time in every boy's life when they get mad at everybody in the world and they wonder how it would be if they were dead. Then everybody would weep and cry and compliment them. Although most people don't actually go ahead and pretend that they're dead, Tom goes ahead and runs away with Sid and Huckleberry Finn, son of the town's drunk who lives by his own rules. They pretend to be pirates and roam around on a nearby island. The town thinks they're dead and they grieve over the \\"lost\\" lives. From all of this hubbub, Tom gets a great idea. Tom, Sid, and Huck come back to town on the day of their funeral and shock everybody at the funeral.Tom and Huck also have another adventure. They start looking for treasure, but they get tied up in the scheme of two men who have an actual treasure. Tom and Huck go looking for it and after plenty of hard work, the two get the treasure; thousands of dollars in gold and silver. Huck is then taken in by a widow in town with a share of the fortune and Tom has a share of the treasure, too.Many people might think that Tom Sawyer is just an boring, old character, but they don't know the half of it. Mark Twain truly captures the spirit of a true boy. But not any old goody-goody boy. Tom is the ultimate troublemaker. This book will make you laugh.

Tom seems to possess all the most intriguing, loveable, foolhardy and frustrating qualities of boyhood, rolled into one skinny body full of opinions.

She has found much more as she becomes friends with her curmudgeon host, Stella and others who shower her and Lily with love. However over time, Hayley realizes she also loves Roz's son Harper, but fears revealing her deep feelings because she worries how Roz and their friends would react; not even love is worth the cost of that friendship. Besides she has doubts that the deep regard is truly hers as she thinks the Harper Bride has somehow entered her mind. Harper shares her feelings including not wanting to hurt their friendship that means so much to him.Hayley believes the Harper Bride, a ghost singing lullabies in the mansion, has chosen her as the one to help the spirit leave this plane. Accompanied by Harper, Roz and her beloved Mitchell (see BLACK ROSE), and Stella and her cherished Logan they begin a quest to learn what happened in 1893 to keep this specter haunting the mansion.RED LILY is a terrific ending to the delightful In the Garden trilogy. Haley fantasizes about Harper and dreams of things that happened to the Harper Bride not her. This makes her wonder if the Bride or she loves Harper. The ensemble cast returns from the previous novels, but remains consistent to their distinctive personalities. The mystery of the ghost and the potential romance make for a fine finale as the audience will wonder whether the Bride, Haley, or both loves Harper. Nora Roberts proves once again she is one of the best writers in the romance world.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"Let me start off by saying that I adore Nora Roberts books.

A small handful of apparent proofreading errors may be confusing, but the overall work is wonderfully done. Hayley's character tended to swing between headstrong and whiny throughout the story, but otherwise, she was a worthy lead.I'm awarding four stars to Roberts for \\"Red Lily.\\" If you liked the first two installments of the \\"In the Garden\\" trilogy, you will enjoy seeing how the ending plays out.-C.W."},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"What can I say, Nora has done it again. She has beautifully depicted the lives of the people involved with In The Garden. I couldn't wait to get this final installment and see just how Hayley's story turned out and I have to say that Nora did it just right. Of course as with all of her trilogies I didn't want it to end, but it was a nice finish to a beautiful set. Highly Recommended!!"},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"To reiterate a comment in an earlier review (Blue Dahlia, April 27, 2006) about the gardening element in this trilogy...if you love gardening, you'll enjoy this book; if you don't, you won't. There's a great deal of descriptive prose about propagating and hybridizing flowers, etc., that may cause some readers to skip pages to get through it. Be careful doing this, however, as crucial information may be tucked away in those passages. I also have to agree with some reviewers about the ghost story. It's a little overdone at times and, while I can suspend belief and accept unusual incantations regarding the supernatural, I found some parts a little overwrought and over the top for my taste.Having said this, I did enjoy this third book in the In the Garden trilogy and the long-awaited romantic involvement of Hayley Phillips and Harper Ashby. The romance took root in the Blue Dahlia and took an enormous leap at the time of Lily's birth when Harper held Hayley's hand during the final moments of childbirth. Roberts gave these characters a year or so of knowing each other before the romantic tension became too much for either to withstand. Harper's total devotion to Lily and her attachment to him make his eventual place as her father both desirable and predictable.Amelia Ellen Connor, on the other hand, was a very unhappy, selfish, unbalanced person in life. In death, she is worse. However, her place in the Harper family is real, and the need to find her remains and put her to rest is critical to the family as well. As much as Hayley feels sorry for what was done to Amelia, in reality, had she raised \\"James\\" he would, no doubt, have grown up to be a very different man than the fine one \\"Reginald\\" turned out to be.As a whole, I liked the series and find Nora Roberts's ability to write well-written books, one after another, an enormous accomplishment. One would think she'd run of ways to say things, but she certainly doesn't. Examples of her ability to describe just about anything, no matter how mundane, are the following passages regarding Harper's temper: \\"Temper seemed to vibrate off the blades of his tense shoulders.\\" A few lines later: \\"But, the move, as designed, pushed a little humor through the wall of Harper's temper.\\" Can't you just see it?!Carolyn Rowe Hill"},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"Nora Roberts has been one of my all time favorite authors ever since I read Genuine Lies. However, lately I've been very disappointed with her books, it seems as though she's rushing to get them done and doesn't put much effort into them. I thought so with the Key trilogy, then the garden trilogy came out and I decided to give her the benefit of the doubt. I did that with all three books, but I think at the end I just read them to find out how the story would end, and not because I was caught up in it as used to happen with her other books. If you're a first time Nora Roberts reader, DO NOT start with these books, get the older ones, which are much much better."},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"~* 3.5 Stars *~Over one hundred years ago, a young woman on the brink of insanity...or just beyond it...disappeared without a trace. Her ghost haunts the house and grounds of the Harper household and has for as long as anyone alive can remember. Most who have seen or heard her speak of the care she shows to the children of the house, singing lullabies to the young and offering a comforting presence to young mothers. But there is a darkness, too, and when lullabies become edged in madness and comfort turns to terror, a group of family and friends must ban together to find out who their ghost is, WHERE she is, if they have any hope of surviving her wrath.Hayley Phillips knows all about difficult choices and personal strength. It takes a special sort of strength to be a single mother, and even more to pack up the only life she'd ever known while pregnant and move all the way across the country in the hopes that distant relative Roz Harper would help her get a job. She was rewarded for that temerity, and now she's got a daughter, Lily, a home at the Harper house, and friends and family in Roz and Stella. Hayley even has a lust interest in Harper, Roz's son...when she's not willfully pushing all thoughts of lust aside out of respect, however misplaced, for her friendship with Roz.Harper Ashby is his mother's son, and the gorgeous Hayley is living in his mother's house, both a friend and distant relative. Because of this, and out of respect for his mother and Hayley both, not to mention the strength of will that he got directly from Roz, he's spent more than a year forcing his thoughts into the brotherly range when he looks at Hayley - not always successfully. The young mother tugs on more than one of his heartstrings and her daughter Lily has him firmly wrapped around every one of her tiny fingers. Then one evening, the delectable Hayley knocks on his door, steps into his kitchen, and changes everything...in the best possible ways.That night, the Harper Bride does the same...in not so nice ways.Harper and Hayley struggle with the insidious influences of a malignant entity as the corps of family and friends race to find out the whole story of Amelia, with the desperate hope that knowledge is more than power - it's the key to ending what has gone far beyond a haunting and straight into ghostly possession.As we come full circle in Roberts' In the Garden trilogy, there are few surprises left for the romantic pairing of Hayley and Harper, but that lack of surprise doesn't mean the development of their relationship doesn't have merit. Sweet and a little zany, single mother Hayley has a slew of obligation and not a whole lot of room for a complicated romance, and there's nothing at all about being intimate with one of her best friend's sons that isn't complicated. Many of Hayley's deepest concerns may be unwarranted, but they're real to her, and her story is thick with that understandable angst. Harper has been a solid, reliable presence since the start of the trilogy, and Amelia's ghostly impingement has triggered his most protective instincts - also a legacy from his mother. His stubborn bullheadedness, however, and his attempts to male-muscle his way into pushing Hayley around for her own good actually add character to his personality...not always good character - but interesting, at least. That's actually an aspect that I felt missing from the previous book, characters with a flash of their flaws now and then.The plot of Red Lily, though, lacked much of the depth and layers of the first and second book in the trilogy. There were no real external issues to supplement the romance and the battle with an annoyed specter, and in this case, that turns out to be slightly unfortunate, because while the issues with Amelia do come to conclusion in this final book, Hayley and Harper's relationship - which really started germinating back inBlue Dahlia (In the Garden, Book 1)- didn't offer enough in the way of complications or complexity to hold my interest throughout the book. And even though the Harper Bride issues were expanded and intensified, I didn't find Amelia to be enough to support the book on its own, either. There was a lot of planting and growing information included, as there has been all along in the trilogy, but in this book I found it difficult to slog through at times without other plot thread distractions.Still, the undisputed strength of this series lays in the bonds between the primary and secondary characters - those family by blood and those by choice. That is always the core of Roberts' trilogies - the relationships between the characters. How they start, how they grow and develop, and how that growth blooms into something that feels true and abiding. In that respect, this series (and all the others) is far greater than the sum of each individual book, and one of the most significant drawing points for me when I'm reading Roberts. I may not have been quite as fond of Red Lily as I was ofBlue DahliaandBlack Rose, but together, the trilogy was a pleasure and a treat and I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys a ghost, a mystery, and strong, independent women coming together with the men who love them.Reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another."},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"This genre is not what I usually read.

Oh yeah, its about a ghost who haunts this beautiful mansion of a house, the Harper House. Then the author takes you on a roller coaster ride into the world of flowers and propagation of flowers/plants. To be honest, not that interested in it at all. Okay, some, but not as thorough as she wrote about it. No. She didn't write nearly enough about the past Harper family nor present Harper family. The author went back and forth from present time to past time about the family to tell the readers how the ghost happened to be, but still not enough, though. I felt that she should have written more of the Harper family than the people that they would eventually marry in the Harper family, which to me, didn't make any sense. Again, I think the author should have focused on the main characters, the Harpers. I will continue to read Nora Robert's books but this just didn't hit it over the ballpark like her other books. Sorry.P.S. Sorry, I didn't write a review of this particular book but the overall series. I hope what I said inspires you to read the series anyway, because, hay, it's Nora Roberts. We still love to read her books eventhough a few aren't as good as the ones we've read in the past. Still, enjoy!"},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"This was so hard to get into. I didn't feel any connection between the two main characters. I didn't feel anything for anyone, in fact. In this book, Roberts didn't really go into how any of the characters were feeling. The only part in the whole book that had emotion was the prologue. From then on, it was just...flat. It was more like watching things happening. People talking. Doing things. But there was no passion or anything. The romantic relationship and the plot were not really write well together. I sometimes had no idea what they were talking about when the subject of the ghost and the history came up, because they were so vague with what they said."},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"I'm wanting more CH/Stackhouse books,but tried this to fill theno book gap...it is a good read.I'm planning to try her othersnext payday !!!"},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"I'm a huge fan of Nora Robberts books to begin with so Red Lily was even more enjoyable then I had planned.

Keep up the great work, Nora!"},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"It was one of the best readings book I have read in a while and very nice condition"},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"Don't get me wrong, I love Nora Roberts. Unfortunately, this book lacks character development. I seriously doubt you would understand this book without reading the prior 2 books of the trilogy. What is the point of 3 different books if they can't stand alone. Further, the garden terminology in this book makes some parts difficult to understand. I tend to enjoy reading fictional books without the need for referencing botany textbooks. I eagerly awaited this book hoping it would be better than the first 2 of the trilogy. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. Maybe Nora Roberts has burnt out."},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"I've found that after the first two I was very into finding out what happened to the third Character. As with all three in this series I found the beginning a tad slow, but by the second disc on Red Lily it definitely started picking up to where I couldn't wait to get in my car to listen to it. I really started caring for these characters."},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"Nora Roberts finishes her In the Garden trilogy with RED LILY and does it in grand style. The Ghost of Harper House, who has been haunting the characters as well as the readers in these books, finally has an identity along with the entire story of what happened to her. Even though the ending is a bit blah, the rest of the book will leave you feeling great!In BLUE DAHLIA, Stella took on The Harper Bride, as the ghost is known, and we found out her real name was Amelia. In the second installation, THE BLACK ROSE, we learn a bit more about Amelia but can't figure out what caused her death or what can be done to put her to rest. That story featured Roz Harper Ashby. The entire story is summarily told in RED LILY which features Harper Ashby (Roz's son) and Hayley who have been romantically dancing around each other for two books.Since this is a romance series, Roberts doesn't disappoint the reader and has a wide variety of characters, some of whom make interesting couples. Stella met and fell in love with Logan, the unorganized hunky landscape contractor giving credence to the old adage, \\"opposites attract\\" in BLUE DAHLIA. Roz hired a genealogist (Mitch) to help identify The Bride in THE BLACK ROSE and ended up falling for him, proving that second chances are indeed sweet. And in RED LILY we're given insight into Hayley and Harper who finally stop denying their true feelings and fall in love. Yep, romance books can tie up those loose ends in very tidy bows and this trilogy is no different.The thing that Nora Roberts does best is thrown in a little intrigue to keep the story interesting. Throughout the series we're given insight into the Harpers and learn that Reginald (Roz's Great-grandfather) was a monster but the question remained throughout as to whether he actually killed Amelia. We find that answer in RED LILY.Hayley is overcome by the ghost and relives what happened to Amelia more than one hundred years ago. Some of these occurrences seem a bit far-fetched, but it did make the story more interesting. Through these possessions the tragic story of Amelia Conner comes to be known. If you don't have an imagination, then this part of the story will be hard to grasp. If you can put down the barricades and just fanaticize, then it will be enjoyable.The characters are colorful and dynamic, as are most of the ones created by Nora Roberts. The stories focus more on the female leads and the men are mostly in the background. RED LILY features Hayley who is colorful, strong, and very interesting, especially when she is spouting off useless trivia that she has obtained somewhere along the way. Harper is a hunk who is more comfortable in his greenhouses with his plants than among people. You can't get much more fun characters than the support cast. David is wonderful and I only wish a book could have been added to spotlight him! Roz, Mitch, Stella, and Logan were all highlighted in previous books but their lives continue to unfold in this one.Overall RED LILY is a very enjoyable reading adventure. It's not one that will make your brain work overtime, but feels like an old friend telling a story that will make you sigh and smile."},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"i took this on vacation and never put it down. i read it on the plane, on the beach , before bed and in the morning . it didnt have those boring decription pages where you have to skip through half the book to get to the story . it was consistantly interesting. i loved the romance , the ghost, the family and the issues .. great book"},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"Roberts introduces 3 women whose lives become intertwined. Roz, the elegant 40 something Southern lady and owner of Harper House/In the Garden nursery and retail store. Stella, the 30 something mother and perfectionist Yankee Manager of In the Garden. And Hayley, the pregnant 20 something distant cousin of Roz who also works at In The Garden. The store and gardening/gardens are very prominent inn the trilogy. For those who don't like gardens or gardening, you won't like all of NR's descriptions and gardening details.The Harper Bride and her story is a wonderful ghost story and her presence, the mystery of her identity, and what happened to her become paramont to the three women, especially when romance finds each woman. Roberts blends romantic suspense and a ghost story to lead the reader to last sentence in the trilogy.The Blue Dahlia focuses on Stella who loses her husband and is left to raise her young sons. She moves back to Memphis to be closer to her father and step-mother while she manages Roz's In The Garden. Stella learns she must live in Harper House with Roz and David. She worries about her sons when she hears a lullaby sung by no-one she can see, but feels the chill of the Harper Bride. She is driving crazy everyone at work, especially hunky Logan. When Stella and Logan make a connection, the Harper Bride invades her dreams. Could the Bride-always benign in the past-hurt Stella by harming her boys and Logan?The Black Rose is Roz's story, though Stella and Hayley are still living at Harper House. Stella is still lovingly General Rothchild and Hayley still amuses everyone with her charming naivete and factoids. Roz loves being an honorary grandmother to Stella's boys and Hayley's Lily, but needs more and turns to her In the Garden business to create a new 'baby' for herself. Sexy Dr. Carnegie now can devote his time to the Harper Bride mystery and to Roz herself if she'll let him. But Bryce and the Harper Bride have other plans. Roz's reputation, business, and life are in danger. Could Blood kill blood? As Mitch Carnegie gets closer to Roz and the identity of the Harper Bride, the Bride grows more demonic and dangerous.The Red Lily finishes the Harper's Bride story using Hayley. The Bride finds Hayley's sympathy and flesh inviting. Harper, Roz's son, finally admits to himself and to Hayley that he, too, loves her since he first saw her. Hayley feels the same towards Harper but will she risk their friendship and his life to be with him. Lily is already calling Harper Daddy, much to the displeasure of the Bride. Harper looks so much like Reginald, and must die. Does Hayley follow her heart or will she protect Harper from the Bride? Whatever she does, Hayley knows the Hazper Bride will be out of women's lives for good.The Black Rose was the BEST in the Trilogy, while Red Lily was the weakest. In Red Lily, Hayley became a caricature of her character than in the other books. The character was more crass and less confident. In The Garden was perfect, despite major destruction in The Black Rose. Roberts tells her readers that the garden will be important in each book's letter to the reader. Either she lost focus or Roberts was up against a hard deadline, but all in all the Trilogy is worth reading. 4 stars on the Trilogy."},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"Of the three books in this trilogy, RED LILY is my favorite. Robert's flair for weaving together multiple characters and their relationships is very well done. The suspense of the story reaches its peak in this book and doesn't disappoint, plunging Hayley deep into Amelia's tortured world. I couldn't read fast enough to find out what was happening next. I do find that many of Robert's characters are very much alike from book to book, but the interesting storylines and strong women characters keep drawing me back to buy her books time after time.AJ CaywoodAuthor of Stay in the Light"},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"I love Nora Roberts, including this trilogy.

I normally LOVE Nora Roberts books; the MacGregor series and her Gallagher trilogy are amoung my favorite books of all time. Normally, Roberts trilogies have some fantastic or magical element that she effortlessly weaves into the plot that makes the relationships of the characters more believeable but in this case I think that she would have been better off dumping the whole subplot of the ghost. It was incredibly stupid and just dumb (for lack of a better word). I believe that the relationships between the main characters in this book (and the other books in this series) would have been better without this ghost-hunting. It was difficult to take Harper or Haley seriously as individuals while they were discussing their encounters with this ghost.Also, I did not feel that either of these characters were as developed as the other characters in the series. That is not to say that the other two books had well developed characters but I felt that the two in this book were simply thrown together because it was expected. At least in the previous books, Roberts tried to create 'realistic' situations for the romantic relationships to develop. Here she just gave up and threw them together. Harper was not a developed character at all. Haley was a moron.In general, the plot of this book was borind and there was absolutely no flow at all (it took her 300+ pages to tell a story that could have been told in 200). And the ending was SO stupid.I had to force myself to sit down and finish it and I have NEVER had to do that for any of the other Roberts books that I have read.Don't waste your money on this worthless book. I would suggest Jewels of the Sun (the first book in the Gallagher series) if you are really interested in reading a good Roberts trilogy."},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"I have been waiting impatiently all summer for this book to come out.

I loved Harper and Hailey's romance and I especially loved the scary ghost! I got lots and lots of shivers reading this! Delightfully spooky with a very satisfying ending. If you've read the first two, don't miss this one!"},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"This is the last book of the In the Garden Trilogy. I didn't read the others, but found this one a good stand alone read. I listen to audio versions of books and this one is well done by Suzie Breck. I must say though that I nearly dumped the book after the prologue. I'm not into historical fiction and this one sounded really strange, opening with a mistress (Amelia Conner) coming to reclaim her child who has been stolen by his father in the 1890s. The book came highly recommended, so I thought I'd give it a chance though and I'm glad I did because starting in chapter one I understood where the book was going and the reason for the prologue. Even though I found the main character and Ghost posessed, Hayley to be somewhat of a crude flake at times, she was endearing and I enjoyed the warmth shared by her and the Harper family."},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"book in excellent condition, almost looks like nobody read it yet. good value for the money. loved shopping this way. i plan to do it again."},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"I love Nora Roberts' series - and this one didn't disappoint!

Contrary to some opinions, I truly enjoyed this book. The first part was really nice when you get to watch two people torn apart by their growing love for each other and sense of propriety. The second part got a bit heavy on gosts, but really nothing to keep you awake at night.I wonder what Nora's next series will be about. This one was very nice!"},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"The story was slow, predictable and boring. I am still amazed I hung in there and finished reading it. It's a dud in my opinion."},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"This trilogy was a little disappointing. I can't imagine being an author, like Nora Roberts, and putting out best sellars all the time, still, she has set a certain standard. Which this time, I don't feel like she quite got there. Still an entertaining read, but not the best work for Nora Roberts."},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"A great finale to an interesting trilogy."},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"Nora Roberts once again makes you feel as you are a part of the story. Her writing takes you deep into each character until you feel you have met them all personally. Just like Nora....you cannot put it down once you start reading!"},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"I truly hope that the author doesn't write any more trilogies anytime soon, since she continues to repeat the same six male and female characters in each of them. Hayley is the typical estrogen driven, desperately needy stereotype who has zero control over her emotions and is so self delusional about her \\"motivations\\" not to entrap Harper into a marriage because she \\"accidently\\" got pregnant with him, and/or to secure her dream house which just happens to be the Harper House, that she is downright laughable.The \\"babies, babies, babies\\" theme continues here until it overwhelms one. The mawkish, patronizing dialogs between the characters, particularly the females, comes across as entirely phony and irritating. No one in real life talks in that saccharine manner between their family members. Then, there is Harper finding the watery grave for the physical remains of the ghost Amelia within a period of 2 hours is hilarious. The channeled delusions and \\"inhabitation\\" by Amelia which Hayley allegedly \\"receives\\" is another howler. Not even Hayley's emotional lability can excuse this one.On the PLUS side: At several points when the author steps away from the cuteness and silliness of her storyline and \\"gets down\\" with some real dialog she soars. But this doesn't happen until nearly the last 1/4 of the story. Thankfully, the sex scenes are far more classy and there are none of the \\"melting bones\\", etc. imagry that used to populate her female characters' inner dialogs. Well done!Having read every book that this author has ever written, I feel that at this point, her best work is in her crime-romance books that she writes under her nom de plume J.D. Robb. In those stories her heroine Eve Dallas is a character with guts and common sense. A modern woman.However, that can't be said about these fluffy, psuedo-mystical tales of this trilogy. IMO, it is so full of psychobabble, name dropping of current celebrities and label waving that it becomes soooo yesterday the day it is published. The characters are increasingly repellant in addition to being repetitive. I hope that Ms. Roberts will forge ahead and leave fluff behind. She is so much better than this. Check out her \\"In Death\\" series. It is fantastic."},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"it took a while to arrive, but the book showed up eventually in the expected condition. i don't know what else to say."},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"Harper Ashby and Hayley Phillips have been circling around their attraction for each other for quite awhile now. Neither wants to ruin the special friendship they have established, but both crave for something more. The chance to love each other is there and they are going to grab it with both hands. Along with Hayley's young daughter Lily, Harper and Hayley start to form a family.However, all is not right at Harper House. Amelia, the ghostly presence that has lived in the house since the late 1890s is getting more violent, more unpredictable. She's been taking over Hayley's body, using Hayley in order to get her story across. It's taking a heavy toll on Hayley, along with Roz and Stella and company. This close knit group must find a way to rid Harper House forever of Amelia's ghost, while also providing a fitting ending for a woman who was treated shabbily in life. Can they do it, or is Amelia destined to haunt Harper House forever?Red Lily is the fabulous conclusion for Nora Roberts latest trilogy. This is a truly creepy novel, more so in my opinion than previous Roberts' trilogies have been. The way Amelia subtly and slyly takes over Hayley's body is spooky to read about, but is counterbalanced nicely by the blooming relationship between Hayley and Harper. Also enjoyable for this reader was catching up with the other tenants of Harper House.This is by far the best of the three stories, and even if you weren't all that thrilled by Blue Dahlia and Black Rose, as I myself wasn't, I think you'll find Red Lily to be a fast-paced, and action packed romance that definitely shows off Ms. Roberts romance talent once again.All in all, this is suspenseful and romantic tale that will keep you on the edge with the mystery surrounding Amelia."},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"Harper and Haley finally get their story. Through the entire series they have gotten to know and love each other. Haley came to Harper House pregnant and very alone, but now has a large extended loving family. She is desperate to let Harper know her feelings, but fears from both of them keep desires hidden.Amelia, the Harper Bride escalates her violent tendencies as soon as the love between Haley and Harper becomes evident. Haley, Harper, Roz, Mitch, Stella, and Logan race against time to solve the mystery before something tragic happens.The final book in the garden series did not disappoint!! I loved the entire series, and it will be a permanent addition to my library."},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"As slow and meandering as the first two books in Nora Roberts' In the Garden trilogy were, \\"Red Lily\\" is the exact opposite. In a fast-paced, interesting, romantic thriller, Roberts is back to herself as she tells two stories at once: the romance of single mother Hayley and Roz's eldest son Harper--and the escalating haunting of the ghost who wants something from Hayley and is willing to posseses her to get it. But what does she want?Nora comes back alive in this book as she describes Hayley's winsomly darling baby daughter, Lily--one cannot help thinking that the author is describing her own adored grandbaby, it seems so real and true! The romance is perhaps a bit less graphic than in past books, but just as pleasing as always, and the dialogue is fresh and \\"now\\" and right.I'm so glad to see Nora back in the groove. I believe that she has settled happily and comfortably into the third stage of a women's life--wife and grandma--and this book positively shimmers with that happiness. I lift a glass of wine to her and this wonderful book."},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"I really hate to give Nora Roberts low marks on a book, but this one leaves me no choice. Instead of a neat wrap to a compelling trilogy, it was more of a dragged-out ending to a story that just didn't stretch far enough. In \\"Blue Dahlia\\" we met the whole crew starring in this series and got an introduction to the Harper Bride, who haunts Harper House, where most of them live. In \\"Black Rose\\" we learned more about the Harper family, and how the Harper Bride fit into it. In this book, the rest of the secrets about the Harper Bride were revealed, but as to the romance, it felt like a rehash of things we already read in books 1 and 2.Hayley Phillips appeared at Harper House in \\"Blue Dahlia,\\" pregnant and alone in the world. She's a distant cousin by marriage of Roz Harper, the mistress of Harper House, and the owner of the gardening center she started. Even six months pregnant, Hayley caught the eye of Harper Ashby, Roz's eldest son who lives in a guest house on the property and works with grafting and other technical aspects of running the garden center. Hayley's daughter Lily was born in the second book, and loves Harper like she would a daddy, so Hayley is fearful if she follows her feelings for Harper that everything will get messed up and she'll have to leave her wonderful new home. When she finally acts on her feelings and finds that Harper reciprocates, there isn't much more to be said. So, instead of having their budding relationship develop, there are too many scenes where Hayley discusses her feelings with Roz, while going on and on about how odd it is to discuss her love life with her lover's mother.Meanwhile, the Harper Bride is becoming a lot more than a benign ghost who sings to children and breaks the occasional dish. Amelia, as the ghost is known, starts to inhabit Hayley's body and mind, often sliding her own peevish thoughts in with Hayley's, and showing Hayley the world through her twisted view. Because of this, the crew at Harper House becomes a bunch of amateur psychologists who analyze the whys and wherefores of the ghost's thoughts, feelings, and lifestyle. In short, it became a bit much. I half expected them to call Dr. Mira for her input, but they appeared to have it all worked out themselves, all the way down to determining that the resident ghost really wouldn't have been a good mother after all. I also just didn't care for the way the final showdown with the ghost went down. It was too obvious what was going to happen, as well as being a bit anticlimactic.Naturally, a person can't read the first two books of this trilogy and skip the third. Just don't expect as much from this one as the first two. All three books are filled with likeable and admirable characters. It just felt as if the story had already been told by the time we got to the third book."},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"Nora did not disappoint. Contrary to some reviewers, I found this last book in the \\"In the Garden\\" trilogy a well-written, well-played out conclusion to a most interesting story. Red Lily is Hayley's story and very descriptive of a young woman with a great deal of love to share and a great desire to share it with Harper Ashby. Unbeknownst to Hayley, Harper had always had an attraction to her, however, neither one felt it was the proper time or circumstance to act upon their feelings. Hayley makes the first move and that is all it takes for their relationship to blossom. Hayley's little girl is just fascinated by Harper and this should make for a \\"happy ever after\\" ending were it not for the resident ghost, Amelia. Amelia has taken a special interest in Hayley and decides to take over her body as well as her mind to right the injustice that had been done to her over 100 years ago. Just as Stella and Roz had experienced her wrath, Hayley pays the price of falling in love, thus irritating the Harper Bride. It is most interesting how Nora Roberts weaves a tale of suspense and intrigue with the characters we have come to love in this series. Stella, Logan, Roz, Mitch, Harper, Hayley and David all come together to bring about peace and justice and to uncover the mystery of Reginald Harper (Roz's great grandfather) and the consequence of his actions played out through many generations. You will not want to miss the conclusion to this series. Red Lily is definitely worth the read."},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"If you haven't been reading the \\"In the Garden\\" trilogy, I highly recommend the first 2 books. This can be read stand alone as enough background is given with the setup and first few chapters. The series follows the stories of 3 women who come to live at Harper House in Tennessee and are at various stages in their lives: Stella who had been suddenly widowed and left with 2 young boys in Michigan and moves back to the place of her birth to get a better job and be near her father and wonderful stepmom; Rosalind (Roz) Harper Ashby who is 45+ and has raised 3 boys to adulthood and started her own nursery business, \\"In the Garden\\" when she was widowed and finally Hayley a very distant cousin of Roz's who comes to her 6 months pregnant and unmarried to get a job at In the Garden. Roz, Stella and Hayley have formed very close bonds of friendship. By this third book, Roz and Stella are married and all 3 have encounterd the \\"Harper Bride\\" ghost. They have worked hard with Logan, Mitch and Harper and Dave to identify the ghost. They know her name is Amelia and that she was most likely a mistress to Roz's Great-grandfather. In the first two books, Roz and Stella find new loves and are married. Now Hayley has her 14 month old daughter Lily and is working hard but finds herself with the \\"hots\\" for Harper, Roz's oldest son who works at In the Garden behind the scenes mostly doing propagation and making hybrids and so on. Harper has also been attracted to Hayley for sometime but thinks SHE thinks of him as a brother and so has not made any moves.As Hayley and Harper begin to act on the attraction they feel, time, Amelia's ghost is making herself more known to Hayley and sometimes in a very dramatic \\"possession\\" type of way. This becomes very scary and unnerving to both Hayley and Harper.I felt Nora Roberts did a wonderful job and both the romantic lines and the investigations into learning the full truth about Amelia!! NR did a great job also describing Hayley's daughter Lily and her antics and relationship with Harper. Harper's love for Lily too was wondefully done with humor and affection. The real detective work and contributions by Mitch, Hayley, Roz and Harper to uncover the full and complete truth and put things to right were right on the money. I also love how NR keeps some humor in her stories which helps bring realism to even this \\"ghost\\" story!!A fun read!!"},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"Nora Roberts' greatest talent is in creating a realistic sense of place for the reader. She is better than almost all other present-day writers in this area. In the \\"In the Garden\\" trilogy, she takes us to a large plant nursery outside Memphis and makes it so that we can see the mansion, the gardens, carriage house, indeed, the entire locale. One almost feels that he has been there. Roberts creates the same realism in her other novels--Alaska, an island off New England, the Louisiana Bayous, etc. I would add as an aside that gardens are a recurring theme in Ms. Roberts' works, even in frigid \\"Northern Lights.\\"Her characters are generally engaging, but she throws in one in \\"In the Garden\\" who is, for lack of a better term, annoying. The genealogist is supposed to be a \\"hottie,\\" attracted to Ros, the principle character in the middle book, \\"Black Rose.\\" But the genealogist/professor is pedantic one moment, as he carefully explains for the ignorant, and sappy the next as he romances his employer, Ros. A somewhat similar character appears in the Three Sisters Island trilogy by Ms. Roberts: a \\"scientist\\" who is investigating witches by using vaguely described technical instruments. The genealogist and quasi-scientist could have been of some other occupation and the books would have been better.I can accept witches and ghosts in fiction. They are part of a long literary tradition, from Shakespeare to J.K. Rowling. The failing is when a writer tries to look at ghosts and witches with some modern-scientific and logical perspective and thus destroys the illusion. The only exception is when this is done humorously, as in \\"Ghostbusters,\\" and even then the results are questionable and silly.The plots are OK in all Ms. Roberts' books--nothing spectacular--just OK. She throws in sex scenes, generally two per novel. They are warm and gauzy sex scenes, lacking in specifics such as one came to accept in old movies. I suppose these episodes are necessary for some readers, but I don't believe the gratuitous bedroom (or in one case, the lawn} scenes add anything worthwhile.Closer editing would help in numerous cases. Surprising errors occur. The Atlanta Braves, for example, do not play the Seattle Mariners--ever. Celiac disease was unknown in Ros' grandfather's infancy. College basketball players cannot be drafted 10th in the first round by the Boston Celtics and still be playing college ball. Etc. Some may consider these niggling points, but they are the sort of thing that can puncture the balloon of reality for a reader.Despite the imperfections, the books are fine examples of escapist literature. I would not call them \\"chic lit.\\" The term itself is somehow offensive. Fiction is either good or bad or somewhere in between. To defend a book's shortcomings by saying, \\"Well, it was written for women\\" is saying, \\"Well, it may be a bad book but women have no taste.\\" I cannot accept that.Nora Roberts' books are not perfect. Few novels are. But the atmosphere alone is sufficient to bring me to read more by this writer."},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"When Hayley Phillips came to Memphis to look up her distant cousin, Rosalind Harper, she never imagined where she'd end up just a few years down the road. Finding a job was what she was hoping for, finding a family was something she least expected.Now two years later, her daughter Lily is 18 months old. While Hayley always admired Harper Ashby from afar, she never acted on her attraction. For one thing she had neither the time nor the energy to purse any sort of relationship. She also would never jepordize her place in the Harper household by going after Roz's son. Soon, her attraction to Harper overcomes her common sense and she shows him how she feels. She never expected that he felt the same.Harper Ashby was bowled over by Hayley when she first showed up at Harper House, very pregnant and very alone. He never expected to be physically attracted to a woman who was six months pregnant. As the months passed, Harper's feelings for Hayley grow into something more, something that he can no longer deny.This is the conclusion of the IN THE GARDEN trilogy. While in the previous two books, Amelia is somewhat of a benign presense, in RED LILY, she is determined to be heard. She does this by possessing Hayley's body. Soon Harper and Haley along with Logan, Stella, Roz, and Mitch are racing to find out what happened to Amelia before she hurts Hayley in her quest for vengeance.While I'm not one for ghost stories, Nora Roberts made this so real that I was a little creeped out going to bed the night I finished it. From the beginning, I bounced back and forth between feeling sorry for and despising Amelia. I think that Roberts wrapped this series up very nicely."},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"Red Lily is clearly the best book in the series. While reading this one I could visualize the scenes. This book would make a good movie, but I can't decide under what category it would fit into.

With all the talk of a ghost (as the rest of the series) this book it isn't a believable read as much as a fun read."},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"This is the conclusion of the Trilogy. It tells the story of Hayley Phillips, a young mother who came to Memphis to start a new life. What she finds is a new job, a beautiful home she shares with her distant cousin Roz and some new best friends. What she didn't count on was falling in love with Roz's son Harper. She also didn't count on being possessed by the family ghost. Through the many interactions with Amelia they find out what happened to her and they finally put her to rest. This was a pretty good book . The only thing I didn't like about this trilogy was the gardening descriptions which really bored me. I skipped those parts. Even though I did skip those parts I still liked it!! So it didn't keep me from enjoying it."},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"In this series, in the prior book, Mitch was presented as a genealogist helping the family identify the origins of its ghost. In this book, on p. 134 (pb ed.) he supposedly identifies the name of the ghost.From the 1890 census.Which burned and is not available for genealogical research.Okay, it's a romance novel. But, still, one expects more of a professional writer."},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"This was the final book from the \`In the Garden' trilogy and focused on the romance between Harper and Hailey. We all knew this match was forthcoming, but it was a major disappointment; Harper and Hailey were not particularly romantic together. It seemed, at least to me, that most of the book was focused on the Harper Ghost and Hailey's daughter, Lily. Although Harper and Hailey do \`get together' in this book, most of the groundwork for their romance comes from the first two books. Aside from being pretty skimpy in terms of romance, this book was flat-out unbelievable. Hailey is \`inhabited' by the Harper ghost during odd moments (like while having sex), and it was just too surreal to even make it good fiction. The entire trilogy was weak and I wouldn't recommend this book. I only finished it because I had read the first two."},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"I've always been a huge Nora Roberts fan, but some of her newer books, this one included, are too formulic for me.

Hayley, Red Lily's main character, reminded me a lot of Zoe from Key of Valor (spunky single mom, wants the best for her child, etc.)The whole ghost thing with Amelia, and her possession of Hayley, got old.I have always enjoyed Roberts' writing, and have kept many of her books, but these are going to the secondhand store."},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"A great ending to a good series, I would definitely read more books from this author.

I OVER LOVE the Three Sister's Island trilogy, my most favorite of all.I notice others who commented on this trilogy about the \\"slow pace\\" of the other 2 books to this series and totally disagree.I believe a trilogy is all about scooping you up in the first book and gliding you along and giving you the history and beginnings of the storyline. As you come to the end of the first book, I am enthralled and begin the 2nd book where I am swept futher into the story and become engrossed to the point of \\"nothing else in my life is going to get attention till I get to the end of this trilogy.\\"As you become attached to book 2, you MUST have book 3 and become one and the same with the characters till you own them as your own.This conclusion to the \\"in the garden\\" series escalated to a climax totally NOT where you think it would go as far as the Harper Bride is concerned.Hayley, Lily and Harper become the unit you saw happenning in book 1 to the extent that you couldn't possibly see it any other way.I won't bore you with the storylines, as you can read excerpts from others and the front of the book gives you a hint.I would suggest that you have all 3 books to sit and read at once.In this one, we continue with a ghost haunting... it takes the lives/loves of three fabulous couples to find the answers to Who? What? Where? When? and How? Kinda like a mystery within a romance.I am not big into mysteries, cuz I am a romantic at heart, so the mystery does not overshadow the romanace and gives a little intrigue.... I DID enjoy this haunting.You started with Stella in Book 1 \\"Blue Dahlia\\", widow and mother of two boys, who finds Logan; and then on with Roz and Mitch, \\"Black Rose\\", 40's, three grown boys and the 'matriarch' in this storyline. No, not the mother but the one who brings the 3 women together in her fabulous home and creates a sisterhood/family throughout this trilogy.The intensity of the storyline continues and the lives blend further. It's a \\"can't put this down\\" book.The storyline will end with Hayley, young pregnant and brave, who struggles with herself before she falls for Harper.I absolutely LOVED David in here as well, and wish there had been a storyline for him that ended in a romance as well.This is not the first time I have read this trilogy. I keep and reread these stories every few years. I never want to put the books down.Great read, but plan for a full week of reading if you have all 3 books in this trilogy."},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"This not a disappointing ending to the 3 books. It is different than the others and that is good. Read all three, you will love them."},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"I came away from this conclusion to Roberts' \\"In the Garden\\" trilogy a bit disappointed, but satisfied overall. There was just a bit too much of the stereotypical ghost behavior, although I was quite pleased at the different approach from the other two novels. The characters remain sympathetic and likable, although I think Hayley is just a bit too sicky sweet for my taste. The chemistry remains light and easy. The d&eacute;nouement was a tiny bit anticlimactic, but the drama and excitement beforehand made up for it somewhat.All in all, a fitting end to an excellent trilogy by an author who rarely lets her readers down. While not one of Roberts' strongest series, it is quite enjoyable and memorable."},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"Nora Roberts is always a good read and she does not disappoint with this series."},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"I always hate when trilogies end, and the \\"In the Garden\\" trilogy (Blue Dahlia (In the Garden, Book 1),Black Rose: In the Garden Trilogy (In the Garden), and now RED LILY) is no exception. You get to know the characters so completely, and feel such a connection with them, that they become almost real--and you just want to keep on reading about their lives!RED LILY is the story of Harper Ashby, oldest son of Rosalind (BLACK ROSE), and Hayley Phillips. Hayley had come to Harper House the previous year, pregnant and alone, to beseech Roz, a distant cousin through marriage, for a job. Unwed, with her baby's father out of the picture, Hayley wasn't looking for a handout, but for a chance to start over. What Roz offered her was so much more--a job, a place to stay at the renowned Harper House, and a family.Now she has her daughter Lily, a great job, and a roof over her head, but lately she's been thinking of Harper, the man whose been her friend through it all, in a brand-new light--that of a love interest. Afraid to ruin their friendship by telling him how she feels, she keeps quiet. Harper, on the other hand, has wanted Hayley in a more than friendly fashion ever since he laid eyes upon her--pregnant and all--more than a year ago. But he's sure that she doesn't think of him in the same way, and he's leary of messing up the friendship that means to much to him.As these two friends--both wanting to be so much more--fight their attraction to each other, the resident ghost of the house, the Harper Bride, kicks into high gear. She's always been loving and kind to the children in the house, singing them lullabies in the night, but she seems to hate men, and she's become especially violent now that Hayley is entertaining thoughts of romance.As the whole crew--Roz and her new husband Mitch, a geneologist trying his hardest to discover who the Harper Bride really is; Stella and Logan, both employees of Roz's In the Garden shop; and Hayley and Harper, who live on Harper/Ashby land--try to figure out the Bride's agenda, their lives are in danger, and their hearts and passions intertwine with that of the ghost's.I loved this entire trilogy, and read RED LILY in one day. It was a perfect conclusion to this powerful family saga, and I was especially happy to finally learn the answers to who the Harper Bride was, and what happened to her.I will admit that there was one surprise twist to the storyline that I didn't see coming, and wasn't really thrilled with, but since Ms. Roberts wrote it and I didn't, I can't complain! Overall, the story was still great, and in time I learned to live with what I thought was an unnecessary plot device.Pick up this trilogy today--you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"Red Lily is the perfect ending to another great trilogy! I enjoyed this trilogy as much as every other NR to date. This one is a bit different though, I think Nora has spent more time in the first two books of this trilogy really examining each character more than usual. Where I normally read a NR book in a day, these took me a weekend each. I have been waiting impatiently for the finale, RED LILY.RED LILY is everything I had hoped it would be. I love the way it really wraps up all the stories so that I felt completion on the saga. This is the story of Harper & Haley, and it was a bit creepy at times with Amelia taking over her body...but it really works with the storyline. I'm not going to tell you the plot and give anything else away, but I will say this: READ THIS BOOK!

The final book in this trilogy is just wonderful. I love the way that this series stressed that women could be strong and independent, yet still have quality men in their lives. And, of course, the bit of supernatural was an intriquing way to hook them all together. I was excited to add this one to my collection!"},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"The third book kept us interested right to the end, couldn't put it down. You will enjoy the three 'flower' books."},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"I have never felt compelled to write a book review before, but certain aspects of this book are quite disapointing.Without giving away the entire plot of the book, Roberts completely sidesteps a huge moral issue. It is an important enough plot point that the rest of the book and the two earlier books in the trilogy now ring false.Additionally, the dialogue is ridiculous. Roberts has become so mannered with her character's dialogue that the book is full of one word sentences. I'm not sure how she expects that writing style to further the theme of the novel, but it is quite unsuccessful."},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"I thought this whole series was not up to her usual standards."},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"A bit disappointing...I guess I expected more, because I was told when I purchased this book that it was the best of the IN THE GARDEN trilogy. And that stands to reason when you expect the last to be the best. After all, isn't that when it's supposed to all come together? Not to mention that I did enjoy Black Rose-5-star and thought Blue Dahlia 3-star was an average read. Several of the novels with the NR seal have been about the supernatural and I have enjoyed most of those books. Plus, when you see the NR seal, it's almost a given to be a good read. And you'll note I emphasized \\"almost\\", because, obviously, you can please some of the people some of the time, but not all the people all the time. And so it was with Red Lily. The ending to this trilogy was a disappointment for me, especially after the first two novels.Hayley's character lost something in this book. Maybe I was just expecting her to mature. She didn't. Therefore, I have a hard time understanding how a guy like Harper could get hung up on such a childish person. And Roz, a very strong woman, just fizzed out. Grant it, the plot wasn't, and wasn't supposed to be, centered on her. Regardless, she just wasn't the same as I'd expected.Overall, it was mostly the plot that didn't turn me on. This one was just a bit too far-fetched. And to be quite honest, the ending just fell flat.Oh well, two out of three ain't bad. ;-)"},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"This book was the third book in the garden trilogy.

The story was boring and ridiculous. If you're looking for mindless drivel, this is the book for you.The reader was also terrible. Her presentation had Haley whining constantly while everyone else (in indistinguishable voices) talked in an admonishing tone."},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"I was disappointed. I did not see the connection between Haley and Harper. The story line was too predictable and rather boring. I hope Nora isn't losing her touch."},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"As with Blue Smoke, its pretty obvious the way things are going to turn out- ie, Haley with Harper. So there is no suspense there. The story of the ghost was much more interesting, but I do think Nora has trouble writing unlikable characters. The ghost becomes so appalling you are to be glad she was killed. Most people have alot of the gray area- her bad characters do not seem to. This trilogy was dissappointing to me- I did not feel transported to the world of the characters. Still, as always, any Nora book is a good book, but she has spoiled us with so many good ones, we notice the not so good ones."},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

You always have what I need and it's perfect when it arrives."},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"A Harper has always lived at Harper House, the centuries-old mansion just outside of Memphis. And for as long as anyone alive remembers, the ghostly Harper Bride has walked the halls, singing lullabies at night...Hayley Phillips came to Memphis hoping for a new start, for herself and her unborn child. She wasn't looking for a handout from her distant cousin Roz, just a job at her thriving In the Garden nursery. What she found was a home surrounded by beauty and the best friends she's ever had-including Roz's son Harper. To Hayley's delight, her new daughter Lily has really taken to him. To Hayley's chagrin, she has begun to dream about Harper-as much more than a friend...If Hayley gives in to her desire, she's afraid the foundation she's built with Harper will come tumbling down. Especially since she's begun to suspect that her feelings are no longer completely her own. Flashes of the past and erratic behavior make Hayley believe that the Harper Bride has found a way inside of her mind and body. It's time to put the Bride to rest once and for all, so Hayley can know her own heart again-and whether she's willing to risk it.Red Lily is just as enjoyable as Blue Dahlia and Black Rose in the In The Garden Trilogy. This time focusing on Hayley and her growing relationship with Harper, Roz's son. When she finally gives in and puts her feelings into actions she finds that he feels the same way about her. Soon after their discovery the Harper Bride starts her mischief.Perfectly pig-headed just as the other women around her, Hayley finds plenty of bumps in her new relationship. The discovery of her becoming pregnant with Harper's child doesn't make anything easier.As I have said with the other two books, which is the same that I feel about this one, Red Lily is an easy, smooth read. Enjoyable, during the times that the women cool down and relax a bit, and though not something that I would re-read, I would suggest it to several people as I know that it is more their cup of tea than mine.You may attempt to read just the first book, Blue Dahlia, just by its self and I guess you could if you like a bit of a cliff hanger and like to leave it that way. I would suggest that you give all three of the books their turn in the line up and be sure to enjoy them in the proper order as you will get a little lost here and there."},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"Harper and Haley finally get their story.

I reccomend this book to romance lovers andthose interested in a good ghost story!"},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"This is the third book in the Garden Trilogy. Personally I think this book lacked a bit of substance in describing Hayley. I feel I received a better glimpse into Stella and Roz' life and personalities in the first two books. It was really rich with Amelia, the Harper Bride ghost. All in all, a good trilogy series."},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"When I bought the In the Garden Trilogy, and started with Blue Dahlia, It took me awhile to get into. Usually when reading Nora the first chapter starts a frenzy of reading for me. But after I got acquainted with all of the characters I really fell in love with it. Blue Dahlia, and Black Rose were great, but my favorite of the series was Red Lily. I love the characters Hayley and Harper, they had chemistry from the first encounter in the first book. I love the way their relationship develops. All in all this was a stunning series, as always, and I enjoyed reading it very much."},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"In this final book of the In the Garden Trilogy, the friendship and love between Hayley and Harper really blossom. The characters we have come to know and understand from the first two books in the series come alive in Roberts' writing, and the chemistry of the main characters cannot be mistaken.When the Harper Bride ghost tries to get close by way of invading Hayley's body, the change in personality is distinctive and the reader feels the shift. (Roberts is a master of this subtlety!) So, what's a gal to do when her body has been taken over? Her family and friends step in to help Hayley and to help the ghost, all while running the nursery.Hayley lets herself be taken over, if only to help solve the mystery. The reader is taken into another realm, when the ghost lived, over a century ago. We see her love retreat, her gifts disappear, and her child taken from her. No wonder she is a tortured soul wandering the halls of the mansion!How this family, especially Harper and Hayley, come together to solve the mystery is an act of love between them. The reader feels how protective Harper is and how independent Hayley is, and how they build a bridge together to lay this soul to rest.Readers will enjoy classic Roberts' style in the closing novel of this trilogy. It is action-packed, intriguing, and will keep the reader hooked until the final page."},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"I liked the first two in the trilogy and am about to start Red Lily - yes, I haven't even read it. But it's a romance and not exactly hard to guess the plot.Aren't Harper and Hayley cousins though? Ick! I'm going to try to make my way through Red Lily and I am going to read reviews to see if I can find something that makes this not true. But isn't anyone else concerned she is going to date a relative???"},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and KritiquesWhen Hayley Phillips showed up on Roz Harper's doorstep, she was pregnant and desperate for a home and a job. Months have passed on now Hayley has a beautiful baby girl, Lily and a new happy life with Roz and company at In the Garden. Life couldn't get any better. Well maybe in one way it could...Roz's son Harper loves his job at the nursery developing new strains of flowers and greenery. He also has the love of his family and friends, and Hayley's baby girl. After much resistance from both parties, Harper and Hayley find themselves growing ever closer and wanting to explore the tender emotions between them. Unfortunately, The Harper Bride, ghost of the manor, is not willing to let that happen. Her efforts to destroy their happiness grow strong enough to threaten their lives. Now Harper and Hayley, and all the other members of the In the Garden family must get to the bottom of the mystery of the ghost before it's too late.After Hayley and Harper have danced around each other's affections in the preceding two books, they finally get their in Red Lily. The romance is deeper and stronger due to the length of time it took for them to find love together. Of course, no one can resist the adorable Lily and these three bond beautifully to form a new family. Their story is probably my favorite of the three found in the In the Garden trilogy.I've read each of Nora Roberts' paranormal trilogies to date and this one ranks high on my personal favorites list. She goes into great depth about the mystery of The Harper Bride and how it affects all the players. I love that almost as much time in Red Lily is dedicated to her story as it is to Hayley and Harper. We finally understand who she is and why she has haunted Harper House for so long. Readers will be happy with the resolution of her story.Once again Susie Breck does a masterful performance. She can reach the hearts of the readers, or better said listeners, than many narrators out there. She is a strong talent and has easily become one of my preferred performers of audio books. You can't go wrong with an audio book she makes.Kelley A. Hartsell, January 2007.

It has the momentum that good character and tense plot bring to a \\"good read\\" so that I didn't want to put the book down until I finished reading it. I found the denouement a bit weak at the end--the story seemed to stop in its tracks and that's they only reason I didn't give it five stars."},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"I read it, I enjoyed it, but there are many other better Roberts' books worth reading over and over. Not a keeper."},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"I too, like most who've read the first two books, eagerly awaited Red Lily. I was glad Roberts didn't spend the whole book with Haley and Harper pining for each other--she was straightforward and to the point with that. The book though focused on the more important plot line--that of discovering who Amelia Conner was and what happened to her. I love all Roberts books and wasn't disappointed by this one."},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"This was my first Nora Roberts and one of the only books I never finished. After several chapters, nothing had happened. No suspense was developed. Just page after page of aimless dialogue among a cast of cookie-cutter romance characters. Only the heroine had a personality - one so insipid and self-absorbed that I began to hope the dreaded ghost would get her. But even the supernatural failed to pump any energy into this listless story. I really wanted to like the author because she has so many books available, but if this is typical of her writing, I'm baffled by her popularity."},{"Title":"Red Lily (In the Garden)","review":"I didn't really like Red Lily. Even less then I disliked Blue Dahlia. I don't know what it was about this book but I just didn't find myself connecting with charactors Hayley and Harper were okay but not very memerable. The ghost story wasn't very exciting and I didn't care for the conclusion. I guess this just wasn't my cup of tea."},{"Title":"Risk and Resilience in Childhood: An Ecological Perspective","review":"This book reviews the theoretical constructs of risk and resilience and goes on to discuss specific childhood issues' risk and protective factors.

Use this book to spark interest in the resilience literature."},{"Title":"The Whole Foods Diabetic Cookbook","review":"Enhanced with information on diabetes and nutrition by Patricia Berton, The Whole Foods Diabetic Cookbook by Patricia Stevenson and Michael Cook offers an imaginative and diabetically sound approach to using whole grains, legumes, vegetables, and fruit in a culinary wealthy of meat-free recipes, each designed to help control diabetes naturally.

Even vegetarians can develop unhealthy eating habits adn need to learn better!I was disappointed in this cookbook, however. This is the kind of cookbook that was popular back in the 80's when American vegetarianism was all about brown rice, whole wheat flour, tofu and tempeh. These are fine and valuable components of a healthy veggie diet, but we've come a long way since in terms of aesthetics and variety.For example, is it really necessary to make french toast with tofu instead of milk and eggs? Or to add crumbled tofu to potato salad? I have a real problem with those who take a perfectly fine, nutritious and proven food item and make gratuitious additions of tofu and tempeh, just because. And I was very surprised to note that this cookbook does not cover the proper techniques for preparing tofu for cooking, because a truly well-prepared tofu dish can be quite delicious and possess interesting texture.The techiques and concepts in this book are just too dated and limited to appeal to today's informed cook, vegetarian or otherwise. If you are looking to add vegetarian meals to your diet or to better understand your vegetarian diabetic nutrition, you can do better than this book. I recommend the American Diabetic Association Month of Meals 'Vegetarian Pleasures' for a more up to date, equally nutritional approach."},{"Title":"The Whole Foods Diabetic Cookbook","review":"I am not diabetic but was looking for a cook book that had recipes that were low on the glycemic index. This is an awesome book for beginning vegetarians (like me) who want healthy recipes without a lot of ingredients.

In the first two weeks of eating whole vegetarian foods I lost 5 lbs and my partner lost 8 lbs."},{"Title":"The Whole Foods Diabetic Cookbook","review":"Expeected more from this cookbook.

It has great recipes as well being a very descriptive book...it tells you about \\"whole foods\\" products that I had not heard of before, and has food exchanges listed right with the recipes, as well as going into detail about fiber, sweeteners, soyfoods, and even a meal planner for a 1500 calorie diet! It's already one of my favorites!"},{"Title":"The Whole Foods Diabetic Cookbook","review":"Be aware that this collection is all vegetarian, making heavy use of a variety of soy products.

Balzac's country doctor describes in detail how he worked to improve the overall good of his community; the narrative is clear and readable without being preachy.

Depictions of moral and right behavior, responsibility for others, redemption, and spiritual strength resulted in a satisfying read. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Country Doctor (Le medecin de campagne)","review":"I wanted to read some books that reflected french culture.

There's much to admire and ponder in the philosophy of the good doctor, and there may be lessons here for a USA in decline. Alas, if only Balzac could have included a plot, and at least a hint of conflict with hope of a climax and resolution, the book might have kept my interest.If I return to read the rest of the book, it will be due to gems like these:\\"The peasant is always more willing to listen to the man who lays down rules for saving him from bodily ills than to the priest who exhorts him to save his soul.\\"\\"Religion forms the only adequate safeguard against the abuse of supreme power.

Her books are excellent as well as her psychic abilities are a phenomenon as you can see her on the Montel William Show every Wednesday. To really understand psychic abilities and what it feels like to be psychic read her books. They give you a deep religious meaning and take away any doubt these abilities or issues are evil. They help those of us with the same, but not as trained, abilities are normal and it feels good to have reinforcement there is nothing to fear and we are not alone. Her books help us better help others in a humanitarian role and allow others to heal--she gives great advice and knowledge in her books and helps many people feel relief and closure in many aspects of their lives. Her books give people hope especially after a bad series of luck that can last for years she tells people when things will change or what direction to have their Dr go in with their medical treatment. She writes her books according to what us the readers want to know by the thousands of questions she is asked on the Montel show, in her readings, or in her lectures. I have purchased many books of hers and have 6 more on my wish list I will be purchasing soon."},{"Title":"Phenomenon","review":"Yes, I read this book, so don't any of Browne's faithful out there waste time in asking in \\"rebuttal reviews\\" if I did. And yes this book made me more angry than the typical \\"Hi, I'm a psychic! Can I have your money now?\\" books of Browne's I've encountered in the past. I think it bothered me more than her past forays into \\"spirituality\\" because Browne here trespassed on so many areas of life she should have stayed out of, presuming to speak for God while trodding on the sacred and claiming to close the case on earthly mysteries deserving of scientific explanation. To Browne I'd like to say PROVE IT! Prove ONE thing you're claiming! People out there base their philosophies of life on what you say, and so back up this (perhaps immoral?) influence you have on them with some validation.It's a sad comment on the power of money that reputable publishing houses are putting books like Phenomenon out there under their imprimatur, all to meet the demand among humans who seek some glimmer of hope that magic exists and is there someplace.Browne's book is ridiculous, Browne's claims are silly, Browne is not even that talented at what she claims she does. I was reading an account just the other night, after completing this pathetic book, in which a woman on a website said she paid the money to have a reading by Browne, and of the twelve things Browne told her, NONE turned out to be true, including in one case Browne claiming a missing library book had been purloined by a \\"dark-haired stranger\\" when the book in question was later found behind a piece of furniture! How gross is that?How can someone's conscience let her get rich off of lies? How can the public be so mislead? To cash in on taking advantage of the vulnerable, the curious, the gullible, and the intellectually ungifted is shameful. On top of all that, this book wasn't even any good. Boring, dull, plodding, a rehash of old information re-heated for far from the first time, all supposedly written by a woman whose real gift is her ability to make money off the art of self-promotion, proving that even in the jaded 21st century there's a sucker born every minute. You know what's going to be really funny, though? When Sylvia Browne passes away, you can bet someone will make big bucks by claiming to be channeling HER!"},{"Title":"Phenomenon","review":"Phenomenon is a good to read if you believe there is life after this life.Things I thought I disagreed with Sylvia Browne on has actually brought things to light for me.

Until, I was feeling down, and was thinking why, what does it matter, who cares,so why should I even care?This was after my first part of the morning I was feeling good and glorious.

You never know how many people are curious about the paranormal.

This book changed my mind about her.Keep up the good work...."},{"Title":"Phenomenon","review":"This was an awesome price for this book even with shipping!! Great book if you're a Sylvia Browne fan."},{"Title":"Phenomenon","review":"When I bought this book, I was expecting long chapters on specific topics. I was a little disappointed to find out it was basically a book full of paranormal terms and their definitions. Despite this fact, I kept reading, and realized the book was actually really good. There were a lot of terms I'd never heard of that were explained, and that was interesting, and a lot of terms I had heard that were finally explained, and in a simple, easy to understand, makes sense kind of way. Ultimately, the book helped me to understand Sylvia Browne's view of the afterlife and all its side topics. And it made me feel good that no matter what happens in my life, at the end everything is going to be just fine. Because I planned it that way to learn from it all. It was pretty reassuring. I plan to look for more books from Sylvia Browne, not just for her experiences, but she was very entertaining as well."},{"Title":"Phenomenon","review":"\\"As time goes on, more and more people are figuring out that so-called \`psychic phenomena' aren't so unnatural or uncommon after all; that the worlds of the paranormal and spirituality are handmaidens to each other; and that both can actually deepen and enhance a whole spectrum of even the most devout religious beliefs.\\" - From the bookThe paranormal, mysterious, and unexplained have intrigued humankind for millennia. With the dawn of the internet, ancient wisdom and mystical lore are now at the fingertips of anyone with computer access. Concepts like the third eye, clairvoyance, the \\"silver cord\\", psychic detectives, reincarnation, chakras, and auras are making their way into the mainstream, and curiosity about the Other Side and \\"paranormal\\" experiences are at an all time high. However, some of these terms and practices may be unknown or confusing to those unfamiliar.Psychic and author Sylvia Browne has compiled a thorough encyclopedia of metaphysical topics in her book Phenomenon: Everything You Need to Know About the Paranormal. This 332-page book demystifies, explains, and sometimes debunks the various practices, experiences, and concepts of the New Age.Some of the topics she covers include:* Akashic Records* Armageddon* Cell Memory* The Chart* Exit Points* Glossolalia* Hall of Records* Imprints* Incubus* The Rapture* Poltergeists* Psychic Attacks* Remote Viewing* Synchronicity* Telepathy* Totems* The Underworld* Vortex* Walk-Ins* ZombiesAs one who is quite familiar with New Age topics (I was the New Age Editor for the 2nd largest women's site on the web for two years), I didn't expect to find anything new in Phenomenon. However, I found this book to be an engrossing read. Sylvia's concept that we all have Option Lines, which fall under seven life areas, is intriguing. Before we incarnate, we include an Option Line in our chart, which represents an area of challenge that we just can't seem to master. Despite our good intentions and attempts at improvement in this area, we just can't make it work out. For Sylvia-who has had three troubled marriages-her Option Line is Family. For myself, I recognized immediately that my Option Line was Social Life.The concept of Option Lines explains why some individuals just can't seem to find-or maintain-a healthy romantic relationship. I've had little patience with these types, especially as one who has had no trouble choosing, keeping, and thriving with a man. I now realize that these individuals aren't necessarily weak or stupid, but that they have a Family/Relationship Option Line in their chart. This realization has fostered a sense of compassion for sure.Sylvia's description of the Other Side was comforting and familiar, especially Cocooning, our Spirit Guide, The Council, Hall of Wisdom, and The Tunnel. Her accounts echo the experiences chronicled in books on past life regression-namely, Journey of Souls and Destiny of Souls, both by Dr. Michael Newton.If you're interested in TV shows like Medium and Ghost Whisperer-as well as \\"paranormal\\" practices such as Tarot, Astrology, Numerology, Palmistry, and Channeling-Phenomenon by Sylvia Browne is an absorbing read. This book will remind you that there is oh-so-much more to life than the \\"real\\" world in front of our eyes, affirming the reality of the spirit world, our Divine spark, and the loving, benevolent Beings who nurture and guide us."},{"Title":"Phenomenon","review":"Hey there. Just a quick note to all the haters and doubters out there. Don't judge before you have experienced. When I first encountered Sylvia Browne in the late 1990's, I used to think exactly as some of the reviewers of her books and her detractors characterize her. That is, as a useless and dangerous criminal charlatan. But then, something amazing happened. I got to actually be \\"read\\" by her at an event in Toronto at the Learning Annex. In the span of a minute and a half, Sylvia (through spot-on and specific references to people I know or have known, experiences I have had or was in the midst of having at the time, etc.) proved to me that she was for real.I am not talking about some John Roberts BS like, \\"I'm sensing someone by the name of G in the room.\\". I'm talking specific names, dates, events, chronology, and the relation between them. Then, after giving me a rundown of what was going on in my life at that time, she proceeded to tell me how everything was going to unfold in the next year. Well, all I have to say is that she was right on the money on all counts. Not only did what she said would happen happened, all of it occurred at exactly the order and time intervals she predicted. I will not divulge the details because this had to do with private matters that, frankly, are nobody's business but my own (another thing, even though we were in a large hall with hundreds of people, Sylvia maintained professionalism by not embarrasing me with too private a reading). Since then, I have had the priviledge of having 2 formal readings with her, each of which was just superb.There are those who say that she is not a serious scholar of the paranormal. But, I ask you, how in the hell can anyone be a serious scholar of the paranormal? By definition, the paranormal is fleeting, and subject to much interpretation from enumerable points of view. Nothing can be isolated and verified. None of it can be replicated. Therefore, there is no scientific basis for inquiry, right? What kind of sources can be sighted in such a course of study? A book by someone who read a book by someone who read another book by someone who swears that a friend of a friend 30 years ago saw some freaky crap happening in the night's sky, huh? Ridiculous.So, if you're picking up this book and saying to yourself \\"Who does this person think they are? They're going to tell me about life, about the paranormal, about my future?\\", just give it a try and see if you are not wholeheartedly convinced that Sylvia is the real thing. You might just actually feel all of your skepticism just slipping away into the ether."},{"Title":"Phenomenon","review":"This book is basically a dictionary for the terms used in the paranormal world. I have read most of Sylvia Browne's books so I found this one mainly repeating the same information. I did learn a couple of new things though. I would recommend this book for someone who really hasn't read much of Sylvia's books or just looking for more information on the subject. Overall, I was happy with the book."},{"Title":"Phenomenon","review":"I used to think the world of Sylvia Browne--until I started to read more widely about the paranormal. Now I can see how empty of content her books are. Whether its on paper or on television, Sylvia is obviously just spouting things off the top of her head--no validations or evidence needed.Writing books like \\"Phenomenon\\" make that process even easier. I've read so much about this subject in the past few years, enough to see that this book is a complete work of fantasy and imagination.Paranormal fantasies might be a fun read, if you're looking for fiction and imaginative free associations about other-worldly experiences with no basis in history or experience. But to really find out \\"Everything You Need to Know About the Paranormal\\" one should look to authors who've really done their RESEARCH.This book is definitely Not Recommended."},{"Title":"Phenomenon","review":"This book gives everyone a great understanding of the basic terminology used to describe most all things \\"paranormal\\" from someone that has decades of experience with and teaching about the so-called Paranormal World . Not as repetitious as some of her other later works with enough new stuff to be well worth the cash and effort to read it. I will keep this one close to my 'puter as one of my best reference books when 'discussing' this kind of stuff on line ."},{"Title":"Phenomenon","review":"I have read a few other guides to paranormal terms. This is perhaps the finest one I have ever read. This book should be a guide to those who believe and those who DO NOT, since this book is written by one of the finest psyhics of our time. She knows the terms and she explains their meaning beautifully and completely. Every university library should contain this volume. Enlightening!"},{"Title":"Phenomenon","review":"The book is organized as a large glossary or detailed dictionary of terms related to the paranormal. Despite that fact, a reasonable unity of presentation is maintained. The book is coherent. For those of us who are \\"muggles\\" and not very consciously connected to the paranormal, it gives good insights that might be completely true and useful. (How would we know?) In particular, sorcery is a load of rubbish. On the other hand, fairies and elves are entirely real and interesting. Maybe. I don't know that, so it is pleasant to read.If this book has a main failing, I think it is weak in the problem of explaining evil in the world. Mrs. Browne has no available devil or hell in her view of creation. Most of us reincarnate repeatedly, basing our excursions from a very secure version of Heaven that she terms as \\"Home.\\" That's fine, and I hope it's true. However, if we're really coming from a heavenly origin and returning to one, it seems quite unclear to me how we manage to go so badly wrong while we're here. Lots of selfishness and greed and gluttony and lust seems to get mixed in without a very good explanation why. If we are based in such a splendid and heavenly condition, there ought to be rather fewer Hitlers and Bormans and... you get the picture. Perhaps there is just more for her to write."},{"Title":"Phenomenon","review":"i loved this book, i was so surprised that it was set up like a dictonary. i have always loved sylvia when she's on Montell im glued to the tv. I can't wait for her next book, \\"If You Could See What I See\\""},{"Title":"Phenomenon","review":"PHENOMENON is packed with new,stories and perspectives from Miss Browne, though many seem strangely familiar. One wonders how she can \\"read\\" people on the spot, and even after this effort, the question lingers -- who or what is the source for predictions, for instance? Still, this is one of Miss Brown's better books."},{"Title":"Phenomenon","review":"I have always been interested in the supernatural and other mysterious things of that nature. This book is a great reference for anyone who is interested in subjects from astral travel to angels and heaven. The book is kind of like a dictionary of words that derive from those subjects that are the topic of many Sylvia Browne books making it easier for us to know what she is talking about. But overall it is a very interesting and thought provoking piece of literature."},{"Title":"Phenomenon","review":"Ok, so I had, repeating myself \\"had\\" a question or two that I felt wasn't answered yet by Sylvia. Now, with this book I have my answer. I was a little confused when comparing Tulpas with Elementals, but not anymore. Her explanation of Totem Animals was also very understandable. For questionable minds like mine who need to be reaffirmed on occasion, read this book."},{"Title":"Phenomenon","review":"I have had read a couple of Sylvia's books in the past and they were ok. However I got this one at the airport and I cannot put it down. It is extremely comforting even if you have not lost someone close to you. To me it just explains everything and especially our purpose here on this earth. This is one book I am never giving away so I can quickly reference it forever. I am projecting my positive aura everywhere I go with her wonderful tips. This is a MUST read!"},{"Title":"Phenomenon","review":"This is by far Sylvia Browne's greatest work. It explains and answers any question a person could have from the other side. Some of the terms Sylvia uses are unknown to the lay person, it is all explained here. Also she writes in every day language. The way she describes life themes helps a person identify their theme. This is something that I refer to time and time again. There are so many answers in here that one reading is not enough."},{"Title":"Phenomenon","review":"I love Sylvia's books and have read most of them. I highly respect her as both a psychic and a human being. However, this book was one of the only of her's that dissapointed me. It seemed to be a bunch of copy and pasted stuff from all her other books.SO:I highly recommend it for new reader since it does offer such an immense ammount of info from all her other books.I do not recommend this book for avid readers of Sylvia's since it does tend to be a bit redundant and fans might get a little bit bored as I did =)"},{"Title":"Phenomenon","review":"I recently pulled these CDs off my shelf and listened to them again. This time it was with consideration of whether to include this in a bibliography for my clients. I realized that, while some of the more general definitions are good, many are heavily laced with Sylvia Browne's own peculiar brand of qausi-metaphysical theology. There is an extraordinary amount of this, so much so that I would consider Phenomenon as more a statement of her theological system as any basic teaching on phenomena. Too, there are places where I disagree with her assessments and definitions. Much of this may also be rooted in her theology. The definitions are based mostly her experiences alone, without much reference to the work of others. She claims to have read extensively and widely, including \\"26 translations of the Bible\\", and many other works. The only evidence of this wide-ranging study in this program is her claim to have read so widely. I will acknowledge her literary background (her college major was literature), but, for theological and metaphysical work, the jury is very much still out. Another concern of mine is her apparent belief in the omniscience and infallibility of her spirit guide, Francine. Spirit guides are extremely knowledgreable and wise, but they are not infallible and not all-knowing. Just because her spirit guide says so is not sufficient reason to accept the guide's pronouncements completely unexamined. The same applies to any spirit guide. Purchase and listen to this if you particularly like Sylvia Browne, but keep the meat and spit out the considerable number of bones. Above all, do not take this program as authoritative without much cross-checking and careful assessment."},{"Title":"Phenomenon","review":"Sylvia Browne is one of the most sincere, convincing, honest people I believe a person can every meet. She gives frank honest information that reader interested in the paranormal are looking for. My daughters lost their Dad at the young age of 4 & 6. I told them to never feel alone. Their Dad would always be with them. Sylvia reinforces this to everyone. We believe she is wonderful.

Sylvia explains what's real and what's fake in the only way she can. As always, she simplifies things so that anybody can understand what she's talking about. It's a good read as usual (if you enjoy her books that is) but unlike other books, this isn't really talking about her experiences for the most part because like I said, it reminds me of a dictionary of terms that you could refer back to should you be reading a different paranmormal book and can't quite remember what a term means."},{"Title":"Phenomenon","review":"I didn't want to put the book down and i probably would have finished it but i had a newborn and a 3 year old wanting my attention.On page 148, it states that the land around Pacheco Pass (a stretch of highway 152 in Northern California) was part of the \\"Trail of Tears,\\"I thought this is Northern Georgia history?

Read page 302... then read her book \\"Secrets & Mysteries of the World\\"- it gives a different level that unicorns are on... so which level is it? Maybe Sylvia simply had an error in editing. I am unsure. But since I've always felt I have a unicorn as an animal totem I was excited that she was of the opinion they do exist on another level."},{"Title":"Phenomenon","review":"I am not inunitiated in this area. Paranormal events is a misnomer. They are normal, just outside our limited primary senses. There is nothing that can happen that there is not a \\"natural\\" explaination for.

Most of her explainations I agree with. But I'm sorry, I just can't go along with Numerology. If I'm called Jan, Janny, Janet or hey you, I can't seriously believe it makes any difference.I've seen her on TV, I think she's well read on the subject of the paranormal, but I don't believe she's been there and she does a disservice to those who waste their time in going to see her. With her it's big-business and she has her son prepped to take over. Is she actually seeing the dearly departed? Not from what I've seen. Subscribe to a daily \\"text message\\" from her?

If we think about energy and the vastness of the universe we should be able to see that all things are possible. In my experience this is very true. I loved also \\"The Celestine Prophecy\\" by James Redfield, and if you have not read it, please do. It will give you a whole new outlook on life, death and on all of Sylvia's books.

It is an interesting reading indeed, as it reveals some not immediately obvious peculiarities of British media market. One would want to see the hacking of phones of 9/11 victims by the Murdoch Empire as something what is unlikely to happen again.The book is divided in 20 chapters, and is intended for other journalists and reporters, both professional and amateur. It starts well, claiming that investigative reporter is someone who asks tough questions; challenges herd instinct, and checks facts.Some examples of great journalism are presented, namely Harry Evans's first inquiry into Kim Philby and the DC-10 case, and Roger Cook's Checkpoint. Cook was the most productive British journalist, who authored more than a thousand investigations. BBC repeatedly demanded Checkpoint to be less investigative.Chapter 4 \\"Finding the stories\\" shows that the story for an investigative reporter does not need to be brand new, and that 50 years old stories are still worth investigating. One of these presented in this book is the case of anti-Bolshevik White Russians deported forcibly to Russia in 1945 from the British zone, with reference to two important books written on this topic - Ian Mitchell's \\"A cost of reputation\\" and Christopher Booker's \\"A looking glass tragedy\\". Norman Stone summed this up that there was no conspiracy in this case, as too many Britons wanted a quite life without trouble with the Soviets.Further in this book, these \\"tough questions to powerful people\\" are diluted a little bit to make sure the journalist does not get in trouble with MI5 for \\"subversion of the British state\\", which is supposedly no longer relevant as the main task of the Queen's Security Service (together with hunting Soviet spies), as the service now works mainly on counter-terrorism. Some examples are carefully presented in a completely ball-less way. In Chapter 15 on \\"Crime\\" the author presents the case of Jonathan Moyle and \\"The Valkyrie Operation\\" launched by his family and friends following his alleged suicide in Chile. Moyle worked for a military magazine as an editor and for British authorities on the side. He travelled to Chile to inquire about suspected adaptation of civilian helicopters for military use to be sold to Iraq before the invasion. Whilst Chilean authorities did not like this suicide and launched a murder investigation, British authorities were perfectly happy to go with the verdict of suicide.Tough questions to the police should be carefully avoided, too, as clearly suggested in Chapter 16 \\"Trail of bent coppers\\". The author presents stories of The Bridgewater Four, where 3 petty criminals were jailed for 18 years for murder of a newspaper boy; the fourth one died in prison; and the case of Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four. The cases were highly publicized and the media witch-hunt against the perceived criminals was overwhelming. The author openly admits that these cases spread lot of fear among journalists to challenge even the most obvious and most serious cases of mistakes and malpractice made by the police, and presents some statistics of outcomes of investigations of allegations of police malpractice. This is then explained by the logic that \\"Those who make allegations against the police are in some degree disreputable, otherwise they would not have come up against the police in the first place. The same logic is used for handling complaints of former employees against corporations, which are routinely dismissed as unreliable and unjustified based on the fact that the complainant is an ex-employee (Chapter 7). Investigations of police mistakes and malpractice have now become more difficult as prisoners cannot be now visited by journalists. In early 1970's The Times, The People, and World in Action documented widespread illegal activities among London detectives. This part demonstrates how hard it is to build a case strong enough to get a suspect officer dismissed and prosecuted.There are some very interesting points a journalist working in Britain should take into account, and it is the Defamation Act, which gives premium on evidence which cannot be dismissed as axe-grinding; conditions of inquiries in the public interest; use of secret recording and gossip; reporting under cover; and the use of witnesses. Quite a lot of emphasis is made on the legal use of clandestinely obtained statements and evidence, which should be made in case the main witness ends up dead or flees abroad to make sure he does not end up dead (Chapter 5). As pointed out in Chapter 9, getting people to talk can be a problem, as talking can be dangerous. This explains why the number of whistleblowers is so small. Vast majority of people who get treated very poorly don't talk. In Chapter 10 \\"Writing it: problems and pitfalls\\" the author mainly discusses legal actions taken against journalists in the past and the difference between legal proof and truth which is as pointed out not always the same thing.There are some interesting parts in this book worth remembering, and it is comprehensive list of facts which can be obtained from public domain in Chapter 6 and 12.This book provides a valuable insight into mindset and behavior of people who create the British media scene. Overreliance on secret sources of information which are seen as source of power, difficulties in challenging the authorities in cases of abuse of power, and difficulties in protection of sources, witnesses and whistleblowers can be the underlying causes of slow shift of focus of investigative reporting from perpetrators of crimes toward victims."},{"Title":"Chaotics","review":"This book takes an interesting look at chaos theory and complex systems theory (especially self-organizing behaviors) and promotes a new theory, Chaotics. Chaotics is seen as a bridge between the shortcomings of chaos theory and ideas surrounding complexity in today's rapidly changing world. Using chaotics, the authors look at a wide range of areas in which the application of the theory can be used to provide new insights into how current, degrading societal and business systems can be re-thought in order to facilitate the saving of or recreation of those failing systems.The authors spend a great deal of time in the first chapters of the book explaining their view of chaos theory and complex systems theory. This examination includes an interesting look at the history of not only chaos and complexity, but the deterministic scientific theories which, they say, have led to the decay of many of our world's current societal, educational, and environmental beliefs. Building upon this foundation, proposals are offered for re-thinking the way problems within these decaying systems are examined. Examples include viewing unemployment as a natural state of one's working life, an educational system shaped by the shrinking time-space compression of today's technological environment, and the possibility that 'advances' realized by today's information driven countries may, in fact, be in declines and not advances.In terms of education, which is my focus, the implications for using chaotics to address the monumental changes required of this aging and inefficient system may be significant. That our educational systems may be pushed towards more effective and efficient methods of operations by orchestrating changes within it, using chaotics, is certainly intriguing. That our educational systems need to undergo radical change if we are going to attempt to educate our children is not in question. Inserting chaotics into our education al change strategies is neither 'new fangled' nor 're-done', and could have a dramatic impact upon how we begin turning the bow of this monstrous ship we call education in America (for real).A bit of a tough read, Chaotics is certainly worth a close examination by anyone new to chaos or complexity theories. The ideas put forth in this book are worthy of consideration and will minimally alter the reader's perspective of change, happenstance and decay within complex systems."},{"Title":"Chaotics","review":"I'd like to read the opinions of some fluid dynamicists, fractal geometers and quantitative ecologists on the ideas put forth in this book.Thanks in advance."},{"Title":"Furniture Design/Mobel Design/Design de Meubles/Muebles de Diseno (teNeus tools series)","review":"Furniture Design is a compact yet extensive guide, with 400 pages, enhanced for the reader with more than 750 color photos of a wealth of unique, eye-catching, emotional, and functional furniture designs from around the world.

In this book, a young candidate for the priesthood follows his psychic powers in search of a man whose supposed death has left a vacuum in many lives.

This is the second time in a row that abook was labeled Large Print and when it arrived it was not. Sandalous Risks isa paperback edition which I can't read at all. How do I find real large print books at Amazon?Richard Halladay"},{"Title":"Mystical Paths: Library Edition","review":"Susan Howatch once again shows brilliance in characterisation, expression of spiritual truths, and integration of Jungian psychology in creating this strange and rather macabre picture of conflict, intensity, and the darkness of deception. While the plot has notable deficiencies, particularly in some major scenes in the last quarter of the action, the author manages to present a deep and thorough, if sometimes horrifying, picture of what seems an eternal battle of good and evil.Set in 1968, when the previous modern certainties of the stability of church and society were crumbling, the story of Nicholas Darrow shows us both the tearing conflicts within one man's life, where his faith is overshadowed by his intense tendency to use his psychic gifts for power and manipulation, and the overall despair of a world which seemed totally unstable. The popular crowd who form secondary characters deteriorate rapidly from a privileged and party-loving group into addiction, mental illness, suicide, murder, or desperate, even pathological, promiscuity.The main characters, Nicholas and his father Jonathan Darrow, both possess rare psychic gifts, and their inability to see situations clearly in relation to one another stems from the mutual belief that the son is a replica of his father. The differences, which manage to pointedly reflect the times as well, are drastic. Where Jonathan, whose insight and wisdom are clear in the various novels of the series in which he appears, is grounded in Christian mysticism, Nicholas has fallen into a gnostic approach, which he sees as superior, and his manifestation of psychic power is frighteningly manipulative in its various plot depictions. Though father and son have certain common weaknesses, Jonathan is sustained by classic mystic theology and monastic experience, where Nicholas (until his own turning point) cannot except the elements of conversion, and, despite giving them a Christian flavour in his own mind, engages in displays of (mostly apparent) unusual powers that seem close to sorcery.Lovers of the series will find that action in this book enlightens the portrayals of characters who appear elsewhere. For example, the full consequences of the tragedy involving Venetia Flaxton, which is set in 1963 in Scandalous Risks, are sadly clear in this 1968 setting. Readers who know Charles Ashworth from other novels undoubtedly will feel Nicholas's frustration keenly when, in his turning to Charles for assistance, one who might be expected to be comforting and wise is quite the contrary because he has decided what Nicholas is trying to say without giving him a chance to speak. The same Lewis Hall who, in other volumes, will be invaluable to Ashworth and, much later, rather exasperating in a joint healing ministry with Nick, is here &quot;at his best,&quot; a strength for both Nicholas and Jonathan.It is unfortunate that most of the action in this book involves elaborately staged dramatic, which can obscure the essential themes even if it delivers certain key messages powerfully. However, in the outcome it is an exceptional depiction of the hard path to self-knowledge (from which even wise spiritual guides of 88 find constant), resolution of internal conflict, providence and, ultimately, redemption."},{"Title":"Mystical Paths: Library Edition","review":"Mystical Paths is my first experience with a Susan Howatch book. I found that I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The characters are solid, complex, very different, and interesting. I truly felt like these were people that I would like to get to know better.I won't reiterate the plot here, since other reviewers have done it well. I will just say that this book has elements that many readers will likely find enjoyable for pure fun reading: demonic possession, exorcism, mystery, and suspense. There are also complex elements for the reader that likes more meat to a story:guilt, pride, vocation, growing up, and parental relation complexs.My only very tiny complaint about this book is that in a few places it bogs down a bit, though it does tend to recover quickly. Overall, though, I highly recommend this book and will be seeking out the other titles in this series."},{"Title":"Mystical Paths: Library Edition","review":"Well written, mainly about a young man Nick Darrow who is a psychic Christian, albeit a very immature one, who blunders on to a highly dangerous situation whilst privatley investigating as to whether a fatal accident was a suicide or a getaway by the person concerned in order to start a new life"},{"Title":"Mystical Paths: Library Edition","review":"The second trilogy in the Starbridge books takes place in the 1960's. In this book Jon Darrow's son Nick is now a young man shortly before his ordination as a priest. Nick is in no way a model ordinand. Like his father he has psychic powers, and cannot resist the urge to show them off as parlour tricks to impress the girls. He has quite a collection of female admirers and has it all figured out - how to separate the nice girls from the bad ones, and, of course, when to go to Confession (not compulsory in the Church of England) only to start all over again. The central story in this book is Nick's obsession with finding out the truth about a friend who has died under mysterious circumstances. There is also the father-son dynamic between him and his father Jon - now living as a recluse - and Nick's problems with keeping his psychic powers under control. Nick tends to blunder from one mess into the other - but remains a loveable and sincere young man who needs to learn the lesson: I CAN BE WRONG.In spite of Nick's charms I wasn't entirely captivated by this book. I never really developed an interest in Christian and couldn't quite follow Nick's fascinationwith him. Also I found the psychic-occult element a little tedious this time around; it had been dealt with adequately in Glamorous Powers, I felt. Nevertheless it's an important part of the series and it was wonderful getting to know Nick, and witnessing the love between him and Jon."},{"Title":"Mystical Paths: Library Edition","review":"It's hard to name a favourite in this series however this and the first book (Glittering Images) would come close.Howatch is at her very best in this book which moves along at a good pace and introduces us very well to the character of Nicholas Darrow - son of the famous Jon Darrow.We see the unhealthy yet loving relationship between Father and Son as they both struggle to release their psychic hold on each other and also a good glimpse into the relationship between Nicholas and his half brother Martin Darrow - the Actor.Howatch has an unequalled way in bringing together characters from the other books and also recalling past incidents from a different viewpoint which I find fascinating - and extremely clever.Much has been said about the plot in previous reviews so I won't go too much into that other than to say it's entirely believable and utterly engrossing.After the Starbridge series - if you enjoyed these ensure to read the St. Benet's series (3 books) which all again feature Nick Darrow and also Lewis Hall. Even Cynthia Aysgath makes an appearance in the first book.I only wish Howatch would start another series - perhaps looking at Nick and Alice's life when they leave to go back to his ancestral home to begin a Healing centre there. That may be too much to hope for."},{"Title":"Mystical Paths: Library Edition","review":"This book, like all of Susan Howatch's books, is a good read.

It is GREAT fun for children and reader alike.I own the \\"adapted\\" board book edition as well, which is designed to appeal to newborns, and very young children with short attention spans who are not attentive enough for the full text versions. The text, format, and images have been adapted to accommodate board book standards; yet, the phrasing and prose still flow. That being said, the original is just that - ORIGINAL. It is more amusing, entertaining, and educational, but is appropriate for older children, 3 years and older. If your child is three or older purchase an original version, otherwise think of introducing your infant to the shorter, travel-anywhere format, and procure the original at a later date?

The best part is that its a lot SHORTER in duration than, say, One Fish Two Fish or Cat in the Hat. Its all about feet---\\"his feet, her feet, twenty-four feet,\\" etc. My two year old has problems with Seuss's classic characters--what is that mommy?A dog? A duck? Yeah, sure...

And it contains several characteristically &quot;Seussian&quot; characters, including 6-, 8-, and 10-legged creatures that look like they stepped out of a child-friendly science fiction film.

It's a wonderful book - one any child would enjoy and any parent would love to read!"},{"Title":"The foot book, (A Bright & early book)","review":"I bought several Dr. Seuss board books, and this is one of my favorites. Each page has one or two pictures with a short phrase underneath each one. They describing different types of feet or situations in which feet are involved: left foot, right foot, front feet, back feet, feet in the day, feet in the night, etc). The vocabulary is simple. It rhymes but the words are not just random (compared with the ABC book) or non-sense words (compared with the Wocket in My Pocket). It reads with a nice rhythm and pace. I also appreciate the cohesion of the board book: the last page repeats the theme \\"how many different feet you meet\\" from an earlier page and captures the theme of the book. Although I started reading this book to the baby when she was just a few months old, she didn't start enjoying it until she was about a year old. Now this is the first Dr. Seuss book she grabs for me to read to her. It's easy enough to read that, if you are bilingual, you can alternate between reading it in English and in another language (making up the translations on the way).I didn't read the original version of this book until recently, and I was surprised by how much more wordy it is. And the original does get a lot more complicated, with a plethera of feet going everywhere! There are more pictures and more words per page. And I noticed that this board version only covers maybe half of the original book. Being an English teacher (and having a graduate degree in language education), I can tell you that this version is probably better suited for language learning with its simpler vocabuary and simpler pictures (which helps connect the words to what they see). Those who are more familiar with the original may feel disappointed at the changes that were made, but I would suggest that you take this book for what it is: an easy to read rhyme book for learning vocabulary."},{"Title":"The foot book, (A Bright & early book)","review":"My granddaughter is only 20 months old and lives in Australia.

The Foot Book to the rescue. A catchy short poem with appealing illustrations about the many kinds of feet- front feet, back feet, slow feet, quick feet- one would encounter in a Dr. Seuss world. The Foot Book is an engaging tale that will have your child humming to the rhyme and discovering the feet in his or her world. A dog-eared favorite in our home."},{"Title":"The foot book, (A Bright & early book)","review":"Dr. Suess had the enviable privilage of being able to see into the workings of a child's mind then harness that special zaniness on paper. Some of his works defy the adult's strictly defined ideas of the way things are, but children recognize and appreciate a kindred spirit... THE FOOT BOOK unwitttingly teaches numbers and opposites while highlighting the many different kinds of people there are in the world. It is a very readable length that doesn't leave the tired parent snoring on an open book and the illustrations are bright and attention-grabbing. I recommend this as a staple book in the toddler through kindergartners home library."},{"Title":"The foot book, (A Bright & early book)","review":"IF YOU HAVE A CHILD, YOU SHOULD DEFINATELY HAVE THIS BOOK.

From a &quot;durability&quot; perpective, the paper is good quality and can withstand the abuse of tough little hands turning pages roughly.

The story is very simple - it shows all different kinds of feet, from wet feet and dry feet to fuzzy fur feet. There aren't many words on each page, so there is lots of page turning to keep the youngest kids interest. Dr. Seuss used a sing-song rhyme, which reads quickly and is very soothing. We read it over and over again.The artwork is classic Suess, with a focus on feet!I credit The Foot Book with fostering my children's love of books. At just 12 months my daughter will bring the book to me and climb into my lap for a reading. (Fair warning - you will know this book by heart!)My older child was bored with this book by about age 2, because it is so simple, but is now enjoying it again as I read it to her sister, and I think it will be a popular choice when she starts learning to read.My recommendation is to get this book early and enjoy it often!"},{"Title":"The foot book, (A Bright & early book)","review":"My Sons Really enjoy it They want to hear the story every night, even as they get older they still listen"},{"Title":"The foot book, (A Bright & early book)","review":"If you like Dr. Seuss books you'll love this one.

My son (at age 2) loved this book in the original form we had; but he was a bit rough on it & I had to tape our copy a few times! So I searched everywhere for a board book version, and was so happy when I found one. I bought it without reading it first (which I almost never do) and was so disapointed in the quality! The pictures are poorly drawn (I think some of them may even be drawn by someone other than Dr. Seuss? maybe the original drawings could not be reprinted or something) and the rhymes were changed. They are awkward and I can't see why they needed to be changed in the first place! For example, changing \\"Feet in the morning...Feet at night\\" to \\"Feet in the day...Feet in the night\\". This is poor english, and what was wrong with it the way Dr. Seuss wrote it? Twice, they changed \\"Feet, feet, feet...how many, many feet you meet\\" to \\"how many different feet you meet\\". Again, why? It just sounds better the other way. And finally, why change \\"slow feet..quick feet...trick feet...sick feet\\" to \\"well feet\\"? It doesn't even make sense- what are Well Feet? The picture is a dog juggling balls- doing a \\"trick\\"! I am surprised that the Seuss trustees, who are usually so protective of Dr. Seuss' work would OK this book."},{"Title":"The foot book, (A Bright & early book)","review":"My niece loved it, but I'm hiding this version now that I've gotten her the *real* version. Stupid editors, changing the text, cutting stuff out, just to make a board book.Forgo this copy, just get the hardcover edition.

It has only 47 words in its 27 pages and includes important vocabulary builders for toddlers and above. Simple adjectives, prepositions, and pronouns predominate. The repetition and presenting of word groups make this an excellent tool for reading.Since it won't help reading if it's not read, the book contains the fabulous characters and silly situations for which Seuss is known. With big, slightly zany illustrations, this is highly recommended for adults or kids to read to each other!"},{"Title":"The foot book, (A Bright & early book)","review":"The original hardcover The Foot Book is absolutely awesome, but I had a lot of trouble finding it to buy on Amazon (it has a white cover, not green). For some reason the only versions that came up in my search were the board books. My daughterss have loved this book since they were 6 months old (one is now 12 months and the other is 3 1/2), and my copy is very tired.Be aware that this version only has 12 pages and has stickers and flaps, which get torn and make a mess. If you're looking for the original version, click on \\"hardcover edition\\" on this page and you're all set.I can't see any reason to purchase the shortened, board book version of this classic unless you're concerned with torn pages. There aren't many words on each page, and the rhymey, sing-song story is short enough to hold your child's attention for the entire book. We read this book together for storytime, and put the sturdier books into the crib for play.The Foot Book belongs in every small child's library, but go with the real deal, not this dumbed-down version."},{"Title":"The foot book, (A Bright & early book)","review":"This is a nice enough board book, but be advised that it is NOT the full version of Dr. Seuss' book! They've left out several (charming!) pages of text and illustrations for the Board Book... What a disappointment to loyal fans, and how unfair to the newest generation of fans-to-be."},{"Title":"The foot book, (A Bright & early book)","review":"The Foot Book teaches children adjectives and nouns to describe and name things; this educational read will be a lot of fun for your young child just learning to read. This book is perfect for adults to introduce to children while reading it to them; and gradually the child can be encouraged to read it more and more independently.The illustrations are wonderful and classic Dr. Seuss style; but the real draw here is the information the books imparts to young readers and children learning to read.The book has a page near the very front so that the child can write their name in it to personalize this book; that's sweet and a very clever idea to draw the child into the book all the more.The lines of the book teach adjectives and nouns as they relate to, well, feet. (Well, mostly as they relate to feet.) Children are taught the words and the differences between left and right; morning and night; wet and dry; high and low; front and back; slow and quick; up and down--and much more. It's all very well done.The hardcover of the book feels very strong and resilient so that young children can't accidentally do much damage to it; and the quality of the paper is excellent.I highly recommend this book for young children. It is very educational and fun for them at the same time. Just don't tell them they're learning--as long as they think this is all in fun they'll gobble up this information faster than anything!"},{"Title":"The foot book, (A Bright & early book)","review":"Welcome to the wonderful world of whimsical, wacky writing, and crazy, colorful caricatures. Geeezz, that's hard to read aloud. \\"The Foot Book, Dr. Seuss's Wacky Book of Opposites\\" is an inspired introduction to contrary concepts, such as left verses right, and just plain silliness through rhyme. Wet/dry, high/low, front/back, and well/sick... you get the gist. William LOVED this book when he was a baby. He especially liked the pig page.\\"Up feet, down feet, here come clown feet.Small feet, big feet, here come pig feet.\\"It's a quick read. It takes less than a minute to complete, although, we'd sit for 5-minutes or more just talking about the illustrations. If you've ever read an original Seuss, then you know what I mean when I say they are whimsical, and colorful. Of course, I am partial to Seuss's illustrated works, rather than the books he wrote and others illustrated for him, such as \\"The Eye Book\\". His caricatures are silly, almost fantasy like. He doesn't use a lot of color on each page; however, the overall effect is upbeat, and always entertaining.\\"The Foot Book, Dr. Seuss's Wacky Book of Opposites\\" is NOT a miniature version of Seuss's, \\"The Foot Book\\". The text, and images have been adapted from the original to accommodate board book standards. Yet, the phrasing and prose flow, as is apparent from the above excerpt.There has been a great deal of controversy regarding these little books. It seems, others think the publisher, has infringed upon the copyright laws. When these \\"Bright and Early BOARD Books\\" were released in 2001, the titles, and the covers were the same as the originals. Some were confused, and even angered. Apparently, they thought they were buying smaller, yet full-text copies of the originals. It clearly states they are adapted formats on the back of the cover, so I don't understand what the fuss is all about. Random House has since altered the titles, and covers to indicate the modifications. For instance, \\"The Foot Book\\" has a white cover, while \\"The Foot Book, Dr. Seuss's Wacky Book of Opposites\\" has a green background even though the image is the same.I, for one, was thrilled to have the opportunity to offer my infant son a CLASSIC Seuss narrative, even in it's ADAPTED form. These magical miniatures are delightfully entertaining for little babies. Especially for those who enjoy the positive interaction of cooperative play through reading. The objective of these small books is to appeal to newborns, and very young children who are not attentive enough for the full-text versions. They are NOT meant to replace the originals. Moreover, these pocketsize gems are fashioned for effortless travel to the market, on a plane, in the car, or on a train. Hee, hee... that's my own Seuss inspired rhyme. Birth and up.Happy Reading,Mary"},{"Title":"The foot book, (A Bright & early book)","review":"The original book is NOT about opposites. It a clever funny, rhythmical book about ... feet. But when adapting it for a board book they decided to make it useful, and so changed the wording to fit an imposed theme. This is not Dr. Suess.

With better parent-child bonding from reading, your child will also be more emotionally secure and able to relate better to others. Intellectual performance will expand as well. Spending time together watching television fails as a substitute.To help other parents apply this advice, as a parent of four I consulted an expert, our youngest child, and asked her to share with me her favorite books that were read to her as a young child. The Foot Book was one of her picks.Dr. Seuss understood the elements of a successful early reader: Lots of repetition, visual adjectives, and hilarious drawings to tie it all together and keep the child racing forward. The Foot Book is perhaps his most successful basic reader.But what makes this book even more remarkable is that it teaches basic concepts as well such as left versus right (that most chidren are sorting out at this age), high and low, front and back, and counting.I was further impressed by the obvious encouragement for children to notice feet, and become better observers. You can follow up in this way with your child by asking her or him what was noticed that day about feet.Please note that this book is quite different from the board book that came out with a similar title in 1996.

My son loves to chew on this book. Board books are excellent for chewing; or at least my son thinks so. In contrast my daughter and I read this book together. We also love this book; but be warned ... we come to the task without using our sense of taste. Yet it is a tasteful book. Dr. Seuss was indeed a great writer.

This is clearly illustrated by the fact that after thirty-two years of his first publishing The Foot Book, Dr. Seuss has my son eating his feet."},{"Title":"The foot book, (A Bright & early book)","review":"This book is a lame version of dr seuss's otherwise excellent and witty silly rhymes.

The book has been great for teaching adjectives - \\"low,\\" \\"high,\\" \\"wet,\\" \\"dry,\\" etc. The illustrations are such that my kids really seem to understand the gist of the word being used.

I've read it to her anything up to six times in a row.

This book's board book format that she can carry around works for her better in this case. She is still indifferent to a big hardcover collection that we have, probably because she is not allowed to handle it by herself. It's still not something that she brings me to read often, that's why she completely takes me by surprise by randomly quoting parts of it. Her favorite page is about quick feet and slow feet.

This book, however, I noticed a lot that didn't flow quite right. The last time I had read \\"The Foot Book\\" was probably 5 years ago but I kept misplacing words and getting off-beat with the rhymes. My son likes it as well as other books, I just know that it's going to bug me every time I read it (why change \\"trick feet\\" to \\"well feet\\" to accomodate the \\"opposite\\" theme while leaving the picture of the character juggling?)

The author had a gift of encouragement and was able to pinpoint obstacles that can rob us of simple faith in Jesus Christ and His promises. His words are very challenging and help clear the fog and the various limitations that keep us bound up so we are not able to experience the freedom and fresh power and life Jesus wants us to have through the power of the cross.

The session blew me away, providing me with immediate relief from some pain and a curiosity to learn more. And so my journey began. The following day, feeling somehow lighter and more at peace, I began to read his book. I couldn't put it down and finished within two days! Robert brilliantly captures your attention with the story about a family's spiritual journey. It is down-to-earth and very easy to follow, yet powerful and informative. I felt as though i was learning along with the main character, Margaret.As a student of spirituality, healing, and growth, I am now reading if for the second time. To my amazement - I'm learning more the second time around! Questions arising for me seem to be answered as if Robert intuited what would come up and how to answer them in a way I could grasp. Almost as if I was being answered personally!This book is a true work of art.... entertaining, informative, and an essential tool for the spiritual seeker.A.P.

The catalog is black and white. Many of the pieces detailed are from the Metropolitan Museum of Art in NY.

The characters are underdeveloped and I'm not engaged emotionally with them. The characters are at times aggravating, the \\"liberal pastor\\" is portrayed as more or less an atheist, the conservative wife does nothing except for cry and pray, the daughter is a waste of ink, and the bad guys are all minorities. Honestly, the only characters I liked were murdered off early on.The flow of the book is choppy. He seemed to jump forward in time and change perspective without notice from time to time. Some of the events aren't rationalized very well, leaving the reader to come to their own conclusions as to why they happened. I this may be the reason why some readers find the events unbelievable.As a sermon I didn't care for it much either. He makes good points, but when he describes the three basic ways you can view the bible, his reasonable center point is still to the right."},{"Title":"Jordan's Crossing: A Novel","review":"This takes the lesson and theme of The Wisdom Hunter, and applies it to a different man and his family.

I see he's releasing a children's book at the same time."},{"Title":"Jordan's Crossing: A Novel","review":"\\"Jordan's Crossing\\" is a Christian suspense novel. There is a character in this novel that is the main character in a previous novel, but this novel can be read as a stand-alone. It did spoil the previous novel, though, so you might wish to read them in order.The suspense was created by the relationship tensions caused by financial worries and the death of a son/brother and from the physical danger Jordan put himself and others in while tracking his son's killers. The characters dealt with realistic problems, but I felt like I was held at a distance. The author told about the character's emotions instead of pulling the reader into them.The whole story was basically a sermon to the reader about the problems in the modern, western church and the effect of picking and choosing what parts of the Bible to believe has on Christians. While I liked the story and agreed with a lot of what the author pointed out, I wished the story had emotionally engaged me more.Also, I didn't really like the ending. After bringing home the point repeatedly that Christians need to leave justice to God rather than seeking revenge themselves, the ending solely focused on the justice dealt out in this world. No one mentioned the ultimate justice given by God on Judgment Day.There was a minor amount of \\"he cursed\\" style bad language and one explicit bad word which, apparently, some people don't consider a bad word. There were no sex scenes though a rape was referred to in vague terms. Overall, I don't regret reading the book."},{"Title":"Jordan's Crossing: A Novel","review":"Jordan's crossing is an excellent follow up to Wisdom Hunter. Randall Arthur hit another home run with me in his mastery at keeping you on the edge of your seat. If you love a great action book with a deep spiritual challenge, You'll enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Jordan's Crossing: A Novel","review":"Randall Arthur also wrote Wisdom Hunter. It is not necessary to read his books in order, but it will add depth to the characters.In Arthur's latest book, Jordan's Crossing, Jordan is a missionary in Germany. You would think he is spiritually together. Wrong. He has no faith in God; he has faith in himself.Against his family's wishes, he took the Germany missionary position. Then, his son is murdered. He turns his back on God and his family in order to seek revenge.The ending is stunning. I will not spoil it! Why his books have not been made into movies, I do not know. Arthur has a way of demanding empathy from the reader. He creates tangible tension. Arthur's day job is that of a missionary. Not to discredit that, but I dare say that his books touch quite a few souls, too."},{"Title":"Jordan's Crossing: A Novel","review":"His wife Susan and their two children seventeen years old son Chase and thirteen year old Donica had doubts bigger than the Atlantic Ocean, but liberal pastor Jordan Rau could not pass up the 50% increase in pay by leaving Chattanooga for Munich. In spite of their concerns, he relocates his family to Germany. To Jordan's amazement and affirming his decision, Chase finds his first girlfriend Heather Anne Mosely, a classmate at the DOD HS.However, Jordan's belief he did the right thing collapses when Chase is viciously and senselessly murdered as he blames himself as if he killed his son. His family, his congregation, other pastors and psychologists try to help Jordan heal, but he cannot as he asks God why punish his innocent only son instead of his guilty father who left home for the wrong reason. He vows to find his son's killer(s) and bring the wrath of his sword onto them; deserting God like God deserted him.This is an entreating inspirational tale that grips the audience with the formerly logical liberal pastor replacing his \\"turn the other cheek\\" belief system with an \\"eye for an eye\\" vengeance . Although some incidents seem over the top of the German Alps, readers will relish this character driven tale; wondering whether Jordan's Paradise Lost of logic based faith will ever return him back to a believer in the goodness of the Lord.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Jordan's Crossing: A Novel","review":"I have read all three of Randall Arthur's books and enjoyed them all.

Many of the events were just too unbelievable. All in all I'm glad I read it, but now want to see if he has improved int Jordan's Crossing."},{"Title":"Jordan's Crossing: A Novel","review":"Reader from Florida is certainly correct that many of the events are unbelievable, but to me, it did not lessen the book in any way. As Jordan's Crossing opens, it is immediately evident that Jordan is a man who is disturbed and in conflict about many issues dealing with Christianity. After his son is brutally and senselessly murdered, Jordan goes through a change in his attitude and personality that no one, his wife, daughter, or his church members can understand. No one, ministers and psychologists alike, can get Jordan to open up and begin the healing process. Instead, Jordan goes through his own process, or crossing, as he single-mindedly pursues his son's killers. Yes, how he achieves this crossing is riveting, sensational, and even hard to believe, but it works for Jordan's personality and the way that he handles his grief. The reader is kept on the edge of his seat not only to see if Jordan ever gets his man, but also to see if he ever makes his crossing. This is a riveting and thought-provoking book."},{"Title":"Jordan's Crossing: A Novel","review":"Jordans Crossing is an absolute must read. I have learned so much about Christian legalism and am able to recognize it. This story takes place in Europe and every place described and written about I've been, Randall Arthur writes obviously from experience, even to the story's locations. This is a capitvating-no put down book. You'll want to buy as many as you can to give away. A must read!!!"},{"Title":"Jordan's Crossing: A Novel","review":"I heartily recommend &quot;Wisdom Hunter&quot; in place of this book. Perhaps because W.H. was exactly what I needed to hear and the fact that J.Faircloth was in a similar position I was in. I was captivated by how much that book spoke to me. As for J.Crossing, I'm not saying it was a poor novel - it might be what W.Hunter was for me, as J.Crossing will be for you. God might speak to you in a different way than He did for me through this novel.I would recommend Wisdom Hunter if you are: under legalismI would recommend Jordan's Crossing if you are: ....???

Randall, if you're reading this, thank you for letting God write through you. Though it has a been a good six months since I read them I am tearing up as I remember then now and how God used them in my life.

Jordan's Crossing is in many ways a more powerful book, because of the hard hitting and graphic subject matter. If you are looking for a light fluffly read this is not the book for you. If you are looking for a hard hitting, in your face story full of hard truths than you are in the right place. Randall Arthur has again created characters that you come to know and care a great deal about. I just finished reading the book for the second time and it was still an amazing read eventhough I knew what was coming next. I applaud Arthur for writing a hard hitting story.

His is a household name among traditional fans all over both for his own concertina playing and his music history lectures. I first saw him in Ireland about 5 years ago giving a lecture on the Irish Famine. I was so pleased by what an easy and interesting introduction to the topic this book was that it became my Christmas stocking stuffer for lots of my friends. Both those who play and those who love to listen to the music.This new book was pretty light reading and yet the best introduction to Irish music in the context of powerful historical events, war, famine, colonalism, Michael Flattley and Lord of the Dance. It makes me long for a real full version from this author.

I take it that Gearoid's name in English is good old Gerard O'Halloran, but I digress...) which treats the matters in more depth.I was particularly impressed that the author, who obviously is highly qualified on the subject, does not fall into the trap of overwhelming us with academic lecturing and, most of all, is respectful to all shades of contribution in the living river of traditional Irish music.

Here, hold the slender globe of / Your lantern in the mute, pulsing night.\\" (53); \\"Where were you all that light ago, busy as a scarab in the dust, / Hard by the bed? Winters passed, forecasting new bad memories.\\" (17) Acute longing and a subtle violence go hand in hand in the most intensified of these gems (for example, poems XXXVIII and XL). Wit is in season as well, in multiple plays on \\"assembling\\" and \\"dissembling\\" wind throughout the work-reference to semblance/mask/face/mirror and the complicated tango of identity -and in deceptively glib transformations which open onto knotty philosophical reserves: \\"The pane of circumstance / Broken always by one's own reflections.\\" (4)Tonally, the poems don't stray much from each other, in spite of widely differing formal strategies. This is one area in which the book suffers, as the neutral point of its register wobbles between jokey, self-deprecating intimacy and prosaic wistfulness. Many poems (especially the directly narrative) seem slack by comparison with the transcendent lyrics. At worst, the merely sentimental seizes center stage, as when the speaker describes the birth of his daughter: \\"toting along with her such innocence / As falls in whispers from the towers of cathedrals.\\" (47) The tough-guy language and the anger, all the hotter, baser, darker emotions, somehow fail to convince as effectively as the regret, sorrow, and yearning.With such a title and multiply-announced project, a book like this dwells unapologetically in the postmodern, and that is largely where it stays: looking at the face of surface from angle upon angle while feinting underneath. As such, \\"The Face\\" is suitable for a very broad audience; it's likely that anyone can find a praiseworthy poem in it, from film-lovers to fiction-readers to language poets to unreconstructed Romantics, but as a whole the book hangs heavy with overdone verse."},{"Title":"The Face: A Novella in Verse","review":"It's not hard to find the overriding theme of David St. John's The Face. Of course, one might say, obviously, the \\"novella in verse\\" is about faces, or more specifically the speaker's face, or even more specifically and metaphorically, the speaker's appearance and history/story. One might even continue on this thread and come to the conclusion that the work is about the masks we adopt (XXVII). But I believe the poems are more about the process of reflection, disintegration and understanding.Throughout the work, there are references to mirrors and more importantly the broken shards of a mirror, as well as the ideas of shattering and disassembling. This is imperative to apprehend the mind set of the speaker. Here is a person who has suffered some trauma (does it really matter what?) and is merely trying to reassemble what has become undone (\\"assembling the disassembling\\"). Instances of this fracturing are also evident in the passages that speak about the movie being made out of the speaker's life. The creator (ironic), Infanta (telling) wishes to make the movie in reverse, that is show the speaker's life in an inverted sequence a la Merlin-esque.Some of my favorite poems are XXV about the black rooms and even more XXX, the Edge World theme park idea. Overall, I think that David St. John has got something here, a cohesive and modern idea that translates well for the reader, as well as being a genuinely entertaining piece of literature (and I say literature because it is both poem and prose)."},{"Title":"The Face: A Novella in Verse","review":"David St. John's newest work, The Face, a Novella in Verse, chronicles the fallout of a love affair in a loosely narrative manner, addressing issues of time, identity and longing in the process, and employing self-reflexivity as a tool to ward off the pitfall of preciousness. Written in the voice of an LA denizen who feels, he \\"had come, it seemed, to the end of my life,\\" and whose life is in the process of being made into a movie, the 45 numbered poems take us through a wide range of styles, from the unabashedly romantic and sensual to the sardonic and angry.The refractory and elusive nature of time and self are considered from many different angles in the course of the book, as in the 3rd poem which states \\"When it's over/It's already been over, everybody knows, long before it's finally over.\\" This is a comment on relationships, but it contains the shifting, unsteady sense of temporal consciousness that marks a number of poems in the book. The poem goes on to echo Bob Dylan's \\"Don't think twice\\" toward the end, with the line \\"I don't mind any of it, not even those years I've wasted like silence.\\" Time is addressed in a subtler way in the harrowing poem number 11 which begins \\"Shattered, shattered, shattered. There are so many ways/ To break the vessel, sometimes no single way will do,\\" And goes on to shatter our notion of what is entailed by a vessel: \\"The vessel is only the shape to be recalled as what once one was...\\" The book contains many instances of such \\"assembling and dissembling,\\" in the narrator's effort to pick up the pieces of self after the proverbial \\"break up.\\"Each poem is filled with questions that the narrator directs at himself, a friend or a lover, in the relentless interrogation of reality and facades that occupy the book. The pronouns are blurred and the \\"you\\" comes to stand for either a beloved or the divided self. Yet, even as the narrator braves visits to a hilarious and hair-raising \\"Edge World\\" where his \\"self pity/..sets even the dingoes howling\\" and continues to \\"push the day up the hill\\" in Sisyphean ardor, readers are whisked through European landscapes, introduced to Sharon Stone and are given the chance to ponder the significance of Dennis Hopper's trench coat. Set against the Hollywood backdrop, the Face puzzles the notions of self as mask and performance, reaching for, and attaining, a \\"sweet delight\\" in the process."},{"Title":"The Face: A Novella in Verse","review":"THE FACE by David St. John is an exciting and daring departure from his previous books of poetry. St. John is at an age and stage in his career as a poet where most poets begin to protect territory and write and the same poems and the same book over and over again under the theory that it?s what his/her public wants. St. John has always taken risks and deserves our admiration for continuing to do so. This book is a story of a spiritual quest but one that is exciting and never heavy-handed. Some of its 45 sections are terrifying, some riveting, some consoling, and some are fall-down-laughing hilarious. A stunning book, profound without ever being obscure. Read it!"},{"Title":"The Face: A Novella in Verse","review":"Questions of identity constitute the foreground of David St. John's most recent book, The Face, in which a multivocal anonymous speaker is continually \\"assembling and dissembling\\" his sense of self. The loosely coherent plot of this \\"Novella in Verse\\" (a categorization which presents its own identity crisis at the level of genre) has to do with various performances and shatterings of the speaker's identity, ranging from grief over a recently lost love to the absurd making of a movie about his life, starring a 19-year-old androgynous girl. \\"Who am I?\\" he asks at the beginning of the second of the book's three parts; \\"(Who was I; who will I be?)... I held up my soul to the highest bidder & along came/ That devilman carrying his basket jangling with pieces of jagged mirror.\\"In his debut at the start of the book, the speaker appears costumed in a trench coat alleged to have been worn by Dennis Hopper. With faux sophistication, he repeatedly asserts that \\"Yesterday is so boring, don't you think?\\" In brilliant satiric moments throughout the book, St. John captures the flavor of Los Angeles' Hollywood culture in all its materialism, its loneliness, its vanity, and particularly in its conflation of reality and fiction, until the two seem interchangeable, equally violent and disorienting. At the heart of the poet's critique is an illustration of how Hollywood culture has bled so far into contemporary public life (particularly in Los Angeles) that as the movie about the speaker's life is on the verge of release, he asks himself, \\"Now when exactly was it that I ever could, in this world,/ Call this life my own...?\\"Against the backdrop of this glitzy upscale urban self-consciousness, the book turns on the spit of the speaker's personal grief over the recent loss of a lover whose \\"face\\" we never get to see. Her absence is expressed appropriately through the sad, lyrical language of silence, leaving her nameless and featureless, discernable only by \\"the fever of her body, the white/ Ember in the long pillow of the bed.\\"Disconnected imagery combines with the speaker's radically shifting emotions to create an experience of displacement and confusion for the reader. Surfaces, shadows, costumes, reflections, drama, depression, sleeplessness, nightmares, the incessancy of nighttime (think film noire), spiritual vacancy, fragmented memories of Italy, flashes of recognition in the natural world, the touch of a familiar hand, theme parks, fast cars, drugs, Renaissance art, literary figures disguised as movie stars disguised as servants, cell phones and all their consequent mishearings humming and buzzing like \\"the insistence of a heartbeat long after the body has grown distant & cold.\\" St. John wants us to feel as disoriented as his speaker. Accordingly, in some sections of the book, the plot dissolves completely, or more appropriately \\"dissembles\\" behind other valences of meaning. In addition, the speaker's modes of speech are so various and surprising that it's not entirely clear at first that we are dealing with a single speaker throughout the book. At times, he has us laughing out loud, and then we suddenly find ourselves sympathizing with his \\"pane of circumstance/ Broken always by [his] own reflections.\\" To complicate matters further, St. John intermingles real people (Toni, for example, to whom the book is dedicated) as characters among the obviously fictional (Infanta, Antonioni, Cyb&egrave;le).For all its fragmentation, The Face triumphs in its presentation of some of the most pressing difficulties we face in our hi-tech, overpopulated, commercialized, and plot-obsessed culture. This is a book to be read several times and considered on many levels as a journey through the vibrant intricacies of human consciousness and its inexorable public and private struggles."},{"Title":"The Frenchman: A Photographic Interview with Fernandel","review":"This is a hilarious book.

It also explores theories and discusses fieldwork methodology, illustrating these with examples from the authors' fieldwork in Malta, Madagascar, the United States, and other places. The approach is cross-cultural, systematically comparative, and engagingly creative. An in-depth scrutiny reveals the need to update and revise some aspects of the book.

Aldous Huxley can say more in one page than many serious writers do in volumes.

It is peculiar in some respects: Huxley believes in the efficacy of magic (~morphic resonance); he is convinced that Hinduism and Buddhism are intrinsically less violent world views than the great monotheisms (based on their history); and he uses some strange, and slightly fuddy-duddy phrases, such as &quot;poverty of spirit&quot; to designate a positive condition. He emphasizes the necessity of including spirit along with body and mind in any complete description of humanity. Some of the strangeness of this work to the modern reader owes to its datedness; it was written in 1944, and Huxley is clearly hugely disenchanted with the nationalistic politics that have been tearing the world apart. Some of the strangeness owes to Huxley's vocabulary which, like any mystical vocabulary, must be oblique. Nonetheless, it would be difficult to imagine a more useful, diverse, or erudite compendium of mysticism in a work of this size. I was delighted and surprised to see that he even referenced Alan Watts, who only came into his own as a writer decades later, but was already analyzing, in more technical works, eastern philosophy such as Zen. The basic idea of the philosophia perennis, or perennial philosophy, is that nirvana and samsara, time and eternity, the individual and the cosmos are one. This insight is described as advaita in Hinduism, annata in Buddhism, and (though perhaps less clearly) the union of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in Christianity. Islamic mystic Jallaludin Rumi wrote poems about it, and Zen banned reading of sacred works to foment it. Huxley, like Watts, thinks Jesus was a misunderstood mystic; J.C.'s main difference seems to be that he staked his life on the essential nonduality of himself and the universe, barely flinching along the way. Huxley would no doubt be thrilled to see the veritable scientific proofs of the cross-cultural insights collectively termed the perennial philosophy in experiments such as those by Alain Aspect, explained by &quot;ontological&quot; quantum theories such as those of David Bohm. He would not, however, be happy to see the present slide back toward medieval-style religionizing in the name of partisan beliefs and blood politics."},{"Title":"The perennial philosophy","review":"here we have a comprehensive review of the world's primal spiritual traditions packed into one book. like a glittering gem of many facets, the great Truths are examined and compared and illuminated. mr huxley's brilliant insights make this a rare and beautiful book of wisdom. its a guide for the sincere, a treat for the curious, and a true spiritual classic. mr huxley points out that these truths are not self evident to the worldly philosopher or skeptic. these truths only become self evident and experiencial to those who fulfill the necessary conditions, he says you will realize these truths for yourself when you become pure in heart, poor in spirit, and truly humbly seek to know God. i own hundreds of \\"spiritual\\" books and there are very few as great as this one. it's definitely in my top ten. buy it, read it, give it away. then buy another copy and read it again. the New York Times was right on in calling this book, \\"the masterpiece of all anthologies.\\""},{"Title":"The perennial philosophy","review":"Huxley has produced a study in the history and philosophy of religion that focuses upon 'religious experience'.Like Leibnitz, William James, and C J Jung, Huxley begins with the personal mystical experience, then delves into how this personal, individual experience has been expressed in different faiths and re-interpreted in different historical periods. Yet the essential aspects of the mystical experience remain -- as THE 'perennial philosophy'. Huxley is famously known for his drug-induced 'mystical' states but the isolation which mystics often self-impose upon themselves is the more traditional form of 'outsider experience'.Because of his psychological approach to religion, Huxley distills an essential ' perennial philosophy' in writings as diverse as Plato, Christian mystics, Eastern mystics & poets, and, even his contemporary scientists (Heisenberg) & social scientists (Jung). In reading Huxley, one thing must be kept in mind: if you as the reader accept Huxley's premise that mysticism is at the core of all religious belief, then, like Huxley, you as reader will devalue much of what you read in the classical texts until you get to 'perennial philosophical passages'. These will be what you looked for and found. This kind of 'pre-selection' eventually results in reading as self-validation so the significant differences between mathematically exact scientific mystics and literary or theological mystics may be ignored. Basho's mysticism produced haiku; Kepler's contributed to his 3 laws of planetary motion. Tesla's contributed to his ingenious AC motor.In terms of modern personality theory (Jung's analytic personality index), the Briggs-Myer, personalities which prefer perception to judgement, i.e., ENTP vs ENTJ or ISFP vs ISFJ, are more inclined toward mystical behavior.But social context can significantly affect personality -- we all behave according to social environment. The social ends can be scary. Charley Manson was a powerful charismatic, persuading his naive 'family' by psychic manipulation with ideas not so different from those described by Huxley. His end was mass-murder.For those interested in the relationship between exact sciences & religion, the Western mystical tradition of Neo-Pythagoreanism is a distinctive mix of mathematics and elements of perennial philosophy. Plato, Aristotle, Kepler, Leibnitz, Kekule, and Einstein each drew from this tradtion, (to name a few of the many famous scientists who took mysticism seriously).Nevertheless, a first-rate primer in philosophy of religionFYI from wikipedia -- definition of perennial philosophy\\"Not only have mystics been found in all ages, in all parts of the world and in all religious systems, but also mysticism has manifested itself in similar or identical forms wherever the mystical consciousness has been present. Because of this it has sometimes been called the Perennial Philosophy. Out of their experience and their reflection on it have come the following assertions:1. This phenomenal world of matter and individual consciousness is only a partial reality and is the manifestation of a Divine Ground in which all partial realities have their being.2. It is of the nature of man that not only can he have knowledge of this Divine Ground by inference, but also he can realize it by direct intuition, superior to discursive reason, in which the knower is in some way united with the known.3. The nature of man is not a single but a dual one. He has not one but two selves, the phenomenal ego, of which he is chiefly conscious and which he tends to regard as his true self, and a non-phenomenal, eternal self, an inner man, the spirit, the spark of divinity within him, which is his true self. It is possible for a man, if he so desires and is prepared to make the necessary effort, to identify himself with his true self and so with the Divine Ground, which is of the same or like nature.4. It is the chief end of man's earthly existence to discover and identify himself with his true self. By doing so, he will come to an intuitive knowledge of the Divine Ground and so apprehend Truth as it really is, and not as to our limited human perceptions it appears to be. Not only that, he will enter into a state of being which has been given different names, eternal life, salvation, enlightenment, etc.Further, the Perennial Philosophy rests on two fundamental convictions:1. Though it may be to a great extent atrophied and exist only potentially in most men, men possess an organ or faculty which is capable of discerning spiritual truth, and, in its own spheres, this faculty is as much to be relied on as are other organs of sensation in theirs.2. In order to be able to discern spiritual truth men must in their essential nature be spiritual; in order to know That which they call God, they must be, in some way, partakers of the divine nature; potentially at least there must be some kinship between God and the human soul. Man is not a creature set over against God. He participates in the divine life; he is, in a real sense, 'united' with God in his essential nature\\"."},{"Title":"The perennial philosophy","review":"Within the first few pages, I had a major epiphany, and I have been studying this kind of stuff for a number of years.

The world would be a different place. This is what should be in each home, outselling Harry Potter or Chicken Soup for the Impatient Soul.

To integrate your own mind with that of the Absolute Mind, you have to give up your own self, and hence your own mind. Therefore, you wil never objectively be able to describe the Absolute Mind, because, once you have given up your own mind, you no longer have any distance toward the Absolute: you just become it. You cannot speak about 'our world' as the absolute mind because when you have become the servant of the Absolute your world has been transfigured, and you do not share it with 'us' any longer.Throughout, Huxley insists that 'this world' is the Real world, and that we must not think of despising it, or rereating.At the end, Huxley, with the paternal care typical of writers from a distant era, and with the disdain for our modern age typical of such relics as he (and I), says that when somebody can give up their self or personality, they become a saint. The saintly mystic alone keeps the decadent West going, and has made himself a conduit for Godhead to come on to earth.What an inconceivably great task, and yet here and so simple: to give up being yourself so that you can become what you really are, what you were really made for. So few have and will ever achieve it. This book makes you think that it is possible, and that the Absolute Mind within our paltry world is really there. So sweet a book.

Huxley was raised as a Christian, yet was a mystical seeker across religious traditions. His quest included experiments with psychedelics, studying vedanta and other religious traditions.This book is a must read for the mystical seeker, who wants confirmation that the mystical experience is real.

This misses the point of the book; the DOGMA of Eastern &amp; Western religion are indeed incompatible, which (as Huxley aptly demonstrates) is exactly the problem with organized religion. In fact, the dogma of nearly all religions tend to exclude each other, making religion just another worldly argument. Worldly arguments are not supposed to be the point of religion; the point of religion is to enlighten (or &quot;save&quot;) the faithful. No dogma or beliefs can do this; however, all religions have an element that touches on how it may be done. Huxley ties these common threads together into an elegant tapestry for the dogma-weary seeker after truth to contemplate. To use myself as an example, I am not interested in achieving full enlightenment just yet; there are many worldly things I wish to do yet. One can become as balanced as one wishes to be. For those interested in such things, I recommend this book very highly.

Information takes on real value only when it answers a question or solves a problem. Uncertainty about our place in the universe clearly qualifies as a problem, arguably mankind's most significant and persistent problem. Solving it provides us with both a foundation and a purpose. \\"The Perennial Philosophy\\" answers the extremely pertinent questions, \\"Can man know God, and if so, how?\\" Not only does Huxley's classic work answer these questions, it does so from the perspective of experiential \\"knowing\\" that cuts across all imagined boundaries of time and space. Since humans have historically agreed on so very little, it is of no minor importance that the same basic ideas can be found in spiritual thought gathered from all cultures and times. While we believe that each of us must follow our own path, all serious seekers can benefit from the collected wisdom contained it this volume.Huxley's purposeful quotations make it clear that intellectual gymnastics, rituals, systems, good works, or even faith cannot replace experiential knowing. Throughout the book, he emphasizes that those who have found God have done so \\"one on one.\\" They have approached God with a \\"pure heart\\" and a \\"poor spirit.\\" These terms are often misunderstood and have led many seekers to become distracted by the means and miss the goal of Oneness. A pure heart does not petition, it seeks God for no other reason than the pure joy of knowing God. It knows that in seeking God it will find the Self. Huxley points out that the poor in spirit are not those who deprive themselves of material possessions and pleasures, but their \\"poverty\\" is that of non-attachment and selflessness. The seeker first releases all preconceived notions and personal perceptions and then allows God to tell them who God is. Such surrender terrifies the ego/self and will be resisted until we understand that our will and God's will are one. In this knowledge lies the end of all suffering.The path outlined in \\"The Perennial Philosophy\\" is not popular, but as Huxley states, \\"All are called, but in any given generation few are chosen, because few choose themselves.\\" Never the less, as Huxley emphasizes, God wants to be found. The only thing necessary to our success is our willingness. Huxley's masterwork can certainly help us to make that choice and avoid many of the pitfalls the ego finds so attractive.

It is a remarkably thoughtful and constructive endeavour to explore the essential spirit behind all true religious experience(as against 'religion' as a set of wooden beliefs and self- enclosing, self-serving systems). The minority voice in the reviews, discrediting Huxley's work, reflects the narrower definition which says \\"I-am-very-much-other-than-you/my faith -sets-me-apart \\" . . .This is the creed of the bigoted mind, and 'religious' bigotry is probably the most dangerous and hypocritical of all. It is this tendency which has made 'modern-man' sceptical of faith and claims made in in the name of 'religion.' It looks like a formula to go through life - with a permanent squint, as if all religious propositions were saying: Well, make your choice; which door-crack do you wish to view the world and your fellow men through? Ostensibly then, the world of 'creeds' and the 'open mind' represent antithetical poles of existence and thus, the sceptical cast of mind.The refreshing thing about Huxley's 'Perrenial Philosophy' is that it highlights the great-heartedness which lies at the root of all genuine religious insight and feeling, which almost invariably involves self-emptying and poverty of spirit. This is the central theme of Huxley's book, which he fleshes out with abundant quotations and anecdotes drawn from a diversity of religious traditions and backgrounds - a case of 'behold the spirit' - rather than 'behold the institution.'It is one of those ironies of life that while the World's greatest 'mystics' have tended to speak a shared language, their parent institutions have defined themselves - against each other, by invoking cardinal differences. Huxley was all too aware of this, and wasn't making the naive claim that 'all religions are the same' - when it comes to narrow, doctrinal definitions. But the deepest riches of the spirit are not caste in stone - and can never be written down (yes, even Jesus warns us about 'the letter that killeth the spirit). For Huxley, all true religion - all true religious experience, is essentially 'mystical' - the 'living Word,' as against its pallid substitute in paper scriptures. In this respect, Holy Writ resembles a minefield, rather than a garden. The worst kind of 'fundamentalist' tends to believe that even the positioning of the stops, colons and semi-colons of scripture, have been ordained from on high. Divergence of opinion over the semantic function of a single Greek 'iota' - in a religious text, once led a whole Christian community to split into two, separate halves.Huxley makes an excellent job of showing us the other side of the picture - restating the perennial philosophy through the eyes of the Vedanta, Buddhism, St. John of the Cross, Eckhart, William Law, Madame Guyon, Islamic mystics like Rumi - and numerous others, delving deeply into the underlying psychology and living spirit which made these people SEE the truth of THAT which they spake, rather than just preaching or writing about it. For reasons best known to themselves - chiefly, insecurity, I suspect, this 'perennial' vision is the last thing many of the 'orthodox' like to see or hear discussed. Disturbingly, one sort of 'religious revival' taking place in our midst, seems to involve retreating into ultra-conservative, dogmatic stances. It is worth remembering that the original and highest meaning of the term 'Dogma' - used by the Church, signified \\"THAT which can neither be proven nor refuted by human reason (or logic). \\" Hence, it once signified the very opposite of what it is now assumed to mean, namely, that certain words, concepts and pronouncements per se - are absolutely true, in the literal sense. In short, in its wisdom, the Church was saying that its highest truth embodies a divine mystery. And THAT is what we find celebrated in this book. 'Tat Tvam Asi' (Thou art That).Some readers may find 'The Perennial Philosophy' easier to handle, after digesting Huxley's 'The Doors of Perception.' Misquoting Tim Leary, one might say that the theme of the latter is 'Turn On, Tune in - and Drop Completely In'! Huxley was acutely aware of the ambivalent nature of consciousness - in one sense, enslaving us, in another, potentially liberating. He was conscious of the paradoxical fact that human beings crave fulfilment by getting out of themselves, seeking release into the 'blessedly other-than-self,'a search for self-transcendence. Huxley recognised a two-fold possibility here, horizontal 'transcendence' achieved through things like sexual gratification, immersion in collective and public spectacles, political movements etc. - and 'vertical' transcendence i.e. mystical transcendence or quasi-religious transcendence, which differs from the former type, in that it brings the individual to a higher, supra-personal awareness, touching on the totality of life, eternal verities. Conversely, by its very nature, the quest for 'horizontal' transcendence brings but short lived rewards. As Huxley saw it, we are driven - either way, by 'divine discontent' - the itch of which ultimately makes us ask the sort of questions underlying the perennial philosophy."},{"Title":"The perennial philosophy","review":"One of the most comprehensive books I've read, and I've read thousands.

The issues are really quite simple:1. The ultimate source/goal of virtually every religious system is considered by its devotees to be undefinable, beyond the grasp of human reasoning, ineffable, surpassing understanding. Humans call this Ultimate: Godhead (as distinct from \\"God\\"), Brahman (as distinct from \\"Brahma\\"), etc.2. Since this religious Ultimate cannot he rationally defined, described, analysed, or plotted by mathematical models, religious language usage differs from that of the physical sciences. It employs verbal, visual, musical, metaphorical, mythological, and allegorical symbolism to SUGGEST that which humans may experience without being able to define: \\"When I heard the Learn'd Astronomer, etc.\\" (Whitman). . . (Here is where we part company with the rigid rationalist for whom there is no reality apart from what can be measured or weighed.)3. Religious systems arise at different times and places with various mythologies adapted to local needs. As long as these anthropomorhic creations lead the devotee to spiritual realization, they have value -- but not necessarily EQUAL value with every other mythology. Every individual understandably considers his own belief system as BETTER than those of others, and possibly the BEST of all; but this is radically different from claiming that his beliefs are the ONE AND ONLY POSSIBLE WAY to religious realization. BEST leaves open the possibility that other practices may be viable, though inferior; ONLY is binary -- you're either in or you're out, and that can make all the difference in the world. Consider the following:4. In 9th-century Buddhist Japan the Shingon monk Kukai wrote a treatise on \\"The Ten Stages of Religious Consciousness\\" in which he predictably placed his own Shingon Sect at the top of the list. A competitor, the Tendai monk Saicho had no problem with this but was annoyed that Kukai placed the practice of the Kegon sect on the 9th rung, just ahead of Tendai on the 8th. Note that both Kukai and Saicho clearly recognized that all three sects provided ways to achieve spiritual realization, although one might be considered a BETTER practice than another. This is pluralism, NOT relativism (one thing being just as good as another). And neither claimed that his was the ONLY possible method.5. Almost 5 centures later in his _Sand and Pebbles(Shasekishu): The Tales of Muju Ichien, a Voice for Pluralism in Kamakura Japan_ says in his Preface: \\"There is not just one method for entering the Way, the causes and conditions for enlightenment being many. Once a person understands their general significance, he will see that the purport of the various teachings does not vary. And when he puts them into practice, he will find that the goal of the myriad religious exercises is the same.\\" And where does Muju get this idea? Basically from the Mahayana tradition, especially as expressed in _The Lotus Sutra_,q.v. Once again, the alternative to religious absolutism is inclusive pluralism, not \\"relativism\\".In 1945 Aldous Huxley almost certainly never heard of these examples, but he was, and continues to be, a major force in introducing and defending religious pluralism in the West. _The Perennial Philosophy_ continues to inspire."},{"Title":"The perennial philosophy","review":"I am an avid reader of philosophy and philosophical fiction, and not one inclined to gush over a particular work. That being said, I feel if every CEO, politician, pastor, and parent were to read and truly ingest the ideas laid out so brilliantly through excerpt and example by Huxley in this book, the world could not help but be better off for it. This is the sort of book you have to move through slowly and carefully to enjoy, and the sort of book that would offer new insights with repeated readings. Amazing that scarcely 300 pages of text could, if read well, give one a sound general idea about the basic ideas behind virtually every significant school of religious thought.The author's breadth and scope of knowledge is astounding, he has managed to harness the most simple and profound insights from both Eastern and Western religious thought over the course of the last two millenia. Huxley shows us that theologians of all faiths have struggled and continue to struggle with the same fundamental problems, that of maintaining what is traditionally thought to be the Oriental idea of a focussed detachment from all worldly things and desires. The author challenges us to a attempt a difficult, if not impossible, task - to seek out God without desiring him, to focus on neither ends nor means, to act with righteousness but keep a complete disregard for the reward it may bring."},{"Title":"The perennial philosophy","review":"Certainly this work is representative of a stage in Huxley's spiritual career.

And contrary to what some reviewers have said his idea of a unity of religions is not the grossest kind imaginable. He does mentions that some concepts (like truth) can be understood in different ways and are actually understood differently by various traditions. However, says Hux, these differences are trivial and are merely superficial levels of paths that all lead to the same ineffable truth. Can we find fault with that? We had better. Because in making the differences between religions out to be trivial we would be robbing them of much that is essential to them and what is most beautiful about them. Spirituality is not just about the mystical experience. There is also ethics, there is also faith and shelter and community and many things that can be of value and that gives each spirituality its unique beauty.So if you never have a mystical experience with blinking lights and a direct view of God and a melting into the oneness of al being - would that mean that all of your spiritual life has been a waste? The perennial philosophy would say yes. That is why Huxley subtly slags of Protestantism and Therevada Buddhism a number of times - both argue that religion can have value aside from mysticism through a slow process of spiritual growth and humility and sometimes an appreciation of God which is dreadfully ordinary and everyday and simple. Actually, the same argument is found in the Catholic Church, Mahayana, Daoism, Judaism . . . But to take that seriously you would have to accept the different traditions in there entirety. And they would have to have dialogue on how there differences can enrich each other, not just on how they are all actually the same old thing."},{"Title":"The perennial philosophy","review":"Undoubtedly the greatest spiritual anthology of all time."},{"Title":"The perennial philosophy","review":"I do not have read the book yet but it was delivered on time and book is in great condition.I hope (and i'm partly sure) it will be as good to read as it is by look :)"},{"Title":"The perennial philosophy","review":"I first got this book some 20-odd years ago on a recommendation, and read some of the essays.

From this angle, the book is an interesting read of different religious views that have helped humans live an interesting, meaningful, and ethical lives. But &quot;philosophy&quot; is not really involved except incidentally. There is no use of logical clarity, no evaluation of arguments, no use of the philosphical method, nor much of any tools that philosophers normally apply. Indeed, none of the usual philosophical issues are to be found: Epistemology, metaphysics, theories of language, ethics, mind, and anthropology. But, as a digest of religious views, it does a nice job of harmonizing religious &quot;truths&quot; across a wide spectrum of religious thought, from Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Hindu thinkers. But the consequence of this &quot;harmonization&quot; is reductionism of different religious structures into an over-simplified, under-stated worldview and cosmology. So, even under the rubric of &quot;theodicy,&quot; the book fails its philosophical foundations."},{"Title":"The perennial philosophy","review":"I'm not actually sure how perennial Huxley's philosophy is, but in reality there is very little, if any, philosophy in the book at all. What there is, is a discussion of Western religion, particularly Christianity, as judged by vedanta Hinduism. Not exactly an unbiased discussion!Aside from the absence of philosophical method in this book, a major flaw is the author's reduction of all religion to his version of mysticism. Religion is often defined, in a casual way, as &quot;creed, code, cult,&quot; yet there is no mention of belief, morality, or liturgy. To reduce Judaism, Christianity, and Islam to just mysticism renders a very incomplete and totally inaccurate picture of Western religions.Huxley says in the beginning that he will not use the Bible to support his ideas as applied to this mysticism, and I notice he didn't use any of the Church Fathers either. With good reason, but not for the one he gave. No, it would have been too easy for the interested reader to look up scripture quotes cited to discover their original context. That would have been disastrous for Huxley's book. Instead he picked out people like Eckhardt, whose writings were condemned by the Church because he came perilously close to the edge of heresy in promoting a vedanta-like monism in what he had to say. Or St. Catherine of Genoa, with whom most readers, even Catholic ones, would not be familiar. Since she is a cannonized saint, her writings must have reflected authentic Christianity, but the little bits Huxley used to support his ideas must then have been lifted out of the original context, and certainly out of the larger context of St. Catherine's Catholic faith. Other quotes came mostly from members of fringe groups and were not representative of traditional Christianity.The book was well researched, at least from the point of view of digging up little snippets of quotes to support his ideas, and it was written in an enjoyable manner, but, ultimately, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam are fundamentally incompatible with Hinduism, especially in its advaita form, and there is no reconciliation possible. Westerners are so often accused of being &quot;intolerant,&quot; but at least we are more honest than what Huxley presents in the &quot;Perennial Philosophy.&quot;"},{"Title":"The perennial philosophy","review":"The book came in good quality but because I ordered it for a gift, it took forever to get here and I missed giving it to them on their birthday.

That's why Huxley wrote this book to sum up the basics of all religions. Huxley identifies their points of basic agreement and states these common points as basic principles, because they are PERENNIAL to all religion.The great fact, the one which is most pragmatic and expedient in Huxley's writings on the Perennial Philosophy, arrives in the Second Doctrine (here quoted from his Introduction to the Vedanta Society paberback edition of the Baghavad Gita):The second doctrine of the Perennial Philosophy--that it is possible to know the Divine Ground by a direct intuition higher than discursive reasoning--is to be found in all the great religions of the world. --Aldous HuxleyIf mankind generally would grasp that Divinity is reached by subjective intuition, rather than by objective reasoning, it would clear up much of the bad air that is exchanged between the fields of religion & science, and sort out a great deal of the confusion that we face as individuals.It is unfortunate that mankind does not practice a more generalized religion, for religion used as a \\"spiritual toolkit\\" rather than righteous dogma, will set us free."},{"Title":"The perennial philosophy","review":"Aldous Huxley must have been a busy man: novel writer, non-fiction writer, psychedelic trailblazer and self-proclaimed mystic, this man seems to have lived the life to the full. Weirdly, considering his religious-spiritual views, he actually is related to Thomas and Julian Huxley.\\"The Perennial Philosophy\\" feels like an early-seventies classic, but was actually published already in 1945. The book is often, wrongly, described as an anthology of edifying excerpts from the writings of the great mystics East and West. Actually, it's an exposition by Huxley himself, although liberally sprinkled with quotations from said mystics. William Law and Meister Eckhart seem to have been two of Huxley's top favourites.Although Huxley claims to believe in an actual filosofia perennis, he devotes almost no space to defending the notion. Rather, he deals with the issues themselves: the nature and character of God, miracles, grace, faith, good and evil, rituals, and so on. Indeed, \\"The Perennial Philosophy\\" could be described as a kind of Bible of spirituality-in-general. In that sense, it deserves to be considered a classic.But, of course, there's nothing particularly \\"perennial\\" about the perennial philosophy. Right or wrong, what Huxley preaches from his rooftop is really a version of Advaita Vedanta, couched in a Westernized-Christianized terminology. Are we to believe Wikipedia, Huxley had some kind of contacts with the Ramakrishna Mission, the main conduit of Advaita in 20th century America. Even in India, there's a plethora of very different spiritual traditions, many of whom would reject Advaita out of hand, for instance the theistic-panentheistic \\"Qualified Non-Dualism\\" of Ramanuja. And then, of course, there's Christianity, which in its traditional form simply isn't amenable to the perennial philosophy. Indeed, traditional Christianity seems to be the only religion explicitly attacked in Huxley's book.While it's true that many mystics have (or seem to be having) remarkably similar experiences, which could be termed \\"pantheist\\", not all of them interpret the experiences in the same manner. Maximus the Confessor describes his mystical union with God in a way that would make Eckhart, Vivekananda or Huxley become very interested indeed, but he never left the orthodox Christian fold. In fact, he was one of the foremost defenders of orthodoxy against the \\"heresies\\" of his day. Another example would be Gregory Palamas. Further, there are mystics who don't even describe their visions in \\"pantheist\\" terms, including many Christian mystics, but also Jewish \\"throne mystics\\". Huxley could respond that these mystics were on a lower level than the impersonal mystics, but how on earth can such a statement ever be confirmed or disconfirmed?This edition also contain a concluding essay by Huxley called \\"Beliefs\\", in which he very explicitly defends the notion of an impersonal divine reality. Not only is it impersonal, it's also non-ethical. Yet, the only way for man to approach this impersonal, non-ethical Ground is to behave ethically towards his fellow men (i.e. other persons). A rather strange co-incidence, this, that while the Ground is ultimately beyond good and evil, only the good can reach it! As any antinomian would point out to Huxley (an antinomian high on mescaline, perhaps), this simply cannot be true, since the Ground can arguably be reached by quite different methods as well. India has spawned antinomian traditions by the double and triple. I don't claim to know whether God exists or not, but if he does, it's reasonable to suppose that God is both personal and non-personal. How else could God be the metaphysical ground of dynamic, creative intelligence if he is strictly impersonal? Dynamic, creative intelligence implies a person.\\"The Perennial Philosophy\\" lacks a truly evolutionary perspective, which many would also consider a problem. Non-perennial, modern science strongly suggests (to put it mildly) that we live in an evolutionary universe. In Huxley's vision, the Godhead is static and utterly indifferent to our comings and goings, which occasionally leads the author to sound like an anti-modernist enemy of progress. (Huston Smith has the same problem - he wants to be politically \\"liberal\\" but nevertheless doesn't believe in progress and evolution.) The Theosophists, Sri Aurobindo and Ken Wilber have attempted, each in his own way, to amend this shortcoming. So has Teilhard, although in his case, it was Catholicism who was in for a house-cleaning.Be that as it may, I nevertheless award Aldous Huxley's book five stars. It's well worth reading and pondering, being the most erudite and appealing exposition of impersonal mysticism I've come across."},{"Title":"The perennial philosophy","review":"that comes directly from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. What Huxley has done in a nearly apotheosis like manner, is bring to the fore the common threads which pervade and are deeply inherent in all major religions. Quoting sources from such manifold schools of thought as: Hinduism, Buddhism, Zen, Islam, Christian Mysticism ad infinitum, the author clearly demonstrates that the roots of these major religions are quite similar and that the main tenant of these practices is singular - in order to turn towards God one must turn away from the self.This work is quite grand in scope and hybridized in that it is part philosophy, part religious study, part historical review with a healthy smattering of psychological and sociological discourse thrown in for good measure. And while this work is replete with excellent insights and wisdom it harbors certain detractions and distractions as well. For example: it is abundantly clear the author is highly intelligent and a gifted writer, yet the way he formulates and communicates his thoughts is inordinately complex owing to superfluous content. Huxley routinely uses multi - compound sentences complete with parenthetical thoughts and hyphenated asides, which too often served to confound this reader. It is said that 90% of the English language is redundant; well, that point is well evidenced in this book. The next most prominent distraction found in Aldous' writing style is his use of undefined quotes and/or statements given in foreign languages such as Latin, French, and I think there were a couple in Spanish.This book is of high value, but is a rather slow study, thus I offer 4 stars for this perennial masterpiece."},{"Title":"The perennial philosophy","review":"I truly love Aldous Huxley's work~!

It is challenging to read, and the reward and inspiration that can be found in this work makes it worth the challenge a thousand times over.Jesus and the Buddha undoubtedly had personal qualities that gave their teachings a quality of profound persuasion. And yet, it is likely that neither was as gifted a communicator as Aldous Huxley, and the Gospels and the Dhammapadda do not have any greater a quality of profound expression of the eternal truth than this book.

I myself did not know I was, and it showed me more than I could have ever hoped to have seen."},{"Title":"The perennial philosophy","review":"Some time in the last century, Thoreau lamented that the &quot;Bibles of mankind&quot; were neglected even among those making a serious attempt to understand the Jewish and Christian ones. In the years since, many anthologies and expositions of sacred writings have endeavoured to repair the gap, few perhaps as successfully as this one. Like a Boethius for the modern age, Huxley delineates the universal and timeless truths enunciated by the sages of preceding centuries, interspersed with his own perceptive and serenely illuminating remarks. This is a book to be carefully pondered and studied with others. I can think of no other which so deserves to be the Vade Mecum of the spiritual journey -- the road map to guide you onward. Ultimately your conception of the &quot;perennial philosophy&quot; may differ from Huxley's, but I am sure you will value his contribution toward its elucidation, and may well agree that several of his original passages merit inclusion in its eternal canon."},{"Title":"The perennial philosophy","review":"_The Perrenial Philosophy_ is a masterpiece of English literature - one of the most important books of the twentieth century written in our language. It is the ultimate introduction to all forms of Eastern philosophical and religious thought. But it is more than just an introduction; it is a comprehensive and exhausting crash course in Eastern religion. This book is an indispensible guide to improving the quality of life simply through a change in attitude. There is an unreal amount of information crammed into this volume. It is in fact a &quot;bible&quot; of sorts. If our society were to be annihilated in some sort of catastrophe, and only one book were to survive for the remaining people to discover, this book would probably be the most advantageous one they could find. It may not be the most profound book ever written, but it is extremely valuble because of the amount and variety of historical information conveyed. It provides wisdom from the viewpoints of dozens of important philosophers and religious thinkers, and reads like some kind of greatest-hits albulm. There are other works that may be more modern and far-reaching, and others that may be more unique and individualistic. But the _Perrenial Philosophy_ accomplishes exactly what it set out to do, which is catalogue and explain profound quotes from a wide variety of great thinkers. Some readers might have preferred that Huxley interject more of his own ideas, but if you want to benefit from the wisdom of dozens of great authors without having to buy each one of their books (if they're even available), then I highly recommend that you buy this book."},{"Title":"The perennial philosophy","review":"This is one of the most comprehensive and well written books on the mystical path, which is the core of the religious/spiritual experience. Huxley unites all the world's traditions offering the intrinsic philosophy underlying all paths to God. I humbly recommend this book to anyone seeking an understanding of the sometimes hidden truth in religion."},{"Title":"The perennial philosophy","review":"Simply stated the Perennial Philosophy is \\"Thou Essence is That Essence\\". Each of us is a unique iteration of the Spiritual Source of the Universe. A microcosm of the macrocosm. Created by God as a godlike being for it takes a god to worship God fully. When I use the word God I could just as easily use any of the other names for the ineffable source of existence. The tao that can be named is not the eternal Tao. We are gods, but not the God, lest any man or woman should boast. To fail to see that we are a part of God is an illusion, to think that we are God is a delusion. The seer is intimate with a peace that passeth understanding. God is not only within ourselves, but within all other people as well, even the rest of Creation, God is omnipresent. Pride is a tricky devil. I am an aspect of God, therefore I must be God. Wrong dear solipsist. I am here too. And so are others. God is not One, God is a unitive One. \\"Totality is a unitive one.\\" Hui-Neng. The Kingdom of God is a family. We are each a part of that which has no separate parts.God is a synergetic whole, more than one but less than two. An irrational, beyond rational, whole between one and two, a paradoxical number, a numberless number. God is ineffable. This reality we find ourselves in isn't your dream or mine, we are however links in the great dream chain of existence. Our material Universe is a simulation, a learning tool for spiritual beings. An illusion conceals, a simulation prepares. The glass is half full, or half empty, you decide. Are you an optimist or a pessimist? As Teilhard de Chardin once noted, \\"We are not human beings having a spiritual experience, we are spiritual beings having a human experience\\". Essence is prior to existence. Spirit is prior to matter. Wu is prior to the body/mind complex. Though it is true that there are no lines of demarcation in Nature, our Universe is interconnected, there are areas of confluence, fields of concentrated energy, such as you and I. All created things are such. That part of us that has not been created, that part of our essence that is divine, is found within the holy of holies, our heart, our soul. We are spirit. An awareness of our true selves is essential for the full expression of our potential to be godlike beings, to be childlike beings. To return to innocence is to let go of our conditioned egos and be our original selves. Life is a test in which we either grade ourselves fairly or we are held back. We get to do it over and over again until we get it right. We graduate from one level of understanding to the next without necessarily leaving this relative reality. Our world changes as we change. Made in the image of God we are co-creators with God. Meditation is about coming to this enlightened realization through direct experience rather than the result of a rational conclusion. We are spirit. Nonduality, God, cannot be described in dualistic terms, rather merely suggested. God is like... Thus the use of Parables and Myths and other such forms of metaphorical expression where God and eternal truths are concerned. We cannot say what God is, only what God is like. I AM THAT I AM. Certainty is the product of pride.The essential part of us, our spirit, was never born and will never die. The purpose of life here in the realm of duality is not to play a game of Solitaire with ourselves, but to play a game of Hearts with each other. This is the message of all the great Mystics from all the great spiritual traditions of our world, past and present. Our material but insubstantial reality comes from an immaterial but substantial source. God is eternal, and so are we.This book by Aldous Huxley is one of the greatest books ever written about the Perennial Philosophy. It is must reading if you want to know more about the truth of the universality of truth. No religion has a patent on God. As that great Christian Mystic Meister Eckhart once said, \\"God is like a great underground river\\". Meditation is the technique nearly all great mystics have used to dig sacred wells into the great underground river of spirit that flows through and beyond every manifested thing. I say nearly because there are exceptions to every rule but this rule. Grace is the final arbiter. With that said, take personal responsibility and dig your own well my friend. Just don't get to thinking your well is the only well. This is the Philosophia Perennis in a nutshell. Now Go.For futher reading on the Perennial Philosophy may I suggest some of the following authors. Karen Armstrong, Ananda K. Coomaraswamy, Joseph Campbell, Meister Eckhart, Rene Guenon, Thomas Merton, Rumi, Frithjof Schuon, and Huston Smith, among others."},{"Title":"The perennial philosophy","review":"I was given this book by my grandmother, who had purchased it in to 50's. At first I found the content and the author's writing style frustrating, but I found that as I let the words drift by, I was left with pure ideas, pure content. With this book, Huxley acheives a subtlety of presentation that many authors will never achieve. He concisely summarises and presents the theological and spiritual fundaments of the major religions in a way that is accessible to the devoted reader. It has a very different feel to some of his other works like Brave New World and The Doors of Perception. I liked it, but I think that you need to approach the book with a little patience."},{"Title":"The perennial philosophy","review":"Huxley was clearly a man with great vision, undoubtedly ahead of his time. This book notes the crucial points of world religion/philosophy in terms understandable to both Eastern and Western minds. It will become essential reading to the student of philosophy/world religion and a work valued for centuries to come. The author points out the key elements of the human condition and the proper path to follow for ultimate salvation. Huxley shows us the way, the burden is now ours to understand. I highly recommend this book as a must reading for anyone."},{"Title":"The perennial philosophy","review":"About twenty or so years ago, I had an awakening of sorts. Strange how life can be. One minute you're slicing a banana atop your corn flakes, and the next minute you're looking straight into the Light that all things are created in and out of. And after I had that experience of \\"knowing\\" that life was something more than this external form, I went on a rather mad search to see if I could find anything that would back up my experience and one of the first books I bumped into was the Perennial Philosophy by Aldous Huxley.After reading this book, I was angry. Not at dear Mr. Huxley who beautifully pointed out why all religions and traditions have strands of the same Truth and Wisdom flowing through them, but I was angry that I belonged to a species that was so obviously stupid.I frequently sat outside at the local coffee shop in my black beret, my black sunglasses, and black overcoat on chilly 90 degree days looking at the people walking to and fro with complete disdain. I often grumnbled, \\"Don't these people realize how beautiful and wondrous life truly is? The poor slobs.\\"And what I was doing was in complete opposition to the Perennial Philosophy. I was no better than the overexcited religionist who wants to \\"prove\\" that his religion is better than yours/that her God is the \\"True God\\" and I one day I took my blinders off and looked in the mirror. I looked in the mirror until the form before me dissolved and the Light that I was created in and out of came forth.And I found myself rejoicing at the happy fact that all of us live in such a state of amazing grace. That this is the beauty of life; that it waits and it waits and it waits for us to notice it and when we turn to it, it races with joy and with love and with beauty to give us everything that it has and the Truth is, it NEVER withheld anything from us in the first place.Does that kind of sound like the parable of the Prodigal Son? Well it should. Jesus knew that God was not withholding; that God is Love and is Love all the time.Religions stress sin, evil, repentance, and separation but the revealer behind the religion knows in a beautifully innocent way that the One Life of God...of Spirit...of whatever you want to call it, is in and through everything seen as well as all that is unseen and this is the common thread that runs through every mystical experience and every individual who was daring enough to have one. It is the knowledge that is within you right now and is waiting for you to simply \\"wake up\\". You are the prophet you've been wating for. You're already \\"saved\\" why are you resisting the procedure? The Kingdom of God is now at hand within you and around you now.My cynicism has softened over the years and even though there are times where I can easily (too easily) see things as black or white, I know that there is a stretch of gray that is as big as eternity itself, where beauty and grace reside waiting for me to rememember over and over and over again, that all there really is, is Life Itself and Life needs no one to defend it or protect it or be saved for it. It stands on Its own Formless, Real, and Perfect moving into and through all, as all.Buy this book. Buy a cup of coffee. Have an experience. Read, assimilate, drink, enjoy. Here's hoping your intellectual experiences transcend themselves into something much, much more.Peace & Blessings"},{"Title":"The perennial philosophy","review":"I feel some of the more critical reviewers posting here coming from a very glib place. Maybe 'old man Huxley' is too stuffy (too Victorian?) for the modern, confident, e-informed seeker. I love this book because I know the context of the man's life and where it came from. Discover Huxley! His flaws are obvious, sure, but nothing in comparison to the difficulties he overcame and the giant leap he provided to the thinkers of his generation (and the seekers of the next!)

Huxley is a timeless, worthy writer to meet, profound but easy to read and understand."},{"Title":"The perennial philosophy","review":"This book is essential reading for those interested in the realities of the spiritual world. It is an overview of the world's religious views and their points of agreement. For those who have begun their awakening, it is essential reading. Its bibliography alone is worth having. I read it when I was 17 and thought it full of misty-headed nonsense interspersed with noble but doomed aspirations; I reread it when I was 50 and found that th book had grown much wiser in the interim. This book describes reality! Consider the following quote: &quot;The lust-dieted man 'slaves the ordinance of Heaven' -- that is to say, he subordinates the laws of Nature and the spirit to his own cravings. The result is that 'he does not feel' and therefore makes himself incapable of knowledge. His ignorance is ultimately voluntary; if he cannot see, it is because 'he will not see.' Such voluntary ignorance inevitably has its negative reward. Nemesis follows hubris -- sometimes in a spectacular way, as when the self-blinded man (Macbeth, Othello, Lear) falls into the trap which his own ambition or possessiveness or petulant vanity has prepared for him; sometimes in a less obvious way, as in the cases where power, prosperity and reputation endure to the end* but at the cost of an ever-increasing imperviousness to grace and enlightenment, an ever completer inability to escape, now or hereafter, from the stifling prison of selfness and separateness. How profound can be the spiritual ignorance by which such 'enslavers of Heaven's ordinances' are punished is indicated by the behavior of Cardinal Richelieu on his death-bed. The priest who attended him urged the great man to prepare his soul for its coming ordeal by forgiving all his enemies. &quot;I have never had any enemies,' the Cardinal replied with the calm sincerity of an ignorance which long years of intrigue and avarice and ambition had rendered as absolute as had been his political power, 'save only those of the State.' Like Napoleon, but in a different way, he was 'feeling heaven's power,' because he had refused to feel charity and therefore refused to know the whole truth about his own soul or anything else.&quot; In addition, the author uses beautifully concise and precise language."},{"Title":"The perennial philosophy","review":"The Perennial Philosophy by Aldous Huxley, Harper & Brothers, 1945; HarperCollins 2009, 324 ff.The perennial philosophy refers to the spiritual truths that underlie human existence in all cultures through all time, transmitted through Jungian archetypes, Sheldrake's \`morphic field' and the wisdom philosophies. The term \`perennial philosophy' seems to have been used first as long ago as 1540 by the Italian humanist Agostino Steuco, and then by German mathematician and philosopher G.W. Leibniz in the 18th century.Aldous Huxley is perhaps best known for his novels, Brave New World and The Devils of Loudun, but this work is a non-fictional survey of aspects of spirituality. I cannot do better than to reproduce the author's own definition of his subject matter: \`the metaphysic that recognizes a divine Reality that is substantial to the world of things and lives and minds; the psychology that finds in the soul something similar to, or even identical with, divine Reality; the ethic that places man's final end in the knowledge of the immanent and transcendent Ground of all being - the thing is immemorial and universal'.This book is a collection of writings on this enduring mystical theme, joined together by a commentary from Huxley. He compares the extracts he has chosen with the Shruti and Smriti of the Hindu religion: the Shruti depend upon direct perception of these universal truths accessed transcendentally by the sages or rishis while the Shriti are myths and tales that illustrate the moral teachings of the Shruti. The whole book is much more oriented towards the spiritual Hinduism and Buddhism of the East than the doctrinal religion of the West.In Chapter IV, God in the World, Huxley specifically berates humankind for its lack of respect for, and its exploitation of, the natural world and endorses communing with God through Nature. Respect for the trees, rocks and streams around us that has long since disappeared from western capitalism, at least until quite recently, has remained very much alive in Chinese and Japanese society: where western religious art depicts characters from scripture, Eastern art is full of reverent nature-painting. Huxley was always a keen supporter of environmental preservation and deplored the Brave New World we were creating.Chapter VI is about Non-Attachment and Right-Livelihood - about not letting the quest for material acquisitions and comforts and the turbulence of our daily lives disturb our equilibrium: certainly a message for our times. Huxley maintains however that the worship of Culture, for its own sake, is overblown. Novelty in the arts has become almost a god in its own right. Having said that, many writers of plays and novels indicated that they understood human psychology long before Freud.Chapter VII deals with the issue of truth. Whatever we say of the material world can only be an approximation of truth because its essence we can never truly know. And the same is true of statements about God: Huxley records the sayings of many sages endorsing the via negativa - that nothing we say of God can begin to describe the qualities of the divine.Chapter IX on self-knowledge opens with a quote from Boethius: \`In other living creatures ignorance of self is nature; in man it is vice'. This echoes Socrates' maxim: \`the unexamined life is not worth living'. Many sages have told us that the greatest challenge of human life is to understand oneself.Chapter XII is on Time and Eternity and opens with the statement: \`The universe is an everlasting succession of events; but its ground . . . is the timeless now of the divine Spirit'. The extracts and commentary then elaborate on this theme.Space prevents my summarising the themes of all 27 chapters, but I hope this review will give readers a good feel for the content and spirit of the book.The Phenomenon of Man by Teilhard de ChardinDestination of the Species: The Riddle of Human Existence by Michael MeacherHoward Jones is the author of The Tao of Holism"},{"Title":"The perennial philosophy","review":"This is the book that set me on the path of study that not only landed me an Undergraduate degree in Religious Studies with Advanced and Research Honors, an \\"Outstanding Philosophy Major of the Year\\" award, and the writing of an Honors thesis called \\"The Sphere of Mystical Paradox: The Problem of Paradox in Mystical Truth-Claims,\\" (consisting of 50 pages concluding that there WAS no problem).

By crossing cultural and religious boundaries while, through his selections, illuminating the same themes Huxley takes the reader deeper and deeper into each of these themes that are each aspects of the perennial philosophy. Through his work Huxley has helped me understand the source of religions and how they have evolved more into political systems then maintaining an integrity of the teachings. Also, how each religious tradition has a mystical expression that is often at odds with the developing more formalized religion. I've often wondered why would religious people seek war and why do these modern preachers and priests who profess to be so stoically religious can be so cruel and condescending toward other human beings, not to mention the things that are done to our children? Huxley helped me to understand within the context of his themes how religions have gotten to this place in our culture. Yet, at the same time, in each religion we hear the voices of those saints and mystics that really did profess the truth of a perennial philosophy, not by preaching or talking about it, but by living it in the daily practices of their life."},{"Title":"Don Quijote de la Mancha (Audio CD) (Spanish Edition)","review":"This classic contains many antiquated words, therefore an abridged audio book version was welcome. Unfortunately, this production has flaws that prompted me to give up three quarters into it. Firstly, such a heavily abridged version should have concentrated on the main story, i.e. the adventures of Don Quijote and Sancho Panza, rather than get bogged in the many secondary stories. For instance, it contains too much of the soap-opera-like story of Don Fernando and Luscinda, while the episode where Don Quijote frees the convicts is only hinted at. In many places there are such gaps in the telling of these digressive secondary tales that you get lost. Replacing ancient word forms (\\"formosura\\") by their modern equivalents (\\"hermosura\\") was a good idea but why not do so throughout instead of only in the beginning? In fact there is a drop in quality towards the end and the undisputed talent of the speakers was wasted when they kept reading out sentences in an intonation out of step with their meaning ; or when they rendered whole sentences unintelligible by missing words (verbs, prepositions etc.).

However, I was dissappointed with the choreography and the notation in the book, and would not reccommend it to anyone looking to use it as a source for quick and easy (or interesting) choreography. I found the narrative was an interesting idea as an aide to the notation, but the pictures were not at all clear, nor was the notation. In an attempt to simplify things, an odd and sometimes innaccurate mix of numbered parries and described hits is used... sometimes a thrust to the right means the attacker's right, sometimes the defender's. Only the parry helps you figure it out. I was also not that impressed with the choreography itself- not bad, but rather generic. I suppose it's hard to do anything too unconventional in a book format, since you're limited to what you can put in words or pictures, and I don't think either were used too clearly here.

However, when they reached the swamplands of Louisiana, fever claimed all the other members of his family. The story opens with Cav sitting and wondering what to do next, the two oxen are sound animals that respond well to his control, so he has no trouble in continuing the journey. Unfortunately, now he has no destination. The events have almost sapped as his emotional strength and he is on the edge of coming completely apart. A man named Bruce Cavanaugh (Big Cav) spots his campfire and would like Cav to share it, and although weary of a stranger, Cav enjoys the human company. Big Cav is the boss of a team that is going to drive a large herd of cattle up to the cattle markets in Kansas.This is the beginning of a major adventure for Cav, as he sells his wagon and oxen and is put in a school. However, this is not for him so he bolts and buys two horses so that he can take off and join Big Cav's group of cowboys. Cav encounters an unscrupulous peddler that convinces a local sheriff that Cav is a horse thief, so the peddler takes Cav's horses. Cav manages to break away from the peddler and flees until he encounters Big Cav's group.Cav proves to be a solid worker, doing his share and more in the drive, one that is fraught with difficulties brought on by nature. In the end, Cav once again encounters the peddler and manages to turn one of the peddler's tricks against him. At the end, Cav is proclaimed a true cowboy, an honor he is proud to have earned.This is a nice adventure tale of the old west for children, there is no gunplay and the only shot fired is a signal to start a race. There are no encounters with Indians and even though he had every right to do so, Cav feels guilty for having taken one of the peddler's horses."},{"Title":"The bridge in the jungle","review":"I confess that I am a major afficionado of B. Traven. My politics have mellowed over the years but I enjoy Traven's political perspective. I believe B. Traven was an ararchist at heart. He attacked big government and big business as evil but saw the uncorrupted individual as nobel and good. In the rural Mexican Indian community he found, for himself, the most ideal form of government he had ever encountered. His Jungle Books were a tale of conflict between good and evil; peasant and capitalism. His book, The Bridge in the Jungle, is his ode to the Indian peasant community. He brings us into their midst throught his vagabond American who stumbles upon a small village at the time a tragedy is unfolding. A young boy has drowned and we witness their suffering and their coming together. We see the corruption of their society by misunderstood influences from the outside world. The example I remember best is the musician who, when asked to play something during the funeral march, comes up with &quot;Yes We have no Bananas&quot;. Neither the musician nor anyone else except our American narrator comprehends the total inappropriateness of the song. All in all, a beautiful story of a disappearing society."},{"Title":"The bridge in the jungle","review":"&quot;The Bridge in the Jungle&quot; is one of those strange books you don't know how to respond to at first. On one hand it's absolutely tragic and, on the other, it's filled with some of the funniest passages imaginable. More or less condensed into a twenty-four hour period, Traven describes how an Indian community bands together, sometimes with folly but often with strength, when a young boy disappears into the bush.Throughout the story Traven gives an intimate account of peasant life in southern Mexico, nevering missing a detail of how the campesinos live, think and act. In fact the narrative is filled with so many astute observations that you feel, at times, Traven works better as an anthropologist than as a novelist.But, unfortunately, some of these observations sound a little sentimental. It's the only work by Traven that seems to run in circles, at times even becoming boring. He praises the spiritualism of Indians one too many times and focusses on their diet rather than moving on with the plot.He does, however, redeem himself with the character of Sleigh, an expat who's made the jungle his home. He's like a good-natured version of Kurtz -- wise, crazy, but harmless.On top of all this, Traven makes his usual attacks against the oil industry and organized religion.If you enjoyed any of his &quot;jungle books,&quot; then gives this one a read."},{"Title":"The bridge in the jungle","review":"This book was dedicated by Traven to the mothers of the world. It is a cold, crude and, at the same time, compasionate and tender view on a child's death and the terrible, extreme pain it produces on his mother. It also describes the quite particular, &quot;uncontaminated&quot; and honest reaction the event creates among a small Indian community in Chiapas. All this is told by Gales, the main character, an American adventurer that hardly tries to undertand what is actually going on and how he feels about it.Although the plot is very simple, this novel has some passages of an extraordinary literary intensity. It is also full of irony and sometimes sarcasm too.Well, it can be said The Bridge in the Jungle is a sad, tragic novel but it is beautifully written and that is what matters."},{"Title":"The bridge in the jungle","review":"By chance I came upon Traven at the library when I noted that he had authored \\"Treasure of Sierra Madre,\\" a film classic that I automatically associate with Hollywood's old Bogey.What I found most fascinating was the way Traven transcended cultural biases, opening a window to another world. In an obscure Mexican jungle town a seemingly poor and inconsequential boy dies. Yet what is revealed is a metaphor speaking to the proud spirit of an Aztec culture on the threshold of extinction."},{"Title":"The bridge in the jungle","review":"Sets the scene brilliantly - you can 'see' the people, their surroundings, their squalor, the river and surrounding jungle, the changing light, etc - and I found myself thinking about and reliving the events after I'd finished the book, which isn't overly long. It's as though you've had a vivid, exotic dream you may never forget. There are also odd passages of the narrator's introspection which stick in the mind and warrant re-reading. The symbolism is obvious and powerful, but I consider the meaning more humanist than political. I don't believe in superstition, but this book helped me understand why other people might believe in it, and the arguable value of that. An easy, worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Hunter's World, The","review":"This is the book for hunters. It is for men who are aware that the game they seek exists in an environment of many dimensions. And who sense that success - and real satisfaction - as a hunter depend on an understanding of all those mingled elements of terrain, feed, cover, and the interrelatedness of species. And who will welcome an expert's guidance on how to enrich their own hunting experience by becoming a meaningful part of the hunting environment. With 300 pictures - 193 of them in full color - by outstanding wildlife photographers."},{"Title":"Hungry Ghosts: Mao's Secret Famine","review":"This book tells the fascinating and horrifying story of a Chinese famine caused by the communists. Basically, the communists had &quot;experts&quot; (really party hacks) who thought they knew everything about agricultural such as burying seeds several feet into the ground to produce good growth and planting crops close to each other so they could help each other grow. These techniques failed miserably but no one would admit the failures in the communist chain of command. Glowing reports of record crops were passed along to the point that Mao was wondering what to do with the surplus. Before it was over, millions had died and countless others were reduced to cannibalism.If anyone ever thought that George Orwell didn't know about Communists and that way of thinking, he/she should read this book. Everything about it rings like an unpublished Orwell novel, but it was all too true for the millions who died. This work should definately be required reading for high school students."},{"Title":"Hungry Ghosts: Mao's Secret Famine","review":"Books like this are important since they set the standards for others to follow. No one - to my knowledge - has seriously tried to quantify the extent of the suffering brought on by the famine that began in the late 1950s. In Hungry Ghosts, author Japser Becker might not get his numbers absolutely right, but this is a highly engaging look at the downside of thuggish megalomania. I don't think I've ever read anything so morbid, yet so utterly fascinating.The basic thrust is that China's communists repeated the mindless agricultural policies designed by their Soviet counterparts in the 1920s. Russia's communists destroyed learning, promoted ignorance and brought famine to the Ukraine. China, following in their footsteps, made exactly the same mistakes. Strangely enough, the result was exactly the same. Famine and over 30 million deaths - as the World Food Summit's documents clearly show.What follows is the story of a country in the grip of mass delusion as moronic agricultural policies caused a collapse in crop production and an authoritarian government demanded ever higher taxes in the form of grain. Of course, communities attempted to please Mao by lying about the true level of grain production. Since they exaggerated, their grain tax quota was higher. When they couldn't pay their taxes, their food stocks were confiscated. Villagers then died, en masse. Anyone found with food was assumed to be counter-revolutionary and was either starved to death or executed in gruesome circumstances. The madness only ended when Mao's own family intervened. But only after tens of millions had perished.Some reviewers - expecially those who grew up in a stable and judicial country like Hong Kong - seem to think that the murderous circus just north of the Shenzhen river is something to be applauded and anyone who thinks differently is out to get at China. How sad can you get? Four Stars."},{"Title":"Hungry Ghosts: Mao's Secret Famine","review":"The tragedy of the massive famine that devoured untold numbers of lives in China during the 1959 - 1961 \\"Great Leap Forward\\" campaign was that the official stand of the Chinese Communist Party refused to acknowledge it as a man-made mistake.This book acts like Spielberg's \\"Shoah Foundation\\", it's a testament to a fatalistic catastrophe of biblical proportions. It contains testimonies of survivors which the author had interviewed.

He used countless sources, including many internal CCP documents, interviews, and plenty of statistical analysis. Mixed with the scholarship are several in-depth narratives that look at specific counties and provinces in China."},{"Title":"Hungry Ghosts: Mao's Secret Famine","review":"I read this book many years ago when there were not many Chinese sources available.

The facts in this books check out against Yang's book and other sources. I thank the author for exposing one of the saddest moments in human history. Despite the scale of the disaster, most young people in China never heard about it since some people really want us to forget what happened in those terrible years. This book stands as a reminder what protects our freedom and quality of life."},{"Title":"Hungry Ghosts: Mao's Secret Famine","review":"I first read this book when it came out (and posted a review right here in 1997). Now, 13 years later, I find it has lost none of its shock value. Every page heaps multiple outrages on multiple outrages.Unlike any other famine, this one did not have a political objective or a natural basis - it was essentially unintentional, and entirely man--made, making it even more horrifying. It was of such proportion the country even suppressed the 1964 census data. Doctors were not permitted to claim starvation as a cause of death. Cannibalism was rampant. And the entire time, China continued to export grain. The state's granaries remained full.Mao implemented the \\"Great Lea Forward\\" to catch up to the West, using an agricultural policy he knew had totally failed in Stalin's USSR 25 years before. Everyone had to go along, or face death. No one could avoid lying that everything was going great, and exceeding expectations, because that's what Mao had to hear. The result was an unending and unendurable hell, which, far from catching up, actually saw wheat production actually drop below the level of the Han Dynasty, 2000 years prior.The details elicit emotions like I have never experienced in reading the worst atrocities of Nazi Germany or Stalinist Russia, probably because this had no such goal - it just happened and kept happening to a worse and worse effect. It is all thoroughly and painstakingly documented, making it absolutely believable, and horrifyingly real, from the bizarre policies that led to it (melting all metal in backyard furnaces to create \\"steel\\") to the insane agricultural \\"solutions\\" (cutting three to six foot deep furrows so the wheat harvest would multiply) inspired by Mao, it is all there, in seeming science fiction of the worst B-movie kind. Truly a must read."},{"Title":"Hungry Ghosts: Mao's Secret Famine","review":"This is an utterly fascinating story of how fear and lack of personal, individual responsibility came together to create a disaster of unthinkable proportions. I found the book easy to read, well researched, convincing, and more than adequately documented for anyone who might wish to explore some of the author's conclusions further.Most poignantly, the book ends with an anxious eye to North Korea. The author's anguished conviction that &quot;it will happen/is happening, all over again&quot; has been all too persuasively supported by evidence from humanitarian organizations that is all too easy to ignore by those of us who enjoy the standard of living made possible by a modern capitalistic state.There will always be apologists and wishful thinkers who attack from a baseline ideology divorced from historical fact. Ignore those people, buy this book, and make up your own mind. The truth is out there."},{"Title":"Hungry Ghosts: Mao's Secret Famine","review":"There are so many good things about this book that I have had to whittle down the good points in the interest of creating a good, simple review. (There was no single bad point that I could find about the book.) I can also say that I will not be purchasing the copy of \\"Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds,\\" because the events chronicled in this book far exceed (in scale and sheer stupidity/ malice) any of the chapters of the reviewed book. Other than the general splendidness of this book, I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE THAT THIS HAPPENED!1. The prose just leapt off the page. Books dealing with analysis of current/ historical events using statistics can seem intenesely boring and difficult to read (Tainted Truth -by Cynthia Crossen andThe Tyranny of Numbers: Mismeasurement and Misruleby Nicholas Eberstadt spring immediately to mind), but this was not the case. I gobbled up this text because of its readability.2. There was just SO MUCH information not only about the famine in China, but also the relevant details of similar famines in the USSR, Cambodia, and North Korea. Another cool piece of information was the fact that orthodox genetics was ignored for some period of time in China-- and that offers an explanation as to the shocking genetic deformities that one sees here on a daily basis (people too close together marrying each other; villages where everyone has the same last name).3. Apparently, famines in China were the status quo. And it was not owing to anything other than the transport costs. Apparently, it was cheaper to bring some foods in from overseas than it was to transport them from one part of China to another. 1,828 famines? There are many who deny that the Great Leap Forward ever happened, but if the total number of famines is correct (and famines happened on 1,827 other occasions), then why would the 1828th time be a surprise? It is not easy to accept that railroads didn't come to China until something like 150 years after they became popular in the West-- or that the Qing Dynasty actively prevented them from being built for fear of not being able to control them. (This topic alone could have become another book: successive Chinese governments' choice of underdevelopment and complete control of things with which they were familiar rather than more development at the cost of less control. I think Becker just let us take this away as subtext rather than really get into it.)4. Becker made an interesting afterword on North Korea. The number of people who starved to death there (as a percentage of the population) is greater than even in China. He also demonstrated to us his awareness of his surroundings (noticing little things such as fruit stores stocked with plastic fruit and non functional cash registers-- or hospital equipment that had plugs still encased in their original wrappings).5. \\"Gob-smacking\\" is hardly even the right word. Every 10 pages or so, one has to stop and remind oneself that this is not a fiction novel and that this actually happened. What circumstances could have driven people to such stupidity? I could have done with some analysis of how Confucianism educates people to disbelieve their own experience and senses in favor of authoritative explanations-- but perhaps it is so obvious that the author chose to leave it out of the text.6. Another subtext in this book is: The role of intellectuals in awful destruction/ perfectly-preventable disasters. Every single one of these disasters started at a university somewhere. And people pressed for influence just for its own sake and not for the greater good (even if it was done in the guise of \\"The Greater Good\\"). Heather MacDonald wrote \\"The Burden of Bad Ideas\\" where she dealt with such stupid ideas just in New York (it was a good book--it's just amazing that there are enough idiots in New York to make a whole book out of their ideas)-- but Becker takes the cake. Lysenkoism. Crossing pigs with cows. Growing apples off of pear trees. Increasing crop yields by several orders of magnitude. Huh? And this all started off at universities. (I wonder what is Noam Chomsky's real motivation in saying the things he does after reading this book.)7. Becker disputes a lot of what Jung Chang later says in \\"Mao: The Unknown Story\\" while also confirming other things. I suspect the description of the KMT's falling from power because of their corruption is a bigger factor than Chang was willing to concede. But on the other hand, Becker's description of Mao as a \\"god-king\\" was exactly the same conclusion to which Jung Chang (a local Chinese) had reached-- as were the specifics of the stupidity of the Great Leap Forward.8. There were a lot of historical witnesses to this incident (Americans who worked at universities-- who else?) that insisted none of this ever happened. (Anna Louise Strong. Edgar Snow.) I know that you can't trust the accuracy of historical witnesses-- but now I *REALLY* know it.9. Good historical lessons can be gleaned from the plight of the Tibetans (who lost the ability to defend themselves and have suffered quite a bit at the hands of the Chinese as a result). It seems that they were warrior like, and then the state and temple/ pagoda/ stupa got into bed with each other and it was all downhill from there. So *that's* the historical lesson to be drawn from the separation of church and state! Oh! So *that's* this historical reason for the military as a deterrent. Oh! So *that's* the reason that there is so much enmity toward the Chinese (on the Tibetan side).You will not regret purchasing this book. It's worth buying even new!"},{"Title":"Hungry Ghosts: Mao's Secret Famine","review":"My husband like this book, so i bought it for him.

Over 30 million people died as widespread famine gripped all of China. It wasn't brought about natural disasters, as Mao lied and told the rest of the world, but his insane quest to out pace Stalin and turn all of China's agriculture and industry into a collectivist miracle. Instead production dramatically decreased and especially in the rural areas the Chinese people starved. For several years, Mao denied that it was even happening and raved about the vast increases in agricultural production when it was shrinking and to show of China's success sold much of what little grain was there to foreign countries. A fair amount of grain also rotted in storage while people starved. Because the peasants were often to weak from hunger to harvest it, some of it also rotted in the fields. You will need a strong stomach to get through the chapter on cannibalism. Read it and weep. Also, if you live in a country such as the United States, realize how blessed you are."},{"Title":"Hungry Ghosts: Mao's Secret Famine","review":"What Hitler did retail, Stalin did wholesale.

It covers every section of China as it was effected by The Great Leap Forward and the horrific famine that resulted in all of China. It also covers the Russian famine that preceded the China famine but was not heeded as a lesson by Chairman Mao. It is also a study on communism and totalitarism and how it can go so wrong if policies are not allowed to be questioned even by the top officials. I would recommend this book to everyone.

Whether the specific numbers are accurate or whether Mao can be held personally responsible for the millions of starvation deaths is something that will be debated for years. However, books written about or by Ch'an monks who lived during that era support much of what Becker asserts (see George Crane's &quot;Bones of the Master&quot; as an example). After reading this, now I know my mother wasn't kidding me when she used to chide me for not eating my vegetables when she said &quot;Don't you know there are starving people in China?&quot;&quot;Hungry Ghosts&quot; also provides insight into present day Communist Party behavior, particularly in the provinces. The recent AIDS epidemic in China is a good example. How is it local officials can round up thousands of villagers to collect their blood, using the same unsterilized needle on hundreds of people, without having any concern for the potential of blood-borne pathogens, let alone HIV? And then mix all that blood together, spin off the plasma, then reinject the mixed blood back into the villagers! That is what is happening now in China, the birth of an AIDS epidemic that may put the one in Africa to shame.Read &quot;Hungry Ghosts&quot; and you will see the same bureaucratic malfeasance at work today trying to deny an entire new generation of orphans being created -- not by famine as during the Great Leap Forward, but by an institutionalized silence over government initiated mass HIV infection.Sadly, some things never change. China is making great strides economically, but the government is dragging its feet with meaningful reform."},{"Title":"Hungry Ghosts: Mao's Secret Famine","review":"Hungry Ghosts, as simply as can be put, makes one realize how much we take for granted. Although the book slumps into dullness here and there, overall it holds the reader's interest, and does a beautiful job of taking the reader into a starving Chinese village, and creating a famine-stricken world that scars the conscience and turns the pages. Though Becker's comment can seem invariably one-sided, it is still a remarkable expose' of the famine and its causes, both direct and indirect. If the reader is able to ignore Becker's bias and find the deeper (non-political) messages, then this book is certainly a valuable one."},{"Title":"Hungry Ghosts: Mao's Secret Famine","review":"Becker, Jasper. 1998. _Hungry Ghosts: Mao's Secret Famine_. New York: Henry Holt. xiii+380 pp. Appendix, index, notes, photos, postscript, references. ISBN 0-8050-5668-8.Hong Kong-based journalist Becker documents calamitous starvation visited on China during the Great Leap Forward, 1958 - 1960. Becker's thesis is that Chinese Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong's ultra-left communization and industrialization policies, which he pursued with blind zeal, were the root causes of thecalamity; Becker estimates more than thirty million Chinese starved to death. This well-researched book is based on interviews inside and outside China and on documentary sources. Becker focuses on the anatomy of mass starvation, nonsensical agricultural theories and their effects on production, foolish \\"backyard\\" industrialization policies, unrelenting Communist Party factional politics, transparently venal political self-interest and Mao's emerging personality cult.Part one details the history of Chinese famines, Communist collectivization policies, pseudo-scientific agricultural theories and Mao's response to the calamity. The second part is a tour of the famine among peasants in the provinces, prisoners in labor camps, and citizens in cities. A Tibetan Buddhist leader's attempt to save his people, starvation's physiological effects and the facts of cannibalism each receive separate chapters. The third part examines political battles and policy changes that ended the Great Leap Forward and lifted the famine. Becker argues for Mao's personal responsibility, devotes a chapter to the death toll and discusses Western knowledge of and responses to the Chinese situation. A valuable postscript about ongoing starvation in communist North Korea ends the book.Becker lays the disaster at Mao's feet for his \\"...fundamental ignorance of modern science.\\" (p. 99) and his willful refusal to believe the Great Leap Forward was leading not to utopian communism but to catastrophic national misery. Mao did not implement his policies without competition from other Party leaders. In 1959 at a Central Committee summer summit at Lushan, central China, Mao defeated powerful critics opposed to Great Leap Forward policies. Opponents were purged at the center and in the provinces; personal political loyalty trumped available evidence. As national starvation became more desperate, government exploitation turned more savage: \\"To force the peasants to hand over their last remaining reserves, the officials did not simply beat the peasants but created a nightmare of organized torture and murder.\\" (p. 115). By spring 1961, news and investigations proved the extent of the suffering; Party leaders Liu Shaoqi, Deng Xiaoping and Zhou Enlai succeeded in forcing a retreat from radical Great Leap policies. In keeping with practices intermingling policy and personal disputes, much of the anti-Great Leap movement took the form of factional attacks on Mao as supreme leader and policy maker.Many Chinese venerate the souls of their ancestors through ritual sacrifices; these acts keep the ancestors safe as members of their descendants' families. But souls no one nurtures are hungry ghosts. They are ill-fed, disoriented, kinless wanderers; they are troubled and may be troublesome. The metaphorical point of the book's title is that the souls of the millions who died exist outside the pale of human society. According to Becker, they do so because Mao Zedong caused their deaths. Although Becker does a credible job unearthing, displaying and discussing the evidence, his thesis that Mao is personally responsible for thirty million dead ignores the very complex etiology of the disaster. It is more reasonable to think the center designed and directed the disastrous policies but they were willingly carried out, until it was too late, by multitudes of cadre and citizens who must share the blame with Chairman Mao."},{"Title":"Hungry Ghosts: Mao's Secret Famine","review":"This book tells the fascinating and horrifying story of a Chinese famine due to the Communists.

So to show the USSR it meant business, China exported more grain to the Soviet Union than it could afford to give up. Peasants slaved in the fields to work miracles, and as a result grew so weak that the grain died, as did tens of millions of people.The striking images in this book included how the peasants ate food 'substitutes', plus tree bark, feces, and worms. And then many turned to cannibalism. If this isn't shocking enough, the author writes how no one China talks about the Great Leap Forward (as opposed to the Cultural Revolution) and how for the first twenty years after it happened, no one (in China and outside) was really sure it had even happened.I've been studying China for a good 27 years, but after reading this book, I've realized the more I read about China, the less I really know about it.My only complaints about the book are that parts often repeated themselves and that it was structured in such a way that led to these repetitions. I think a better editing job could have resulted in a narrative that flowed better. Also, he seemed to rely more on memoirs than on his research when he quoted sources in the text. I certainly have nothing against memoirs, but somehow there's nothing as convincing as first hand accounts writers obtain through their own interviews."},{"Title":"Hungry Ghosts: Mao's Secret Famine","review":"This item is as described by the seller.

When I first came to Taiwan, a few days after Lin Biao died and a few weeks before Nixon visited Mao, the government here frequently published this photo as evidence of how wrong things had gone in the PRC. Pooh, I thought, things can't possibly be as bad as they said. For proof I looked to the glowing reports published by the first American reporters to visit: one even brought along her father, who had been a missionary, and could speak some Chinese.Years after Mao died, when the PRC started opening up, it became evident that the KMT had vastly understated its case, perhaps to avoid panic here. Hungry Ghosts documents a tragedy that the world hardly noted.I would be the last to claim expertise on PRC government affairs, but one reason I believe Hungry Ghosts is credible is that detail after detail meshes with bits and pieces I had picked up over the years, unaware of the extent of the disaster.Example: Becker mentions the dams peasants had to build. In the early 1980s, Mr Wei, from a family of tea farmers in Fujian, told me why his relatives starved:&quot;We were told that tea is decadent and capitalistic. We were ordered to tear out all the tea trees and plant grain. Our family has farmed those hills for generation after generation. We know the soil, we know the climate, and we know that grain cannot grow there. We were ordered to build a dam. We didn't know how, so we asked the cadres. They said,'Ask an old farmer.' We had no choice, so a couple old farmers got together and planned a dam, even though they had never seen one, either. We toiled and toiled. Since we were producing no crops, we had little to eat. Finally, our dam was finished. As soon as we let the water flow, it washed away the dam. We asked the cadres what to do. They said, 'Grow tea.' But we couldn't harvest tea for several years. For three years, we had nothing to eat. Many of my relatives starved.&quot; Anybody who reads Hungry Ghosts will recognize the elements in this story. For me, practically the whole book reads like this, corroborating things I had seen and heard over the years.Mr Becker speaks with authority on modern China, but his ancient history is weak. The first chapter opens with &quot;an inscription on a Shang tomb.&quot; I have never heard of an inscription on a Shang tomb. In, yes; on, no. If the inscription is translated correctly, it is hardly typical of early Chinese thought (unless the 'Emperor' refers to the god Di). Becker makes some outlandish comments about Confucianism. Okay, big deal, his book is about modern, not ancient China. His explanation that the Cultural Revolution was a response dealing with the GLF makes sense of an otherwise senseless convulsion.Dear reader, this is a heart-breaking book. May you and I never suffer as those poor people suffered. May such times never come again."},{"Title":"Hungry Ghosts: Mao's Secret Famine","review":"I found this book well-written, well-organized, and moving. It's interesting to see how many Chinese readers consider it ethnocentric and anti-Chinese. I didn't take it that way at all -- Mao's sort of madness is all-too-universal in human history, and the story left me with a sense of great admiration for the Chinese people who somehow suffered through this period. Becker is also very careful to point out that the real roots of the disaster were not in China but in Mao's enthusiasm for actions of Stalin and the writings of Marx.And if the portions on Mao sometimes read like a bio of Idi Amin, well, I'd consider that appropriate. He was a murderous, vainglorious sociopath. The fact that he was right about the terrible crimes of the Western powers against China neither changes nor justifies a thing.Anyway, a very nicely written and fascinating account that left me wanting to learn more about both ancient and modern Chinese history."},{"Title":"Hungry Ghosts: Mao's Secret Famine","review":"-----------------------------------------------------------A horrifying and well-researched history of how Mao's \\"GreatLeap Forward\\" became the worst famine in history, killingperhaps 30 million Chinese (1958 - 1960) -- it appearsunlikely an exact fatality figure will ever be known.

Here is a compelling treatment of a chapter in China's history that is almost a black comedy. Mao's Great Leap Forward is predicated upon such preposterous silliness that we chuckle at its absurdities (eg, the crops will improve with &quot;deep planting&quot; at up to 12 feet; steel can be made by all in back yard smelters, etc...). Yet...the consequences are so awful, that any thought of smiles is quickly erased.Historians differ, but here was want and famine on a scale unprecedented in the 20th century. Perhaps as many as 30,000,000 died. Another reviewer scoffs at this number and says that it was &quot;only&quot; 10,000,000. Whatever the number, this is still an unthinkable tragedy, and one that happened in our lifetime. Like the Taiping Revolution that claimed as many as 22,000,000 lives (read &quot;God's Chinese Son&quot;), it left an indelible, but largely unknown mark on China - one that shapes the country today as it emerges as the only &quot;other&quot; super power.Well written and fascinating."},{"Title":"Hungry Ghosts: Mao's Secret Famine","review":"I have taught finance at universities in both Hong Kong and the US, and I regularly recommend this book to my MBA and undergraduate students as a graphic illustration of the risks and weaknesses of a planned economy, particularly when combined with control of the media. Perhaps Becker puts too much emphasis on the responsibility of Mao and not enough on his many followers. But the fact remains that this massive famine could not have occurred in a market economy and would not occurred if so much power had not been concentrated in the hands of one person. Mao was brilliant when it came to maintaining political power but painfully inadequate in his understanding of science. In power politics, reality is whatever you can convince people to believe. Mao refused to accept the fact that science and economics do not ulitimately follow this same rule (or perhaps he didn't care). No matter how many people claim to believe in a bountiful harvest, they will still starve to death if they have nothing to eat. To further understand the Chinese Communist Party under Mao, I recommend the book written by Mao's personal physician. As for Becker's account of the worst famine in history (and the postscript to the later edition, pointing out that it's happening again today in North Korea), the book is informative and fascinating. It offers a lesson for those, particularly in Asia, that don't believe that economic decisions should be left to the market. A government directing industrial policy is unlikely to produce the extreme consequences seen here. Nevertheless, the dangers of lack of diversification due to one set of possibly misguided or simply mistaken leaders forcing everyone in the same direction are the same. Too much attention is given to the relatively rare cases, such as Japan or Singapore, where it worked, at least temporarily. This is the most extreme of the many, many examples that show how painful failure can be when the same policy is forced on everyone."},{"Title":"Hungry Ghosts: Mao's Secret Famine","review":"This book isn't especially well written from a literary perspective. In the reviews below you will find one or two criticisms such as an incomplete understanding of ancient Chinese history, which may well be valid. Unfortunately some people have obviously got hung up on the \\"30 million\\" deaths claim, but Becker does little to independently research the size of the death toll. He just summarises the various research that has been carried out, with what looks to me like a fair-minded commentary of the problems of estimating an accurate number.However this is not the point of the book, which is firstly to gather together evidence that this famine did happen and secondly to piece together the complex strands explaining why it happened.Ultimate blame is placed at the foot of Mao who firstly was the architect of the radical and in some cases barmy social and agricultural reforms which initiated the famine and secondly put in place a regime of terror which led most non-heroic subordinates to feedback the information they thought he wanted to hear regardless of the reality on the ground. Most of those who dared to tell the truth, ultimately paid with their life, either immediately or a few years later in the Cultural Revolution, which itself is seen by Becker as the way Mao sought to regain control of the party from the more moderate voices who had eventually managed to put in place the reforms to Mao's policies which ended the famine.To his credit, Becker spends some time discussing the previous famines and periods of war and unrest which provide a backdrop to the situation. He also recognises, though does not emphasis some of Mao's achievements. His overall thesis is I think not, as some seem to suggest, that Mao deliberately and consciously murdered his own people in the way that Stalin did. It's more that Mao though he might have been a master political and military tactician had little understanding of human nature or science and was so drunk on his own propaganda that he refused to see how he could have been mistaken. Becker leaves open the morally important question of the extent to which Mao had deluded himself about the suffering of his people, and the extent to which he believed that such suffering was of little consequence in the greater scheme of things.Becker also correctly lays considerable blame at the doors of those western commentators, China watchers and academics who were duped by Mao's propaganda - way up until the early 1990s, thus paving the way for a series of disasters around the world as various third world governments from Cambodia to Tanzania tried to emulate the apparent achievements of Mao's China with disastrous policies of their own.I believe that Becker puts forward a fair minded and highly plausible analysis of what happened during this period, and given its importance not only from a moral perspective but in understanding the history of China and the world during the subsequent 50 years, it's a book that as many people as possible should be encouraged to carefully and open mindedly read."},{"Title":"Hungry Ghosts: Mao's Secret Famine","review":"In this book Jasper Becker has done an impressive and exhaustive job on digging up information and interviews, out of a society that has pulled out all the stops to repress all knowledge of China's enormous famine of the early 60's. Chairman Mao, who has been idolized and emulated by many third world countries and disdvantaged peoples as a visionary, is instead revealed in this book as a stubborn, cruel, and apathetic dictator. Mao's so-called &quot;Great Leap Forward&quot; quickly became a failure in its efforts to forcibly collectivize agriculture and increase production. Mao refused to believe that his great plan was causing the starvation of huge numbers of peasants, and suppressed and threatened anyone who tried to reveal the truth. The fact that communist officials down to the local level had been threatened to keep their mouths shut, and that Mao refused to admit failure, proves that these dictators would rather watch tens of millions of people die than admit that their bold plan was a dismal failure. So instead of looking like a laughing stock on the world stage, they allowed these people to die and then used an iron fist to cover up all information about the famine. Ironically, this is from a regime supposedly dedicated to the &quot;people&quot; and it was an eerie repeat of a similar famine inflicted on the Ukraine by Stalin 30 years earlier.Becker has done a good job of unearthing this long-suppressed information, and adequately debunks past writers and politicians who were misled and duped by the communist propaganda machine. While Becker's statistical approach makes this book repetitive in places (especially the section giving the famine's development and death tolls from various Chinese provinces), overall the book is an impressive piece of scholarship. Also, the new postscript about the recent famine in North Korea, which has resulted from almost the same political failures, offers disturbing proof that those who don't know history are doomed to repeat it."},{"Title":"Hungry Ghosts: Mao's Secret Famine","review":"The subject of the book is the great famine caused by Mao's misguided economic policies in China in the late 1950s and early 1960s.The facts as related by Becker are not exactly new, but shocking. In a phase of hubris, the 'great leader', the 'helmsman', wanted China to make the 'great leap forward'. Since he was many things, like eg a brilliant survivor of political infights, maybe a talented guerilla leader, certainly a winner of a civil war and thus by definition a 'liberator', he was not really a leader of a government in peace times. He actually knew next to nothing about economics or even basic administration. Had he faded wisely out of the political front line to something like an elder statesman position, his status as the liberator of his country from lots of evils would be easier to defend. He would still be controversial, but he would not be a front runner in the race for the title of most vicious mass murderer of the 20th century.The 'great leap', generally in upper case like some heroic event, produced one of history's worst famines with huge numbers of victims. China had its share of famines before. The tragedy of this one was that it was largely man-made, unnecessary, avoidable, and that it would still have been possible to contain it on a more moderate level when it had started. What kept its momentum going and produced these huge fatality numbers was a combination of political incompetence and cowardice. The system, i.e. the party machinery, did not tolerate the truth. The planning process led to exaggerated production figures, which were not corrected when the disaster started to become obvious on a lower level of the hierarchy. Provincial and lower leaders reported harvest and grain storage numbers in line with the plans, and the total added up to an enormous misunderstanding of the real world. The coterie of sycophants did their best to hide the reality from the great helmsman, who continued to live in his dream world of greatness and saw critical questions as counterrevolutionary crimes against his own exaltedness. Even long time friends were discarded if they dared to raise a finger.If this were not such a sad story, it would be laughable. The man really seems to have believed that he can order grain yields to rise at will. Brecht or similar masters of sarcasm could have invented it and written a political parable about government stupidity and the ambition of the lower class leaders to be good boys and make a career.Interesting that apparently there are still people who deny the magnitude of the disaster. Interesting also that the subt-title of the book has been changed. I have an older edition, dated 1997. It was called 'China's secret famine', which strikes me as accurate enough. The book on this amazon page is called 'Mao's secret famine'. Not sure that is an improvement.After all, he caused it, but he never went hungry himself. Probably never even believed that he did anything wrong."},{"Title":"Hungry Ghosts: Mao's Secret Famine","review":"I find this book a most fascinating one . . . and a \\"required\\" reading for those interested not just in China's history but modern genocide, mass media control by state press, Communist theory development, among many other topics.

The next one who write a similar book will write it was 48 million. We don't need this type of book, I would prefer history books which describes the reasons for things happen as it did. To explain the reason why Mao so easily come to power. My wife is from China and her grandfather worked for a landlord, the workers had to sleep in the stable with the animals. There was no value for normal people, if we understand the situation people was under during this year we will understand their action better.

George P. Joyce is simply a legend in technical report writing. He doesn't concede to the form of his medium and write lifeless mechanical descriptions of alternatives to chemical aircraft paint stripping, but baptises the lives of the chemical aircraft painter strippers in the hot quicksilver of his magnificent prose, reifying these \\"paint strippers\\", restoring their humanity. Joyce is an alchemist, taking the leaden medium of technical report writing, and transmuting it with his warm spirit, pouring his pen over the obscured voices of the chemical aircraft paint strippers like a mellifluous caramel gold; redeeming them in a universal chorus of aircraft paint strippers, their individual spirits vibrating like strings in a cosmic harp.The men and women who perform the Plastic Media Blasting or the Modified Medium Pressure Water are not just pale vapours forever condemned to history as nameless peon ghouls. No. Their lives are celebrations and their performances are a pure ablution upon the incurable leperous spawn of insdustrialism - the C-l30 aircraft (by the PMB process at the Lockheed Aircraft Service Center in Ontario, CA, and the MPW process by Warner- Robins AFB, GA.) Moreoever, Joyce's invocations of both these locales are startingly rich despite the brevity of language. His impressionistic craftsmanship is on full display here.

Garrison was an investigative journalist that sorted out confusing mysteries in an easy to understand manner. Although this book is out of print, it is still sought after because it explains many aspects of the mystery of Howard Hughes.The author writes about Hughes' secret career as a portrait photographer and playboy in disguise; the tragic accident in which he killed a stranger in a sudden and fateful encounter beyond his control; his absentee marriage to former film star Jean Peters; and his running battle with the Atomic Energy Commission in an all-out effort to halt the underground testing of nuclear bombs in Nevada."},{"Title":"Howard Hughes in Las Vegas,","review":"This book written nearly 40 years ago deals in detail with many of the business deals Howard Hughes conducted during the late 60s in Las Vegas. The author does an excellent job of detailing the intricate details of the time such as the often ignored fact that the Vegas economy at the time of Hughes arrival had hit rock bottom. Most accounts of his Vegas takeover attempt to portray him as a victim of some grand scheme concocted by organized crime figures without looking at Hughes power and influence within the highest levels of government \\"both nationally and locally.\\" His ability to circumvent the normal procedures when it came to the Nevada Gaming Commission is unprecedented as well as his ability to influence other powerbrokers to see things his way.

If you can find a copy, it is well worth the cost."},{"Title":"Beyond the Impasse: The Promise of a Process Hermeneutic (Studies in American Biblical Hermeneutics)","review":"In Beyond the Impasse: The Promise of a Process Hermeneutic, Ronald L. Farmer attempts to present a comprehensive introduction to a process hermeneutic to those unacquainted with the process hermeneutical option. To accomplish this task, the book is divided into three segments. The first segment includes a rather lengthy chapter in which Farmer documents his personal quest to find a satisfying biblical hermeneutic. In recounting this adventure, he catalogs the assets and liabilities of various hermeneutical options including the historical-critical method, classical Liberalism's progressive revelation, the biblical theology movement, existentialist interpretation (Bultmann), the &quot;new&quot; hermeneutic (Bultmann's students and the later Heidegger), literary criticism/reader-response criticism, and deconstruction. After years of exploring and experimenting with these hermeneutical options, Farmer's personal &quot;quest for a satisfying hermeneutic brought [him] to an impasse&quot; (45). Almost every approach offered something of value, but none could be embraced completely; &quot;consequently,&quot; he confesses, &quot;I found myself engaged in \`tool box raiding'&quot;(46). The examination of various options led Farmer to recognize that every hermeneutical system he had studied assumed a worldview - even those systems designed to deny the possibility of a world view. This led him to ask *which* worldview was the most adequate to undergird a hermeneutic because, as he argues, &quot;it is far wiser to make one's worldview explicit and thereby open to criticism and improvement than to deceive oneself with antimetaphysical rhetoric&quot; (45). Farmer eventually concluded that the provisional metaphysics of the process world view, most clearly laid out by Alfred North Whitehead, is the most adequate for the hermeneutical enterprise. The second, and most extensive, segment of the book is devoted to developing the implications the process world view has for hermeneutics. After hammering out the nature of language, text, and interpretation in this process hermeneutic, Farmer spends a chapter assessing what contribution a process hermeneutic makes to the field of hermeneutical studies. I list several here. (1) The process hermeneutic grounds the concept of &quot;open-ended&quot; meaning in the general nature of reality, thus accounting for why the meaning of a text will change, to some degree, as it is experienced by different readers in different contexts. (2) The process hermeneutic helps by objecting to the hard distinctions between religious and everyday language; the varieties of language are not essentially different because all language is relatively (in)determinate, subjective, and value-laden. (3) The process hermeneutic is more adequate because a process hermeneutic primarily regards texts as lures for feeling; therefore, the process interpreter need not be limited, as many modern approaches are, to commending a narrow portion of the biblical text for positive analysis. (4) Rather than being confined to interpretation of the essence of a text, a process hermeneutic affirms a trajectory approach by insisting that meanings undergo transformation in history. (5) Because a process hermeneutic is undergirded by a metaphysics available for public discussion, &quot;a process interpreter can affirm that biblical studies can and should have a public character as well as address the needs of faith communities&quot; (130). (6) Because the process hermeneutic emphasizes God's necessary role in the initial states of all events, the notion that God has inspired authors and communities can be given an adequate basis: &quot;God is involved in both the writing and interpretation of a text,&quot; explains Farmer (132). To illustrate the power of his process hermeneutic, Farmer addresses the Apocalypse of John in the book's third segment. Many contemporary interpreters regard the Apocalypse as having little theological or ethical value because of the extreme difficulties the book has for interpretation. Farmer, however, suggests that paradoxes found therein may be transformed when the component lures of each idea, taken together, offer a novel contrast. He addresses the paradox of limited and universal salvation found in John's writing, for instance, and concludes with the novel interpretation that &quot;God's justice involves both judgment and redemptive transformation&quot; (193). Farmer's work is simply outstanding! The chronicling of his appropriation and dissatisfaction of various contemporary hermeneutical options is engaging as Farmer draws the reader into his personal adventure. The middle segment, dealing with process metaphysics and hermeneutics, brings together smartly a wide variety of issues pertinent to the interpretative task. Perhaps the book's only drawback is its status as an &quot;introductory&quot; book. It is introductory for graduate students perhaps, but, even with the extended appendix offering an overview of Whitehead's cosmology, it is highly doubtful that those without a strong graduate education will keep their head above the technicalities of the book's hermeneutically and philosophically enriched waters. Its greatest contribution may be to those who, like Farmer, have come to an impasse afer traveling widely on the eclectic hermeneutical terrain. For these adventurers, the process hermeneutic will likely hold profuse promise."},{"Title":"In Search of an American Catholicism: A History of Religion and Culture in Tension","review":"Jay Dolan's history of the church in America makes one overwhelming point--that the crisis in the church today is part of a long struggle lasting over 200 years by the American church to define itself as part of and in opposition to both Rome and America at the same time. Dolan examines the collision between the traditional, European, immigrant, authoritarian church and the modern, American, democratic society in which it found itself from several perspectives. The issue of local control of churches has been a long-standing one, and indeed the early church in the US experimented with lay trusteeship of parishes. Immigrants coming to the US with a thirst for freedom also struggled to retain local control over the parishes they built and supported. Sometimes these arguments erupted among immigrant groups, sometimes with Rome.Devotional practices for Catholics were also very different from those of their Protestant neighbors, used to more austere practices, who were likely to regard Catholics as superstitious and of the Old World. For a long time, a debate raged over whether one could be both Catholic and American; much anti-Catholic sentiment arose from Catholics' efforts to distinguish themselves from their neighbors. These slowly changed in the 20th century of course in response to Vatican II, but also as Americans moved away from Old World traditions. The emergence of women as important players in American society, at the same time as women argued for equality in England, also put pressures on the church still being felt to this day to an extent much greater than some more traditional Catholic countries.Perhaps the greatest argument is a philosophical one--is the church part of or apart from society; should the church embrace or reject modernity; should the church respond to the times or remain unchanged for all time? These arguments went on at the very beginnings of the US 200 years ago and are still being argued today as the church fights off the biggest crisis in its history in this country. Perhaps these issues are more intense in a country that considers itself among the most democratic, the most open, the most modern in the world.Dolan's work is a bit slow-going at times, and maybe a little too scholarly for the casual reader. But the points are valid, and caution against expecting an easy, prompt resolution of the current crisis. As ties to Western Europe weaken, and fewer and fewer Americans identify themselves as having two nationalities, obedience to a foreign, Roman hierarchy, which seems not to understand American culture and society, feels more and more alien. How it will be resolved remains to be seen."},{"Title":"Golden 45's","review":"I WAS ON THE EDGE OF MY SEAT , I COULDNT SET THE BOOK DOWN, FOUND MYSELF WANTING TO REACH FOR IT FIRST THING IN THE MOURNING WHEN I WOKE UP!HOW CAN I MEET THIS BEAUTFUL MAN ON THE BACK OF THE BOOK WHO IS THE HERO ???I THINK THIS STORY WOULD BE AN AMAZING MOVIE!ESPECIALY IF MARC LLOYD PLAYS THE PART ..."},{"Title":"Golden 45's","review":"Marc Lloyd, star recruit of an elite military force, fights terrorists with savvy and psychic powers in a novel packed with intriguing strategies, romance, and suspense.

It's almost as if the author spent an afternoon at her craft store, pulling down the handouts and shilling inexpensive products that will break after one use.The most intriguing product, a pendant, turned out to be a waste when I discovered that the author glued the metal embellishments onto the heavier wire frame. (glued? How \\"popsicle stick day camp project\\" is that?) Anyone with even a passing acquaintance with jewelry making has far too much skill and experience for the ugly projects in the book.And the attractive bracelet on the cover? It's as misleading as the rest: the bracelet's not silver and gold, as you might think, it's coated copper and non-tarnishing brass. (and would really look horrible if placed side by side with the real thing) Rather like like the rest of the book - you think it's the real thing, then discover it's a shoddy imposter and wouldn't fool anyone. The book is printed in Malaysia, most likely to save on printing costs. That's a good idea - I can't imagine they'll sell a lot of these, considering how many will be returned when any experienced craftsperson opens the cover.What a shame.

With that in mind, I have the following criticisms of Ms. Peterson's book:1) Many of the projects use a much finer gauge wire than I would use personally, and beefing up the wire changes how much you will need for any given project.2)You don't need the handy \\"magic coiler\\" device that she talks about but she doesn't really give photos of how to use an alternative. (Not that it's tough to figure out, mind you, but there are photos of everything else in this book...)3)Glue. She uses honest to god GLUE for securing some details on one of her projects. Glue is a total no-no for jewelry making, and should be used as either a last resort or as a way to doubly secure something, like a dot of glue on a knot in a silk cord.4)One of her projects uses brass screen to make wire wrapped earrings. They're cute, but there is no reference within the project itself to filing the sharp edges of a screen once cut. And you're going to wear these next to your neck and hair?

The photos are all from the brothers' road trips across the U.S., but the stories of these trips aren't really here. Instead, the brothers pair each photos with a quote, in the classic Sierra Club style. Many of the quotes are from famous works, many are from the brothers themselves. Some don't make sense at all, such as a quote from a deer that's somehow multiple millennia old. Hmmm.The book does have a GREAT photo of a girl looking sadly at a rising Lake Powell/flooding Glen Canyon, and a good section on Glen Canyon in general. However, I wish the book had more on the brothers' actual story, as the photos of them look intriguing, and the book's afterward mentions that one of the brothers died shortly before the book's initial publication.I recommend this for Glen Canyon scholars, those interested in the Sierra Club and this century's environmenal movement and grainy sixties imagery, but I don't see how it's the life changing book that some people say it is. It didn't strike me that way."},{"Title":"On the Loose","review":"How ironic it is to see that this book is about to be published once again. I was first given a copy in 1969, my freshman year of college, and it was the first publication I'd ever held in my hands that spoke of wilderness as something that could enlarge and enlighten the inner life of a human being. What interested me most was the fact that the Russell boys were the only people I've yet encountered to go into Glen Canyon before it was flooded to document at least some of all that was about to be lost. Given the unsuitability of the geology of the area, and the Native American sites that present day laws would have protected, it's highly instructive to have this book to illustrate what was drowned before most Americans even knew it existed. I'd certainly never heard of Glen Canyon before I picked up &quot;On the Loose.&quot;The merits of the Glen Canyon dam were shakey even in the sixties, but the momentum for building big dam projects could not be entirely overcome by the cautionary minority of long-term thinkers. In the end, Glen Canyon was sacrificed partly so that the Grand Canyon might escape the two dams proposed for it. In the decades since, the creation of a 180+ mile reservoir where once a mostly unexplored canyon complex once stood has proven of far less value than it's more famous cousins Hoover and Coulee, and fallen far short of it's promoters' promises. And now patient Nature, always the eventual winner, is taking her canyons back via drought, evaporation, leakage into the porous sandstones, and every dam's nemesis, siltation. Add in the fact that there is a growing movement to take the dam itself down and let the canyonlands heal as best they can, and you've got powerful incentive to revisit the Russells' little book, to see what once was and may once be again.I hope the surviving Russell brothers have had good lives. Their beautiful book certainly struck a chord in me and a lot of people I know."},{"Title":"On the Loose","review":"This book changed my life. I was given a copy while in high school in the mountains of colorado. I was, and continue to be, inpired by this book.

Obviously, many thanks to him for broadening my world and pushing my limits. Likewise, this thin book does the same. On the Loose is one of the books I keep handy for reading when things get too dark and I need to get out of the city limits. It's a positive idea - two young men, running wild through the west, productive in the sense that they are becoming conscious of Nature, themselves, and the encroachment if 'civilization' on that fragile world, and remains an inspiration to me to hold on to my own wild places I have found. The combination of grainy photos and wonderful quotes, as well as the poetic prose, inspire and center. I have purchased copies for friends, when it was still in print, and jealously guard my copy, although I am pleased to hear that the book will once again become available, as well as a follow-up.

I wanted to share the insights and the beauty of this book as a way of sharing my love of all places wild. Something made me look to see if copies were still available and was thrilled when I saw that it was back in print for a new generation to experience. Even though Glen Canyon is \\"gone\\", and many of the places these boys experienced are covered (or nearly covered) with masses of humanity, there is still the spirit of this book that lives on in the places that are left. I first read this book in high school and it definitely had a huge impact on my life. I read it, and reread it so many times that it became a part of who I am. One of my favorite quotes in the book was by Steve McQueen; \\"I'd rather wake up in the middle of nowhere than in any city on earth\\". That pretty much describes me to this day! If you have any love at all for wild places, read this book. It's beautiful, and it will reach places inside of you that have been dormant, just waiting for the right catalyst to bring them alive."},{"Title":"On the Loose","review":"In 1969, to celebrate our recent graduation from high school, my best friend and I took a backpacking trip in the wilderness area of northern Yosemite National Park. I was a seasoned backpacker by then, at 18, and he was a neophyte. Our first night as we lay under the magnificent canopy of the Milky Way, I explained to him how the sweat, grit, and toil of the trail recharged me. The panoramic vistas, the roll of thunder in the canyons, the flora and fauna, the clean air and quiet - all unavailable to the motorized tourist - were only some of the rewards for the labor. Blisters from our low-tech footwear, cold knees from the ice-water stream crossings, partially cooked food from wet-wood campfires at high altitude, hard cold leather boots after a chilly night - they were all worth it for the experience of wilderness. Later that year, my friend presented me with my copy of On the Loose. I found within its pages an affinity for my wilderness experiences that were hard to communicate to my peers.On the Loose is a unique book. Over the last four decades, I have returned to it many times, and I can say that it ages very well. Within its covers the wilderness experience is portrayed with all of the grit and discomfort - along with the pastel beauty of the photographs. These elements of the wilderness are timeless, so while the book contains a picture chronicle of two brothers and their travels in the 1960s, its essence is the never-changing spirit of the wilderness experience. At the same time it is a memorial to the wondrous wilderness that has been lost to \\"progress.\\" From these pages, the reader can get a sense of the wilderness - how small and inconsequential man is, yet, at the same time, the capacity of man to destroy.Forty years later, I remain a passionate wilderness hiker. I still consider that the Russell brothers were, and are, my kindred spirits. On the Loose is inspirational, yes, life-changing perhaps, to some - but still a classic portrayal of the wilderness experience. I wholeheartedly recommend this book to any dedicated wilderness backpacker, hiker, rafter, whatever, as well as to those who wish they could."},{"Title":"On the Loose","review":"On The Loose is certainly one of the most beautiful and inspiring Books ever written.

I remember vividly sitting under a canopy of ponderosa pines being awestruck by the beauty and emotion of the words written by the Russell brothers. From then on, it remained my favorite book, to which I would turn repeatedly for comfort and wisdom as I found myself (unhappily) living in large urban areas. &quot;City life is the scary life, inane, insane, tiny and alone.&quot;The book made me cry at 16, and its still does at 45. &quot;Take the road to the roadless area, because it won't be roadless long. Too much demand.&quot; Terry &amp; Renny Russell were right. They saw it coming. It breaks my heart to witness the metastasizing of urban sprawl throughout the United States, and the subsequent displacement of our precious wildlife and their natural habitats.

Eric, a bisexual man, Michelle a very \\"promiscious girl\\" and Tracy the uppity rich girl, are all tied together in a plot that also includes Tracy's boyfriend Brandon. There are a lot of twists and turns, and never a dull moment. Sex, sex, sex, lies, murder, backstabbing and more steamy sex make for a very catchy storyline. The only problem was no one practiced safe sex in this novel, I think the author should have put in that they were using condoms, a condom is not mentoned in this story,and that is just plain old nasty! It's a shame, but I know some people will just do it, and suffer later. Anyway, this is a must read!"},{"Title":"Scandalous","review":"SCANDALOUS is Torrian Ferguson's second novel and a drama filled book it is. This book contains raw and uncut sex, friendship, love, lies, murder, and deadly secrets and it all takes place on Bell University campus in Greenville, North Carolina. Tracy, Michelle, and Eric are three total opposite people that on their senior year become roommates.Tracy is a rich uppity girl from miami running from a dark secret that has been threatening to be exposed.Michelle is a ghetto sex fiend who has sex with just about anything with a penis. She was used by her mom growing up and it shaped her to be the hoodrat she is today.Eric is an bi-sexual who seems to be very open with his sexuality. He is Michelle's bestfriend and becomes Tracy's after a while but is he really a true friend.I think this book was for the most part was a wonderful read. I do however have a few problems with it. My actual rating for it is 3.5 due to the bad, bad errors in the book,the big promotion of unprotected sex and because I honestly could not connect with Eric's character. It seemed like with every person no one heard of a condomn in the book even the bi-sexuals. Although this is life and there are people that are out here that dont use condomns I feel that there are plenty that do. As far as Eric's character, in the beginning I got the picture that he was this flamboyant gay guy(even though he was bi-sexual) by the opening scene of the second chapter. Talking about he wears makeup, but he still getting all these women. How come none of them knew he was bi-sexual if he was so open? Also, if he was so open why did he have to act all macho around Thomas until Thomas came and asked him about him being gay? I feel like if he was a senior and school and the way him and Michelle were screwing around the school everyone should have known that he was part gay and if he wears makep i dont know of any woman wanting a man wearing makeup! The plot of the story and all the drama definitely had me page after page to the point of me not wanting to put the book down. I would still recommend this book to a reader just because the storyline was still excellent and the twist and turns in the book will have readers intrigued!4 star review by Mskiki425 of Real Divas of Literature"},{"Title":"Scandalous","review":"This book was an excellent read! I opened it to see if it would be good needless to say I didn't put it down. This book will have you hooked right out the gate. The sex scenes had me sweating. You will love this book."},{"Title":"Scandalous","review":"ScandalousBy Torrian FergusonThree college students share living space for the school year: Michelle a brash \`around the way girl' who likes to start trouble, Eric a bisexual male shunned by his family, and Tracy, a young lady who has skeletons she'd like to keep in the closet. Being roommates shouldn't be too bad...right? Especially since everyone has their own bedroom. But when you take into account that Tracy's boyfriend is fine as hell, Michelle will sleep with anyone who's willing, Eric is looking for the love of his life, and Tracy is having trouble keeping one man and getting rid of another, things can get quite scandalous.Sex, murder, lies and blame all make an appearance in this second erotic tale by Torrian Ferguson. The chapters are compact and the story has a good amount of suspense and drama. Editing issues throughout the book were an annoyance, although the characters are appealing. This was a quick and easy read but my \\"Ferguson Favorite\\" is still his debut \`Swingers'. Torrian crafts great plots and I look forward to his next release.EnglishrulerARC Book Club IncStar Rating 4 Stars"},{"Title":"Scandalous","review":"What harm could a little secret do? A secret can do more harm than good as three college roommates soon find out. Michelle, Eric, and Tracy are college seniors all living under one roof. Michelle is a plus-size beauty that's down for whatever and doesn't care who she steps on to get what or who she wants. Michelle will learn a life changing lesson when she crosses the wrong person. Eric is Michelle's bisexual best friend. Eric has always slept with various men and women but if anyone finds out about his latest secret conquest all hell will break loose. Tracy is the new roommate who immediately clashes with Michelle. Tracy is stalked and blackmailed by an ex-lover that she's been trying to get away from. All of these situations lead to murder. The question is who did it and why?Scandalous is another shocking page-turner by Torrian Ferguson. Scandalous is the perfect title for this novel because it accurately describes the events that take place in this book. I loved how none of the characters in this story were innocent. Everyone had a deep devastating secret that when revealed had horrific consequences. The perfect blend of sexy erotica, drama, and murder mystery will definitely keep the reader on the edge of their seats. Ferguson expertly intertwined the lives of these roommates without making the story confusing. I literally couldn't wait to see what happened next. Scandalous proves that Torrian Ferguson is not a one-book wonder!"},{"Title":"Scandalous","review":"Michelle loves men and makes no bones about it. Her more than healthy frame keeps her open to any and every man she deems attractive. Unfortunately, Michelle has to deal with stuck up Tracy who has the audacity to try to steal Eric's friendship from her. Payback is a mutha or at least that is what Michelle is hoping for. With a little snooping and scheming, Michelle vows to teach Tracy a lesson she will never forget.Eric \\"likes to pull up to the bumper with his big black limousine.\\" He listens to Tracy's problems by day and parties hard with Michelle by night. As Eric tries to be the voice of reason to both his roommates so they won't kill each other and keep his \\"lover\\" a secret for now, his tasks couldn't get any harder. When Eric still finds himself in a \\"messy\\" situation he has to choose between his friends and his lover.Tracy is use to the finer things in life and cannot stomach living with Michelle. Michelle's nasty and intrusive ways leaves Tracy wishing that she had the house to herself especially when her boyfriend Brandon comes to visit. Even though Tracy feels that Brandon would never stoop so low and mess around with a girl like Michelle, she still feels that maybe Brandon has kept his options open for someone else.Torrian once again effortlessly delivers another piece of erotic fiction. Even with a \\"who done it\\" at your finger tips, you still cannot get away from the sexual nature of this tale. Hopefully, with that said, we will see more of an effort with removing the typos."},{"Title":"Scandalous","review":"Around and around we go as three roommates learn to share. Hmph...hmph...hmph... Some things should be singly owned, but sometimes it takes a valuable lesson to learn that everything isn't for your taking.Scandalous albeit is the first book I've read by author Torrian Ferguson, I'm hoping to make him a bookshelf favorite."},{"Title":"Scandalous","review":"Story and plot leaves something to be desired.

He explains that many young adults do not lose their faith--they just find a new way to understand it. As they question their traditions, experiences, and religious convictions they see different aspects (probably because they are on their own).Hoover describes the spiritual journey as a &quot;Road Trip&quot;. Many people commute to work. Commuters are only concerned with getting to their destination. They dread the trip, ignore the sights, and think only of the end. Hoover points out that many people live their spiritual lives as commuters on the way to heaven. &quot;Road Trips&quot; involve rest stops, visiting, sight seeing, discussions, laughter, and growth. This, according to Hoover, is what the spiritual journey should be. Our growth should be enjoyable and have an awareness of the journey to heaven. Throughout the book this metaphor encourages discipline, an appreciation for tradition and discussion, and a seeking for spiritual growth and formation.This book is a great book for any graduate."},{"Title":"Losing Your Religion, Finding Your Faith: Spirituality for Young Adults","review":"I bought this book because I've been investigating the religion I was brought up in. I found the book to be overly optimistic that one can readily walk back into a faith after becoming disillusioned with it. I think it's written by a Catholic man, but could be relevant to any Christian viewpoint. The author asserts that we don't really lose our faith, but \\"misplace it\\" because we don't like the religious environment we find it in. I would recommend this if you want to work your way back to a place of faith, but if you've already decided you want out, this won't help with affirming that decision."}]`),L={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:H,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},j=["disabled"],B={key:0},M={key:1};function R(s,e,n,c,r,i){const y=w("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",x,[(t(!0),a(f,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(t(),b(y,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",M,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",B,"See more"))],8,j)):p("",!0)])}const E=u(L,[["render",R],["__scopeId","data-v-1d25980c"]]),O=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/35.md","filePath":"guide/35.md"}'),q={name:"guide/35.md"},W=Object.assign(q,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(E)]))}});export{O as __pageData,W as default};
