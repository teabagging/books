It required a bit of patience, and sticking to the rules, but the payoff was worth it.

If you have any questions concerning why you are going through a particular trial or hardship, you will find the answer in the pages of Pastor Russ Plilar's new book. Pastor Russ goes through several &quot;roadblocks&quot; that stop people from receiving the blessings that God has promised them, and reveals truths from the Bible that will make you stop and think for a moment about where you stand with God. The Contemporary English Version of the Bible says in 2 Corinthians 10:5, at the latter part of the verse, that we (Christians) are to capture peoples thoughts and make them obey God. If there is one statement I can make about this book, it is that it will capture every evil way of thinking that the devil tries to put in your mind, and force you to change your way of thinking to be like God's way of thinking. Every Bible believing Christian knows that God's thoughts are higher than our thoughts as humans in general. This book will drive you to repent of the things you have done against the will of God. The word &quot;repent&quot; literally mean to change your mind and turn around, or, more simply, to change your thoughts to be God's thoughts. When you start thinking the way God thinks, you will no longer give sin a place in your life. In Romans 6:12 the apostle Paul warns us to not allow sin to reign in our mortal bodies. Sin is the one thing that seperates us from God. When Man fell in the garden of Eden, it was sin that was added to the human body that seperated us from God, becauses God has no sin. 2 Corinthians 7:1 tells us that we as Christians are to cleanse ourselves of the filthiness of the flesh and spirit, which means that we have to remove the sin from our life, which is only possible through the shed blood of Jesus Christ when He was crucified on the cross as a sacrifice for our sins. This shows us that the only way to become what we were created as, in the likeness and image of God (Genesis 1:26,27), is to repent and change our ways to be like God's ways. &quot;The Place Between Amen And I've Got It,&quot; is a book designed to help people everywhere to turn from the sin that has them enslaved and draw near to God. Colossians 3:2 tells us to set our affections on things above, not on the things of this world. Pastor Russ's book will help you to focus on God, the source of your blessings, your health, your prosperity, and your life. Through his own personal testimony Pastor Russ will take you to a place between the shout of Amen when God promises you abundance of blessings and life, and the time when you will actually receive these things. He helps you to understand how the devil operates to destroy you during this crucial time, the time between the planting of the seed and the harvest. The Bible says that as long as the earth remains ther shall be seedtime and harvest, but if you do not understand the work that must be done between the time os planting and reaping, you may never see your harvest. This book is a must for anyone who wants to know how they can receive the fullness of what God wants to do in your life. Buy it, read it, and apply it to your life, it will truly bless you."},{"Title":"The Place Between \\"Amen\\" and \\"I'Ve Got It!\\": Why Some Receive Sooner Than Later","review":"This book should be required reading for every Christian on the road between &quot;AMEN and I've Got It!&quot; I grew up in the &quot;Faith Camp&quot; and have seen many &quot;shipwrecked&quot; Christians that never understood the principles taught in this book. Pastor Russell Plilar walks you through all the major roadblocks to obtaining the promises of God found in the Bible. He is no novice when it comes to the walk of Faith. The examples he uses from his own life are supernatural and inspirational. The &quot;Faith Message&quot; has been criticized by many in the Church because of their lack of understanding of the things discussed in this &quot;Faith Saving&quot; book. If you believe that God really does want you to be blessed and successful in this life - OR if you are beginning to have your doubts - this book will save your faith!

I used to read and reread the Henry Reed stories by the same author - but this one was different because it didn't have any pictures, not even on the cover (the Henry Reed series had three or four pictures per volume) and the characters were older (high school age). I recall thinking it was a \\"big\\" book, but this volume I just read is only 186 pages. It's all relative.I loved this book when I first read it as a nine or ten year old - so 25 years later I decided to reread it and see what my impressions are now. I was amazed that I actually remembered every single scene, character, and plot element. It was like I just read it.The two main characters - Cloud and Wong - are interesting viewed from today's world. In the book Wong is 100% Cloud's sidekick. He is his Tonto! There is no evidence that Wong cares about anything except meeting Cloud's needs; and this after Cloud treats him so poorly when they first meet (unabashedly racist) and throughout the book Cloud never really does anything to benefit Wong. It makes me wonder what Wong is getting out of the relationship (besides the joy and pride of seeing Cloud get his Jeep!Another oddity is that the character Cloud is supposed to be a teenager - but he has a vibe more like a middle aged miltary or ex-military adult. I assume that the character Cloud was based on the author as an adult and not on a teenager.That having been said I had a blast taking a Jeep drive down memory lane. I would advise anybody who is actually reading this review to go back and reread one of the first novels they ever read. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Year of the Jeep","review":"I thought this book was very interesting for any car buff, or jeep fanatic. It was meant to be a book for us kids, but I think adults could enjoy it just as much.

The hero is a teenage boy crazy about cars, especially old jeeps - back in the days when you could repair cars. He's asked to escort around a new kid, a Chinese-American who loves to pull the old \\"Charlie Chan\\" routine on unsuspecting people. Anyway, exploring, they find an abandoned farm and in the barn, an old jeep! The hero works at getting it running, which takes some cash, so he and his friend take odd jobs that sometimes work and sometimes fizzle. Like, not a good idea to bring all the bats you captured in an attic to a downtown lecture. They have friends in the neighborhood, all busy, and get some helpful advice from adults. He finally gets the jeep running, but then learns the farm and its contents(!) are to be auctioned off. After more misadventures and the intercession of his friends, and even some adults, all ends well. So mostly it's a book about making and being a friend, bumbling through life and learning on the fly, and how wonderful it was to spend lazy summers just clunking around. For ages 8 to 80. Note this book was published as just \\"The Jeep\\" by Scholastic, so there are plenty of copies floating around."},{"Title":"The Year of the Jeep","review":"Well, Moik, someone did read your review! I was contemplating the purchase, but after the 3rd paragraph of your review I was spending the money.In the fall of 4th, 5th & 6th grade, 1969-1971, I read the book, loving every page. For years, I've shared with others that it was my favorite book as a child. I've often wondered what it would be like to read it again. When it arrived, I was astonished to find that I had purchased a school book, complete with the little check-out card in the holder inside the back cover. The lines were empty - no one had checked out the book! I felt like I should sign and date it! I polished off the 1st two chapters and smiled. Yep!

Apparently he'd stolen it from the middle school library.It was written and published in the late 60s. Other than the date on the cover, you couldn't tell. Cloud's daydreams are a bit distracting, obviously aimed at a younger audience, but it's a story any kid (or adult) can relate to. You want something you can't afford, and you either don't get it or you save your money until you can.I was a bit surprised at the trouble the characters get into, considering when it was written...

But it is color we see first. Color either grabs the viewer with its expression of a mood or emotion or it does not.

She also emphasizes the importance of using the color wheel as we paint. It surprises her that many artists do not have the color wheel close at hand while painting. Color is just that important!\\"Color Harmony\\" is organized into six sections:1. The Basics of Color (properties, mixing, matching)2. Choosing a Color Scheme3. Discovering the Munsell Color Wheel4.

Apart from few paintings all paintings looks like the painting on the cover of the book (colorless and with colour engravings, in most cases: brown).

The instructions are quite detailed, clear, precise and specific to each block. It is the next best thing to having an instructor in the room with you. Second, there are many variations of the quilts and blocks provided throughout the book, one more beautiful than the next. Third, the actual blocks are quite interesting and would be appropriate for any level of quilter. I believe that the novice and experienced quilter will benefit from and enjoy this book equally.

When I decided to make another sampler quilt,I was looking for some new ideas and was delighted to see that Ms. Edwards had put out another sampler quilt book, the \\"New Sampler Quilt Book\\". I was even more delighted when the book arrived and I began work on my sampler patchwork. The blocks are a little more intricate in the new book but do not require extensive sewing experience. Ms. Edwards has a very clear style of writing and explaining the \\"how to\\" part of each patchwork piece. There is a chapter devoted to each sampler piece covered in the book, as well as chapters that cover some basic fabric cutting and quilt finishing techniques. Because of Ms. Edwards clear explanations and obvious sewing skills, these extra chapters are worthy reading.The sampler piece chapters open with a beautiful color picture of the sampler patch, an interesting short history of the patch, and then leads into construction methods that include clear diagrams of the piecing methods. This book is a \\"must\\" for every quilter's library because the patchwork construction methods are not limited to one style of piecing; the methods used include hand and machine foundation piecing as well as freezer paper applique, which gives the reader a chance to practice different techniques following clear, concise, instructions.Another wonderful feature of Ms. Edward's books are the pictures of completed sampler quilts of other quilters who took a class with Ms. Edwards for the purpose of completing a sampler quilt. Both books follow this format, which allows the reader to see how the patchwork looks in different color schemes and with different borders.I have purchased other patchwork collections; however, these are merely outlines of the patches and pieces used.

Different piecing methods are used for each block but I believe that all could be completed in whichever method you prefer if the basics of piecing are understood.

His partner, Alex Stone, visits him after two years to get his help with a problem brewing in Marezzo. He also delivers some bad news about his former deceased lover. Marc refuses to help and Alex is reported dead three weeks later. Seven months later, Victoria Jones shows up in his cabin with claims of being Alex's twin and him being alive. She wants Marc's help in retrieving him from Marezzo using her twin telepathic connection. Marc agrees and takes her with him to help locate Alex.This is entertaining but light fare. The op was somewhat suspenseful and interesting (a bit predictable) but the romance developed awkwardly. It was also mystifying why Marc failed to ask pertinent and critical questions of Tory prior to beginning the op, those that arose in my brain immediately and made a difference with the outcome. And, for all the emphasis on finding and retrieving Alex, there was zero focus on him at the end of the op.With that said, I liked both characters and got them however, I feel the dialogue between them was stilted and at some times immature. It didn't support the timeline of their romance or behaviors, even though you wanted them to be together. There are some steamy moments that do add spice.I understand later books in the series are far better so I plan to continue."},{"Title":"The Mercenary (The Men of T-FLAC, Book 1)","review":"Marc Savin is retired from the mercenary business. No more covert ops. No more jobs. He is quite content to be a rancher now and nothing more. T-FLAC (Terrorist Force Logistical Assault Command) can find someone else from now on. At least that's what he keeps telling himself. When his ex partner, Lynx aka Alex, shows up asking for his help, Marc doesn't hesitate to tell him no. Well actually more of a \\"HELL NO\\". Lynx brings information with him about Marc's last case, the one where he murdered his girlfriend in cold blood. Now Lynx is telling him that she was a double agent all along...the woman he loved was a spy.When Lynx doesn't come back from his last job, Marc blames himself. He let him go in alone after all. The body that was returned to them was nearly unrecognizable. Coupled with the death of his girlfriend, Marc just wants to be left alone.Tori Jones needs to find her brother Alex fast. Her telepathic way of communicating with him gets weaker as he does. She knows, regardless of what everyone else thinks, that he isn't dead. However he can't last much longer against the torture being bestowed upon him. Tori understands all to well because the same men had her for two weeks too. She goes to the only person she can trust to believe her...Marc.Marc isn't happy about this woman who claims to be Alex's sister showing up in his house. Nor can he believe that this mousey woman even had the courage to show up, arm in a cast and everything, to ask for his help. He wants to turn her down flat, but if there is a chance Lynx is still alive, he needs to help her. Reluctantly.I really enjoyed this first TFLAC book. Marc and Tori work so well together. Tori starts out the story as a mousey, slightly prim and proper, virgin. She is scared and desperate to find her twin brother Alex. She has been through a lot to even get to Marc's house and then he treats her with indifference and arrogance. Tori is a hard one to crack though, she is a lot stronger than she gives herself credit for. Being tortured for two weeks I was surprised she was a pulled together as she was. That is a lot for even operatives but she seems to have taken it in stride. Tori's description as well as Marc's seemed to morph throughout the book. At the beginning she is described as mousey and him as \\"could never be attractive\\"....however, by the end its more of a GQ model and a librarian out of a 80's rock video. Marc is downright mean to Tori several times through out the book and yet Cherry makes you love him. She makes you believe in him and his ability to not only change but to overcome his past.I think my favorite scene is towards the end when Tori decides to take a stand and she makes an excellent shot on a bad guy. I was all \\"HELL YEAH, who's mousey now\\"The action in this book is continuous from page one. You won't want to put it down and at only 250 pages it's a fast read.

Don't let the innocence fool you, there are, a few twists such as a paranormal element has been thrown in plus action and suspense. Those elements underscore this origin story as a gateway to more intense romance, action, suspense or paranormal genre series.

The spy goes off to save the day and is soon reported dead. Spy's unknown twin sister (Heroine) shows up asking hero to rescue his supposedly dead friend (the Spy). Sister claims (without a shred of proof) that her 'psychic' link to her twin proves he's alive and in dire need of rescue. Hero makes heroine accompany him into enemy territory. They hide out in a cave, ho hum, 'entertain' each other (a la dishabille) then they get around to rescuing the twin. The sister gets captured, the hero rushes to her rescue, they liberate the spy. Cue credits.CONS:There was NO relationship played out between the twins. I expected the sister who risked her life and torture to at least, oh, say, ask, \\"Ok, you rescued my twin brother, um, is he ok or alive or half dead or huh?\\". Maybe a little interplay between the siblings would have been the bare minimum you'd expect from the storyline.The James Bond aspect of the hero waltzing in to the stronghold as an \`old school chum' was laughable and frankly absurd.I didn't like the hero and thought the heroine was super sappy and wimpy. I'd love to tell her to grow a pair.Cherry Adair's novels are harsh. The characters are razor sharp with no softness at all. The guys fall in love with the heroines, but they don't want to. The Heros are dark and completely unsuitable for a normal person. For instance, the hero takes the heroine's virginity, then in order to 'protect her' so that she doesn't think there's a relationship forming, he harshly pulls a GUN on her, then tells her 'I got my sex.\\". Harsh right?IMO, heroine flip flops too easily. The dark hero pulls a gun on heroine, threatening her by counting down, till she flees in fear for her life. Minutes later, she throw herself into his arms. Pooh. I say. Pooh and Phooey.PROS:Cherry Adair can take an absurd story and pull the reader inside. She is a good fantasy, so I do have her on my list of \\"Authors that I will suspend reality for and buy their books anyway\\".I liked the fact that the heroine was willing to do anything. Spend everything, including liquidating her own home in order to help her sibling. She was going to seriously step outside her comfort zone to accomplish the impossible. Ok. I might slightly revise my opinion of the heroine up a notch or two.OVERALL:I like Adair. I say... go ahead.

Too much of one or the other, and the book sags under the imbalance. Too much romance, the writing often tips over into the treacly, the overblown, the gushy. (I'm not a big fan of alpha males who will \\"just die if they don't have a taste\\" of [insert heroine's name].) Great writers can imply their hero feels that way without using the overblown language. Too much suspense, and either the alpha male is so harsh you can't believe (or respect) any woman would want to look for the deeply hidden squishy parts or you feel like the romance is added as an afterthought. For me, the only two authors who consistently deliver the perfect, believable blend of romance and suspense are Nora Roberts' J.D. Robb series of In Death books and Anne Stuart's Ice series. Neither of those authors ever indulges in the flowery language that for me is so off-putting. In this book, Adair succeeds. I never read the original version of this novel, so I don't know how much she \\"improved\\" upon it, but I found this revision believable and interesting. I was sad to say good-bye to the characters, and wish the author would have included an extended epilogue. Or better, have her revise it again and go much further with both characters :)"},{"Title":"The Mercenary (The Men of T-FLAC, Book 1)","review":"I enjoyed this romanctic action mystery.

I developed an early rhythm for this book."},{"Title":"The Mercenary (The Men of T-FLAC, Book 1)","review":"&quot;The Mercenary&quot; is Adair's debut novel written in 1994 and published as a Harlequin Temptation series romance.This is the story of T-FLAC operative Marc Savin and his partner's sister Victoria Jones. T-FLAC (Terrorist Force Logistical Assault Command) is an elite government unit, a cloaked counterterrorist force beyond even the CIA.When Victoria (Tory) realizes that her brother is being held prisoner, she enlists the help of Marc Savin to rescue him. Tory and her brother are twins and they have a special ability to communicate with each other telepathically. For this reason Marc needs Tory to help him locate his partner and he takes her along on the rescue mission.This story held my interest because of Adair's ability to produce an exciting read when it comes to action, adventure and suspense. But the romance portion of the story was disappointing. There was no indepth character development. Other than their mission together and some background info on their past lives, I feel I didn't get to know Marc and Tory too well. Their relationship followed a stilted and dated format but you will find some steamy sex scenes in this story. Another slight problem in this story was that I found it difficult to believe the mental telepathy conversations between Tory and her brother.I would have liked a longer, more indepth story, but even with these distractions, I feel that Ms. Adair did a good job with this short format series title. This title is currently out of print and very hard to find at used book stores. Copies are available through amazon.com auctions and zshops."},{"Title":"The Mercenary (The Men of T-FLAC, Book 1)","review":"Let me start off with saying I love Cherry Adair. I've read most of her books and I held off on reading this book until it was republished. It was not worth the wait. This is Adair's first novel originally written 14 years ago. Most of the actions of the hero and heroine make absolutely no sense at all. Tory travels by herself to a violent, terrorist-controlled country to find her brother who is missing. She is captured and held hostage for a few weeks and is repeatedly beaten. They release her and escort her to the airport. When she arrives back in the States she calls upon Marc, who was her brother's partner, to help get him out. Marc has been retired from T-FLAC for over two years, he believes Alex dead and initially does not even believe her. At this point in the story, Tory is basically afraid of her own shadow, she is immensely afraid when Marc even so much as looks in her direction. Marc threatens Tory in an attempt to get her to leave and she faints! Is this the same woman who traveled by herself half way around the world to take on evil terrorists? Any woman experiencing what she did would walk away with major Post Traumatic Stress, but not Tory even though she is a self-proclaimed coward.Once Marc is convinced that what Tory is telling him is the truth, he decides to go and to take Tory with him since she and Alex have a psychic connection. So at this point my question is...why is Marc the only T-FLAC agent going in the rescue Alex? I have a hard time believing T-FLAC would send only one man in to rescue one of their own, even more so when the man going in has been out of commission for over two years. Throughout the story there are several moments where you just want to scratch your head. For example,Tory has saved her virginity for 27 years only to give it to a man whom she has only known for a few days and he has been nothing but a bully to her, on top of that, she is scared of him.There is a scene where the Tory pulls a gun on about 7 armed men, she tells them all to drop their weapons and they comply! These 7 armed dangerous terrorist are just so stunned to have a woman stand up to them that they all actually surrender. LOL(**SPOILER** Another peeve about this book is that Tory never tells Marc that she is pregnant at the end of the novel. Sure they decide to get married and all so his knowledge about the pregnancy is a given but there is no moment in the book when he finds out. I kept reading expecting her to tell him at anytime and it never happened.)I could go on but won't. This book is technically book 1 in the T-FLAC series but I recommend starting with Kiss and Tell instead. Actually none of the books need to be read in order, except the Edge books. All of Adair's T-FLAC books tend to have unbelievable plots but they are still fun to read, The Mercenary just takes it too far; that combined with weak character development but that can be expected in a first novel. Cherry Adair has come a long way since 1994."},{"Title":"The Mercenary (The Men of T-FLAC, Book 1)","review":"Despite being separated most of their lives, Tory and her twin Alex have a psychic connection and she just knows that her brother is in trouble. Alex is a counterterrorist agent and has disappeared from his latest assignment. When Tory lands on the doorstep of Alex's mentor Marc Savin, she pleads for his help. Marc left T-FLAC after his lover was murdered in a botched assignment and now lives a solitary life on a ranch. He wants no part of the rescue, but relents and finds himself in Italy searching for Alex and attracted to his friend's sister.This is Adair's first T-FLAC novel, which she revisited and expanded. Unfortunately, it still falls short of her later writings and missed the boat on plot and character development. And as usual we have a virginal heroine who succumbs to a man who treats her like dirt within days of meeting. It is just an average novel and does nothing to display Adair's talent at writing fast-paced romantic suspense. Had it been my first my Adair novel, I probably would not have read the rest of her fantastic T-FLAC series."},{"Title":"The Mercenary (The Men of T-FLAC, Book 1)","review":"Marc Savin is retired, or so he keeps telling himself and other former colleagues. He is so retired he has put himself in exile and, in a way, a personal mental hell. The fact that he killed the last person he loved was the sign he needed to get out of the business. But when his former partner Alex tells him he was set up by that former love, he is infuriated. If that was true then the hell he has put himself through was for naught. When he refuses to go on a mission with Alex and Alex is killed, Marc further hardens his heart.Victoria Jones is a self-confessed coward. But there is one thing she will risk everything for and that is to save her twin. Victoria knows Alex is still alive, no matter what T-FLAC or the authorities say. In fact, she even went to the island where he was to have died, and after she is captured and tortured, she is certain he is alive. Now she will go to the one man Alex always told her was the best. No matter how scary she personally finds him.When Victoria shows up at Marc's house, he is surprised and not too amused. Especially at her insistence that Alex is alive. Since he sent Alex on the mission alone, he feels compelled to get him out. But he is also more than a little attracted to Victoria and her prim and proper ways, though they are so far from his norm it is stunning.Hot Mediterranean nights, stressful situations, and physiques to die for will lead the reader into one spicy story.The Mercenary - the one that started it all, in reprint, finally. If you love the men to T-FLAC created by Cherry Adair but, like me, missed this first story, then run to get this one. While I feel that her characters have grown stronger, as has her writing, during the subsequent novels, this one is still a keeper. I loved how prim and proper Victoria talks to herself and wants to do all that is correct and be in the background, but has a backbone of steel that some might miss. And Marc...what can you say about a secret operative with long black hair, an earring and a physique to die for, other than send me one now? Want to see how it all started?

She believes that Marc may be the only one who can help find and save him. Tori and her brother have shared a psychic connection since birth. Using the connection, she has located her brother in Italy. Marc is reluctant to come out of retirement. Seeing Tori's suffering, he caves. He has no choice but to take Tori with him. She is the only one who can point Marc to her brother's prison. Knowing herself for a coward, Tori tries to convince him to go without her. In the end, although neither is happy about going, both are willing to risk all to find Tori's brother.For several days, Marc and Tori hide- out in a cavern while executing the search. As much as they try to avoid it, they find themselves attracted to one another. Marc knows he needs to keep a cool distance.

This is the second book I've read by the author and so far, I'm a fan. This book is a re-release of the 1994 title, expanded by the author. The additions seem to flow very well, nowhere did I see an obvious patch.One thing I loved about this book was the heroine, Tory. She fully admits to being a coward who likes things to stay the same. She wants her home, her job and her life to be boring, safe and routine. I think the blurbs are a bit misleading in that they make her seem to be more driven and heartless than she is protrayed to be. She simply wants to save her brother and pushes herself beyond what she felt were her limits to do so. Even as she proves her courage and determination, she wishes she was back home in her safe little world.I wasn't so enamored of Marc. Throughout the book he is a jerk to Tory. Even when he's not being deliberately mean he's insensitive and rude. A few times he seems to remember that she's not a trained operative, but most of the time he seems to expect more of her than is reasonable. On those rare occasions when he does remember she's not prepared for the kind of mission he's forced on her he makes up for any show of compassion with calculated cruelty.Some of the action did seem to be glossed over a bit to me, cleaned up off-camera, so to speak. That's a minor annoyance. I also think the \\"romance\\" was a bit forced.

I thought the main character, Victoria Jones was a bit of a wimp, she read more like a 'romance novel' female character and Marc was the usual brooding male. This book does fall way short of later books. I don't think you'd necessarily have to read it to understand the series, unless you are like me and have to read them in order!

In his quest for vengeance, Kyle kidnaps Eden and then later her young son, Tommy. The years have taught Eden to hate as well but as much as they try they cannot turn their backs on the passion they once knew.I almost gave this story one star rating because I could not stand Eden and in my mind she never did anything in the story to redeem herself only made herself more loathable. Eden's father shoots Kyle in front of her, teaches her son hatred, locks her in her room, treats people bad and all she ever does is say,oh Dad now don't do that..tsk tsk....However when the man she supposedly loves professes his innocence to the crime he's convicted of she does not believe him, and she ends up killing someone who was trying to protect themself and she hates Iron Hawk and thinks she's the one justified.

When Hawk escapes prison he is bent on revenge and kidnaps Eden and takes her to a Comanche village where the reader is to believe that Eden is still in love with Hawk even though she is breathing threats and hate filled speech at him constantly.

He was amaizng!"},{"Title":"Gay and Lesbian Weddings: Planning the Perfect Same-Sex Ceremony","review":"I am not sure what I expected from this book. Maybe I have a bias since I am a professional event planner who also happens to be a lesbian. First off I must say the book does offer practical, easy to understand advice for any couple planning a wedding. The chapters are well laid out and packed with practical ideas. On the other hand the book does have a more gay male friendliness than lesbian friendliness. The book is authored by a gay male and straight female. So, the true lesbian point of view is kind of lost in the shuffle. Silly issues arise for the lesbian side of things assuming that all lesbian relationships are made up of two masculine females or two effeminate females. The vast assumption is made that all the members of a lesbian wedding party will wear dresses. The silly question also arises as to which woman will toss the bouquet or if two should be tossed. My partner would not be caught dead in a dress and do not even try to push a bouquet into her hands. I do commend Mr. Toussaint on his ability to make a well rounded wedding guide for the \\"rainbow\\" family, but his research (if he did any) should have include vast types of lesbians the same as it included vast types of gay male relationships. For this reason I can not give the book a full five stars because it simply does not address the issues of lesbian couples."},{"Title":"Gay and Lesbian Weddings: Planning the Perfect Same-Sex Ceremony","review":"Let's face it: getting ready for a wedding isn't exactly a laugh a minute.

That's why I've given copies to friends and family, gay and straight, whether they're planning on getting married to their mates or not. And I'd love to see if Mr. Toussaint can follow up with another edition -- I'm sure this is a book that can be updated regularly with new info and new real-life stories.

Early on, I checked out this book and two others (The Complete Guide to Gay and Lesbian Weddings and the Essential Guide to Lesbian and Gay Weddings) from the library to see which ones I might want to buy. I expected this book to be my favorite, but found it next to useless.This book was cute and sometimes funny but lacked substance. All of the advice was based on a very traditional wedding and assumed a level of parental involvement (and their $$) I found pretty unlikely for many couples. My main concerns: chapters full of fluffy fillers, inaccurate information and missing key pieces.First, there was no information about finding a reception or ceremony site, other than a cute but silly \\"find you style\\" quiz. I was hoping for concrete information on choosing a gay-friendly site, working with vendors, signing a contract and ways to hold a wedding at your home. nada.Instead, there's a whole chapter devoted to quizzes on sex after marriage (funny but unhelpful) and another of legal issues (adoption, domestic partnerships etc). The legal chapter is already out of date and inaccurate. Please please do not rely on it. Check out Nolo's A Legal Guide for Lesbian and Gay Couples and the HRC website instead.Also, the alternative wedding section was only a few pages long. They only included a paragraph each on destination weddings or \\"ethnic\\" weddings. I would have been happy to cut out the section on attendents and the presents you should give them in favor of more alternative wedding ideas, creative invitations or ideas on dealing with wedding stress.I did really like the wedding stories that preceeded each chapter. Definitely the best thing about the book.But I would still recommend either of the other two books I mentioned instead. The Essential Guide is dated, but still the best of the bunch in my opinion.

But what I liked best, and didn't expect, was that the book told us all about the legal stuff; we might want to adopt someday, and there is a whole section about the different laws from each state. There was also a part on how to find an officiant, which helped a great deal. I thought I was going to have to spend days on the Internet searching for places to get help in that area, but it's all spelled out in the book. They give a whole list of sites to go to.

This huge 32-page book (intended to evoke the huge comics sections of yore), printed luxuriantly on yellow-tinted thick paper, includes the serialized exploits of Rusty Brown (collector), Tales From The Future (consumer), and Quimby the Mouse (who has one strip for each season of the year).Like in Acme #7, the centerfold is a huge Jimmy story (this time it's about Christmas). But there is another centerfold (printed on thick white paper) inside of THAT centerfold, which has a stereoscopic motion picture viewer cutout on one side and a Rusty Brown calendar on the other side. The movie viewer is nearly impossible to put together, but the calendar would make a great wall hanging. As always, the themes are always loss and grief -- but executed through the most brilliant whole-package design comics has seen since Krazy Kat or Flash Gordon. Every element is controlled and used to Ware's advantage.Appearing in cameo is God/Superman (cover, where he appears as the antithesis of Jimmy), Rocket Sam (2 strips), and Big Tex (one strip). There's also a serious article by Ware, an obituary for his art teacher who died (it's even relevant to the book because he collected like Rusty Brown) which is especially touching because it's not funny or ironic. The cover itself unfolds to become a huge diagram to which I still haven't figured out all the meanings. And the cover is colored by HAND. It's beautiful.One thing to watch out for is that the front cover has some spots in the white areas -- this was true for every copy at my local comics shop. I think they're all like that. So don't yell at Amazon if your copy is speckled. It's not a big deal, only in one area of the cover.Notice Ware's cameos: he appears buying the edison rolls from Chalky White, his early book &quot;Floyd Farland&quot; is at Captain Kid's Treasure Trove, and his 6' display is in the small &quot;Putty Gray&quot; comic strip below the movie viewer cutouts.His next book will be the first chapter in a full-length Rusty Brown novel. In a few years we should see a Chris Ware sketchbook from Germany (Fanta will import it). If you like this one, be sure to seek out Ware's other issues of the Acme Novelty Library at your local quality comics shop or Fantagraphics's web site.Hint on storing this book: I keep my Acme 15 and 7 sandwiched in between my computer tower and the wall, and it works very well.-Yakov."},{"Title":"The ACME Novelty Library #15: The Big Book Of Jokes II","review":"It's a pity that the first review is one which slights what is simply a continuation of one of the greatest canons of art and literature of the past century.It bristles me to see it be referred to as heavy-handed. This is much like saying some synphonic music is &quot;too loud&quot; or &quot;too quiet.&quot;Personal tastes aside, there are other errors in that review which cannot benefit anyone. . . comparing Rusty Brown to Jimmy Corrigan because they are both &quot;comic book geeks&quot; is ridiculous. The Jimmy Corrigan serial spanned generations in the same way, but the similarities end there.How was J. Corrigan a comic book geek? The only thing in that surreal tale which related to a comic book was a bizarre version of a super man. Having read the entirety of C. Ware's work, I can assure you as an unfamiliar reader, that the characters have little or nothing in common.So, as you should be able to gather on your own, anyone purporting &quot;who needs this&quot; and &quot;its heavy handed&quot; is just displaying their own tastes on their sleeve.This book is fabulous. The larger format is always better and welcomed. Just that alone puts it way above most &quot;drawn big and reduced&quot; comics, as you are seeing it nearly 1 to 1.The drawings are perfection. The stories are sentimental and endearing, no matter the protagonist.The baffling aspect of the first review (o how painful to see such a review of chaff up front) is that it then says &quot;if you'd like to see 'better' go to Dan Clowes' Eightball.&quot; Not only is it juvenile, as though there is a magical pyramid somewhere where all comic book writers compete to be the best and to adhere to someone's rather sketchily undefined tastes, but it detracts from one to serve another.I am aping the first review by stating:&quot;If you like good things, you'll like this!&quot;But I will one up it by stating that if you are a fan of the series this is essential because it draws from every character, and if you're not it's a great primer because of the variety."},{"Title":"The ACME Novelty Library #15: The Big Book Of Jokes II","review":"The Jimmy Corrigan saga having culminated in Mr. Ware's gorgeous, haunting, touching graphic novel of last year, the Acme universe expands in this new issue to include the horrid Rusty Brown, and it's wonderful. Unlike most of the other numbers in this series, the unprecedentedly huge #15 is a collection of mostly one or two page comics, comprised of Tales of Tomorrow, Quimby the Mouse, Big Tex, the aforementioned Rusty Brown (an as of yet unsympathetic, spiteful collector of 1970s ephemera), and even a welcome look in on Jimmy Corrigan. It's a given that Ware's books will be endlessly fun to look at from a design standpoint, but there's more to it than even that sizable accomplishment. I always feel alot happier about life in general after reading an Acme. In #15, Mr. Ware is no longer under the more serious demands of the Jimmy Corrigan story, and the comics here have more thematic freedom than the last few issues. The Jimmy Corrigan graphic novel made alot of friends of the format, and I hope that many of these carry over to this new book, to see how wonderful comics can be today."},{"Title":"The ACME Novelty Library #15: The Big Book Of Jokes II","review":"the reviewer who said he didn't &quot;get&quot; chris wares illustrations is obviously a no-talent hack who wouldn't know real art if it was staring him in the face. maybe you should just stick to thomas kincade paintings of pretty streams and rainbows."},{"Title":"The ACME Novelty Library #15: The Big Book Of Jokes II","review":"If your only exposure to Chris Ware is the collected \\"Jimmy Corrigan\\" graphic novel, you owe it to yourself to experience his work in its original, serial form. However, this most recent issue of The Acme Novelty Library is a less than ideal introduction to the book. While the issue features typically superior artwork and, in its best moments, achieves breathtaking sadness, by and large there is nothing here that Ware hasn't already tackled in \\"Jimmy Corrigan.\\" The Quimby Mouse stips are able to relate a precise and poignant element of misery, as does the excellent strip on the inside cover. However, most of the issue does not match these highlights. The Jimmy Corrigan strip included here is merely redundant, simply reiterating plot points already made in the serial. The \\"Tales of Tomorrow\\" are, for the most part, heavy-handed and overly austere. And the introduction of \\"Rusty Brown\\" is a big disappointment. Do we really need another story about a pathetic comic book geek? Rusty is like Jimmy Corrigan, except that is he is more repugnant than pathetic. If you loved \\"Jimmy Corrigan,\\" you will *like* Acme Novelty Library #15.

His meticulous, bitter, bleakly funny vision is best viewed in his sporadically released volumes of the &quot;Acme Novelty Library&quot; from Fanatgraphics-- even more so than in his bound collection of Jimmy Corrigan narratives (almost all of which came from the previously published ANLs). The early large-format ANLs are unsurpassed, and this new volume returns to those heady days-- this huge magazine format, in full color, shows Ware to his best advantage. As always his draftsmanship is precise to the point of absurdity, and his characters suffer unimaginably in his peculiar little hells. Ware is without equal-- buy this and see why, then investigate the first four ANLs as well to see more of his best."},{"Title":"The ACME Novelty Library #15: The Big Book Of Jokes II","review":"This book is really big. I have to fold it in half to store it."},{"Title":"Overlords of Atlantis and the Great Pyramid","review":"Brad Steiger ranks as one of the truly great writers in the field of paranormal subject matter. With his technical skill and sure hand with the printed word, he has few peers, and his prolific output is further testimony to his proven ability to deal with phenomena like UFOs, ghosts, parapsychology, and even ancient civilizations--topics most writers would grapple with inadequately or not at all.So it is easy to recommend &quot;Overlords of Atlantis and the Great Pyramid&quot; without reservation. Steiger presents his usual thorough and painstaking research into one of the more familiar sacred cows of the New Age Movement, and takes the reader on a fact-based quest for the lost island of Atlantis, combining fascinating myth with recent scientific discoveries by archeologists and other scientists.The opening chapter deals with scientific discoveries regarding the reality and unreality of the legends of Atlantis, surely one of the most objective summations of the current data available in the field. Evidence to bolster both sides of the argument are presented without undue editorializing, and the reader is invited to draw his own conclusions.Perhaps the most profound implication of the story Steiger tells is what is called &quot;the catastrophic theory of history.&quot; Simply stated, the theory poses the idea that perhaps the history of mankind goes back much farther than is currently believed, and that there existed previous cultures of highly advanced, extremely skilled technological people, what Steiger calls &quot;hominids,&quot; who had their existence cut short by some kind of natural or manmade disaster. Perhaps great civilizations have risen and fallen many times, without leaving a trace of archeological evidence behind them. Are we dangerously close to some kind of extinction ourselves, with our nuclear weapons and environmental decline spinning out of control?Steiger also discusses various theories as to why the myth of Atlantis has been handed down to us over the centuries, even turning up in the works of Plato, the Greek philosopher, among others. He says it may be because of what is called a &quot;racial memory,&quot; or a function of the collective unconscious, harking back to the universal myth of the Great Flood, which is found in nearly every ancient system of belief from the Bible to American Indian legends.Another point the universal myths have in common is that the deluge was a demonstration of the disfavor of the gods, which is perhaps most familiar to us from the Biblical story of Noah and the Ark. Do they all describe the same cataclysm, which also destroyed Atlantis?Steiger goes on to point out many other similarities and correlations between ancient cultures that serve to prove that they all had in common the same influences, that some kind of godlike guiding hand was present throughout the world. Hence you find pyramids in Egypt and again in Mexico, two very divergent societies who somehow created the same monuments to both their gods and themselves.This review has touched on only a small part of what &quot;Overlords of Atlantis and the Great Pyramid&quot; has to offer. As with every book in Steiger's catalog, the reader can count on finding evidence for fascinating paranormal phenomena presented in a clear-headed, coherent and entertaining way."},{"Title":"Overlords of Atlantis and the Great Pyramid","review":"We tend to think of ourselves as highly civilized -- &quot;superhumans&quot; who are more intelligent than at any other time in history. WELL THIS BOOK SHOWS DIFFERENT&gt; Brad Steiger - well known in the paranormal world - does much to prove that eons ago intelligent humans lived on the planet, and were in fact capable of creating a higher form of technology then we find ourselves with today. Supposedly, the overlords of Atlantis assisted in the construction of the pyramids,had space travel and may even been in contact with extraterrestrials. It was a wonderful world until mankind became too materialistic and destroyed itself with weapons of mass destruction...evidence of which can be found many places around the planet. This is both an adventure book as well as a book that can teach the reader a lot."},{"Title":"Overlords of Atlantis and the Great Pyramid","review":"This is an interesting book at times, but the title is misleading, it is not really about the Great Pyramid or Atlantis. On the other hand, since the book was written before the Sphinx and the Giza pyramids were redated to much earlier times than the Egyptians currently give them credit for, so one has to make certain allowances for that. The problem with this book is that it is misleading. At times, it seems to be about anything but Atlantis. Brad Steiger has collected some good information, but seems to equate Atlantis with all sorts of other occult ideas, like aliens, monsters and the supernatural...what does any of that have to do with the lost continent..? The first fifty pages are the most interesting as it delves into the idea that humanity is much older than historians give it credit for. The incidents range from interesting (million year old human shoeprints, suggesting that humans did live in the time of the dinosaurs, giant skeletons, also monsters menacing miners in caves), to the outright ridiculous (good old U.F.O.'s trotted out again any time a mystery can't be explained). Many of the old myths regarding the Watchers, ancient Indian flying craft and the Hollow Earth are also mentioned here. Again, it's interesting, but all this has all been done better elsewhere. The book seems to lack a clear, coherent structure and I agree with the reviewer who said that there are entirely too many pictures of the author posing before various ruins. That in itself just seems to negate the whole serious scholarly approach. On the plus side, the information, taken as a whole, makes a good supplement to other books out there on the topic, provided that one realizes they aren't getting the definitive word on the topic."},{"Title":"Overlords of Atlantis and the Great Pyramid","review":"I found this book quite disappointing (and not just because the text contained grammatical errors and typos in places). The back cover claims &quot;...archeological proof...indicate that the Great Pyramid was constructed with the assistance of the High Priests of Atlantis.&quot; However, there is no proof offered in this book, just theories and hypotheses. It's like a very long episode of &quot;In Search Of...&quot; where you never actually get an answer. I also found the photos included in the book useless for the most part. Many were of the author standing in ancient ruins. Big deal. Some drawings of maps of the ancient world would have made much more helpful companions to the text. The research talked about in the book is very interesting, but it proves nothing. In fact, some of the research studies contradicted each other. Very very disappointed in this book."},{"Title":"The Sorrows of Eros and Other Poems","review":"&quot;They clipped your wings? Well now you're doing time/ For every verse, for every bloody rhyme.&quot;In a blurb on the back cover of this 1999 collection, noted poet-translator Allen Mandelbaum calls Weinfield's verses &quot;companions to be treasured.&quot; To read this book is to put yourself in the company of Hamlet and all others imprisoned by love, brutal worldly intrigue -- and their own mortality. You could choose worse companions.If you are moved by Yeats and Auden more than the Beats or Lifshin, or simply seek, with Weinfield's Eros,...sources of the ancient spring,/ the luminous and liquid solacings/ that language proffers us against the voidyou might love to undertake &quot;The Sorrows of Eros&quot; - though the poems are anything but simple. Weinfield's Muse is one of lyrical beauty; his mode encompasses classical techniques and the clarity of philosophical argument; yet he carries the burdens of History and contemporary irony. About which, in his own wry way, he will even laugh:&quot;And some, more pessimistic, said/ That all the poets now were dead./Blizzards of prose and epidemics/ Of deconstructionist polemics/ Had turned them all to academics.&quot;Much more is here, and there is much more to be said about about a poet who reads his Bible, his Dante, his Shakespeare with both love and barbed wire in mind. (Try the unsparing &quot;An Essay on Violence&quot;). About a poetic vision that has appropriated self-mockery and compassion to a lifetime's searching of our mortal wounds. Weinfield's verse praises, protests, and would fly us out of our mortal prison.When I read reviews of poetry, however, I usually find myself wanting to hear more from the poet than from the reviewer. After we love the poems, we might crave more biography, insight, criticism. So I want to leave you with the whole of Sonnet Ten, from the first section of the book:&quot;For years I journeyed in the Land of Prose;/ With other sojourners I sojourned there./ It was a land of Plenty, I suppose,/ But in the end I was a sojourner./ I was a person then, a character,/ And so I happened to encounter you./ It seemed that I had known you once somewhere,/ Though both of us were merely passing through./ How long ago it was I cannot say/ That I departed for the Land of Rhyme;/ But it was long ago and far away,/ And I am finished now with space and time./ When I arrived I learned that I was dead -- / And I am nothing now but what you read.&quot;Now you know the kind of companionship these poems provide."},{"Title":"Rivers of Ireland","review":"I recently moved to Ireland with all my fishing gear and little fishing information beforehand. I luckily managed to get hold of this book. Peter O'Reilly truly lists all fishable rivers in Ireland, from the smallest trickle to the largest river. He does so in an efficient way, stating the most neccesary info, flies, size of fish etc. Not only did this book help me find excellent streams that I would otherwise never have heard of, the info. and tactics suggested proved to be very useful and similar to my own experiences at the rivers. The content itself derves five stars. My reason for only giving it four lies in the somewhat casual organization of the fisheries. The book is divided into different geographical sections but it lacks a map with an overview of each section. Instead there are small maps spread loosely in each section. This is fine if you know each area well, but the highway angler who tries to get a quick overview is left with some irritating pageflipping and index searching. Finally, the author makes room for a few select anecdotes that gives the book an enjoyable personal feel. Organization problems aside, I can wholeheartedly recommend this book to any angler searching for his/her own spot. I found mine and, most importantly, with help from this book I caught plenty of fish!"},{"Title":"Rivers of Ireland","review":"If you ever plan a fly-fishing trip to Ireland, this is the best source for detailed information about where to go. Peter O'Reilly is very well-regarded by fly anglers in Ireland, and he's an excellent writer. He has a newer edition available, which I'll probably buy next."},{"Title":"Mathematical Statistics (Springer Series in Statistics)","review":"This book has all the ingredients of what in my opinion constitutes an excellent mathematics text: rigorous, concise,self-contained, clear, and taking an abstract point of view. Note however that, due to the latter ingredient, the author studies statistics using a measure-theoretic approach; and thus I highly recommend that a potential reader first study measure theory as a prerequisite. The first chapter reviews the basics of measure theory, but it may seem too giant a first step for some readers.The first two chapters of the book give a nice overview of probability and statistics, while the remaining chapters expand on three fundamental areas of statistical inference: estimation (both parametric and nonparametric), hypothesis tests, and confidence sets). And I must admit that I'm very impressed with the author! For if a textbook is a reflection of what an author knows about some subject, then Shao represents a treasure trove of knowledge that is so eloquently shared in this book. Anyone serious about doing graduate-level reasearch in statistics should invest a year of studying this book. But be forwarned that most likely one will find this, due to the onslaught of measure theoretic analysis, one of the more challenging books to makes its way on the book shelf. For those who cannot stomach so much analysis, but would like to at least understand the gist of statistics, I recommend Roussas's book of the same title. It is calculus-based and makes some simplifying assumptions (e.g. continuous or discrete) about the distributions, which helps make the math digest easier."},{"Title":"Mathematical Statistics (Springer Series in Statistics)","review":"Don't waste your time: this is a rigorous book on mathematical statistics, done right, for mathematically mature readers.If you want a plug and chug manual, buy something else.

I read the first half of it in a PhD level statics class. I found its approach refreshing after taking an engineering oriented senior level/grad statistics class. I still frequently consult it."},{"Title":"Mathematical Statistics (Springer Series in Statistics)","review":"I don't know if statistics are just that difficult a subject or statistics writers just aren't good. Either way I have not found a satisfactory statistics book that treats the subject rigorously, but still readable. This book is an excellent reference. However, it's notation is cumbersome, if you're not used to it.Before I started taking the class that uses this book, I took four undergraduate probability and statistics classes, as well as studied advanced topics such as measure theory. That said many of the things in statistics I thought I understood, I found out that I do not, or had a hard time translating my undergraduate knowledge to this level. As with many advanced math subjects, the definitions are not enlightening and no motivation or further discussion is given for most definitions. These definitions are designed to fit into as general theory as possible, but trying to understand why some things are defined the way they were, and what the original intent of the object was, is just not there.To use this book, you will definitely need the guidance of an expert statistician."},{"Title":"Mathematical Statistics (Springer Series in Statistics)","review":"Update: In 2010 I am using this book again to review probability and statistics in preparation for applying to a PhD program in Finance or Risk Management. I still find the book to be extremely clear. Everything still seems up to date, surprisingly. I like that fact this book has a longer useful life than an iPod or a cell phone, but is a LOT cheaper :-). The sections are very concise, sometimes just 2-3 pages, so this is definitely a reference book and not a learning book. I think it's most useful for a quick comparison of the different methods for someone who has already learned most of the material before.---------------I know it must be a sign of extreme geekyness to be reviewing statistics books... but it happens to be one of my passions. (So that proves it takes all kinds of people to make the world go around.) I find this book to be unusually clear. Printing is also of high quality and I did not spot sloppy notation errors. I would judge the level to be about first or second year PhD level. First chapter lays out probability theory very well and introduces the more standard notations. I find books that use the less standard notations to be annoying. I got this book to use as a reference book rather than as a textbook. I wanted to have a concise place to look up and compare the different methods. If you are learning this material for the first time, I strongly suggest you take at least one applied statistics course first. I don't think one can learn statistics easily without using data and actually running the models. Also this is definitly a graduate level book. I don't think it will be a good idea to try it before reading through several undergradute-level books on probability, regression, and statistics.For more descriptive graduate-level books in econometric, \\"The Practice of Econometrics\\" by Ernst R. Berndt is good for hands on practice. Kennedy's \\"A Guide to Econometrics\\" provides a descriptive explanation of the various models."},{"Title":"Mathematical Statistics (Springer Series in Statistics)","review":"This is a pretty technical book on theoretical statistics based on measure-theory. It's very well written. For Ph.D. students or readers with experience in analysis/measure-theory, it's a good investment. For less technical book, I would recommend Casella and Berger's Statistical Inference."},{"Title":"Mathematical Statistics (Springer Series in Statistics)","review":"I bought this book as a \\"capstone\\" book for my personal studies in statistics. I have undergraduate and masters degrees in applied mathematics (operations research with minor in environmental engineering), but my studies were broad enough that I did not get to an advanced level of statistical understanding. Once I started working, I found that while my other math skills are sometimes useful (optimization, simulation, analysis) it was statistics that is the most frequently called upon by others in my work. However, I realized that although I knew a lot of statistics at the applied (and slightly beyond) level, I felt that I couldn't \\"see the forest for the trees\\", as I did not know the advanced theories that connected all the various statistical methods.If you've also felt that you have lots of \\"trees\\" but cannot see the \\"forest\\" that is statistics, Jun Shao's book will solve this! He keeps his basic topic list short and focused, and shows how they underlie essentially all of statistics. Also, the first chapter on probabililty theory is also very good. I never took measure theory (nor real analysis for that matter), but his expanations and presentation are clear enough that you can pick it up pretty well. However, if you are in the same boat as me, you will need to make sure you work though his examples yourself to be sure you could repoduce what he did and you know why he got that answer -- without this check, you may merely feel that you understand it, but will be missing the subtle points in the theorems -- remember: in advanced math, if its not forbidden in a defintion, it's allowed.From there, his other chapters build nicely on one another. Starting with basic problems/motivation and fundamentals and ending at the three pillars (some would probably say raison d'etre) of statistical inference, he builds a very solid conceptual house! I have come away from this book with a much deeper appreciation and understanding of statistics. It took a while (some reviewers have cited about a year to get through this...which was correct for me!) but I am now not just more conversant in statistics, but also much more creative and flexibile in how I apply statstics, and evaluate and develop new methodologies.Thanks Dr. Shao for creating this comprehensive and clear text!"},{"Title":"Mathematical Statistics (Springer Series in Statistics)","review":"This textbook is too technical, even for stat PhD students, and does not introduce many ideas and concepts. However, the biggest problem is that this book is not technically correct. Many proofs pretend to be complete, but actually there are many gaps and many important propositions are left unproved. The book should be honest about what they prove and what they do not prove.The only advantage of the textbook is clarity in statements, not in proofs. If you want to refer statistical theorems in measure-theoretically sophisticated way, this is a good reference."},{"Title":"Mathematical Statistics (Springer Series in Statistics)","review":"This book, coupled with its accompanying exercises volume is a good source for beginning graduate level statistics."},{"Title":"Mathematical Statistics (Springer Series in Statistics)","review":"This is an utterly useless book.Most of the essential theorems are not proved but left as an exercise to the reader. If the reader already knows how to prove these things, why buy this book.Stay clear of this book and don't waste your money."},{"Title":"Mathematical Statistics (Springer Series in Statistics)","review":"Too many seemingly unrelated topics with little attempt at unification. Equations rather than concepts. No attempt to relate concepts to practical applications. Nothing on the L1 norm. The brief section on permutation tests (and permutation tests applied to ranks) is laughable.On the plus side, contains many exercises of value to those whose emphasis is on distributions. Good support for the use of the bootstrap in hypothesis testing though no attempt is made to unify or select among the varying approaches to improved CI's."},{"Title":"Mathematical Statistics (Springer Series in Statistics)","review":"This book is highly abstract and technical. Very little emphasis is placed on statistical thought or ideas. It is easy to get lost in this sea of analysis and mathematical trickery. The reader is left with the impression that the author is more interested in demonstrating his mathematical prowess and ability to pointlessly abstract concepts than teach. Consequently, this book is unsuitable for teaching--unless the reader has at least a MS level mathematics education and plans to do research in mathematical statistics. Even then, this book is, at best, a good reference.For advanced textbooks in measure theoretic mathematical statistics, I highly recommend:Theory of Point EstimationLehmann and CasellaTesting Statistical HypothesesLehmann"},{"Title":"Propeller Handbook : The Complete Reference for Choosing, Installing, and Understanding Boat Propellers","review":"This is an extremely readable book for a technical subject tome. It is one of the better organized technical treatises I have seen. Whether you just want to select a propeller for your boat or want to design boats and propellers the book has something for you; though the casually curious may find themselves skipping a lot of engineering content. Tells you how to proceed in propeller selection in a parsimonious, no nonsense manner. And not simply how to do it, but the theory and reasons behind what to do are included as well. A complete index and list of suppliers makes this book a good reference tool."},{"Title":"Propeller Handbook : The Complete Reference for Choosing, Installing, and Understanding Boat Propellers","review":"Dave has done an excellent job of clearly covering a very complex subject.

As a result I have read a lot of material on this subject. This is the best reference on propellers that I have seen to date."},{"Title":"Propeller Handbook : The Complete Reference for Choosing, Installing, and Understanding Boat Propellers","review":"The author has boiled out all the complicated Bessel functions and the reader is left with the bottom line for basic propeller selection.

It was newly published and very expensive, so I found a copy in the FairFax VA library and made arrangements to borrow it through interlibrary loan. After reading most of it, I plunked down the money to buy my own, it is that good.If you are interested in learning about hull performance and power requirements, how to properly size an engine to meet those requirements, and how to select a prop to mate the engine and hull together, then this book is for you. I have spend many hours studying it and applying its contents to boat modifications I have been considering. Are you interested in sizing an engine or electric motor to drive a boat? This book will tell you what you need to know to do it right so you will be pleased with the boat's performance when you are done. Got a boat that is performing poorly? Maybe it has the right engine and the wrong prop, or the right prop and the wrong engine. This book will tell you how to find out. It is a great resource for understanding boat hull performance and how to match engine performance to the hull."},{"Title":"Propeller Handbook : The Complete Reference for Choosing, Installing, and Understanding Boat Propellers","review":"This is a well-written, extremely nice discussion for laymen of what's known about marine propellers. The book is short on surfacing props, where most of what's known is from seat of the pants testing by racers. The few equations presented are empirical equations based on scaling of one sort or another. I.e., there is no good theory of any sort of prop, low speed submerged props included. The role of circulation in producing high thrust/drag rations is explained, props are understood (we can say since Prandtl, ca. 1916) as rotating hydrofoils. What surprises me is that the upper curve in fig. 5-4 agrees with my experience setting up fast boats with surfacing props. I'm surprised because there's no known reason why it should work. I recommend the book to anyone who's interested in marine propellers!There are a few errors. E.g., cavitation is not a vacuum, in cavitation the local water pressure has fallen below vapor pressure, so the water 'boils' locally, forms bubbles (the assumption of incompressible flow fails). A bubble, of course, provides no thrust. Cavitation cannot occur with an airplane propeller, air is analogous to water vapor but in normal flow is treated as incompressible. In that case the assumption of incompressibility fails when supersonic speeds are reached."},{"Title":"Propeller Handbook : The Complete Reference for Choosing, Installing, and Understanding Boat Propellers","review":"SHOULD BE NAMED PROPELLERS FOR DUMMIES......

To put matters in perspective, prostate cancer - the leading cause of cancer in men - begins as early as puberty and affects nearly every man if he lives long enough. Prostate enlargement, another common condition, affects half the men over the age of sixty, one third of whom need treatment. Finally, prostatitis accounts for more than two million doctor visits yearly. In fact, prostatitis is the most frequent reason that men under the age of fifty see a urologist.That's the bad news. Now for the good news. Men don't have to become one of these statistics. Based upon information that I've gathered from scientific research, coupled with over twenty years of personal experience as a physician, urologic surgeon, and practitioner of conventional and alternative medicine, Smart Medicine for a Healthy Prostate will help men blessed with a healthy prostate keep it that way, and teach men challenged with prostate disease how to overcome it.The book is organized into four chapters.v The first chapter gives an overview of the prostate and pertinent male anatomy.v Each succeeding chapter guides readers through a different prostate disease. The first half of each chapter provides information about the natural history, evaluation, and state-of-the-art conventional therapies for the condition.v The second half of each chapter provides proven alternative therapies and teaches readers how to apply them.v The appendices contain a concise overview of nutritional and herbal supplements and the resource section provides additional valuable information.I hope you enjoy reading my book. May you be blessed with abundant health and happiness.Dr. McClure"},{"Title":"The Prentice Hall Reader","review":"Dr. Miller has, by and large, pulled in readings from &quot;everyday&quot; places--popular magazines, newspapers, &amp;c.

Suffice it to say, for a good few years now I've been looking for another book by the same author, sadly to no avail. This however has not surprised me, Contrariwise is such a gem it's difficult to imagine the author would have much material left to do anything else. At any rate, on with the story! Contrariwise is not your run of the mill fantasy, Knights in armour, damsels in distress etc. The usual theme of good and evil is tossed out the window, the main character being the &quot;Trickster&quot;, one of a pantheon of Greatkin, whose nature is as his name. He is at once childish and omnipotent, and in true Olympian style takes great delight in meddling with the lives of mere mortals. The geographics of the world in which contrariwise is set vary greatly from our own, and are able to physically affect the natures of the people who are born into them. There are no rules which correspond with the rules of our concepts of reality, therefore anything is possible. This said, There is a very definite logic at play,and many connections with familiar cultural teachings. &quot;So turn the inside, inside out, And go sanely mad with me.

There are several races with distinct and unique racial attributes. For instance, the Jinnjirri normally wear hats or head scarves, since their hair changes color to match their mood. They can also effortlessly change their sex. One of the Jinnjirri characters is homosexual. It doesn't matter which sex s/he is, s/he wants the sexual partner to be the same sex. A book with inventiveness such as these examples has a lot going for it. Also, Greenhalgh shows a deft ear for dialog. Real people do talk the way she has her characters talk.There are some problems with the book. Many of the characters are only two dimensional. The outright villain of the book, Cobeth, is described as being very charismatic. He certainly hides it well, or Greenhalgh doesn't show this side of him. He comes across as a vain, self-centered, vindictive jerk. Gadorian, the mayor of the city where most of the action takes place, is supposed to be very intellectual and altruistic, yet he appears to be driven purely by political ambition. He is convinced to ignore his prejudices solely because an outright display of them would hurt his reelection.This book has some clever ideas in it, most of which work.

He uses one of the natural elements to torture his victims and invites Lacie to join him in th element. Of course the killer finally meets his end in the ironic way of being dispatched by the element he chooses to use as his insturment of torture. Lacie can't handle the situation alone, so she enlists the aid of a rogue government man of action who is a pain to his organization, but they keep him around because he is the best at his job. Together, they unravel the truth about a top secret government organization. The rogue government guy is wounded by a gunshot from the evil genius and is pretty much useless in the final battle. Despite his unlimited financial resources, the evil maniac is undone. Oh, did I mention he is also a master of disguise? So what is the point of all this? The point is, reading 'DEAD TIDE' is almost like reading 'BURNOUT' again. The two books are so much alike it was sad. I felt totally ripped off after having read this book and it is safe to say that this is my last Jeannine Kadow book. If you haven't read 'BURNOUT', this would be an okay read at best. It is readable, but really you have to totally suspend belief in reality to accept this plot as even remotely possible. Also I think the fact that one of the good guys just flat out commits murder in the end and everyone is okay with that really seemed out of character."},{"Title":"Dead Tide","review":"DEAD TIDE is the first Jeannine Kadow I've read, and I'm full of admiration for it. The writing is clear and well-paced; the characters are drawn with enough depth to make them believable; and just about all of them - ranging in age from their twenties to their sixties - are attractive and sexually active. This is a real masterpiece of the mystery/adventure genre: dark, but with a lot of human warmth at the center of it.The book is extremely well-researched, full of information about fish and birds and oceans, and featuring some of the most detailed accounts I've ever read (outside the med school library) of autopsies on murder victims.People say of this kind of book that you can't put it down - as if that were the highest compliment. But I'm a busy person and I had to put it down several times: I read it in four sittings over the course of six days. What strikes me as most remarkable about it is that it was no problem to pick it up and continue reading it: the characters are interesting enough to make me wonder what was going to happen next; and as the plot thickened, I really needed to know how it would turn out. The last scenes in particular are exciting page-turners.This book is a very classy form of entertainment for all but the very young and very old."},{"Title":"Dead Tide","review":"I picked up this book on a lark, and I was very impressed by the quality of the writing. This book is a sequel to an earlier book called Burnout which I have not read, but it stands very well on its own.This book isn't for everyone. Kadow is not a lean writer -- she spends a LOT of time on description. I also found much of the dialogue rather stilted. Still, the quality of the prose is so good that I was willing to put up with these small flaws.The only question is when Kadow is going to write another book. This book, her most recent, came out nearly four years ago. So when's the next book Jeannine? Kadow keeps a remarkably low profile, but a writer of her talent should be better known than she is."},{"Title":"Dead Tide","review":"This is a wonderful read! The storyline moves adroitly; the protagnists are well-developed characters and each achieve that &quot;yeah, I wanna know this person&quot; level.

You won't want to put it down. And leave the lights on! It can get pretty creepy. That said, I really enjoyed this second book by Jeannine Kadow featuring Lacie Wagner. Wagner, a TV journalist recovering from a recent brush with death, begins what appears to be a fortuitous investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of a young woman whose body washed up on the shore near her home on Nantucket island. Her intense investigation soon leads her to the determination that she is somehow the target of this psychotic killer.Lacie enlists the aid of a renegade investigator,Nick St. James, to protect her and find the man she believes is responsible for the savage murder. In a plot full of superbly detailed investigation and unexpected twists Kadow leads us on a relentless and desperate search for an evil killer. She does it so well that it is impossible to put this book down until the end and then you will regret that it is done."},{"Title":"Dead Tide","review":"If you haven't read Jeannine Kadow's work you are missing out!

Twenty-three years later, the man who set the car fire returned to Lacie's life, killing her daughter's father, kidnapping her daughter for six weeks, and almost killing her. Now, nine months later, Lacie is almost healed and ready to report to work as a TV anchor and reporter on Washington DC.Relaxing in her Nantucket home, Lacie gathers the strength to reenter the real world. While jogging along the beach, she comes across the dead body of a young woman. Tests prove the woman was murdered and while investigating the victim's life, Lacie discovers that the deceased was part of an unauthorized black ops group. This group is linked to Lacie's next door neighbor and lover Justin Vale, a man who has a special agenda planned for Lacie.Jeannie Kadow has written an exciting thriller showcasing a complex and driven protagonist who refuses to let her deformity handicap her in anyway. DEAD TIDE is a serial killer thriller that stars a villain that is even more depraved than Hannibal Lechter. Ms. Kadow is on the level of a Patricia Cornwell and a Nancy Taylor Rosenberg in turning up the suspense in a believable manner.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Dreaming the Great Brahmin: Tibetan Traditions of the Buddhist Poet-Saint Saraha","review":"I'm not at all convinced of Kurtis Schaeffer's argument as regards the growth of the Saraha corpus... As Sahara has been presented to me by several teachers who hold lineages descending from either him, himself, or whatever his school of thought was originally, Sahara, himself, is a fairly monolithic character for all that the stories concerning him vary in both tone and content.Surely, for someone as pivotal in several traditions, anecdotes of many different kinds - 'true', projected and totally imaginary - are bound to crop up.For all the fact that the research is probably impeccable, the Sahara of this book is *not* the Sahara of the 'Three Songs of Realisation', but another, somewhat less authentic eponymous being with similar, but less exceptional, achievements."},{"Title":"Windows of Vision - Stained Glass (Studio Designer Series)","review":"The stained glass that goes whooshing this way and that.....like on the cover, is so cool!

You know no editor got his grubby hands on this one. Don't be put off by the title, which promises kinky melodrama. The book aims for social agitprop, but don't be put off by that, either. I do have one caveat: Beth Holmes has an unstated Christian agenda, in addition to the social one. It's unstated because it's taken as an absolute given. Some readers will quickly be alienated, around the point where the psychiatrist sits down to dinner with the disturbed family. If you're not horrified (as the psychiatrist is) that a father would allow his son to lead the family in saying grace--a permissiveness that is viewed by the author as sacrilege and horrific abuse--you'll probably be bewildered. And--just maybe--hooked.The novel--about a demented Dad who drives his son nuts, while the boy's saintly mother fights to save him--calls for reform of child-abuse laws, which at the time of its writing punished only physical abuse. It dramatizes the need for parents to set boundaries, warning that a lack of discipline (i.e., spoiling them rotten) can be as cataclysmic as daily beatings. Some good old-fashioned, Christian discipline is what's called for. That's the pretense, anyway. The book illustrates something else: that the medium is, indeed, the message. The novel itself is like some freaky, naive, flipped-out adolescent, totally lacking in any sort of discipline or shame, filled with weird disgust. Holmes gooses her polemic with hysterical overwriting, zany plot-twists, and yes, kinky melodrama, as well as the occasional Dr.-Seuss-on-drugs rhyme: \\"Timmy was a twelve-year-old [expletive] in lunatic drag.\\" And that's not dialogue.Much of the story is rather far-fetched, even for a pot-boiler. True, the twelve-year-old protagonist is described as good-looking, but his father can't leave him in the office for a minute without a secretary jumping into his lap. (Naughty boy!) Daddy finds this very annoying, since he likes to conduct nude wrestling matches with the boy on the living room rug. He doesn't mind the kid trying to murder people, including his own mother, and he lets him hang out at bus stations wearing lipstick and a beret, threatening sailors, but this girl stuff is out. Inexplicably, he decides to put the family finances and stock portfolios in the kid's jittery hands and give him total carte blanche. When bankruptcy results, he chases the kid onto the roof, hurling large pieces of furniture at him.Like little Timmy, you start to wonder what Mom ever saw in this guy. Helpfully, the novel flashes back to the 'fifties, to the budding romance between Dan and Evie. One evening, after a hot date, Dan accuses Evie of rape and attempted murder. Of him. Instead of running for her life, Evie finds his \\"vulnerability\\" irresistible. After the wedding, she doesn't wonder too much about why Dan's always going on about her \\"hard-boy body,\\" or why he enjoys walking around nude in public while, er, \\"tucked.\\" Dan is so nauseated by women that he can't even look at a drawing of a cow without getting sick. From here, the narrative sky-rockets into total delirium. Evie and Timmy flee into the Deep South, in search of Answers, all of which seem to lie somewhere in Dan's twisted childhood. Holmes can't think of a plausible device for this, so she has them stumble upon Dan's secret Second Home, which is curated by a little old man who calls himself the \\"Keeper of the Shrine.\\" Inside, of course, is an exact replica of their home up north, right down to the shag carpets and track lighting, except for one room: a weird museum holding relics of Dan's perversion. This room has portraits of his parents and sibs--a rogues' gallery of Irish inbred peasants--all of whom died mysteriously; a photo of the male camp-counselor who gave him VD when he was ten; the steel wool his monstrous mother used to scrape off his sores; pictures of Dan dressed as a little girl; you get the picture. The kicker is Dan's huge, demented journal, which the Keeper has been trying to turn into a best-selling memoir. Yes: the always-secretive Dan hopes to make himself rich and admired by displaying his sexual warts (real and figurative) to the world. Psychoanalytic short-cuts don't get much lamer than this.Reading this book, you get a creepy suspicion that the grotesque characters are somehow based on real people. You wonder what \\"Dan\\" ever did to Beth Holmes. You worry about all the prurient brilliance that went into her fantasia of homosexual self-loathing. The earnest, can-do, social proselytizing makes you a bit queasy. But anyone who finds this book \\"serious,\\" \\"thoughtful,\\" \\"complex,\\" etc, ought to be put under observation. If you have a sense of irony, please, please read this social-diatribe/get-even memoir/Christian sex fable, tricked out in lunatic drag. You'll chuckle about it for years."},{"Title":"The Whipping Boy","review":"This is story telling at its best - a story that should not be buried or ignored.

The characters are complex enough to allow a reader to understand the dynamics behind the bizarre behavior of the parents and children."},{"Title":"The Whipping Boy","review":"This is a truly gruesome story.This story starts off with a bang. Timmy, 12 is a dangerously mentally ill child whose mental illness seems to be functional rather than organic. At the opening of the story, Timmy mentally boasts of how good he is with animals, yet a kitten dies while in his care. It is never made clear whether Timmy killed it; the kitten's cause of death is equally obscured.Timmy lives in a house of madness. One of three adopted children, he delightes in tormenting his twin siblings, Nick and Meg, who are eight. Their father is a sexually confused person who insists on parading about the house naked; tucking his genitals back to as to appear feminized and who condones the boys beating up Meg. His initial attraction to his wife, Evie is based on her boyish appearance and body.Timmy unravels even further; he changes road signs around so as to cause a possible accident; he goes out in drag and flirts with sailors; he nearly kills a man while on a shool field trip which results in his expulsion. The school psychologist and Evie later become romantically involved, which comes as no surprise to readers.There are a few surprises to readers. One wonders why the psychologist drops in on the Lowells during dinner and why he was horrified that Timmy, rather than Dan was leading the grace. In many families, people take turns as to who says grace, so this singular act does not seem to be the hair raiser that Stollery, the psychologist seems to feel it is.The main thrust of this book is the psycholgical harm that excessive permissiveness can cause. Dan Lowell allows Timmy to rearrange his stock portfolios which results in bankruptcy; he gives the boy an office and a salary. The only sensible adults in the Lowell household are Eric and Hulda, the housekeeping couple.Since Timmy cannot return to the public school and Stollery recommended a special program, Evie and Timmy drive around the country visiting different schools. The schools range from state institutions to unsupervised lairs, such as the school in Rhode Island. None will take him, save for the Rhode Island school. Horrified at the permissiveness and excessive license granted to minors, Evie turns the Rhode Island School's offer down. Their odyssey continues throughout the book.This book is written in a surreal tone - the few interludes in the Lowell house after a long trip; Timmy's piano playing which is reflective of his level of internal control; Evie's illness in New Mexico after visiting a state institution and Timmy driving them home to California; their continued quest to find a school; a side trip to Alabama to discover Dan's sick roots and history and...origins of his twisted pathology.Evie's offer to take Timmy and two of his friends to a ball game is thwarted by Dan, who insists the boy remain home to sort out his coin collection. That ends in an ugly confrontation with them hurling furniture at each other from a roof. Timmy decompensates further and pretends to be 3 and displays regressive behavior.From infantile behavior to mature sexual predator, Timmy makes unwelcome sexual advances and sexual comments to Evie during each one of their cross country trips. It was sick and sickening to read this; the boy's mind was so warped and the pathology so thick it makes one queasy.Towards the end of the book, Dan Lowell re-emerges in Evie and Timmy's lives. By that point, Redwood Grove school in New York has agreed to admit Timmy, but he will be on a waiting list for several months. Dan does some strange things, such as lashing out at Timmy a propos of nothing; the boy is medicated which also does not seem to be a helpful move either.Dan was a repulsive character and one cannot help wondering what on earth Evie ever saw in him. His twisted behavior has hurt the family tremendously; why on earth she left the twins with him makes one wonder.Still, readers are left wondering how much of this twisted, demented tale is true. Justice Polier, a New York Family Court Judge who was often quoted in articles in the late 1970s is mentioned. Since she is a real person and the book closed on a \\"sociological\\" note by the author, one wonders if this is an entirely fictionalized account. One can only hope that it is."},{"Title":"Covenant and Polity in Biblical Israel: Biblical Foundations and Jewish Expressions (Covenant Tradition in Politics, Volume 1)","review":"A. The Covenant Idea in the Bible and Politics1. IntroductionIn this well-researched and engaging volume, Daniel J. Elazar, in describing the biblical tradition of covenant, examines the covenantal foundations of Jewish political life, the revival of these foundations in Reformed Protestant Christianity, and the ways that the American polity was founded on this tradition in its \\"Puritan expression and in its secularized Lockean form\\" (p. xiii). He defines the covenant as a \\"morally informed agreement or pact based upon voluntary consent, established by mutual oaths or promises, involving or witnessed by some transcendent higher authority, between peoples or parties having independent status, equal in connection with the purposes of the pact, that provides for joint action or obligation to achieve defined ends ... under conditions of mutual respect, which protect the individual integrities of all the parties to it\\" (p. 23). A biblical covenant (\\"brit\\") \\"involves a pledge of loyalty beyond that demanded for mutual advantage, actually involving the development of community among the partners to it\\" (p. 64).Elazar distinguishes covenants and compacts, which are public in nature, from contracts, which are private. While the former are designed to be perpetual in nature, the latter frequently include terms for abrogation by the parties. A covenant is not like a private legal partnership where each partner has limited obligations to the others; rather it is like \\"the most comprehensive kind of public law partnership\\" (p. 69), with extensive mutual obligations.2. The Bible as a Political Book; the Protestant ReformationThe Bible is an \\"eminently political book\\" (p. 60). However, it has not successfully inspired many political orders. After the abortive revolts against Rome in the first centuries of the common era, Jewish concern with political matters declined. Christians of the early Church were similarly reluctant in applying biblical principles to the political order; they were instead concerned with individual salvation and were expecting an imminent second coming of Christ.However, as the centuries passed by, the Bible and biblical ideas of covenant would ultimately find expression in the Protestant Reformation. Christians would rediscover biblical insights on politics and civic order. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, \\"the Swiss, the Dutch, the Scots, and the English Puritans not only conceived of civil society in [biblical] covenantal terms, but actually wrote national covenants to which loyal members of the body politic subscribed. Similar covenants were used in the founding of many of the original colonies in British North America\\" (p. 20). Reformed Protestantism wholeheartedly embraced the covenant concept (p. 26). Based on the idea of sacred covenant, reformed Protestants came to believe that once God establishes a covenant, no human authority can abridge the rights established therein without the consent of the governed.Especially in Switzerland, a federal theology was articulated (the Latin foedus means \\"covenant\\"). American constitutionalism merged the concept of covenant with the secularized idea of compact (p. 28).3. Three Models of Political SocietyElazar describes three systems that have shaped substantial segments of the human race: (i) the covenantal, which tends to be federal; (ii) the conquest based, which tends to be hierarchical and developed through conquest; and (iii) the classical Greek organic system, which tends to be oligarchic and involves \\"the development of political life from families, tribes, and villages into large polities\\" (p. 36). The American system, based on the political ideas of the Protestant Puritans, is predominantly covenantal, and thus lends itself well to democracy.B. The Torah as Ancient Israel's ConstitutionThe book of Genesis institutes the first covenants between God and man. Elazar calls the Genesis 2 relationship between God and Adam \\"asymmetrical\\" and \\"segmented\\" (p. 113); the covenant is hence \\"implicit\\" (p. 212). Aimless violence follows Adam's disobedience and leads God to the first true covenant between God and man that recognizes man's ability to choose and grants him a formal role in the choosing (p. 113). God thus destroys all life on earth, with the exception of the inhabitants of Noah's ark. The covenant with Abraham is formed in Genesis 15 and 17 and is renewed with Jacob. In Exodus, God establishes a covenant at Sinai, which is reiterated in Leviticus 26. In Numbers 18, God establishes a covenant with Aaron and His House and a covenant in Plains of Moab is established in Deuteronomy 28-30.While Genesis establishes the first covenants between God and man and the setting for the emergence of Israel and of its constitution, Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers \\"constitute the second part based on the exodus from Egypt\\" (p. 211). In Exodus, the Decalogue is given in the form of two tablets and the Book of Covenant, which enumerates a series of civil and criminal laws, is described (Exo 20-23). In Leviticus, laws and priestly functions and rituals are enumerated. Numbers continues the constitutional corpus and is an indivisible part of the original constitution (p. 184). It discusses the national census by tribes, the divisions of the tribe of Levi and their responsibilities, operational rules for managing the camp, provisions for sacrificial offerings, adjudication of vows, and an allocation for the Levites, among other matters.Finally, in Deuteronomy, Moses summarizes the history of Israel and puts down all of the laws and revelations he had received in a final form so that they would be memorialized. The book, which ends with the death of Moses, is a \\"restatement of the entire constitution in a more systematic fashion\\" (p. 193). The repetition of these laws is especially important to an \\"oral tradition where repetition is critical to developing recognition if not memorization of texts\\" (p. 200). While the previous four books served as a constitution for the Jews as a nomadic people, Deuteronomy serves as a constitution that only deals with those laws as applicable to the Jews while living in their land.C. A Biblical Republic?1. JoshuaThe book of Joshua \\"describes the classic polity envisaged in the Torah,\\" with the Eved Adonai responsible for the civil rule of the edah (congregational assembly) and the Kohen Gadol responsible for linking the people to God. In Elazar's view, it is \\"a classic of political thoughts,\\" \\"a major statement of the class political worldview of the Bible and the regime it advocated,\\" and \\"the first classic exposition of federal republicanism\\" (p. 229). The book is divided in an account of the conquests (chaps. 1-12), the division of the land (chaps. 12-21), and Joshua's farewell addresses (chaps. 22-24) (p. 232.). The book explains why the Jews lost or won specific battles and contains instructions to the Jews as to how they should fight. For example, in the case of Jericho, the people were to withhold the desire to loot and personally profit (p. 248). Joshua warns the Jews that they keep God's commandments and, in his words of closing, he warns the people of the consequences that will befall them if they depart from the covenant (Jos 23:14.16).The book likely emerged during the struggle of Israel against the better armed Philistines. Joshua sought to restore Israel's constitution to its original form in order to reform the confederacy's constitution and better prepare for battle.2. JudgesThe book of Judges was written after the conquest of Canaan in the book of Joshua and before they had a king. Judges contains stories that traces Israel's forsaking of God and His consequent forsaking of Israel. The following cycle repeats throughout the book: (i) the people of Israel begin to worship the foreign gods of the Canaanites that were still living among them; (ii) as judgment for the Jews' following after these foreign gods, God allows the Jews to be conquered by the Canaanites, thus becoming their slaves; (iii) the people of Israel remember God and cry out to Him; and (iv) God raises up a judge (meaning \\"ruler\\"), from among them (usually a military leader) who fears God and who helps them conquer their slave masters. Having experienced deliverance from slavery, the Jews live in freedom for a while until they forget God and start to worship false gods once again, thus repeating the cycle.The book as a whole traces and describes a decline in republican civic virtue. The cycle of backsliding, repentance, and deliverance foresees the redemption of all who repent and turn to Jesus Christ for forgiveness.D. A Biblical Constitutional Monarchy?1. General OverviewIn Part IV, Elazar deals with the alternate monarchical model of biblical Israel. In the book of Judges, \\"monarchy is rejected as a form of government consistent with God's covenant\\" (p. 323). Nevertheless, Saul is made king (p. 330 ff.). Saul's kingship is followed by great tumult as he persecutes David, causing him to go into hiding. In 1 Samuel 21-23, David flees from Saul and hides in the desert. After Saul pursues him, an opportunity arises for David to kill him, but he refuses to do so, for Saul \\"is the anointed of the Lord\\" (1Sa 24:7). In this way, David remains faithful to his lord.The battle with the Amalekites brings about the death of Saul (1Sa 30). When the news reaches him, David weeps and fasts. David is then anointed by the elders of Judah as their king (2Sa 2:4). Meanwhile, the son of Saul, Ishbosheth, is made king of Israel, and war between Israel and Judah follow. David ultimately wins the war (2Sa 4) and becomes king over all Israel (2Sa 5).2. Government and Covenant in Ancient IsraelUntil this point, we have seen God's implicit covenant with Adam, and his explicit covenants with Noah, Abraham, and Moses, and the renewal of the Mosaic covenant under Joshua. In the books of Samuel, God establishes yet another covenant. He says to David: \\"when your days are fulfilled and you rest with your fathers, I will set up your seed after you, who will come from your body, and I will establish his kingdom. He shall build a house for My name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever\\" (2Sa 7:12-13). From this \\"everlasting covenant\\" (2Sa 23:1-5) comes David's descendent, the Messiah Jesus Christ.The covenantal governmental framework established by the Israeli Scriptures pursues \\"a limited but active role in the affairs of society, a role whose level depended upon the needs of the time\\" (p. 353). It is unclear if from the biblical record the public sphere played a role in education and social services (p. 353). Those principles that animated ancient Israel were theocracy, federalism, and republicanism (p. 354).3. David as a Precursor to the ChristIn the life of David, we find a window pointing to the Gospel. David's entire life is marked by war and the death of his loved ones, from his \\"lord\\" King Saul, to his friend Jonathan, to his first son through Bathsheba and ultimately, the death of his rebellious son Absalom. David experiences firsthand the horrors of sin that have polluted the broken world.Yet at the same time, David represents a man after God's heart. He is quick to repent of his sins (2Sa 12:13), and his own words at the death of his rebellious and treacherous son Absalom reflect God's own love towards his sinful and rebellious children: \\"O my son Absalom--my son, my son Absalom--if only I had died in your place!\\" (2Sa 18:33). We thus find in David's life the mar of sin of even one who is \\"after the heart of God.\\" His lamentation for his son reminds us of the love of God for all of his children. He would rather take death upon himself than allow that even his rebellious children might perish.E. ConclusionI would recommend this book to anyone interested in exploring the idea of covenant in the Bible and how this idea was carried over into America at its founding. In an age where the idea of covenant is being replaced by loose contracts based not on a transcendental view as to the universal good of all of the parties involved, but on the atomistic self-interest of each party divorced from the good of all others and from the good of the community as a whole, this milestone volume is crucial reading."},{"Title":"Covenant and Polity in Biblical Israel: Biblical Foundations and Jewish Expressions (Covenant Tradition in Politics, Volume 1)","review":"Daniel J.

However, it is not to be considered, at least in my opinion, a beginner book. It does not give definitions or any background, or basic tenants of Wicca or anything that teaches the religion per-se. For example, the beginner reading at one point may go &quot;Watchtowers?!? What is that and how do I do it?&quot; An explanation is not included that I could see. And interestingly, there is also no bibliography or any references or appendices, something that I think every book on Wicca or Witchcraft should have for further study, to outline the sources used to write the book and give it credibility. Not that Ms. Telesco needs any here - I have many of her books and love them all, but it seemed odd to me that there was nothing, the book just starts and ends abruptly, period. However, aside from that I think my overall opinion is that it is really a great book for someone further down their Path, it's very uplifting and spiritual; wonderful and refreshing as we go into the next millenium continuing on our spiritual journey to keep spirituality and our Pagan religions alive in our lives and in this busy ever-changing world. It contains many, many good rituals, meditations, invocations, prayers and more for multiple situations such as for the earth, for yourself, for growth, etc. There are even children's prayers and meditations, something that I don't usually see in a book of this genre. I have to say that it is less about Wicca (since it is only referenced in passing, as in &quot;as Wiccans, we feel...&quot;) and more about our spiritual growth and aspirations as Pagans as we prepare ourselves to move ahead and grow on the fast track to (and in) the year 2000 while trying to remain true to the Old Ways and the magick in everyday life. Would make a excellent supplemental to a more experienced Wiccan or Witch's library and is well rounded and pleasant to read."},{"Title":"Wicca 2000: Invocations, Prayers, and Rituals for the Magickal Millennium","review":"This book is definitely one of the easiest to understand.. Though it lacks history of what Wicca is and what it stands for.. it truly is a MUST READ for any Witch. Newbies to the craft may be left with some small questions.. so it would be wise if you know nothing about the craft, to have a dictionary near by.. there are wonderful &quot;kitchen witch&quot;(modern witch) spells, simple invocations, and a lot of easy to understand reading material.. the down side of this book though.. is that most of it seems to take on a view of a &quot;white-light&quot; witch's perspective.. it is IMPORTANT that people realize that all magic is equal.. and ALL spells have a consequence.. the 3x's law still applies.. This book is easy to read, easy to understand, and extremely helpful.. I have been a solitary witch for many years, and have found that this book is also better used as a Solitary Practitioner's Guide &amp; Reference.. Coveners are not discuraged but I think most would agree that the spells suit a solitary witch rather than a coven or a group.. though I am sure you could write your own spells from the ideas given here..(The ice-cube spell is as simple as it is effective) Always remember to Thank the God &amp; Goddess after a ritual..

Aside from the Gaia prayers, the second most interesting part is \\"Future Visions, Ancient Quests\\", a chapter on divination. It includes omens, scrying, lot casting, dice casting, playing cards, and divination ideas for children.

William Vantuono (Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press, 1999). xl + 320 pp. ISBN 0-268-01767-0. $17.00.Medieval manuscripts written in Middle English pose a problem to translators who must strive to keep translations true to their original meaning for scholarly audiences yet keep them simple enough for the casual reader to understand as well. Vantuono managed this balance quite well in his edition of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. With the original Middle English text on one page and the translated modern text on the facing page, Vantuono allows the academic reader to easily compare the translation to the original. A quick glance from the translation to the original shows that Vantuono has indeed tried to keep the translation as close to the original text as possible. Footnotes at the bottom of the page also give literal translations and original meanings on individual words or phrases from the original, making it still easier to comprehend the Middle English text. However, the modern translated text is also extremely easy to understand, and the Middle English-modern English arrangement does not create a problem for a modern reading of the text, making Sir Gawain and the Green Knight user-friendly for the general public.The somewhat lengthy introduction at the beginning covers a variety of topics ranging from the manuscript itself along with the three preceding manuscripts presumed to have been written by the same author, a discussion of Gawain poet, the structure of the text, and the various themes that appear in the text.Although a bit too scholarly for the average reader at times, the introduction does bring up interesting points and examines opposing points of view concerning the text brought up by a number of distinguished scholars. Extensive notes at the end of the book, a thorough bibliography, as well as notes on the language, dialects, and source of textual details makes this edition a good choice for an academic study of the text. The edition includes black and white copies of the four original illustrations from the manuscript as well as a copy of the first twenty-six lines of the original text.While overall geared more towards a scholarly audience, this edition is still easily comprehensible to the average reader, allowing a wider audience and greater access to the text."},{"Title":"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight","review":"I loved reading this title the second time around.

The book is larger than a regular hardcover, I would call it an oversized book. This 2008 Calla deluxe edition is an unabridged republication of the edition originally published by George H. Doran Company, New York, in 1920. The paper is of heavy stock, one can literally feel the heft of each page! The color of the paper is a vanilla hue, and it is bound in Kennett Cloth & Rainbow, with a black cover and the side binding is cloth (dark brown). The font is large and pleasing to the eye (it doesn't mention what type of font style is used), and apart from decorative elements and black and white illustrations peppered throughout, the highlight of this book is the 25 color plates, containing illustrations by Kay Nielsen, a Danish artist whose style is part of \\"the golden age of illustration\\". These color plates appear glossy in this book, and one can literally feel the silky smooth texture of the illustrations!

I would love to see it back in print, as it is a wonderful addition to any book collection."},{"Title":"East of the sun and west of the moon: Old tales from the North","review":"This is a very enjoyable book. Stories from every part of the world tend to reflect the land from which they come and the people who live there, and Scandanavia is no exception. These tales are filled with white bears, lonely forests, icy wastes and wicked, often multi-headed, trolls. Many stories are deeply, beautfully Christian in tone. Old Europe, North, South, East or West, was a devout place. They have a quality all their own and are an enjoyable read for both the young and the old. The only quibble is that a number of the stories are apparently variants of one another, and so feel rather similar: sipping potions to wield great swords to fight trolls-first three headed, then six, then nine headed, seems to have been a popular motif in those days. Many folk tales are likewise (foolish younger sons named Jack, etc.), so I don't think this is a big issue, but it might bother some.The illustrations by Nielson are excellent, and are very evocative of the world they are meant to depict. Illustration is a very personal thing; one man's feast is another's famine, and you might check the style of the artist before you buy, if you are not familiar with his style. The Wikipedia article on him has some nice examples of his work. While I don't find his work as appealing as, say, a Rackham or a Dulac, and in the world of Northern tales John Bauer's Swedish Folktales is better, there is still much to enjoy here. Nielson's work has an art-deco quality that is very nice. Some of the illustrations are just beautiful.It is difficult to find modern editions that reproduce Golden Age illustrations well. This Calla edition does quite a good job, though a few of the paintings seem faintly blurry. The Calla edition of Hans Anderson's tales turned out slightly better. The book is beautifully bound, with excellent quality paper. Some pages of print are faded looking, which is a shame.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in good storytelling of the old North of Europe. Calla should be thanked for making it available to us!"},{"Title":"East of the sun and west of the moon: Old tales from the North","review":"I LOVED THIS BOOK AS A CHILD AND WOULD LOVE TO SEE IT REPRINTED IN A LUXURY EDITION.

The illustrations are beautiful, bright and very well printed. I'd say this book is worth buying for their sake alone. The stories will take you far away and back in time to \\"The Old Norse\\", the land of giants and trolls and princes under a curse waiting to be saved, told in a lovely and a bit archaic English that I found to be absolutely charming.It was a joy to read and I look forward to the day my kids are old enough to enjoy it with meOn a more prosaic matter - the cost:I hold a hardcover 1986 Omega edition of the book, and it is sold by some used book dealers at a very reasonable price. By reasonable I mean I don't think paying over 25$ is a good idea.No need to go all crazy with the spending unless you're looking for a first edition, and that, naturally , is going to cost you.But If , like i did, you're just looking to enjoy the stories and the illustration this is a great edition.As a last resort- if you can't find a used book in a sane price, I recommendNielsen's Fairy Tale Illustrations in Full Colorsince the reproduction are very beautiful and high quolity.There is a NEW edition of the bookEast of the Sun and West of the Moon: Old Tales from the North (Calla Editions)but i have read bad reviews about the quolity of the art reproduction and binding of it, i guess you'll have to read the reviews and decide for yourself.I have to say that buying a used book has it's own appeal to me since i feel that not only i have saved a tree, I have a little peace of history.

(See my review of the version by an unknown author followed by my review of the de Beaumont account.) It was first published in English in 1849. Unlike the well-known de Beaumont version (see my review of it), the beautiful daughter's father in this tale is poor. He has many children and is unable to feed them all. A white bear comes and promises to give him rice if he would give him his youngest daughter to him as a wife. Unlike the de Beaumont tale, the father agrees and does all he can to persuade her to accompany the bear. She finally agrees and leaves with the bear. It gives her all she wants. When she goes to sleep at night, the bear comes to her in the dark and leaves before daylight. Since it is dark, she never sees him in bed. She misses her family and asks the bear if she can go home for a visit. It agrees. But it warns her not to be alone with her mother because she will give her advice that will destroy their relationship.As we can expect, she spoke to her mother, told her of the night-time visits and that she hasn't seen the bear in bed. Her mother suggests that she take a candle to bed and when he is asleep, light a candle and look at him, \\"just don't drop any tallow on him.\\" She does as her mother suggest, lights the candle, sees that she is sleeping with a handsome prince, leans over to kiss him, and tallow from the candle falls on his shirt. He wakes and tells her that she has ruined everything. He reveals that his wicked stepmother has a daughter she wants him to wed. She turned him into a bear. Now that she saw him as a prince, he needs to marry the stepmother's ugly daughter. He disappears. The rest of the tale tells how she goes in search for him and her adventures with three old women, four winds, and how she outwits the stepmother because of the three tallow stains.It is possible that this version is, among other things, addressing the problem that some young wives have with sex, seeing it at first as being bound with a beast, getting advice from mothers that is not sufficient, misunderstood, or simply wrong, coming to enjoy sex, which opens a new relationship requiring some struggle."},{"Title":"East of the sun and west of the moon: Old tales from the North","review":"Very pleased with this book.

The Ojibwe people camp by the French fur-trading fort on the island every summer. Suzette's mother is an Ojibwe woman. Her father is a Frenchman who works for the French fur-trading company. Ordinarily, Suzette's father would have to spend each winter in faraway Montreal, but this year there is a competition among the trappers. If Suzette's father wins, he will be able to pay off his company contract and stay with his Ojibwe family year-round. Then things get complicated. First, someone sabotages the canoe carrying Suzette and her family to the island. Her father almost losses some furs. Suzette almost drowns. Next, the competition is halted when a bale of furs is stolen from the fort. Evidence begins to point to Suzette's father as the thief. Can Suzette figure out who the real culprit is and save her father from exile? Can you figure out what's going on before Suzette?My daughter didn't like this &quot;History Mystery&quot; as well as the others we have read. I think she might have been put off by the fur-trading aspect of it. The idea of men competing to see who can get the most animal skins didn't sit very well with her. On the other hand, that was a fact of life in those days. We can't ignore the past just because some aspects of it conflict with our modern sensibilities. I thought this was one of the more engaging mysteries in the series. Suzette comes across as a bit more aggressive than a girl in her circumstances might be allowed to be, but she is brave and she comes through when the chips are down. This is a good book for young readers, with all the positive aspects I've cited in my reviews of other entries in this series. I recommend it highly to kids and their parents."},{"Title":"Trouble at Fort La Pointe (American Girl History Mysteries)","review":"The year is 1732. Twelve-year-old Suzette is a part of two worlds - her father is a French fur trapper and her mother an Ojibwe Indian. Every winter her father has to leave the family's home on Lake Superior and journey to far-off Montreal. However, if he can come up with enough money to pay off his contract, he will be allowed to remain with his family year-round. To that end, he has entered himself in a fur trapping competition; whoever traps the most pelts wins. Suzette is positive her father will win. Until the competition is sabotaged and some of the pelts stolen. What's worse, Suzette's father is the chief suspect. If Suzette doesn't find proof of her father's innocence by catching the real chief, he will be banished into the wilderness, along with his family. So with the help of her friend Gabrielle, and using her knowledge of both French and Ojibwe ways, she determines to find the real culprit.

Charlotte Zolotow's classic is a sad but sweet tale of a shy, preschool-aged boy's move into a new neighborhood-a neighborhood where he's afraid no one will like him.Zolotow's story is more to the point today when so many families are on the move, than when it was first published in 1963. Today's children seldom grow up in the neighborhoods where they were born. Today's children often find themselves in Thomas's situation--trying to fit in, trying to find acceptance in their new, unfamiliar worlds. And the shy ones feel Thomas's pain. They too, are afraid no one will like them.Bluthenthal opens the book with a 2-page spread showing a forlorn Thomas sitting on the moving van's ramp. Chin in hand, Thomas sadly stares at his sneakers while his little goldfish stares up at him. The tag marked \\"fragile\\" seems to describe Thomas, not just the fishbowl for his best buddy in the world.When you read A Tiger Called Thomas to the little ones at Story Time, you can see some of the kids nodding their heads in agreement with Thomas's refrains of, \\"Maybe she wouldn't like me...\\" or, \\"They might not like me...\\" or, \\"I don't think he'd like me.\\" You get the feeling that those youngsters know what it's like to walk in Thomas's sneakers--and that they themselves haven't discovered yet what Thomas himself discovers by the end of his Trick or Treat night.As you continue reading though, you'll see the smiles that light their small, shy faces as you reach the end of the story, when they, as well as Thomas, discover that their loneliness can easily be banished. It's a wonderful feeling for you as well as for them.This book isn't just for the little ones at your library, nursery school, or day care. If you have your own Thomas or Thomasina, it's a wonderfully non-threatening way to approach your youngster's shyness. (You might also be interested in getting a copy of Bernardo J. Carducci's new book, The Shyness Breakthrough: A No-Stress Plan to Help Your Shy Child Warm Up, Open Up, and Join the Fun.)I have to admit I'm a dyed-in-the-wool fan of Diana Cain Bluthenthal. I'm firmly convinced that ANY book written or illustrated by her is a delight to read. She has a gentleness, a kindness, a playfulness of spirit that always shows. Her books bring smiles of pleasure to those who read, or listen to, them. A Tiger Called Thomas is no different.Don't save this book just for Halloween. Whip it out whenever you see kids in need of its gentle story--a story that may give them the courage to overcome their shyness. Read it to them with a smile and a hug. You'll all be glad you did.And don't forget to grab Meaner Than Meanest--a funny Halloween story by Kevin Somers & Diana Cain Bluthenthal."},{"Title":"A Tiger Called Thomas","review":"Yes, I thought this book was OK but my five-year-old really liked it and asked me to read it over and over again.

The other is to be a text for a science course for college undergraduates (in most cases, underclassmen majoring in something other than science).The book begins by discussing how stars and planets are formed. And then comes a major point: biology may be common in the universe given evidence that organic molecules form fairly easily, life appears to have originated early in the Earth's history, and there's evidence that Earth life can survive under a wide range of conditions.Next, there's a section on the nature of science and the scientific method. And then some material on the definition and nature of life. From there we go to the Earth's geological record. And there's a useful discussion of greenhouse gases, possible high surface temperatures on Earth when life first developed, and a possible \\"Snowball Earth\\" much later.Now comes a key chapter: how did life get started? And when. The text shows that it was not all that long after the Earth emerged from forming and being heavily bombarded. And that hyperthermophiles may well have been the common ancestor of life on Earth today. The book speculates that the process was: synthesis of organic precursor molecules, development of replicators (RNA), development of protocells (enclosing membranes), primitive cells (the RNA world), and then DNA-based cells. It also addresses the question of whether life could have migrated to Earth from Mars or elsewhere. There's a discussion of the rise of oxygen in the atmosphere. And how primitive life evolved into the intelligent life that now exists.These are certainly the right topics to start with. But I wish this book, even with the constraint of being for non-science majors, had gone into just a little more detail on all of them. It does just that on the rest of the topics.The book continues with an excellent section about possibilities of life elsewhere in our planetary system, including the environmental requirements. We look at Mars (including evidence from Martian meteorites), Jovian moons, and Titan. And we see why Venus is too close to the Sun to be in the \\"habitable zone.\\"After that, there is a discussion of extrasolar planets and the serach for extraterrestrial intelligence. If anything, there is an excess of material here, including speculations about the possible technology levels of an intelligent society and interstellar travel. But this does lead to a worthwhile discussion of the Fermi paradox: if there are relatively nearby extraterrestrials, why aren't they here by now?Writing an overview of this field for non-science majors is a daunting task, and I think the authors did a really good job. After reading such a book, I think one will find it much easier to understand any advances made in this field in the future."},{"Title":"Life in the Universe","review":"This book seems to have two goals.

The exercises definitely work and will have an effect on you, in a variety of manners. I do urge readers not to take these exercises too lightly...practice them diligently, but be open to what experiences occur, as you will find yourself examining a lot of the emotional and mental triggers that are embedded in the fluid stream of your consciousness.If nothing else, consider that this book provides a different way of understanding how you breath and that such perspective can be very enlightening...For the occultist this is a must have book!

This is a republish of the reader's edition, which was originally published in 1998 by Clarity Press.Subjects covered by this instructive book include:A comparison of Fire and Water schools of Taoism.Breathing techniques, from the beginner to advancedThe Eight Bodies of Being and their relationship to one's self and spiritualityThe Sixteen-Part nei gung systemThe primary and secondary energy channels of the bodyThe inner dissolving practiceEncountering and working with the mindstreamHow to sit comfortably and correct your own posture internallyIt teaches the all-important who, what, how, where and why in terms of how meditation works, how to identify internal blocks, where you apply your intent, how to determine whether or not what you are doing is actually working, what to do with problems you may encounter, how to make the most of your practice time, and much much more.This book, along with it's companionThe Great Stillness: The Water Method of Taoist Meditation Series, Vol. 2were invaluable to me during my twenties in dealing with my mental health problems. Prior to starting Taoist Water Method meditation in 1996, I suffered from recurring suicidal depression, severe anxiety and post traumatic stress disorder resulting from growing up and being repeatedly traumatized and abused both at home and at school, and later in institutions. By the time I was an adult, I was pretty messed up and not very happy.Psychotherapy and counseling had little effect on me, and psychiatric drugs made my life even worse and didn't help me in any meaningful way. I did not come from a privileged family, so I did not have any kind of support network, or health insurance. As someone with severe and treatment-resistant mental illness, the outcome of my life did not look good. In the midst of all this suffering, I found Bruce Frantzis' meditation work.Within the first two years of dedicated practice I found my depression had been cured. Within five years, I had, using the dissolving process and the nei gung system described in \\"Relaxing\\", completely healed myself of the neurological conditioning of PTSD. Gone were the nightmares, flashbacks and triggers that had haunted my life previously. Also gone were manic episodes and racing thoughts and anxiety attacks and I gained an inner confidence and self-esteem that I had previously never known.This work made me stronger, mentally, physically and energetically. I can say that without dissolving the first four Bodies of Being, I'd probably still be suffering to this day. But thanks to the practice of Taoist Water Method meditation, I have not been depressed in fifteen years. While I'm hardly Enlightened, I am very happy with myself and my life, which is something that was missing when I started this. I cannot praise 'Relaxing Into Your Being' enough. The practice of the material within its pages totally changed my life around, and gave me a reason to live."},{"Title":"Relaxing into your being (The water method of Taoist meditation series)","review":"I found &quot;Relaxing Into Your Being&quot; very helpful.

Frantzis elegantly explains some of the more complicated concepts within taoist thought, but where he truly excels is in his presentation of the water method's exercises. He offers a systematic approach that offers you enough thorough information to learn basic meditation skills safely by yourself.As a companion piece to his &quot;Opening the Energy Gates of Your Body,&quot; &quot;Relaxing Into Your Being&quot; also provides a solid (yet safely basic) core of chi gung practices. Frantzis and his water method provide the only chi gung I would ever dare to learn from a book, and it is because of a combination of his explicit instruction and the gentle nature of the water method that this is so.Beware: Frantzis is disparaging towards other systems, and he often shows them in their worst light.

Even though it is explained that a qualified instructor is needed for more advanced work, great introductory techniques are taught (like breathing). This book carrys much more then words with it. It carrys the first hand experience of the first American to master the Taoist arts.

One thing that Frantzis seems to keep repeating is he is one of the few who knows the Water method. In my time spent learning meditation, I can say his methods aren't all that unique. He does clearly lay out his material in a straight forward way so anyone can start to learn this stuff. Definiately the real thing. I just think he could do better because his first two writings are some of the best I've ever seen.

Kenny Hetrick"},{"Title":"Jack Dempsey: The Manassa Mauler.","review":"Having recently read - or, shd I say, re-read - a couple of bios about former boxing great Jack Dempsey (born William Harrison Dempsey in 1895, fought professionally 1914-27, heavywgt champ 1919-26, d. 1983, hgt 6' 1\\", wgt in prime 180 lbs), I found myself disappointed when I recalled that I had long ago lost my copy of Randy Roberts' JACK DEMPSEY: THE MANASSA MAULER (first published in 1979) and rued the fact that I had only \\"breezed\\" thru it, intending to thoroughly (re-)read it later. Well, more than ten (15?) years later, I finally got myself another copy (a used paperback) and, unfortunately, discovered that the book wasn't as good as I had \\"remembered\\".NOT to say that it's a bad bio - just the opposite: it's rather good - but there were some things about it that I had forgotten, the main one being that the author made some unaccountable omissions. For ex, Roberts has little to relate about boxing immortal Harry Greb and simply refers to him in passing six times, which is strange considering that: 1) despite being a middlewgt - albeit likely the greatest 160 lber in boxing history - the \\"Human Windmill\\" was one of the leading light heavywgt (max 175 lbs) and hvywgt contenders thruout Dempsey's championship reign and, indeed, whipped, among others, Billy Miske, \\"KO\\" Bill Brennan, Tommy Gibbons, and Gene Tunney, each of whom Dempsey wd later grant title shots; 2) Greb had been publically calling out the Manassa Mauler since before the latter beat Jess Willard for the title in 1919 (the smaller man wd also needle the champ privately whenever they met); 3) Greb had easily gotten the better of the much taller and heavier champ during two sets of three public sparring sessions in July and Sept, 1920 (pls see Bill Paxton'sThe Fearless Harry Greb: Biography of a Tragic Hero of Boxing); & 4) the \\"Pittsburgh Wildcat\\" was one of the very few boxers to publically assert that Tunney wd beat Dempsey before their 1926 title bout, refusing Dempsey's request to be one of his sparring partners for that match and telling the champ that the \\"Fighting Marine\\" wd beat him.Another of many omissions are the hgt and wgt of Dempsey sparring partners \\"Big\\" Bill Tate and George \\"The Leiperville Shadow\\" Godfrey, both of whom towered over the champ. Perhaps, this oversight isn't all that important, but some readers may have found it interesting that the Manassa Mauler prepared himself for bouts by working with boxers of various strengths and sizes, incl the 6'6\\", 225 lb Tate and the 6'3\\", 240 lb Godfrey, both of whom, incidentally, were African-American (though Dempsey never defended his title against a black man, most of his sparring partners were black, such as the quick middlewgt \\"Panama\\" Joe Gans, light hvy brawler Jamaica Kid, and \\"Battling\\" Jim Johnson, who had drawn with then hvywgt champ Jack Johnson in 1913).On the other hand, there were some instances of Roberts not relating something that is quite pertinent to the story of Jack Dempsey, such as his sole kayo loss - to the then \\"over-the-hill\\" \\"Fireman\\" Jim Flynn - likely being a \\"tank job\\". Aside from the eyewitness accounts of knowledgable boxing fans, the best (circumstantial) evidence are that Flynn never bragged about that feat and that, in the rematch held almost to the day a year later, Dempsey crushed the former Pueblo, Colorado fireman in one round (or was it two?).Needless to say, I wdn't be pointing out these oversights if the aforementioned info had not already been public knowledge before Roberts published this book ('tho, b4 Paxton penned his excellent bio of Greb, it had generally been thought that he and Dempsey had only engaged in one set of sparring sessions held over 3 consecutive days).There are also some factual errors in this book, such as the author's claim that Tunney suggested that an elimination bout be held betw he and longtime contender Harry Wills, a 6' 2 or 3\\", 215 lb African-American, in 1926 to \\"decide which of the two shd meet Dempsey\\" next. I found this statement interesting - and funny - since no one had said so before (at least not in any of the many boxing books and mags that I have read or the tv interviews that I have seen) and since a) the future hvywgt champ had never - and wd never - fight a black opponent and b) the 6' 1/2\\" Tunney's manner of fighting (standing straight up, holding his hands relatively low and firing his stabbing jab straight out from the chest, etc, etc) was best suited - if not designed - for battling opponents who fought out of a crouch &/or were shorter than him, neither of which applied to Wills.Nonetheless, as I stated, this IS a good boxing bio. A history prof at Purdue, Roberts writes in a straightforward manner and provides plenty of info and anecdotes both boxing fans and \\"general\\" bio readers will enjoy. \\"Hardcore\\" boxing fans will especially appreciate the detail with which he imbues his descriptions of Dempsey's fights and the fact that Roberts seems to have a much better grasp of boxing technique (which, of course, helps in relating the action when covering fights) than most boxing biographers and writers. However, while the biographer includes many endnotes/citations, an excellent bibliography, and an index, the Manassa Mauler's (bout by bout) ring record and (body) measurements weren't provided.As for how JACK DEMPSEY: THE MANASSA MAULER stacks up against the two other bios that I mentioned above ... the following presents each book's respective strengths:Jack Cavanaugh'sTunney: Boxing's Brainiest Champ and His Upset of the Great Jack Dempsey(which is also more or less a bio of Dempsey - published 2006):- well-researched with plenty of citations- provides the ring records of both fighters- contains sketches - or even profiles - of many of their contemporaries, incl Greb, Benny Leonard, and \\"Battling\\" Levinsky, plus, of course, a \\"full-scale\\" bio of Tunney- provides descriptions of many of the contemporaries' fights (with opponents other than the subjects)- includes Dempsey's opinion of the great Sam Langford and why he didn't want to fight him- has a detailed index, but the only photos are small ones beside each chapter title pageRoger Kahn'sA Flame of Pure Fire: Jack Dempsey and the Roaring '20s(1999) (pls see my review at http://www.amazon.com/review/R114KFSJCP61C7/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm):- author was friendly with the Manassa Mauler and spoke with him many times (which prob explains why he is the least objective of the 3 biographers)- writes in a \\"breezy\\", entertaining, and easy-to-follow style ('tho he frequently goes off on tangents)- provides many \\"celebrity bio\\"-like anecdotes, incl salacious ones like Dempsey's and US President Warren G Harding's sexual piccadillos- includes Tunney's \\"imagining\\" as to how a hypothetical Dempsey-Joe Louis fight wd have unfolded- has an index and 16 pages of picturesRoberts' JACK DEMPSEY (1979):- well-researched with many citations ('tho, again, with some unaccountable omissions)- author interviewed his subject once- notable fights described in detail- has the most info of the 3 books about Dempsey's early bouts- author is the most knowledgable of the 3 in regard to boxing technique and tactics- has an index and 20 pages of photos (btw, the first picture in the book's photo section - at least in my copy - is the one that led many to suspect that Dempsey was a \\"slacker\\" during WWI - unaccountably, Roberts uses a photo that has been cropped above the Manassa Mauler's ankles, thereby obscuring that he was wearing new patent leather shoes while supposedly working in a shipyard, which is what tipped off people that the photo had been staged! - the same photo, uncropped, appears in Kahn's book)Enjoy"},{"Title":"Jack Dempsey: The Manassa Mauler.","review":"I was born in 1947 so grew up hearing the name Dempsey quit a lot.

What's interesting is the effect Hamilton's assaults had on Jefferson's reputation: by imbuing him with every quality from limitless guile to &quot;great passion,&quot; Hamilton makes Jefferson into a colossus in the public eye. Jefferson was more passive than Hamilton thought. One interesting thing about this book is that you get glimpses of Jefferson's dark side. In one letter to Madison, Jefferson asks Madison to &quot;cut [Hamilton] to pieces in the face of the public.&quot; Ouch.Also, the story of Citizen Genet is pretty funny. Genet thought he could somehow go above the head of the Washington administration and appeal directly to the American people. Genet is quickly recalled by France."},{"Title":"Jefferson and The Ordeal of Liberty Vol. 3","review":"This book is the third volume in Dumas Malone's six volume biography called \\"Jefferson and His Time\\" covering the period in Jefferson's life from the end of his tenure as Secretary of State under George Washington to his contentious election as President in early 1800/1801.In this volume Mr. Malone seems to perfect his intended writing and presentation style resulting in the most consistently written volume yet in the series. The organization of chapters by topics, instead of a chronological narrative, is much more pronounced than in the second volume and each 10 to 20 page chapter usually covers at least two to three years of events (as part of a 500 page volume encompassing a mere eight years of Jefferson's life) with considerable chronological overlap from chapter to chapter. This seems appropriate enough for a scholarly, analysis based, biography but requires the reader's continued focus to reconstruct the correct timeline of events.This volume is, overall, an enjoyable read and at moments gives the reader considerable insight into Jefferson's true character, a tough task for such an elusive subject. I must admit, however, at times Mr. Malone's lenghty analyses make parts of this work tough to traverse and I often wanted to skim ahead to the next topic. This seems to be a byproduct of the topic based chapters, with each chapter being a self contained research article on a particular topic of Jefferson's life. I fully concede that this is entirely appropriate for a biography of this depth and length, but at times I miss the narrative based biography that Mr. Malone began with in the first volume."},{"Title":"Jefferson and The Ordeal of Liberty Vol. 3","review":"This third volume in Dumas Malone's six-volume biography of Jefferson is much like the first two - tedious, hagiographic, and severely diluted by minutiae - only even more so afflicted. Reading this book is, in short, an \\"ordeal\\" in itself with very little reward.JEFFERSON & THE ORDEAL OF LIBERTY covers from the middle of 1792, when Jefferson was still serving as Washington's Secretary of State, up to the eve of his inauguration as president in 1801, detailing the final two years of his secretaryship, his short period of retirement at Monticello and the founding of the Democratic-Republican Party, his service as vice president under Adams, and his victory in the election of 1800. Spanning 525 small-type pages of dull, languid writing, eight-and-a-half years never moved so slowly.With the Federalists ascendant, Jefferson and his republican politics were on the defensive during the entirety of the timeframe encompassed by the book. Consequently, the chronicle is one of ceaseless scheming, conflict, and feuding between Jefferson and his political opponents. Once again, Jefferson and his fellow Democratic-Republicans are singularly portrayed as virtuous and selfless in character and intent (including repeated and annoying hyperbolic references to TJ as a \\"sentinel of freedom\\" and \\"apostle of liberty and light\\"), while the Federalists' motives are universally held to be sinister, self-interested, and borne of an insatiable lust for power. It's almost comical in its two-dimensional outlook.Malone completely blinds himself to Jefferson's faults, most notably his duplicity and frequent hypocrisy, and obstinately refuses to acknowledge the man ever did anything wrong in his public or personal life. Whenever TJ has a bitter falling out with a former friend (and he had many), the other party is always to blame. When his longtime friendship with Adams is fractured early in his tenure as vice president, it's due to Adams' hypersensitivity and irascibility, not the vicious criticism Jefferson was leveling at him behind his back. When Washington, late in life, completely severs contact with Jefferson, it's because, according to Malone, he was an overly-prideful and borderline-senile old man who was led astray by the whisperings of Light Horse Harry Lee, not because Jefferson had publicly mocked him or enlisted his nephew to write to Washington under an assumed name in a clumsy scheme to entice the former president to make embarrassing comments that could be seized upon by Democratic-Republicans for political advantage. (Indeed, in detailing the latter incident, Malone snidely refers to the Federalist clerk who tipped off Washington to the intrigue as a \\"busybody,\\" as if the blame for the affair lies with the informant for not minding his own business rather than with Jefferson's dishonorable conduct.)Malone's own hypocrisy is unavoidably manifest in his approach to his subject: he never misses an opportunity to condemn a Federalist - especially Hamilton - for the very same conduct for which he will invariably excuse Jefferson. When Hamilton, as Secretary of the Treasury, corresponds with a British official, it's done to undercut Jefferson and is something that is near-treasonous; when Jefferson, as Vice President during the Quasi-War, secretly corresponds with French officials, it's done not to subvert President Adams but out of altruism and is of no consequence. Likewise, Malone cannot bring himself to acknowledge that a years-long arrangement in which Jefferson made regular $50 payments to the odious James Callender and received in exchange multiple copies of Callender's newest anti-Federalist pamphlets, which he then promptly distributed to political allies and among the public, constituted sponsorship or patronization of Callender's indefensible slander. Instead, Malone, with no substantiation, stunningly tries to spin it as if Jefferson was really a victim submitting to blackmail. Malone does, however, feign enough outrage to excoriate Hamilton for authoring pseudonymous newspaper essays against his opponents, a practice common among public men of the age, including Jefferson's protege Madison - whom TJ encouraged on more than one occasion to pseudonymously attack Hamilton!Aside from Malone's hero worship, the book is a slow and dry slog. It is not organized well; topics and events are given roughly equal treatment rather than that relative to their importance, resulting in trivialities swallowing up the narrative; very little background or context is given for anything; and the analytic value is nil due to the author's flagrant idolatry of the subject. Its only redeeming quality is its breadth of simple factual detail, but it's not nearly enough to save it from its grave deficiencies and make it an enjoyable or worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Jefferson and The Ordeal of Liberty Vol. 3","review":"Make no mistake about it: this is a book by a Jefferson groupie, adding details to the myth and assuming his motives and those of his allies were pure and correct while those of his opponents were not. Hamilton is the bad guy, Adams is bumbling if good at heart, and Washington is a great man sadly in decline. That being said, in comparison to the second volume, Dumas does occasionally question Jefferson's choices and provides just a bit more illumination on the positions of opponents.The great value of this book is the wealth of detail. Dumas has read, it seems, every primary source. If you know the history, there are many fascinating details. What stands out for me is that Jefferson had only studied Palladio in books and had never visited his buildings in the Veneto when he lived in Europe; this astounded me, given his fascination with architecture. But it also explains why Monticello appears to be such a poor copy of Palladio's work - the way I interpret this is that what Jefferson had in his mind was more important than the actual result. This is a key, I believe, to understanding Jefferson's idealistic approach to politics.It speaks volumes, however, that such details stick in my head rather than the gritty politics of what was going on. At this time, Jefferson emerged as the leader of opposition to the Federalists, particularly while he was serving as Adams' VP. Dumas covers the politics extremely poorly. Indeed, his explanations are so deficient that he fails even to mention many key issues, let alone critically address them. Hamilton's economic program - the establishment of a banking system supported by the Federal Gov. and larger vision of an economic based on trade - is scarecly even mentioned and never explained. Indeed, Jefferson's opposition to it can be interpreted as a parochial attempt to preserve the economic preeminence of the Virginia planters or as a silly romantic vision of yeoman farmers as Roman-like republicans. Moreover, Dumas accepts Jefferson's pronouncements are entirely sincere and genuine in intent, never as political ploys or demagogy. While he may not have been a pure demagogue, any assessment of his career should at least consider the question, as brought up by his political opponents, but Dumas utterly fails to do so. These omissions are so glaring that I could not trust anything the author claimed that I had not already read about elsewhere.The greater failing of the book is that a narrative never develops, but instead is lost in detail and abrupt shifts of subject. It is a lousy reading experience in addition to being uncritical. I do not feel like I got to know the man any better. The book completely fails at interpretation.Not recommended. I can't believe that this won a Pulitzer."},{"Title":"Jefferson and The Ordeal of Liberty Vol. 3","review":"Jefferson and the Ordeal of Liberty written by Dumas Malone is the third installment of six in the life and times of Thomas Jefferson and according to the author the most arduous to write. The time frame of this segment starts where the second volume left off and continues to the election of Thomas Jefferson to his first term as President of the United States, (1792 - 1801).This volume is divided into four seperate sections of Jefferson's life in this series of years, but Jefferson as Secretary of State, has frustrations in Philadelphia and as we see most of them are Hamilton in origin. Begining the first segment we see Jefferson completing his secretaryship of state, the second deals with his early retirement to Monticello, third section deals with the growth of political parties and Jefferson's reluctance to be the head of the opposition to the Federalists, and the fourth segment deals with the basic individual freedoms of the people being seriously imperiled.Even though the author stated than this was a difficult time to write about Thomas Jefferson, it is apparent, through the tone of this book that great care was given to portray Jefferson as he was in life... we even get to glimpse at a dark side of Jefferson as the heated frustration with Hamilton begins its culmination, as Jefferson relies on James Madison to do the &quot;dirty work.&quot;This is a fascinating and controversial time in Jefferson's life and the author tells the story well.

The fact is, I learned a lot while reading these books. The second and third books are my favorites; Malone's 2 books on the Jefferson presidency are way too tedious.The good news about these first three books is that when you finish, you will know more about Jefferson than you ever could have imagined. Malone takes you inside Jefferson's time in Philadelphia during the early stages of the American Revolution, his oft-maligned term as governor of Virginia and up through his battles with Alexander Hamilton as part of Washington's cabinet. But there was much to the Jefferson-Adams relationship late in the 1790s that was dealt with in bits and pieces here. This book begins late in Jefferson's run as Secretary of State and continues through his vice presidency, but Malone spends far too much time talking about Jefferson's crops, trees and scientific endeavors.As much as I've learned about Jefferson here, I'll forget some of the smaller details, and I feel like a more concise one- or two-volume biography could actually give me a better perspective on the major events in his life because they won't be so watered down with less significant details that distract from the key points.

This book is more qualified to be a research paper, not a historical account of Thomas Jefferson. The high level of detail the book provides, in most cases, is overpowering and often times delutes the significance of the important details. Especially excruciating to read was TJ political account. If Dumas Malone would have had additional records of TJ's most insignificant and irrelevant actions during the priod, he would have included it in detail as well. Dumas Malone did quite a poor job of filtering unnecessary details, causing the reader to fequently tune out. The story was drawn out, and focused too little on his personal life in comparison to his political life.Also curious was the mention of TJ's slaves and his attitudes towards them without giving any account to Sallie Hemmings (other than mentioning the Hemmings Family name). Some objectiveness would be refreshing in this series... It appears as if Dumas Malone provides a very one sided account of Thomas Jefferson. Whether certain claims regarding TJ are founded or not, they should still be included in the story. The author should not filter information on the basis of convenience or lack of objectivity."},{"Title":"Jefferson and The Ordeal of Liberty Vol. 3","review":"This book arrive in time and was in perfect condition and packed very well.

The veneration for Jefferson that Dumas Malone puts on paper borders on outright worship. Jefferson seems not to have been a man, but an infallible demi-god.According to Malone, if Jefferson was wrong about something, he didn't really mean it. If he made a mistake, he had good reasons and it was actually someone else's fault. If he lied (which he did A LOT), he did it to protect the integrity of the country and it was completely understandable under the circumstances. I've never read so much double talk in all my life. By the time you get to Jefferson's presidency, it gets pretty tough to gag down the copious amounts of praise that Malone spews from his pen.This is basically a massive kids' book, showing us the guy on the two dollar bill through rose, white, and blue glasses.

This book is the best and wisest on the subject. It illustrates exactly how easy it was for Nazis to use the American psuedo-science of &quot;eugenics&quot; to aclimate Germany to &quot;life unworthy of life.&quot; How simple to use the idea of &quot;mercy death&quot; to rid society of &quot;useless eaters.&quot; The members of T4 were ruthless in their quest to define and rid Nazi Germany of deformed infants, the mentally ill, the deaf, the old, the young, the indigent, the DIFFERENT. No marginalised group was safe.Of the killing centers, Hadamar is the best known -- a hub, so to speak. Nobody really knows how many people were gassed there. The buses arrived like clockwork, on schedule... Day in; day out.Significantly, there was little civilian protest until T4 moved on to private Christian instutions. The &quot;euthenasia&quot; program was halted &quot;officially&quot; after several churches protested the gassings of institutionalised patients. (Unofffically, the program went on until AFTER the end of the war!) The members of T4 were absorbed into the killing machine known as the Final Solution. Which, of course, was the goal all along....I reread The Origins of Nazi Genocide periodically just to remind myself that ANYONE can be marginalised -- including me and thee."},{"Title":"The Origins of Nazi Genocide: From Euthanasia to the Final Solution","review":"Henry Friedlander provides a compelling and accurate portrayal of the origins of the Holocaust in the elimination of the mentally ill and physically handicapped. He starts with a description of the origins of German theories of racial superiority based upon social Darwinism which began long before the Nazis came to power. Many German physicians believed that the handicapped were a burden to society and that one of Medicine's chief functions was to be merciful and weed out the lame and feeble and remove them, painlessly, of course. With the advent of National Socialism and coming to power of Adolf Hitler, these doctors willingly joined in the sterilization and euthanistic practices of the Master Race. Gypsies and Jews were the main groups selected but all handicapped were gathered up. The author describes in detail the frustrations experienced by these teutonic genetic warriors because they could not more efficiently kill and maim and remove the untermeunschen. This book is a nightmare which can happen again. The world still witnesses the open genocide of Central Europe and parts of Africa and Asia. While Hitler's bodily presence has been gone for 55 years, his philosophical dementia remains with us. This book is an excellent reminder of science misused and politicized."},{"Title":"The Origins of Nazi Genocide: From Euthanasia to the Final Solution","review":"As a Deaf person and an activist for the rights of the disabled in education and medical care, I was appalled to find out that the disabled were singled out for sterilization and euthanasia long before the Jews had been. I was even more upset that prior to medical school, I had never even heard of the willing collaboration of doctors and scientists in Germany with the Nazi political machine to rid their race of defective people (it didn't seem to matter when impairment began or how, or these people were educable and able to work). Not to ever dismiss the horror of the Jewish Holocaust and the amount of lives taken, but it is imperative that we remember and we teach that the slope leading to extermination of races began with the ideas of Social Darwinism, natural selection, and survival of the fittest, which were the scientific theories/beliefs used to justify the removal of anyone with a difference. This belief system still pervades society today, when someone like Kervorkian (who only worked with dead bodies) could take it upon himself to decide whether someone's life was of any worth, on the basis of 'normalcy'.Henry Friedlander does an excellent job of writing and researching into the lives and minds of the doctors and administrators who ran the secret programs that killed first, German children who were born with disabilities, then led to the removal from schools and homes of older children with disabilities to meet their deaths through starvation and drugs, and finally to include adults with disabilities in mass murders. It was on these people that the Nazis perfected their instruments of genocide, and yet, even at Nurenburg their suffering was dismissed as &quot;lives unworthy of life&quot; just because of their disabilities.This can happen again, especially with the completion of the human genome. NO laws have been suggested to curtail the use of information gleaned from the genome to prevent discrimination of any kind against the disabled. It is of great concern that the disabled community watch opponents of the Americans with Disabilities Act try to get this civil rights act revoked as being expensive, especially since it serves those who many (including Clint Eastwood apparently) feel are not productive members of society. The slippery slope begins at this point, and with these mindsets.It is imperative that students of medicine and students of science be made to read this book. It is only through education and remembering the children and families whose lives were destroyed that we can avoid allowing this Medical Holocaust from ever happening again.

It was very interesting to track the origins and path of the Nazi genocide program, from the view of the handicapped, Gypsies, and Jews. As a scientist, I feel it is very important to understand what happened so that it can be prevented again. Even chemists like myself were involved in the operation.The problem I have with the book is the way in which it is written. First of all, Friedlander gives far too much information, which ends up detracting from the overall theme of the book. For one person, he will often provide four or five different dates, where they were born, the three or four different jobs they performed before the war even started, and it all is very tedious. Second, much related information is scattered throughout the book. He may have three different chapters discussing essentially the same topic, and he is often very redundant. He will restate minor details over and over again, thereby reducing the impact of the more important information concerning Nazi genocide. Finally, I believe the book would have had much more impact if more true stories and examples were provided. While he does present a fair amount of examples in some chapters, in others there are none. I believe the book would be more profound and emotional if these \\"stories\\" were provided. Even so, I would still recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Origins of Nazi Genocide: From Euthanasia to the Final Solution","review":"A most insightful and highly detailed work concerning man's worst scientificly guided attrocities.

Unfortunately, the book is so thorough that it detracts from the flow. Footnotes or endnotes would significantly help the problem. You will find yourself bored throughout the book because you are constantly hammered with small details. And that is why it gets 3 stars.There is also a very unnecessary, albeit subtle, pro-choice message in the \\"Note On Language\\" section in the beginning of the book (Note: I did *not* deduct a star because of this). Quote:\\"Whatever one's position on either abortion or assisted suicide, comparisons with Nazi killing operations do not illuminate today's discussion. It seems to me, however, that one general lesson can be applied. Government programs launched by the Nazi regime to exclude and kill clearly show that there are private spheres of human life where no state interest is sufficiently compelling to justify intervention. Only the individual directly affected, and possibly his or her closest relatives, should make such intimate decisions. True, individuals might err, but even mistakes by millions of private citizens about their bodies or their lives are far less open to abuse than are judgments legislated by the state imposed by its agents.\\"While reading a book detailing the destruction of, among others, the disabled, I find it really unfortunate that Friedlander felt a need to insert such statements. He implies that government sanctioned killing of the disabled (or others) is wrong, but a private killing on a similar scale is \\"ok\\" because it's confidential and everyday people make mistakes.Despite these problems, the book is an excellent reference guide. A sad, scary chapter in human history. You should at least take the time to skim this book, if nothing else."},{"Title":"El-Hazard Role-Playing Game And Resource Book","review":"It must be fun to write a tabletop RPG book. It must also be fun to watch Anime all day and then write about it later. Now, we get both in the form of a deeply crafted RPG world derived from a relatively shallow (see below) source material. The key demographic is already split down the middle.As you can guess by the cover illustration, this book only covers the first OAV series of El-Hazard. El-Hazard OAV-2, The Alternative World, The Wanderers, and even the Manga are absent from all aspects of this book save for the chapter three title page, which features LD art from Wanderers. Speaking of LD, the beautiful chapter break illustrations are somewhat offset by the book's use of screen-shots lifted from the original Pioneer Laserdisc. As beautiful as LDs are/were, the simple fact of the matter is that 420 lines of resolution does not translate to print as well as it translates to screen. So, those looking for an Art-Book will come up a little short.The book is published by Guardians of Order, who have done a rather thorough job of translating a 7 episode anime series into an RPG book complete with episode summaries, character bios, and a general insight into the El-Hazard Universe delivered with a thoughtfulness bordering on the academic. Why only bordering? In addition to A/V resources, Guardians of Order also mention using an \\"atlas\\" packaged with the LD as well as several magazine articles. Unfortunately, unlike good academics offering a comprehensive guide to the Magnificent World of El-Hazard, they give no citations for the articles. What could have been a great academic resource falls flat on its face. Of course, maybe I am just misinterpreting what they mean by \\"resource book\\" (as in, not the same as a \\"fan guide\\"). Besides, since it only covers OAV-1, it would probably have been a very short bibliography and chances are those articles were not of great scope themselves. So I guess fans will just have to settle for doing their own research and drawing their own conclusions from the source material.RPG fans, on the other hand, will undoubtedly appreciate the depth the game has to offer, as well as the sheer looseness of play. Although the game leaves out characters and situations from other series, the writers insist that new characters may be fabricated on the spot and borrowed characters can be seamlessly integrated into the game (there is even a suggestion for a Tenchi Muyo/El-Hazard cross-over). The rule system is fairly straightforward and there are plenty of setting/situation suggestions for GMs.Final Word: Four out of Five for style, Two out of Five for substance, and One out of Five for scope. Rounding down for academic nitpicking, average is Two out of Five.COMPLETIST APPEAL ONLY.PS--like I said, the audience for this book is more than likely split down the middle. I, personally, am on the side that loves El-Hazard, but is not too crazy about tabletop RPGs. So, if the opposite is true for you (or even if you like both), you may add one or two stars to the final score."},{"Title":"Danny Goodman's Applescript Handbook","review":"I found the first 4 chapters to be clear and very instructive.

Taking place in Paris during the Nazi occupation and just after, this is Genet's most psychologically incestuous book, one in which almost every character is linked to the others by undiscussed or only infrequently acknowledged sexual affairs. Despite the violent emotions the characters feel for one another, when they actually speak, their words are banal, monosyllabic, and thus lacking in complex information; the only extensive dialogues are internal. Genet's philosophy is clearly stated: \\"Speech kills, poisons, mutilates, distorts, dirties.\\"As the book opens, Genet's love-object--a young resistance fighter also named Jean--has just been killed and buried. There are extended early passages about the dejection Genet feels; he states that \\"the book is completely devoted to the cult of a dead person with whom I am living on intimate terms.\\" However, Genet questions whether the 'Jean' to whom the book is dedicated is the dead man or himself, and soon refers to him as \\"my poor Jean-in-the-box\\" and thinks of him as \\"changing into fertilizer.\\" Eventually Jean becomes something of an afterthought, as Genet turns away from the dead towards his lust for the living.The conversational, episodic plot concerns Genet's interactions with the remaining members of Jean's family, as well as with German Erik, former Hitler Youth member and current tank-driver for Hitler, and youthful French traitor Riton, a collaborator with the Reich. Genet presents an awesomely entwined branch of relationships: Genet and the dead Jean; Genet's casual friendship with Jean's brother Paulo, who is both Hitler's and Genet's lover in Genet's fantasies; Giselle, Jean's steadfastly bourgeois mother, is Erik's mistress and keeper regardless of his Nazism; Erik and Riton are physical and emotional lovers; Erik, who clearly gets around, is also the submissive lover of Hitler's massive, unnamed, ax-wielding executioner; unattractive Juliette, Giselle's despised housemaid, is Jean's former fianc&eacute;; and Genet and Erik also become sexual partners in time, and right under Giselle's roof.Genet adds another layer of complexity by having character 'Genet' transform mid-scene into the characters he is describing. Genet briefly becomes Joan of Arc just before she is burned alive, and replaces Erik as the killer when Erik decides to murder an innocent country boy to establish his manhood. Genet also steps into other shoes during the erotic passages, metamorphosing into Hitler (who sends \\"his finest-looking men to death\\" because he can't bugger them all, Genet says) when the Fuhrer orders Paulo aside and rapes him, an act Paulo accepts flatteringly and actively responds to. The narrative also moves frequently backward and forward in time, and at least one murdered character (not Jean) shows up robustly alive after his death.Unlike the later novels, few defensive statements are made about the sexual interaction between the men, who alternately accept male and female lovers without question, as if this were the natural state of things worldwide (though other men seem to be the sexual partner of choice). The tough men of Funeral Rites do not constantly challenge and tease one another about standing, dominance, and submission; instead, they seem to take sexuality in all its manifestations pleasantly in their stride. Erik openly makes love to Riton in front of his soldier comrades, none of which bat an eye; when two grave diggers conspire to rape a maid (Juliette?), they fondle and caress her but also reach for one another's hands under her skirt. ...Funeral Rites is humorously obsessed with scatology and flatulence, using both as none-too-subtle weapons against the despised French middle class. In one hilariously protracted episode, Giselle, tired of waiting on chisel-faced Erik, retires to her room to \\"release her wind,\\" only to find she's let fly with something more than she intended and that impatient lover Erik is entering her small, temporarily unventilated room. In another, a prison chaplain, hurrying to give last rites to 28 falsely-accused boys, finding himself in the outhouse without toilet paper, imprudently decides to use his hand, and is then suddenly confronted by God. Hardly a character in the book escapes breaking wind, wiping themselves, or anxiously wondering about the state of their anal hygiene. Genet tells of finding dried feces lovingly sequestered in the doilied, oaken drawers of the bourgeoisie, and, taking up a favorite motif, has \`Genet' hoping that he still genitally harbors some of dead Jean's crab lice. After having failed to crawl into Erik's sheltering and flower-bearing anal cavity, Genet uses his tongue to pinpoint the lice on Erik's back end which are bloated with his virile blood.In addition, there are scenes of wanton cruelty that may disgust some readers, such as that in which starving Riton kills a cat with a hammer, but most of the material seems sensational and mischievous rather than offensive. ... More restrained and less indulgent that The Thief's Journal, if also less deeply felt, Funeral Rites is an excellent choice for new readers approaching Genet's work. Genet seems oddly more confident and hopeful about himself and mankind here, perhaps as a result of the emotional catharsis (as well as the victory) provided by the war. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Funeral Rites","review":"A fairly large number of The Book Discussion Group met at The LGBT Center in NYC in November to discuss \\"Funeral Rites\\" by Jean Genet. I'm constantly impressed at the smart and thoughtful commentary that the group was able to provide for such a disturbing book.This is Genet's final novel before he moved on to drama. All of us found this to be one of hardest books we've read. While supposedly a loving eulogy of his late lover, Jean D., who was killed on the front lines during World War II, Genet created a meandering and episodic hell for readers. Genet shifts very suddenly from being the narrator to an active character in the story (including the eulogized Jean D., a Nazi soldier, and Jean of Arc).The novel is full of gas and scatology, some of it rather funny. The language waivers between vivid hot sex and raunchy pornography.The characters are generally unlikeable:-- Giselle is the pretentious mother of Jean D, who is being eulogized.-- Eric is a sexy German soldier on the lam, who is Giselle's lover and also has sex with fellow soldiers without any moralizing or restraint.-- Juliette is Jean D's surviving fianc&eacute;, an unattractive orphan beggar who is raped at the funeral of Jean D's and her new-born daughter.-- Paulo is Jean D's brother, who is depicted as having sex with Hitler at one point.-- The Executioner (who also has sex with men) has a thick and beautiful neck but is responsible for cleaning up after Hitler's trysts with young boys. (Yes, this book is full of hallucinatory fantasy.)-- Riton, however, is the most ambiguous and disturbing character. He is a handsome and repulsive soldier, who Genet loves as a French collaborator with the Nazis.As disturbing as all this sounds, there are passages of amazing beauty and poetry. Genet raises important questions about the number French who collaborated with the invading Germans and French policemen who helped round up Jewish citizens. This is a tough read for general readers but offers some rewards once you get past the difficult narrative and characterizations."},{"Title":"Funeral Rites","review":"This is one of Genet's lesser known works and not his best but it has an interesting theme in the second half of the book which follows the life of imaginary Riton a Nazi collaborator in occupied Paris in 1944. Parallel to the account of Riton and his love for a German soldier is the grief of Genet the narrator over the death of French resistance fighter and lover Jean. It is Genet's sympathetic portrayal of Riton and rational explanation that for a young petty thief, a gun and food from the Germans was a better bet than the life of a patriotic resistance fighter which captured my interest. Genet's well documented struggles with authority gives authenticity to this novel as you become aware of the difference of patriotism within a nation and that the poor are less concerned who is ruling their country than those who have something to lose."},{"Title":"Funeral Rites","review":"Though not for the faint of heart (it's by far his most graphic and violent novel), this book has some of Genet's most poetic moments. Serving as both a bittersweet eulogy to Genet's dead lover and as an exploration of his own feelings regarding WWII France, the book's subject matter is explosive, keeping emotions at a fever pitch throughout the whole of the novel. While it lacks the range and coherancy of &quot;The Thief's Journal&quot; (his later novel) and is probably not the best choice if you've never read Genet before (try &quot;Our Lady of the Flowers&quot; or &quot;The Thief's Journal&quot; first), it is nonetheless well worth the read."},{"Title":"Funeral Rites","review":"Jean Genet--orphan, thief, homosexual prostitute, renders his impressions of the occupation and liberation of Paris. His metaphors lead to the comparison of the city to a child who is submissive to rape by the Germans, and afraid of offending them as they perpetrate the act.

Absorbing, informational, without getting bogged down in a biographer's desire to show off with literary flourishes. It needs to be back in print!"},{"Title":"Lawrence Of Arabia - The Man & The Motive","review":"I'm surprised that Anthony Nutting's 1961 biography isn't better-remembered. It may be one of the most influential: Nutting was an adviser on the film Lawrence of Arabia (1962), and his depiction of Lawrence as a tormented sadomasochist undoubtedly influenced David Lean and Robert Bolt's depiction of Lawrence in said movie. Besides this cultural influence, The Man and the Motive is a mixed bag, mixing good storytelling with often-shaky history.Nutting's main virtue is accessibility. He structures his biography like a novel (or a film script), with events clearly laid out for a lay reader. This isn't always to the benefit of the book, with Nutting indulging in speculative dialogue and analysis on occasion. But his prose is crisp and the book flows perfectly, so for pure readibility it comes highly recommended. Of course, for historical works readibility isn't the only consideration.Nutting's portrayal is fairly straightforward and reflects the general debate on Lawrence circa 1961 - eg., the scholarly community still reeling from Richard Aldington's broadside, and trying to recognize it with the traditional Lowell Thomas/Robert Graves portrayal. To Nutting's credit, he avoids either extreme of the contemporary debate, seeking a balanced portrayal of Lawrence rather than deifying or demonizing him. His account of the Arab Revolt is straight out of Seven Pillars with some brief sections on his pre- and post-war life, but this is an issue of presentation rather than originality. His history is generally good, and certainly well-written; it's how he deals with Lawrence that will raise an eyebrow.Nutting portrays Lawrence as an admirable man in many ways, but a tortured, self-contradictory one, who mixes heroism and idealism with vanity and neurosis. Nutting mostly abstains from direct analysis until the final chapter, fittingly entitled \\"The Motive,\\" where he tries to determine \\"What... lay(s) at the root of the Lawrence enigma?\\" (p. 237). So again we have a biographer thinking there's a definite \\"key\\" to Lawrence. And without the psychological training of a John Mack or the documentation of a Knightley and Simpson, Nutting's interpretation is questionable.Nutting rejects some of Aldington's more egregious speculations, namely that Lawrence was a pathological liar or a homosexual. However, he does agree that Lawrence was a \\"rabid masochist\\" (p. 244), and goes a step further in arguing that Deraa is the key to all his subsequent actions - not least the Tafas Massacre. Edward Robinson made a similar argument in his Lawrence the Rebel, but this seems idle speculation at best, misrepresentation at worst. If Seven Pillars is accurate, Lawrence's failures during the Dead Sea Campaign prompted him to try and resign, not Deraa nor even his guilt. As for Tafas, biographers needn't engage in psychological speculation: Lawrence's vivid account of the Turkish atrocities beforehand should suffice for a reason.Nutting's overall depiction of Lawrence is mixed. Much of his account rings true, if overly simplified in spots. His depiction of Lawrence as a \\"Kingmaker\\" (p. 36), though harmed by silly \\"thought\\" dialogue, seems accurate, and for much of the book Nutting draws a good bead on Lawrence's basic motivations: a mixture of genuine idealism and personal ambition. Nutting is also credible in portraying Lawrence's relationships with Feisal, Auda and Allenby. Finally, Nutting commendably points out Lawrence's mutual sympathy for pan-Arabism and Zionism, where many authors (looking at you, Suleiman Mousa) see these beliefs as inherently incompatible.On the other hand, Nutting's depiction of Lawrence's \\"northern ride\\" during the Aqaba campaign as a \\"compulsive act of bravado\\" (p. 75) seems ridiculous. Rather than rebut Lawrence's stated reasons (intelligent plus self-destruction) he claims it \\"unlikely\\" and substitutes his own speculation. Bravo, sir. After Nutting's account of Tafas: \\"If... Lawrence was able to see into his soul... he must have been among the most tortured of God's creatures\\" (p. 163). This may well be the case, but if so he seems not to have any particular guilt over Tafas in particular. This is psychological profiling by someone lacking the qualifications.There's also the minor quibble that Nutting spends two-three pages rebutting Terence Rattigan's depiction of Deraa in his controversial play Ross, which has Lawrence deliberately raped by Hajim Bey to break his spirit. I agree with his conclusions but I wonder what the point is; after all, Ross isn't intended as anything more than fiction.Again, it's very interesting, though probably not coincidental, that Lawrence of Arabia features a similar portrayal of Lawrence after having Nutting as an advisor. Most of its portrayal of Lawrence originates here: the neurosis, the egomania, the masochism. It's all well and good for Jeremy Wilson, say, to blame David Lean and Robert Bolt for perpetrating this vision of Lawrence in their film, but it should be kept in mind that Nutting advanced these theses first.In spite of its flaws, Lawrence of Arabia: The Man and the Motive stands as a decent pre-1969 biography. As a work of ground-breaking scholarship it isn't great, though Nutting is ahead of his time in some of his conclusions. As an entertaining, readable, if occasionally suspect, biography, it's recommended."},{"Title":"Winter Concert","review":"A Winter Concert is a wordless book with simple evocative illustrations that speak for themselves. There are some delightful surprises within the cover.I was not sure that my kindergarten classes would understand the story line; however, the children appreciated the reaction of the mice to the concert as much as I did. I love the way Takao draws the reader into the story begging to be \\"read\\" again. As I reread A Winter Concert, I realized that other art forms produce a similar effect on their admirers. I have given it to a musical family whose mother recently passed away.I believe adults and children will enjoy this one."},{"Title":"Winter Concert","review":"A Winter Concert is wonderful. Visually, it captivates the reader with sweet visions of cute mice, beautiful music, and the emotions that it can stir within each of us. We are able to see through Takao's fantastic illistration how the joy of music can spread from the concert hall to the world. Wonderful for adults and children, this is one I will never grow tired of."},{"Title":"Winter Concert","review":"As an elementary school music teacher, I enjoy showing/reading this book to my younger and older students. The younger students enjoy the message of the book, by using their imaginations...as to what music might really look like floating through the air. My older students enjoy the book as well, as they imagine what messages and languages music truely communicates. I only wish it came in a larger copy. It's such a small book to read/show to a class of students. A larger edition would be wonderful."},{"Title":"Winter Concert","review":"I bought this book because, as a piano teacher, I thought it would be a cute book for my students to read while waiting for their lessons.This book is about the power of music.

I keep it in the waiting room of my music studio for students of all ages to read and reflect on. The world needs the messages in this book!"},{"Title":"Winter Concert","review":"This book show us how the beauty of music can change an individual and his world as he spreads the good news to others. On the Mount of Olives long ago a man taught people how to be happy and content. He told them they were important and that all were loved. When they left their world was never the same. Those that they told about the good news given to them by this man were changed as well. The world took on a new color for them that came in contact with his words. The music and the words in both stories changed the shape of things to come. The world became a different color afterwards and a better place to live in. (Rev.

I like the way the author describes conclusions: looking backwards by summing up what went before and forward by giving advice or suggestions.

THE END"},{"Title":"Housewives Still At Play (Volume 3) (Vol 3)","review":"Adult black & white collection of drawings.This is the third collection of drawings involving housewives. There are exactly 38 well-drawn detailed drawings of women inside the book. The pictures are mostly in the extreme range (involving bondage in one form or another, humiliation, getting caught in action, whipping). The women are mothers and daughters, neighbors, students, teachers, lactating women, pregnant women, brides, and friends. The men are \\"renting\\" their wives, gangbanging a woman, and/or shocked at the action.The action occurs in-doors, outside (numerous, like the picture where the nude pregnant woman is bound outdoors to a street sign), at a store (like the picture of a wife left outside a store, nude, to be rented), and at school (like the student forced to pose nude for her yearbook picture; or the alternative biology lesson). There are some single pictures that suggest that people are trying to force women to get pregnant, and there is an interconnected series of pictures showing a woman being blackmailed that leads to pregnancy.Overall, the collection is interesting, and well-drawn. The collection contains pictures of incest, gangbangs, rape, bondage, exhibitism, and humiliation. Note: some of the collections contain a page that collects the title of the pictures, and this is one of those collections. The page is at the very back of the book and is called the \\"Table of Contents.\\""},{"Title":"Housewives Still At Play (Volume 3) (Vol 3)","review":"Wow, this is probably the best book from this great series great; and that's saying something.

In keeping with the format of the series the commentary features a new translation by the author with textual notes; a section detailing form, structure and setting; commentary by verse; and a final explanation section which seeks to bring together all of the above for each passage. Some consider this format confusing and cumbersome; in my opinion the break down isn't terribly distracting if used well by the author.The present volume has considerable strengths. Dillard has not looked away from the difficult historical issues raised by the text. He demonstrates an impressive familiarity with the relevant history and archeology of the Ancient Near East, the textual history of present text(s) and its interaction with the Deuteronomistic history of the Book of Kings. Difficult passages are consistently dealt with in a remarkably responsible and well balanced manner that respects the integrity of the text while admirably refusing to press unreasonable harmonizations. Dillard's linguistic skills are equally impressive. And while he has incorporated the insights of literary analysis, one gets the sense that perhaps slightly more could have been done in this area.While Dillard's linguistic and historical skills make this commentary highly useful, it is his grasp of the overarching theological themes of Chronicles that gives the commentary it's enduring value. Dillard has clearly thought deeply about the Chronicler and his work. His appreciation of the book's theology gives the commentary an appealing coherence and leaves one with the sense of having grasped the meaning of the whole. Furthermore, Dillard thoughtfully places Chronicles within the broader context of the Christian canon finally finding the hopes of the post-exilic community fulfilled in the kingdom of God inaugurated by Christ.Dillard's prose is well crafted. The bibliographies are helpful even if now slightly dated. The excursuses on the theology of immediate retribution and the Chronicler's presentations of Solomon, Jehoshaphat and Hezekiah are valuable treatments of those subjects. And finally, while the commentary predates the recent controversies regarding minimalist and maximalist approaches to the historical reliability of the Hebrew Bible, Dillard models an instructive reading of the text that respects both the historical and literary/theological dimensions of the text."},{"Title":"Word Biblical Commentary Vol. 15, 2 Chronicles (dillard), 349pp","review":"\\"This commentary makes 2 Chronicles come alive\\" - an apt comment of Tremper Longman III (Old Testament Commentary Survey, third edition). Indeed an outstanding commentary! I would all commentaries of the WBC series on the Old Testament were like this one - \\"a showcase of the best in evangelical critical scholarship\\" (dustjacket).

There were in my view very few supportable ideas here and basically I would suggest you try other books that have been reviewed on Amazon - Stephen Levine - \\"Who Dies\\", Christine Longaker - \\"Facing Death and Finding Hope\\", Dr Rob Buckman - \\"I Don't Know What to Say\\" are all excellent and there are many more. The latter of these three is an excellent book, filled with insights and suggestions.

Enhanced by the realistic artwork (including double-page, full color pictures and several dozen blackline drawings and maps), this 9x12 book would be valuable for the quality of the illustrations alone. The text offers a thorough but no frills march through Roman mythology as author Kerry Usher retells the cluttered tales of the gods of Rome with an uncluttered style. Using Livy's history as the source, this book is excellent at recounting the mythic history of the Roman Kingdom and early Republic. I would argue against the inclusion of &quot;Emperors&quot; in the title. Although Augustus is given 3 pages, only two other emperors (Caligula &amp; Vespasian)are even mentioned. On the other hand, the skillfully done section on Aeneas includes sufficient detail to qualify as &quot;Cliff Note&quot; material. The final chapter, &quot;Tales of transformation,&quot; is the rare English source for some of the lesser-known myths in Ovid's &quot;Metamorphoses.&quot; Kerry accomplishes a Herculean task with the gods, the kings, and one emperor, and Sibbick's illustrations are among the best I've found."},{"Title":"Heroes, Gods & Emperors from Roman Mythology","review":"If you've ever had trouble imagining what Romulus and Remus orHades looks like, this book is for you! .

About half of the content is VERY good. The other half seemed almost trivial and shouldn't have been included, or if it were, should have had far greater depth and specificity. Overall though, the value of the good stuff, FAR outweighs the fluff and makes this book a very valuable resource. If this book doesn't save you at least one call to PSS, I'd be very surprised.PROSeveral chapters stood out for both the excellent content and clear writing. Andy Goodman's Advanced Setup and Deployment, Michael Klein's explanation of Exchange Server 2003, Wayne Small's RWW coverage, Alan Shrater's coverage of the use of SQL, Susan Bradley's Advanced Security and Jeff Middleton's Disaster Recovery really make this book a valuable addition to the industry.CONSeveral reviews of additional software didn't do a good job of describing the need for the software and in many cases didn't even mention how much the software would cost. Blatant plugs for Mr. Brelsford's sponsor HP seemed misplaced and contributed to my dissatisfaction with the book. Too many NOTES boxes deprive the reader of content. Coverage of the ISA Server 2004 which hasn't even been released should have been held for the upcoming \\"Extending SBS\\" which was mentioned several times in the book.Here's how it breaks down.Intro and Bio'sSection 1: SBS 2003 DeploymentChapter 1 Introduction and Planning Harry BrelsfordChapter 2 Understanding Hardware in the SBS Environment Chris AngeliniChapter 3 SBS Licensing Harry Brelsford and Steven BanksChapter 4 Advanced Setup and Deployment Andy GoodmanChapter 5 Using 3rd Party Tools to boost SBS Performance Frank OhlhorstSection 2: SBS 2003 UtilizationChapter 6 Exchange Server 2003: Advanced Topic Michael KleinChapter 7 Windows SharePoint Services: Advanced Topics Jonathan HassellChapter 8 Remote Web Workplace: Advanced Topics Wayne SmallChapter 9 Using MS SQL Server 2000 with SBS 2003 Alan ShraterChapter 10 Fax Server: Advanced Topics Kevin RoyaltySection 3: SBS 2003 SecurityChapter 11 Advanced Security: Part 1 General Susan BradleyChapter 12 Part 2 ISA Server 2004 Beatrice Mulzer and Dr. Tom ShindlerSection 4: SBS Advanced TopicsChapter 13 System Monitoring Lawrence A RodisChapter 14 SBS Disaster Recovery Jeff MiddletonChapter 15 Migration Jeff MiddletonChapter 1 Introduction and Planning by Harry BrelsfordThis is a broad and very general overview of the SBS world. It was noted that another book is in the works on expanding your SBS Premium which will include both BizTalk Server 2004 and CRM 1. Besides these things, I don't know that there was much of great value in this chapter to me.Chapter 2 Understanding Hardware in the SBS Environment by Chris AngeliniThis chapter was more interesting. There is an interesting compare and contrast between AMD's server line of chips and Intel's server line of chips. Tape versus HD backup are discussed, SAS and SATA, workstation requirements and server requirements. Wireless and Gigabit networking is briefly discussed. There is a discussion about \\"right-sizing\\" hardware for a client based on what the consultant knows about their business and their knowledge of hardware. Little firm guidance is given here and this is one of the areas I think needs to be SIGNIFICANTLY documented by the industry.Of some interest to me was the brief description of the iLo and RILOE II capabilities for remote control of a server at the hardware level. Though the capabilities are described, there is not much mention about how these could be used in a real-world support way. Perhaps I just don't have enough experience to understand this, but then that's what the book is for right? If you're going to market someone's product, one of the best ways is to describe a pain point and then detail how your product alleviates that. I didn't get it.The last 15 pages of the chapter is a walk-through of the HP Proliant HL 350 G4. Harry does a very good job of plugging his sponsors. However, the same information could be conveyed in a similar way without specifically plugging this machine. I failed to glean anything useful from this material. These blatant product plugs help reinforce my opinion that the book's asking price is too high. If HP is going to sponsor the book, and I am expected to read it, my compensation should be a lower sticker price.All told, I can't say that I gleaned much of anything new from this chapter. It is a fair review of modern technologies, but not comprehensive enough to be significant for me.Chapter 3 SBS Licensing by Harry Brelsford and Steven BanksThe example used for the chapter is a creditable one. It is easy to follow and shows the concepts in action.Since Eric Ligman does an EXEMPLARY job handling licensing questions on the mssmallbiz site, I almost wonder about the inclusion of this in the book. I can't say I got a lot of bang out of this chapter. Well written, not largely needed.Chapter 4 Advanced Setup and Deployment by Andy GoodmanBOOM!!! Home Run!! This is exactly the kind of information that I would expect to see. How to use GPO to roll out software... How to use GPO to change computer settings... How to set the time to automatically sync with the server... Using partitions during install...This is the first chapter that I can say that I will use TODAY to get something done.I also very much appreciated the input on creating multiple partitions and why. Andy's hints are the kind of stuff that I haven't heard before, but that can solve challenges I've got right now. EXCELLENT!!Incidentally, Andy's recommendations as given in this chapter are far more inclusive even that what is on his web site (I at least when I wrote this.). They are also very similar to those made in the Microsoft Small Business Server Administrator's Companion (though better explained and illustrated.) They also match recommendations by MBS for installing CRM and disaster recovery recommendations by Jeff Middleton. Interesting that these weren't included in the \\"Basic and Intermediate\\" book.Chapter 5 Using 3rd Party Tools to boost SBS Performance by Frank OhlhorstThis chapter goes over the backup utility from Acronis' True Image Server. There is no pricing information, which is always a bad sign in my book. There was also no discussion about why this is better than the NTbackup that comes with SBS. There was no justification given for why I might need the additional expense of this software.The next topic covered was hosting with a dynamic IP address. TZO was mentioned and since this often comes in routers as an option, seems a good choice.The last topic was spam filtering. Mr. Ohlhorst discusses how to use GFI Mail Essentials. I haven't used this, but like the backup solution, I wonder why this would be used instead of Intelligent Message Filter for Exchange? Is there such a performance difference that it makes good sense? $300 for a 10-user license when IMF is free tends to make me think there might at least be some attempt to justify this expense.Overall, the chapter was a disappointment to me. Spending money is not always a bad thing. The ultimate determinant is VALUE. If I spend \\"X\\" amount of dollars I will get \\"Y\\" feature which benefits me in \\"Z\\" way and makes it all worth while. There was hardly any of this type of information.Chapter 6 Exchange Server 2003: Advanced Topic by Michael KleinWOW!! 140 pages on just about anything you could want to know about Exchange. This is a veritable treasure trove of how to install, maintain, troubleshoot, monitor, and enhance Exchange Server 2003. There is actually so much that is covered here that it is difficult to describe it all.I have found that reading books on Exchange seems to often be a waste of time. So much of the content is based on running in an enterprise environment and thus completely not related to SBS-Exchange at all. This is by far, the best overview of Exchange that I have ever read. The nuts and bolts of how it sends mail and even tools to diagnose problems are discussed.Given the complexity of this very mature product and the essential nature of e-mail for a business, this chapter alone might justify the cost of the book. Very thorough and well-written. I could easily imagine that this could save the cost of a call to PSS. If this chapter doesn't have the answer to your Exchange question, I'll bet it will have something that will put you on the right track to finding it.Chapter 7 Windows SharePoint Services: Advanced Topics by Jonathan HassellI think this chapter was a disappointment. Almost four whole pages were spent enumerating fixes covered in Service Pack 1. How is this important to me? Post a link, and I'll hit it if I want. Show me how to do NEW stuff. Two of the other examples mentioned are just screenshots of what Microsoft has on their SharePoint spot.There is good information on linking Access to WSS. Frankly, I agree with Harry's comments from the last book, that SharePoint may well be the greatest reason to upgrade to Office 2003. I am amazed at what this makes possible.There is also information on backing up and restoring SharePoint via the stsadmin tool, the migrate tool and also the SQL backup tool. This is very timely information. However, I have to wonder why this wouldn't have been presented in the \\"Basic and Intermediate\\" book.Perhaps the author had a conflict of interest in writing this chapter as it looks like he charges a lot of money for training sessions on customizing SharePoint. I was surprised to see that he mentions an application of SharePoint and the screenshot didn't seem to have anything to do with the functionality he mentions.Chapter 8 Remote Web Workplace: Advanced Topics by Wayne SmallAh, refreshing detail here. Wayne does a great job of identifying what functionality is needed, by whom and with which devices. He covers RWW in excellent detail along with extensive troubleshooting. His coverage even includes editing the registry to change details which may be significant to your RWW setup. This chapter is the first to really earn the \\"Advanced\\" label.This chapter is very well written and provides significant value for the reader. The troubleshooting tips and the website he has which can help would be a great way to justify this book. Having all of this information in an easy to access place is greatly helpful. The detail in the troubleshooting part could be sufficient to save a call to PSS.Chapter 9 Using MS SQL Server 2000 with SBS 2003 by Alan ShraterThis is a breakthrough chapter. I think the content is sufficient to allow one to conceive of other uses, but not so thorough that it is all inclusive.This section of the book is well written. It encourages the reader to think more outside of the box as far as how to use SQL and its benefits over just Access. This is one of the few places so far in the book, where there has been an effort made to justify the additional cost of the upgrade. I think the Mr. Shrater succeeds admirably. I thought he did a really good job of describing how SQL and Access can co-exist happily.One of the other excellent resources is the listing of recommended reading. I think this article will really help implementation of Premium installations and help people see a bigger picture than previously.Chapter 10 Fax Server: Advanced Topics Kevin RoyaltyI may not be a good judge for this chapter. I don't use fax much, and am frankly surprised that it persists as much as it does, given how much more flexible e-mail is.I will say that the chapter flowed well and seemed to make sense. After a review of hardware that seems to be a listing of the most expensive faxes available, the process of setting up different fax configurations was gone over. Dealing with 10 digit dialing and 7 digit dialing in the same environment is also covered.Chapter 11 Advanced Security: Part 1 General by Susan BradleyWow! I have had the opportunity to listen to Susan Bradley before. She has a website at www.sbsdiva.com and I've been there many times looking for answers.I'd bet that I've read or heard of 60% of the security stuff that she talks about in this chapter. This is the first time I've seen so much of it in so coherent a presentation.The chapter is largely generalities: assessing risk, mitigating risk, implementing a defense, evaluating and even recovering. There are a wide array of security tools mentioned, sites to reference, procedures to understand.This is a very well presented writing on the subject. I think it is a useful reference for anyone using SBS. Her thinking is very much based on handling real world situations and protecting the digital assets of a company.This chapter alone may well be a good reason to buy this book. You can probably find all of the information she presents somewhere else, but having it all right at your fingertips is a very good thing and a GREAT time saver.I was particularly impressed with the discussion about changing permissions to allow programs which profess to require the \\"Administrator\\" role to run safely in lower permission levels.The large number of third party tools listed along with other websites to go to for more information will also be very valuable to the reader.I hesitate to say that I enjoyed this chapter, because I didn't. Security and all of its inherent pains is one of my least favorite aspects of the computing world. However, it is the state of the world today and having read this, I am better equipped to deal with it.Chapter 12 Advanced Security: Part 2 ISA Server 2004 by Beatrice Mulzer and Dr. Tom ShindlerThis chapter was written without the benefit of having seen even the beta for the SP1 implementation of ISA 2004 for SBS 2003 Premium customers. You'll see this phrase often: Visit http://www.smbnation.com/isaupdates.html for when an updated version of this chapter is available.There are some examples of tasks and screenshots, but as the software hasn't been released yet, it seems that this would have been a good candidate for the next volume.Chapter 13 System Monitoring by Lawrence A RodisThis chapter is well written and easy to follow. References are given for further research. Both Microsoft and non-Microsoft tools are mentioned, and many of the third-party tools are free for small networks. There was no pricing information given on the other tools which is a pet peeve of mine.Several charts of events and services to be monitored are given. There is a list for hardware performance, Exchange, and ISA. It is mentioned that other apps that the business depends on also need to be monitored.Rodis mentions that with some of the tools, the ability to scale up the number of systems has been significantly improved. This is a very good thing as it is exactly where I presume many of the readers of this chapter would like to be.Chapter 14 SBS Disaster Recovery by Jeff MiddletonExcellent!! Jeff Middleton has done a fantastic job of covering this subject. The beginning of the 110 page chapter covers the boot process, what happens when and how to recover if it goes wrong.There is extensive coverage of recovering from a problem using various different methods, including ASR, a backup, and a drive image. There is discussion of potential problem areas with specialized applications like SQL and SharePoint and how to work around them.Different tools are described and how to use them. Exchange and its components and how to fix and recover them are described.It is difficult to describe all that is described in the process of this chapter. I think Jeff's writing is some of the most clear and concise of the authors included. His experience and confidence are displayed by the easily readable explanations of some pretty technical concepts.It was interesting to me that Jeff is the only author who refers to the Product Support Services Team as an option in his writing. It is clear that he has been willing to jump in over his head and make things happen. He refers people to his website at sbsmigration.com for further assistance with Disaster Recovery or his Swing Migration method.His experience with the Disaster Recovery methods he writes about are the inspiration for his Swing Migration method. This method, covered in the next chapter, was highly lauded at the SMB Nation 2004. He was the only author there to get a standing ovation. (That I saw anyway.)This is another of the chapters which makes this book such a valuable asset to have.Chapter 15 SBS Disaster Recovery by Jeff MiddletonI didn't read this chapter before getting this done, and haven't gone back to do so."},{"Title":"Advanced Windows Small Business Server 2003 Best Practices","review":"I'm not one to to get back online to specifically do a review, but in this case I just had to.

I had never read a Warhol biography before I read this, and it provided a lot of great details, especially involving his early life.The problem, though, is that it seems that sex seems to permeate everything. Perhaps Warhol was a man obsessed with it, as the author seems to suggest, but does that really call for the explicit details of his sexual activities to be included? Seriously....does it? I think not. After a particularly detailed description, I found myself thinking, \\"Ok, I get it, the man had a foot fetish. Can't we just leave it at that?\\" I must add that I am no Puritan by any stretch of the imagination, but there is something quite unsettling about Warhol to begin with (at least for me), and when you add sexual detail to it, it just gets....icky. If you don't have a problem with this, though (I'm sure some people might even especially want to read it with these details included), go for it. It is highly informative, and Warhol was nothing if not compelling."},{"Title":"Warhol: The Biography","review":"Victor Bockris' biography is sympathetic to Warhol's supposed contrived personality. The reader gets the impression that the author, who had a personal association with Warhol, really understood the facination his subject maintained for his adopted country (the U.S.) throughout most of his working life. While others tend to dismiss Warhol as a simple poseur Bockris relates his wide-eyed enthusiasm for the consumer society. While some have suggested he was manipulative, this biography suggests that he was slightly naive. Most of his life is covered here and, although there is documented proof of some interesting associations that are not touched upon, in general the work is broad in its scope and the reader will discover that the most notorious pop artist of all had far greater depth than his blank features and fickle comments suggested. It is also a feast for those interested in good gossip and the social history of the 60s and 70s."},{"Title":"Warhol: The Biography","review":"As a huge fan of this fascinating man who blured the line between art and commerce, I was looking for a well written bookthicker than a brick that would reveal once and for all the mystery that is Andy Warhol. Im still looking, the definitive Warhol bio is yet to be written it seems, but in the meantime I'll settle for this Bockris book which is a sound overall portrait of the artist and his life. Starting from his poverty and illness stricken childhood in an industrial town in Pennsylvania the author breezily tours the reader through hiscollege life, and his subsequent move to New York to become a highly successful (and paid) graphic artist, before establishing himself as one of the founding pioneers of pop art. From there we take rollercoaster ride through his film making years at the Factory, his subsequent shooting, and the time he spent as a socialite and portait artist in the last two decades of his life. Some light is shed on the issues concerning Andy's sexuality, Catholicism, monophobia, work ethic, short livedintimate relationships, shopoholism, and his seemingly aloof public persona.Though Bockris rightly bestows more pages to Warhols peak years as an artist in the sixties, he skims the later decades of his life. As with his Lou Reed biography, Bockris has a tendency to demonize his subjects towards the final chapters of his works. Try as his he might here, his weakly supported insinuations of Warhol as a cold and manipulative character are more a reflection on the authors ownfeelings of insecurity, rather than their being any intrinsic truth in the matter. There is a middle way between sycophantism and character debasement, and Bockris obviously hasn't found it. It's adequately written, albeit unimaginatively, and it takes real effort on part of the reader to stop turning the pages. As it stands, a fine Warhol primer, but for those with an inquiring mind, this book will probably raise more questions than it answers."},{"Title":"Warhol: The Biography","review":"Now out in a new edition, Victor Bockris' WARHOL is a very solidly written and researched biography. In particular, the first half creates an extremely detailed portrait of Warhol's Pittsburgh youth; this adds a tremendous amount of context and depth to Warhol's own work, and the meanings and symbolisms of that work will gain new clarity after reading through some of Bockris' book.Unfortunately, the book gets less detailed and more gossipy later on - Warhol's many flaws are underlined again and again, but Warhol surrounded himself with other highly creative people who launched interesting careers of their own - Paul Morrissey and Lou Reed both spring to mind - and Bockris does little or no investigation of Warhol's influence upon them, and any actual ideas just seem to get lost here amid the varied bits of gossip.-David Alston"},{"Title":"Warhol: The Biography","review":"The first half of this book is invaluable for the intimate infomation that it gives on Andy Warhol's early years. It is very sensitively written and thoroughly engaging, though the latter years are sort of run through at the speed of sound. That would be the only criticsm I have of this book but you can flesh out the facts (from Andy's view) by getting a copy of the Andy Warhol Diaries. Otherwise it's a really great book."},{"Title":"Warhol: The Biography","review":"Bockris was a friend of Warhol, at least for several years. He shares a lot of detail but what seems to stand out in this biography in particular is that:* Warhol had a lot of boyfriends, none for long, and he was ridiculously jealous.* Warhol used people no end and generally didn't pay those who worked for him.So I was left at the end with a decidedly negative impression of Warhol.I'm suspicious. It didn't seem that Bockris explained how someone so creepy was able to get some many talented people to work with and hang out for him. All to be a part of the Warhol scene? For expectations of fame, money, connections? I don't know. I do know companies with a little liked leader. Still, it left me wondering if Bockris had something in for Warhol. I don't doubt there's some truth in Bockris' account of Warhol with boyfriends and assistants but I can't tell how much. Instead of resolving who Warhol was, this book makes me also wonder who Bockris is and leaves me seeking other books to learn more about Warhol."},{"Title":"Warhol: The Biography","review":"This is not a brilliant biography, but there are interesting facts about Andy's life, and so I do recommend it. Ironically, in Andy Warhol's DIARIES, he mentions how a magazine is considering hiring Victor Bockris as one of its writers. And Andy says, &quot;So they are really scraping the barrel.&quot; Ironic that Bockris, then, would be Andy's biographer! Bockris, though, isn't as bad a writer as Andy thought."},{"Title":"Warhol: The Biography","review":"(page 158, my book)The interviewer asked, \\"Do you think pop art is\\"\\"No\\", Warhol replied\\"What\\"\\"No\\"\\"Do you think pop art is\\"\\"No\\" he replied, \\"No, I don't\\"(Page 159) Marcel Duchamp\\"What concerns us is the concept that wants to put Campell's soup cans on a canvas.\\"There are a great many descriptions of Warhol in this book, among others: genius, voyeur, village idiot, a phoney, a vampire(Page 155): To at least one onlooker he seemed more \\"like a white witch, looking at America from an alien and obtuse angle.\\"The strength of this book is that the author always provides us with several views of Andy during the same time period - some flattering, others less soMr. Bockris takes us through Andy Warhol's entire background of growing up in Pittsburgh and attending art school there. The one aspect evident is that Andy (like other great artists) worked very hard - from a young age he was constantly sketching and painting. When he arrived in New York in the early 1950's he had to make money and rapidly made advertising sketches. He eventually made his way from \\"commercial\\" art into the \\"artistic\\" art world. The rivalries between the different groups - artistic versus commercial, abstract expressionism versus art and pop art, gay versus straight, gallery competitions are all well brought out. But the book is foremost about Andy's multiple worlds.We also get a first hand view of the Warhol factory of the 1960's and it's a pretty bizarre place. There are assorted misfits of all types. Andy had an intense attraction to dysfunctional people - he was compulsively drawn towards their problemsPage 219: Andy on Edie Sedgwick\\"I could see that she had more problems than anybody I'd ever met.\\"He would not necessarily try to help them, in fact (from page 205-06) \\"when they had passed their prime for his use, which usually took from three to six months... the deserted star would be in the position of a drug addict suddenly cut off from his supplier.\\" He needed them for art stimulation. There was a price to pay for these affiliations with unsavory characters. One, Valerie Solanas, shot him in 1968; others committed suicide or died of a drug overdose.Much of what he did in the early \`60's partly reflects his Orthodox Church upbringing - but he made everyday objects into icons. He literally filtered them in a very special way.Andy also made several underground films. One was called \\"Kitchen\\"; here is Andy's description of it (page 223):\\"[it] was illogical, without motivation or character, and completely ridiculous. Very much like real life.\\"The Factory started to change in the early 1970'sPage 376: John Richardson\\"The speed freaks and the transvestites gave way to high bohemia'Andy started to paint celebrities as part of his pursuit and obsession with fame. He was criticized for this - going commercial again. But he was not the only artist who did portraits for money; Renoir did the same with affluent clients in Paris.Andy was always moving towards the unconventional no matter what he was doing. This is a rollicking biography of one of the most public artists in America.

Feniger was an artist, youth leader, teacher, kibbutznik .The first part of this book consists in letters to Yael, who one would day become his wife. They are often insightful and moving, filled with a spirit of youth and zest for life. The second part of the book consists of reflections about Ofer made by a wide variety of acquaintances, many from his Army service. They are filled with respect and affection for someone they considered an especially responsible and gifted person. The volume contains a number of his often stark and yet impressive drawings.One reading the volume has a painful sense of a special person cut off too soon, before he could live his life to the full.The volume which was put together by his widow shows a special caring, devotion and love.This is a work like the 'Letters of Yoni Netanyahu' which shows the idealism, and special quality of the Israeli youth of that time. Both of these young men were intelligent informed soldiers who knew their people's history and understood what they were fighting for.It is their courage and sacrifice which has enabled Israel to endure the endless onslaughts of its enemies- and thrive."},{"Title":"Sweet Nothings","review":"I have a large cookbook library and this has consistantly remained at the top of my list of recommendations.

And Brian Cudahy is the person to tell the tale. He has an unusual gift: He leads you through amazing amounts of detail without burying you in minutia. The &quot;small pictures&quot; of the various aspects of the events leading up to this transportation disaster are always beautifully and accurately drawn. They are then framed in the context of the &quot;big picture&quot; of the politics, geography and tenor of the time.A great read for lovers of history, train lovers and anybody who appreciates a well crafted recounting of the complex causes of a shattering event."},{"Title":"The Malbone Street Wreck","review":"Like David von Drehle's narrative of the Triangle Shirtwaist fire, Brian Cudahy has written an account of a New York disaster which had strong ramifications for the rest of America. And like TRIANGLE, Cudahy's THE MALBONE STREET WRECK does not exploit the tragedy for the sake of sensationalism and profit. It is a sober narrative which actually sends warning signals to the mass transit officials of today.This remarkably short book is very thorough. Beginning with America's pulse during the final days of World War I and the influenza epidemic that scourged the nation and world, Mr. Cudahy then explores the world of 1918 New York. Specifically, he inspects the confluence of forces, such as local politics, labor relations, the profit motive of the train line owners, and others, that led to the placement of an untrained, unqualified transit worker in the motorman's booth of a rush hour train. The result being the violent death of almost 100 people in The Malbone Street Wreck.Mr. Cudahy's research seems conscientious, and where he is unsure of the facts, he tells us so. There is an honesty to his narration that gives the story an almost personal tone. (His mother did lose two cousins in the wreck.) The several maps and illustrations are extremely helpful. And while the photos of the disaster site and wrecked subway cars are shocking, they are not gruesome. And they serve as strong reminders of the imperative for the transportation officials of today to adhere to strict safety standards."},{"Title":"The Malbone Street Wreck","review":"I am writing a novel based on this incident; the books that I have so far been able to borrow at the public library go into it to a certain degree but I need something with more depth; &#34;The Malbone Street Wreck&#34; by Brian Cudahy fulfilled that task to my grateful satisfaction. My only quibble about this book is that I wish it had contained more photographs of the wreck and one of the motorman. The author dispels some myths that had circulated concerning the actual fate of the many passengers who were killed or injured an provides a descriptive &#34;place mat&#34; of the events that, either directly or indirectly, contributed to the tragic subway wreck in 1918. An absorbing read that will serve as an invaluable source of material for my burgeoning novel."},{"Title":"The Malbone Street Wreck","review":"Perhaps Doctor Cudahy could write another book or perhaps a monograph detailing why the tunnel from 125th street to 63rd street is taking longer to build than the entire BMT, IND, AND IRT.MALBONE is a fine book and if he wrote the number on the second avenue subway, i'd buy five more copies of malbone and distribute them to the MTA"},{"Title":"The Malbone Street Wreck","review":"This is a fine detailed history of the most deadly accident in American history.

While C.G. Jung is undoubtably one of the most important figures in the 20th century, his writings can be hard to understand if one hasn't already been exposed to analytical psychology, mythology, alchemy, Latin, and/or ancient Greek.This book takes the reader from Jung's theory of the Collective Unconscious and goes step by step through archetypes, archetypal images (and the difference between the two), the shadow, the animus and anima, and interpreting mythology with these things in mind. It shows, quite logically, how mythology links us to the collective unconscious and how learning about mythology is really learning about ourselves and the human experience.It's also nice to hear the theories of other Jungians, people who have taken his work into other areas, like fairy tales, politics, and everyday life. The stories we all know, whether we learned them in church, from our parents at bedtime, or sitting in a movie theater, are stories of us and learning some basic Jungian vocabulary and theory makes these stories resonate with the timelessness in all of us.I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about his- or herself and the unseen forces at work in our minds and the world around us. This book has opened a bigger, enthralling new world to me, one that will keep me engrossed for quite a while to come."},{"Title":"Jung and the Jungians on myth: An introduction (Theorists of myth)","review":"Key Jungian terms are explained and illustrated through an array of multi-cultural myths, essays and letters.Professor Walker leads us to a clear understanding of Jung's psychological theory of mythology within a wide range ofcontexts, making this an excellent and informative experience for all new and seasoned Jung followers and fans."},{"Title":"Raphael (Great masters in color)","review":"I bought this marvellous book through Amazon nearly 8 years ago and in all that time not one review! What's gone wrong? Surely ART is still taught in schools and there's still interest in beauty - especially feminine beauty? If this is so it's inevitable students will eventually discover the highest standards of Art, Architecture and Portraiture were established in a 100 year period in one small town ( Florence) and this era was called \\"The Renaissance\\".From there on it's a matter of deciding which of the Big 3 artists was the greatest natural born genius. After getting all excited about the size of the Sistine ceiling and finding Leonardo only created about 10 paintings it doesn't take long to discover Raphael wins by a street. From the beginning to the very early end of his life everything that flowed from his paintbrush has an unbelievable level of perfection. Too perfect it seems for those looking for angst and naked emotion speaking to them from a canvas. (In every large art gallery the largest crowd is always gathered around a Van Gogh)Raphael's images on the other hand look so simple and uncomplicated. The reverse is true - what you see is the Art of disguising Art. Until much later in his career it never occured to him to create tortuous compositions using extreme movement and dramatic lighting. Just one continuous series of beautiful life-affirming renditions of the kind of subject matter his patrons commissioned. The lucky part being Madonnas were in such great demand he needed to find endless variations of the \\"Madonna and Child\\" theme. In the first part of this book you get just about all of them perfectly reproduced in a large format. And what makes this Raphael book better than any other is wherever possible the Italian author inserts all Raphael's preparatory sketches.It's here the truth about what makes an artist GREAT emerges. The Florentines were all fantastic draftsmen. If the end product looks easy it's because all the hard work was done earlier - trying out every alternative solution until the final image is established. As Raphael's fame spread demand for his genius came from all sides and it was never in doubt he'd end up in the Vatican where his rivalry with Michaelangelo came to the surface. Very few art experts disagree that by sticking by his own convictions harmony was prefable to discord his contibution to the \\"Stanza della Segnatura\\" is one of the great landmarks in humanist art. Again this book reproduces every panel at large scale together with all the drawing Raphael considered necessary to make this room his masterpeice.The rest, as they say is history. This book contains over 300 large very accurate illustrations nearly all in colour. You'll never find a better monograph devoted to the Prince of all Painters."},{"Title":"Theories of Development: Concepts and Applications (4th Edition)","review":"This is an excellent book to get a taste of learning theoriests, a good beginners book.

This book is so poorly written that I found myself wondering if it was chosen solely for the purpose of having an author on the syllabus who is not a white male. I have to assume the author wants to direct everyone to the assessments she provides and supposedly keep it \\"practical,\\" because the book itself is sorely lacking in content. Just as you think she is going to say something substantive, she refers the reader to \\"Appendix B.\\" For example: \\"There are five listening styles: Appreciative, Empathetic, Comprehensive, Discerning and Evaluative. For more information, see Appendix B for information about the Personal Listening Profile\\" (52). The book is all about \\"personal achievement\\" and relies heavily on what Stephen R. Covey calls the \\"personality ethic.\\" Whenever Foster gives \\"personal examples\\" to illustrate a concept, the stories are always fairly abstract and never stray from her own climb up a corporate latter. One gets the sense that upward movement, for the sake of upward movement, is all she knows. For example: \\"From the beginning of my career, I always have made every effort to be prepared or to find ways to develop necessary skills or expertise (necessary for what?)...Later, when I had the opportunity to establish quotas for my own teams...\\" (79, parenthetical note mine).Foster is spoiled, self-absorbed and egotistical, and puts forth no effort to hide this. It starts with the front cover, which features a big picture of her in sparkly, expensive clothes. In her chapter on dealing with change, her personal story reveals that she actually has not truly had to experience hardship because she always had several good outs available to her. \\"Did I want to continue \`doing' the jobs that would eventually include the possibility of my \`retiring on the job,' or did I want to find and pursue an opportunity that rallied my spirits and renewed my passion for \`being' my life's work?\\" (45). From these life circumstances, the reader is somehow supposed to glean insight on \\"dealing with change.\\" She tells the story of her exit from IBM. She had a high-ranking, high-paid position there, but she opted out because \\"I wanted it done \`my way'\\" (Foster 2002, 46). She held down her next management job for 45 days. Why? \\"I quickly learned that the title really didn't give me the option to call the shots. Once again, I opted out\\" (46). What she wanted, and what she achieved in starting her own business and leadership network, is what any real leader would recognize as over-functioning: \\"...becoming CEO, better known as the \`Chief Everything Officer,' in my own entrepreneurial adventure\\" (47). Foster's tables and assessments are of her own creation with little to no formal training or research behind them, other than what she draws from similar self-help and self-improvement books like Empower Yourself by Harvey Coleman.Zero stars. Two thumbs down. This book holds little value for leaders of any kind - other than to be a shining example of how NOT to lead and live. Foster is not leading anyone but herself. One of the best things that could happen to Foster to improve her character and perspective is to go bankrupt and have to work as a cashier at McDonalds. After that happens, I'll be the first to buy her next book."},{"Title":"Due North","review":"I borrowed this book from a colleague, who had it sitting in her library.

Great details of how they captured him. Better than the movie. Highly recommended if you are into true crime stories"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"This remains one of my favorite true-crime novels. Ann Rule really delivers here.Rule gives us not only the background story on Bundy's crimes, but also his childhood story, his victim's stories, and some incite as to what drove Bundy....at least as far as we know. She provides a complete picture of the man and his crimes, and I can't recommend this book highly enough to those interested in Bundy or killers in general.Her story is, of course, made more interesting by the fact that she knew Bundy. However, there are also draw backs to her \\"inside knowledge,\\" the most obvious of which is potential conflicts of interests and problems determining when she is sincere. Sometimes her story seems to go a little \\"too far\\" as when she is telling stories about nightmares she has about Ted. They may be true, and I hope they are, but they definitely made me wonder. If they are true, it brings into question her impartiality. Rule was really in a catch 22 with this book - there would always be questions, given her previous relationship with Bundy. Overall, I think she handled the situation professionally and impartially.The book does drag a little bit in the middle, particularly where she is sharing a lot of Bundy's letters to her - I would have expected that to be the most interesting part, but it gets a little dull at some points. Beyond that my only real criticism is the way she handles the delays in his execution; she treats them as if they are somehow phenomenal, even implying that Bundy might somehow be influencing the system. While this was less true then than it is today, delays in execution are extremely common. In fact, by today's terms, Bundy was executed rather quickly. While this was, as I said, less true when she was writing, I do think she gave into the temptation to stretch the truth a little bit for drama's sake. Either that, or she didn't have a full grasp of the reality of the death penalty, which I find unlikely as she usually seems fairly knowledgeable of the legal system in most respects.Overall I highly recommend. It will change your outlook on crime and criminals, and it will probably answer a lot of your questions about Bundy himself. I wouldn't recommend reading when you are home alone, though!"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"When I was a kid, I wrote an opinion piece in school - can't remember what that piece was about - but the teacher responded with much red ink, saying something like, \\"Choose a side, and argue it!\\" I think that that teacher was a she, and I think that she was right. And I think that a lot of school kids make the mistake of arguing both ways at the same time - hedging their bets - because they don't know how to argue. They don't want to offend as well. Big mistake.After reading 625 pages or so of \\"The Stranger Beside Me,\\" I believe that that is the biggest problem with Ann Rule's book. Throughout, she gives opinions like, \\"Oh, if only this or that, maybe I could have saved Ted Bundy\\" (how could she have had any impact on a sociopath such as Bundy?). And then at other times - near the end I believe - she opines, \\"Even if I could have saved Ted from the electric chair I don't think that I would have.\\" OK Ms. Rule; which one is it? (I believe that she perhaps wanted to show that she was torn between her love for Ted and her loathing for him at the same time. But in print, this type of flip-flopping doesn't quite work.)Another problem I had: Ms. Rule was surely not objective here, which yes is to some degree understandable as she was so close to it all. However, how is it that the Seattle detectives, once they realized that Ted Bundy was a suspect, allowed the same access to information for her? If I were the police, I would have said, \\"Look Ann. I'm sorry, but you're too close to Ted and so therefore we must lock you out. We cannot risk our investigation by giving you too much information, no matter how much we trust you.\\"One other problem: Ms. Rule, I believe, tried to make the Florida judicial system look so much more primitive than the \\"wise\\" system in Washington. It was almost like she thought, \\"They just wanted to kill Ted so they are animals in Florida, while we in Seattle are so enlightened.\\" This implied logic fell on deaf ears to me. Ted was a killer, a cruel killer at that, and surely deserved to die a thousand deaths. And yes, when he was executed I cheered as well, all the way back when I lived in Seattle. (I live in California now, another soft state perhaps on criminals.)I certainly liked the first half of the book better than the second half. Additional chapters were added after-the-fact, and to tell you the truth, I don't think those chapters added any clarity. In reality, they might have clouded the overall story. The first half was filled with edge-of-your-seat drama and terror; the second half kind of devolved into mostly courtroom strategy, some of which was only mildly interesting. But even still, I did give this book a four (4) star as I found it an interesting read that accompanied the better book by Dr. Robert Keppel."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"The greatest purpose of Ann Rule's 1980 book \\"The Stranger Beside Me\\" is it terrifies you. After reading her extensive study of Ted Bundy, you feel compelled to lock the windows and doors. I defy anyone to ever get into a stranger's car again after these pages. It's not just Rule was deeply involved in the case, with a rare insider view making this one of the greatest true-crime works ever written, but the specter of Bundy himself being so extraordinarily deceptive. There is no criminal in history who fits the mold of this man obsessed with destroying women, his compulsion so acute he devised disturbingly intricate strategies to kidnap and murder.The early 1970s were not necessarily an innocent time, and yet Bundy swept the land to conduct his massacre. He was unusually attractive for a monster, with wit and intelligence at home in collegiate settings. He belonged in circles completely bereft of high-risk victims. He fooled so many, most notably fiancees and Rule herself, who worked with Bundy in 1971 at Seattle's Suicide Hotline center. In what is one of the great coincidences in history, Rule had been hired to write a book on the burgeoning \\"Ted\\" murders before Bundy was ever a suspect. Much to her shock following his arrest in Utah, she realized her friend could be responsible. Not until his Florida murder trial did she finally accept Bundy was a serial killer (a term created by his rampage).In Rule's own words, the idea Bundy was a brutal murderer was \\"incomprehensible.\\" Indeed, there has never been a convincing explanation as to why Bundy evolved into an obsessive predator. He was an illegitimate child growing up without a father, and he thought his grandparents were his parents and his mother his sister. There's really no evidence Bundy had an especially difficult childhood. But it appears his killing began as a teenager in Tacoma, Washington when an eight-year-old girl who lived on his newspaper route disappeared. He would never admit to the abduction, which remains unsolved.Rule details what could have been additional early Bundy crimes in the 1960s when he was a student at the University of Washington. As the book progresses, one begins to realize everywhere Bundy went unsolved cases against women took place. What appears to be the catalyst for his ultimate rampage was a collegiate relationship with Stephanie Brooks, an attractive, wealthy student from California who became Bundy's dream girl. She dumped him and Ted was devastated. Interestingly, he focused on a new psychology major, becoming an honors student and a dependable employee of the Seattle Republican Party. On the professional fast track, he recaptured Brooks' heart and when she accepted his marriage proposal, he cruelly dumped her in return. Two days later, the first female student disappeared.It's unthinkable Bundy would throw away a successful life and career. I'm of the belief he had already raped and killed multiple times. Certainly he had long contemplated his predator perversions, as the disappearances of 7-8 women were conducted with skill born of criminal experience. Arguably his most famous crime took place July 14, 1974 at Lake Sammamish State Park when he abducted two separate women. Such a brazen atrocity stunned authorities, though eyewitnesses encountered a man named \\"Ted\\" trying to entice women to his VW.By this time, murder apparently consumed him and Rule details circumstantial evidence of his failing grades as a law student in Utah. He would be arrested eerily driving near Salt Lake City equipped with handcuffs, crowbars, ropes and ski masks. Luck had run out and investigators were suddenly suspicious of this man named \\"Ted.\\" The walls were tumbling, and yet the story amazingly continued.Rule's attempts at analyzing Bundy, in addition to explaining her own feelings on the surreal developments, are fascinating. She reveals multiple letters they exchanged providing insight, though I'm not sure she ever pegged Ted correctly. \\"The Stranger Beside Me\\" has remained in print for years with updates in 1986, 1989 and 2000, inspired by renewed knowledge of criminal behavior and Bundy's execution. I appreciated Rule's insinuation of the murderous detail rather than exploiting Ted's demented behavior. Seattle detective Robert Keppel, one of the few to listen to Bundy's last-minute confessions before electrocution, would pen his own accountThe Riverman: Ted Bundy and I Hunt for the Green River Killer, including grisly facts and a portrait of the pathetically compulsive creature he became after years on Death Row. Though not as lyrical as Rule's work, it's a necessary contrast to the myth of Mark Harmon andThe Deliberate Stranger.The success of \\"The Stranger Beside Me\\" would inspire its own filmAnn Rule Presents: The Stranger Beside Me - The Ted Bundy Storyand Rule would evolve into the greatest true-crime writer in history (with more than 30 books includingSmall Sacrifices: A True Story of Passion and Murder (Signet)). But the epic Bundy tragedy is where it began for her career. Part investigation and self examination, this page-turner is a decades-long journey attempting to make sense of a man's destruction. Rule asks, \\"How can evil exist where you least expect it?\\" There is no answer, and we can only lock our doors."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"I don't have to tell you how fascinating the case of Serial Killer Ted Bundy is, if you are searching for a book about Bundy it's probably because you are aware of how special this case is. This is, in my opinion, the best book written about the case and one of the best book about Serial Killers/True Crimes. If, like me, you buy a lot of books about True Crimes then buy this book, this is a must-own and a great addition to a collection."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"In Stranger Beside Me, Ann Rule tells of working at a suicide hotline and meeting an attractive young man there.The man she met was kind, courteous, and even helpful with her personal problems.Oddly enough, that man turned out to be Ted Bundy.At once a cautionary tale of just how little we can know about those around us and a gripping true crime story, Ann Rule effortlessly negotiates all the emotions and connections that emerge from her very unlucky pairing with one of America's worst serial killers.Appropriately enough, Rule starts at the beginning with her first meeting with Bundy. As the years progress she provides the often mundane blow by blow of their friendship which apparently started just prior to when Bundy went into high gear killing Seattle area college girls.In terms of how it read the closest any other book came to telling essentially this same story was Stephen King's novella Apt Pupil (later made into a movie of the same name). In Apt Pupil King's protagonist was a Dennis the Menace type boy who'd fixated his boyhood attentions on a Nazi war criminal in hiding.Though the King novella drew its story by defying our expectations of how the boy/Nazi criminal's relationship would/would not develop, the Rule book eschews those issues because obviously Rule wasn't aware of just who Ted Bundy really was.Sadly, Rule wasn't alone as scores of women succumbed to Bundy's charms and then his homocidal intentions.By acknowledging her delay in understanding what she needed to know about her \\"friend\\" Ted Bundy, Rule managed to raise the question of just when others themselves would have been suspicious.By reporting the devotion other women felt for Bundy even when the evidence was clear about him says much about the myopic qualities of human love."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Yet again Ann rule mesmerizes us with her detailed plots and dazzling writing. This is her best piece of writing in my mind and for anyone who likes true crime this is a must read book. I could not put it down the whole time I read it. Just don't read it at night. it will scare the bageebees out of you!"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"This book is simply terrifying -- no, not for the portrayal of a serial killer...but for its precious author! Kind of disturbing that a woman would send money to a man accused of heinous crimes even if they were \\"friends\\" and former co-workers. She also handed good old Ted her true crime articles for his reading pleasure! In Ann's starry eyes, Ted was such a great man and nothing ever seemed amiss, even though she knew he took money from women and never paid it back and cheated on his longtime girlfriend. Of course, that was just the tip of a very large iceberg. And she claims to be a former cop! As other reviewers here have noted, Ted is humanized while the victims are not well drawn and are portrayed as naive at best. At one point (early on), Ann gave Ted's name to investigators as a possible suspect and then said vaguely she found out her tip didn't come to anything. Aargh! Why didn't she follow up and press the issue herself, being an ex-cop and true crime writer? Chillingly, that was BEFORE many of Ted's murders had taken place. And she gives herself too much credit later, saying, oh, if only the cops had allowed me to see Ted in jail in Florida, he would have confessed right then and there. The joke's on you, lady, because Ted was just using you for cigarette money and as a sounding board for the usual murderer complaints--I am innocent, the food in here is terrible, the prosecutors don't know what they're talking about. Was her motivation getting a book out of it--or was she really that stupid? Either way, she comes off as an enabler to one of the worst serial killers in history."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"This book is, if anything, a testament to the eerie manipulative effect that sexual-sadist-psycho-killer Ted Bundy has on women. Ann Rule is an ambitious, thoughtful, reasonably skilled writer; and yet she fell for him just like the others.I understand that she would have been conflicted when she found out that one of her good friends was a perverse murderer. But it's not as simple as that feeling of being torn... even though throughout her book, Rule seems content to leave everything floating in that ambiguous area. Friends come and go -- some things are enough to break off friendships over. Also, to be fair, she didn't know Ted all that well -- they had worked together and bonded a bit over the Crisis Center hotline that they both volunteered at, but it seems clear that Rule was very taken with Bundy's personality and strove to keep in contact. She was dazzled by him, and wanted to stay a part of his life because she thought it could be a very promising one. Which indeed it might have been... as many people have said before, with Bundy's intelligence and skills of manipulation, he could have been a very successful CEO.Ann Rule insists, on multiple occasions throughout the book, that she was NOT attracted to Bundy; that she was decidedly NOT in love with him... a claim that certainly warrants her insistent reinforcement. From her near-glowing tones describing Bundy, her sensitivity and expressed care about his needs, her seemingly boundless faith that -- despite all evidence -- it doesn't seem possible that he could be capable of such things; the attitude that comes across to the reader is definitely love. If not romantic love, than certainly familial. Rule says herself that she might have been vulnerable to developing an uncommon attachment to Bundy... she had lost her brother to suicide, and always thought of her relationship with Bundy as similar to the one she had with him. Maybe she felt like he just needed saving... needed someone to understand. A tempting conclusion, and even an understandable compassionate desire. But while she is writing this (very graphically detailed) account, she never really addresses the reality of what Bundy did. In the same way, she never seriously addresses the possibility that she was emotionally manipulated by Bundy. When you read between the lines of her account, it seems all too clear.And she GRIEVES for him -- she still remains in his grip. She even goes as far to say that her relationship with him was the deepest and most meaningful connection she had ever had with a man.Bundy was a con man to the very end. He was cruel, empty, manipulative to everyone he encountered, a desperate egomaniac, would rather die than be made a fool of, all the while NEVER SHOWING HIS TRUE IDENTITY TO ANYONE. He never owned up to his crimes in the least. He wanted to be accepted as a lawyer, a student, a successful young white male, and never for what he really was -- a serial killer, a sexual sadist, and a sick, sad man. This is what makes his case so incredibly heinous to me, and why Rule's almost tearful rendering of Bundy's downfall and eventual conviction leaves me feeling distinctly unnerved. It's just inconsiderate. If I were related to one of Bundy's victims and read this book, I imagine I would have a much more visceral reaction."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Public fascination with Ted Bundy has certainly been quite beneficial to author Ann Rule, who parlayed her association with Bundy into a lucrative cottage industry for herself and used it as a springboard to launch a commercially successful series of crime novels. While I wouldn't go so far as to say The Stranger Beside Me is worthless, I wouldn't exactly say it was close to being a definitive source on Ted Bundy, either (regardless of the amount of copies it has sold). Considering the title of the book, I suppose it isn't a great surprise that Rule's own life should figure into the storyline. What IS most irksome is the significant degree which the book concerns itself with (and the high amount of page space devoted to) the minute aspects of Rule's life that have an at best peripheral bearing on Bundy's life. This irksome feature is coupled with the needlessly dense style of Rule's often cliched prose, which can be quite a slog to penetrate at times. In addition, there are more than a few instances where raw data and factual figures become jumbled when restated throughout the book. It is also slightly odd that Rule frequently indulges in periodic self-gratification over her skills of detection and research into criminology while simultaneously admitting she had no real idea Bundy was doing what he did until virtually the rest of the nation found out about it in 1978. Outside of Rule's own interaction with Bundy over a fairly short span of time in the early 1970s and a dozen or so phone calls and letters exchanged between 1975 and the late 1980s, the rest of the book (which is most of it) is fairly pedestrian...almost sophmoric, really...in terms of the conclusions drawn about who Bundy was and why he did the things he did."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"If this is the 'definitive' book on either true crime or serial killer Ted Bundy, then I find that to be pretty sad. Simply put, Ann Rule is not a good writer. Her prose borders on being cheesy and melodramatic. I appreciate the additional background information given on the victims, but Rule's prose is syrupy and almost comes across as mocking. Ex: \\"...when he got wind of her letter, he learned Janice had indeed expired\\" or \\"There was always tomorrow. Only there wasn't. There were no more tomorrows for Julie Cunningham...\\" Surely there must be more tactful ways to describe someone's death.One problem with the \\"The Stranger Beside Me\\" is it cannot decide if it wants to be memoir or biography. One senses Rule's relationship with Ted is played up a bit, and in that case, the book would have served better as a biography. There is too much information revealed about Ann Rule's life that is irrelevant to Ted Bundy. Yet the biggest problem with \\"The Stranger Beside Me\\" is how Rule presents theories as facts, when in reality it is nothing more than personal speculation. Besides the Devine murder, other information in this book has been proven completely inaccurate. One is Rule's theory that Margaret Bowman was Ted's designated victim on the night of the Chi Omega attacks simply because she was a brunette. Bundy actually planned on attacking Cheryl Thomas on Dunwoody street first, but since she wasn't home he went to the Chi Omega house. As for Margaret being his first victim, evidence reveals that Lisa Levy was attacked first. More alarmingly, she has Ted admitting to murders he never confessed to. Did he really commit these murders anyway? We don't know, but it's wrong to print that he confessed when further research states the opposite. Melanie Cooley's murder is now classified as a cold case, and according to \\"The Only Living Witness\\", Ted claimed to have killed only three women in Colorado. Rule also mixes up two Utah victims: Nancy Baird and Sue Curtis. He confessed to Sue Curtis's murder not Nancy Baird's. There are other minor errors that are insignificant, but because there are so many of them, Rule's credibility is further brought into question. Georgeann Hawkins is described as having brown hair, and then in the 2008 update she is suddenly a blonde. Liz Kloepfer's fake surname is 'Kendall' but Rule fudges up her last name as 'Kenyon' in the 2008 update. Chi Omega victim Kathy Kleiner is called 'Kathy Meiner' at one point.The moral of the story is one can't believe everything they read in one single book. In the case of people who become famous or infamous, there are always personal theories that get swept in as fact. The truth is out there, but sometimes you have to dig for it."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"OK, I thought I had lost my innocence years ago but I was wrong. I'm pretty sure that this book took whatever was left.I wasn't expecting to be surprised like this. That this person existed....that would be enough. That the author was an intimate friend, destined to become a true-crime writer and involved before Bundy was a suspect is just mind-blowing.I'm not exactly sure what this book did to me. It was largely at an unconscious level. And it was intense. I still find myself frequently drifting back to thoughts and feelings about the book.I recommend reading this when you think you have already figured everything out about who to trust...or if you are finding the world at all boring.or if you just want to read *THE* masterpiece of true crime.

There's only one problem with these books (and I have to admit, I'm a fan of the genre): you begin to think your husband, boyfriend, brother, cousin, next door neighbor, and the nice little old lady at the hospital who dispenses pleasantries just might be a cold-blooded killer. I'm always a little stand-offish toward my strange-acting neighbor when reading these things. I try to think if there have been any killings or rapes in our neighborhood lately, and when his car doesn't show up for a week or two, I brood a bit on what he's been up to. However, soon after putting the book down, I realize that my imagination has been racing out of control thanks to Ann Rule, and how silly it was to suspect him of Ted Bundy-like behavior.I hope she comes out with a new one soon. In fact, in case true crime fans haven't noticed, there hasn't been too much fresh product in this area lately.

They can be your friend, mentor, sibling, neighbor. Yet hides a deep, dark secret that only becomes more apparent as one gets older. A compulsion that never stops because of a need to know why they were abandoned or mistreated as a child.I feel that Ann Rule writes from her personal experience, making it seem as a &quot;first person&quot; read. You don't know truely the experience, unless you've come across one, with the mask off) I, myself has come across one of these personality types, (Malignant Narcassist or passive/aggressive disorder). Not that all are &quot;killers&quot;, but the reaction is the same. And I think Ann did more than &quot;throw up&quot;! Probably left with a disturbing and never ending question of &quot;Why&quot;?After reading Ann's book, depicting every mood, every turn of personality from the handsome, witty lawyer to a crazed, angry killer, it brings me back to the recollection of the &quot;friend&quot; in my life who also took off his mask and realizing he was &quot;Nothing&quot; he appeared to be. Only later after research and theropy, finding out I was only a reminder of his &quot;mother&quot;. He wanted her love and punish her as well. Geez, how could I have known!I feel Ann Rule's book gives a thorough insight into how her friendship with Ted Bundy changes over time after realizing, things don't seem right; his lies, descriptions seem eerly similar. More of an insight of her intuition. I think the idea of the way Ted is able to hide his &quot;true self&quot; is just as compeling as the actual acts themselves. She gave, how many $10 to him? and personal thoughts! One doesn't like being made a fool!It's a must read and great description of the disorder!"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"I wanted to read this book because I was wondering if it was one of those \\"oh, he was such a nice man, shame about that sorority house though\\" kind of books. Ann Rule, talks about Ted Bundy in a way that is almost capable of making the man who stalked my nightmares as a child and pre-teenager almost seem like someone that could be understood. I found out a lot of details about his murder spree that I didn't know, for example, I found it quite interesting that almost all of his victims were women with the same features of the girlfriend who dumped him. Which is very creepy, while I don't think that Ann Rule was trying to make excuses for him, I do think that she was somewhat under his spell. The fact that she had staunchly defended him until the trial for the Chi Omega murders which was the first time she came face to face with what he really was capable of. I found this book to have its slow points but all in all it was a great read. For example, I didn't know that Bundy had a jailhouse wife that he had a child with.On a personal note, as I said, Bundy was the stuff of my young nightmares; the Chi Omega murders happened before I was born but \\"The Deliberate Stranger\\" brought that horror into my living room. I remember that from that day to this, I am always double check my locks, because I remember, watching Mark Harmon (playing Ted Bundy) walking down that hallway and trying the doors, one of them was locked and I can't help remembering that though that was what saved that girl. It was the stuff of my nightmares and somehow this book, was like when the sun comes up and you realize it was all a dream."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"This is one of those instances where truth is definately stranger than fiction, imagine you write true crime stories and then as a effort to produce a novel rather than stories, you choose a current event whereby someone was brutally attacking young women leaving them for dead, then you get the suspicion that a man you were alone with at the dead of night (in a crisis centre) whom you shared your problems with could be this...'monster', and then you are proven right - it is him. To the best of my knowledge - even Hollywood didnt come up with this storyline.Reading an account of Ted Bundy's story (just after he was executed) was what actually what got me into reading true crime and watching similar type films. Here Ann tells of having worked beside the man and her impression of him is the absolute opposite that the media portrayed (Media - he was brutal, angry man, Ann- he was a shy, respectful person that listened - At times you think hell is she talking about the same man they executed for these indiscribable crimes against young women?) She tells of how they met, listened and helped each other with problems, there is even a possibility that had circumstances been different she might have been instrumental in at least getting him to stop, possibly even avoid going down the road he went - that's f you can believe that a bad person wont be bad if he/she gets the help/support they need at the right time - who knows?For me this was a very difficult read. I think partly because I made the mistake of first reading the update she recently put in and the women that were attacked - those that survived are up in their 50+'s now - were on average the same age as I am. At times the book is also a bit heavy like when where A.R. considers mentality, and factors that might have affected Bundy to do what he did (and at times she takes pains to explain as well - thats why the 4 stars).Overall - a great read."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"After reading numerous serial killer books, including some about Ted Bundy, I decided to try Ann Rule. I heard a lot of complimentary things about her books, and after reading \\"The Only Living Witness,\\" I thought it would be interesting to read a book by a person who had a relationship with Ted before he began killing. While she did provide some interesting stories and background information I had not previously read, I did not like the book as much as I thought I would.I continually felt astounded at the amount of times Rule was able to insert an irrelevant rambling about her personal life. Telling the reader that someone tried to steal her car had absolutely nothing to do with the story. If Ted Bundy had tried to steal her car, I get how it would fit, but otherwise, it was a meaningless departure. That is just one of about fifty examples.These offshoots might be acceptable if Rule weren't completely delusional about her role in Ted Bundy's life. She clearly sees herself as an integral cog in the Ted Bundy machine, yet anyone who reads the book can see she is yet another woman who is constantly being manipulated by Bundy. She allows herself to be his marionette, jumping through any hoops necessary to fetch him his latest request or to complete his personal business for him outside the jail. Perhaps she does this because she has a contract to write about Ted, or maybe it's simply that old Bundy charm that worked so well on all his victims. At one point in the book, Rule actually compares being in Hollywood writing a movie script to Bundy's experiences in jail. \\"I could now more easily relate to what Ted is feeling in jail. I miss Seattle, too,\\" etc. It was laughable!Ann Rule admits early in the book that she would have tried to date Ted while they worked together had she been younger. It is blatantly clear through her actions and statements about Bundy that she is under his spell. He made a fool of her, using her to get things he wanted, and I think that to this day she really believes they shared some sort of cosmic bond. It's kind of pathetic.The three stars are for all the information on Bundy. If I wanted an Ann Rule autobiography, this would have been great."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"This book was engaging up to a point and then I started skipping pages and then I finally put it down and watched a documentary.There was way too much Ann Rule in this book and I really didn't care about that part. Stick to the narrative.The opening chapter starts with a bang and foreshadows the To Catch a Killer type style that makes true crime so interesting. I just wish she kept things going in that vein."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"This book is very well written and engaging. I was fascinated by all the true facts of this case. Having lived in Florida and being the same age at that time as one of the victims, I was very engrossed in the story. Great read!"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"I am so glad that Ann decided to write this book. To see another point of view, from the \\"inside\\". It's just an amazing book. I definitely recommend it for an awesome read."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Although this is one of Ann Rule's first books, it is one of her best. She gives the background of her friendship with Ted Bundy -- and tells how she only gradually was convinced that he was the serial killer 3 states were searching for. She doesn't weight the book down with ALL the details of ALL the deaths (who really knows how many women he killed?), but we learn enough! I especially appreciated the updates at the end -- to tell us the final chapter in this wasted life!"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"This book is excellent, however, I must warn anyone thinking of reading it that it will absolutely give you nightmares! But a great read!"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"This book is totally amazing. It's the creepiest book i have ever read and one can't /well i can't help but wonder what ted bundy would be like if he wasn't executed. I want to know what he's like...the book makes me want to know more of him.."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"This book gave me the opportunity to understand what exactly ted bunby did.I looved this book."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"This was the 2nd Ann Rule book I read, and after reading it 3 times already over the past few years...it still sends shivers down my spine. This book is a &quot;must-read&quot; for any true crime fan."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"As a former investigator on behalf of death sentenced persons in Florida and thus knowing much about the cases of Ted Bundy, this book is a must read to better undertand serial murderers.The night that Ted did his crimes in Tallahassee, I was breaking up with a college sweetheart until 6 am -- at which time I drove by the Chi Omega House, seeing dozens of law enforcement vehicles at the Chi Omega House -- my only thought was \\"What a hell of a party they had to break up.\\"Not until she called me later that morning about what had actually occurred... Until a suspect was arrested it appeared to me that EVERY male was considered a prime suspect by others. Those days were amongst the strangest days I have ever experienced.In later photographs of crowds gathered in front of the Chi Omega House, guess who appeared: Ted Bundy."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Ann Rule sat beside Bundy for months before she would even fathom that he might be a killer. I heard her speak of her experiences working beside him on a suicide hotline, riding in his car, dining, etc...she had no clue. Rule is not a fool. She not only provided a book that opened the world to the idea that the serial killer is not the bogeyman, but sometimes, literally, your work partner, or your friend. She made me want to search further. How many others were wearing similar masks? We have all heard of the goriest stories, the most heinous criminals, but it wasn't until I began delving personally into tinier stories across the country that I realized I needed to understand better the pathology of serial crime. As the writer of Serial Killer Letters, I hope I can hold a candle to Rule's gift to a society: a wake-up call that the bogeyman comes dressed in designer clothes and pearly whites. Sadly, he is also mentally diminished, wrongfully convicted, and so forth. So while I was learning about one kind of mask when I took the study upon myself, I realized, this is lurking everywhere, many faces...the end result of my own study? Sadly, it is much more difficult to tidy up a little definition than I thought. And as much as we want to hate the murderer in our society, once we begin to learn, we see that we need to reevaluate our emotions, and wonder, many times, how the heck did all this rage occur in the first place?"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Ann Rule does an excellent job portraying Ted Bundy as she knew him, then allowing the reader to feel her anger, nausea, and pain along with her as she realizes all that he has done. I do not believe this book is too gentle on the case - it gives plenty of details and eyewitness' (and survivors') accounts of those horrible years. This was a man she trusted - one who we all could have, and probably would have, trusted."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"The Stranger Beside Me is an excellent book by Ann Rule, who is also excellent. Bundy was a complex man who was deeply troubled, but did not want to seek help. This was the third book I have read on Ted Bundy. I think he could have been a good lawyer, but he chose to go the wrong way."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"I've read every Ann Rule book published, and this one beats them all. Every woman needs to read this book. I personally bought a copy to give to my 17 year old niece before she went to college because I felt so strongly that she needed to know that there are predators like Bundy out there in the world. Truely chilling and riveting."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Ann Rule is one of the premier true crime authors of our time, and this book is the best she has ever written. I first read this book when I was 12. and now, at 21, it has influenced me to pursue a career in the FBI, tracking horrible serial killers such as Bundy. Ann Rule is a terrific author, and this book is one that you will not or will not want to put down!"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"This is my first book by Ann Rule and my first real look at Ted Bundy. I had heard the stories and had watched a documentary about Ted, but nothing could have prepared me for this portrait of the killer. What is so scary for me is that I may have trusted him, may have tried to &quot;help&quot; him when he appeared with his arm or leg in a cast. Ann Rule does an excellent job of telling what must be for her, a difficult tale . Even though I found the book deeply disturbing, I think it is very well done. A definite page-turner, as well as an eye opener."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"&quot;Stranger Beside Me&quot; is not only one of the best true crime books I've ever read, but was also the only one to truly scare me to death--as I was a junior at FSU when I read it. The streets, the Chi O house, the Tallahassee landmarks were not only such that I could see the action in my mind, but could literally walk a couple of blocks to the scene. But what frightened me most was the personal nature of the story. It was impossible for Ms. Rule to write this story as an impartial observer, and how Bundy's story intertwines with her own serves as a chilling reminder that you never know the true nature of those you believe are close to you. Unbelievable!"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"It was many years ago that I first read Stranger Beside Me and the very first Ann Rule book that I had read. It really intrigued me and ever since then I have always wondered what makes people like this tick? I continue to read her books and have found them very hard to put down!!! I love her style of writing! ~~Sabrina Veley"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Ann Rule not only gives an insider look into the mind of Ted Bundy, but she has also shown the two sides of him, one a monster and the other a caring friend. The best book I've read of Ann Rule."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Ann Rule, a true-crime author, is hired to chronicle the hunt for a brutal serial killer. Slowly she comes to realize that the homicidal maniac police are searching for is her beloved friend and co-worker. No one can make real life characters as compelling as Ann Rule, and The Stranger Beside Me is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"My second Ann Rule book and I'm definitely a fan, I give this a strong recommendation to any that are interested in true crime and a small glimpse into an evil mind. The factors that lead to this book being what it is are beyond belief, if you can imagine for a moment being given a book contract on a current unsolved crime, missing women, and then finding out later that the culprit is a personal friend. What are the odds?Because of the personal interaction between Bundy and Rule, this book is something that no other writer could have written, personal accounts of time spent with the killer before he was caught, in fact, before he was even a suspect. Amazing.In any case, the book is a compelling read, and as I wrote in my other review, reading Rule is a bit like reading a good fictional novel, the story flows well, like a good piece of fiction, yet it is so interesting because it all really happened.I found some of the authors personal views and takes on the case intriguing, although I thought it was a bit ironic when she stated that she could see no benefit in executing Bundy, except for the fact that he wouldn't be able to kill again...Duh.While perhaps he was defanged, there are reasons to believe that if wasn't put to death by the state of Florida, he may very well have killed again. Perhaps not, however, taking away his opportunity was probably a good move. I do agree with the thought that perhaps leaving a killer alive, instead of administering the death penalty, could possibly help science, however if we leave this door open every killer is going to want to avoid capital punishment by claiming he'll work with shrinks. A can of worms to say the least.The story was definitely creepy, I wouldn't recommend it to young college aged coeds living in a sorority if they spook easily, it'll cause a few restless nights I'm sure, however for any interested in the subject of serial murder by a sexual deviant, this story of one of they worst killers in American history is a must read.A final note about the updated version, this update adds a bit (not a lot) but a bit of new interesting details, and is worth the read. Perhaps it would have been better to go back and rework some of the book with information that was added later, however it still works. Certainly Bundy was sick, but we find out in the update that he was even sicker than presented because a little more detail about his activities is added and alluded too. I'm not sure if adding this detail in an update, and with only bits of information, was the best course to take, however I'm going to assume Rule didn't want to dwell on some of what Bundy did, so she just hinted at it and gave only minor details.With the growing popularity of fictional crime shows on television and the like, I'm sure at some point we'll see a major motion picture of some aspect of this book, meaning a take on the Bundy murders with the twist of his friendship to Rule. Facinating."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"This was my first Ann Rule book I have read. What an amazing writer! I really felt pulled just as she did. I can see how she would be impressed with the \\"Ted\\" she first met; but then again after the sorrowful incidents the audacity, shock, and horror Ann must have experienced, well, I can't even imagine what she went through as someone who actually knew him.This was a riveting, page turner that kept me hooked, and the thing that really kept me going was kind of a scary intensity that kept me reading till the very end even though I knew how it ended.I know people may think me odd (that isn't unusual), but I actually felt sorry for him...the life as he was growing up, the lies he had to live with that he was given from the day of his birth, the sorrow of love loss, and the evil that grabbed its hooks in him that kept him in its grip till the end of his life.Ms. Rule's style of writing and her words really made me feel what she felt. As I finished the book this evening, my heart actually hurt as her's did as she thought so much of the original \\"Ted\\" she first met. How tragic, yet amazing, the human psyche can be constructed even as a small child."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Bundy was an intelligent, good-looking, yet COLD-HEARTED, VICIOUS M U R D E R E R. I think that Bundy was a very evil and sick man - I don't believe at all that the fact that he was a &quot;bastard&quot; made him go out and kill young, beautiful women. Not that the author implied that, but I got the feeling that some people would use that as a &quot;motive&quot;. And to the girls who wrote love letters to him while he was in jail, &quot;You're stupid.&quot; Whoever believes in Bundy's innocence after reading this book (or knowing the facts and having seen the evidence) has got to be living in a different world. Too sad, though, that the disappearance of that little girl who lived on his street when he was a young boy has never been solved. Frankly, Bundy deserved to be executed - it's just too bad that so much money was spent on his defense and appeals before he was actually put to death."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"This is the book which launched Ann Rule's career as the doyenne of true crime writing, and it is easy to see why. What started out as just another &quot;story&quot; for Ms Rule became a journey of horror, as she came to recognise the seductive, horrifically destructive side of a man she thought she knew well - Ted Bundy. Rule draws us into this tragic saga with incisive, careful writing and probing analysis into the crimes, mind and motivations of a sociopath. What makes this such a compelling book is not only the author's fabulous writing, but her heartfelt compassion for the many victims, both living and dead, and although he is undeserving of it, compassion for Bundy himself. In my opinion, the most haunting question that has arisen from this book is: &quot;How can we stop individuals from becoming the kind of sly, silent killer that Ted Bundy became?&quot;"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"This is a very unique book in that the author actually knew Ted Bundy and had worked beside him. She is a former police officer turned nonfiction crime writer, and her books are very well researched and detailed without sensationalizing the crimes. They include enough biographical information on the victims that you truly identify with them, and the book is hard to put down. I read this book years ago and it permanently changed my awareness of my surroundings. Before I read this book, I would have offered to help Ted without a second thought and could have easily become a victim at the wrong time and place.With that said, I almost gave this book 4 stars instead of 5, which would have been a mistake. After recently rereading this book after many years, two things about it bothered me:1. The author's friendship with Ted just keeps showing through. Understandable, but it became a little frustrating about two-thirds through the book. Of course, this perspective is one of the things that makes this book so fascinating, so maybe that one is totally unfair to her. She doesn't sugar coat his actions, but her feelings are evident throughout the book.2. His last known victim, 12 year old Kimberly Leach, doesn't receive nearly enough attention IMHO. Bundy received another death sentence for her kidnapping/rape/murder, but this case gets minimal coverage in the book. The thought crept in that maybe it received less attention because, if possible, it shows Bundy in an even more unfavorable light than the others. His other known victims were at least a few years older. In any case, I felt Kimberly's case deserved much more attention than it received. As her case actually went to trial, there would have been ample material available for research, in addition to the author's police connections. Perhaps she was too weary of it all, but this case seems almost to have been mentioned only as an afterthought.Nontheless, this book should be a must-read. It is absolutely fascinating and has undoubtedly saved lives. Serial killers are clever, often attractive people who are good at mimicking normalcy, and unless you (and your children) have at least some awareness of their methods, you might be easy prey.I have no doubt that this book was an emotionally difficult one for the author to write because of her friendship with the killer. My hat's off to her for doing a fantastic job. This edition has an additional update which is also very informative. The book really is 5 stars all the way. Read it and share it with someone you love."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"This is partly my fault because I was wanting a book more about Ted Bundy but instead got a book about the author and her feelings about him which I could care less about. Also, she seems to regard her relationship with Ted Bundy much more highly than it actually looks like it was. She think somehow that if she had the chance to talk to Bundy before the trial that he would have confessed to her. Please. Who is she kidding? And sending him money and worrying about him all after she found out that he was THE PRIME SUSPECT in these murders/rape is really weird. She thinks that she's different from those other women who were in love with Ted Bundy but she's just one of them herself."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"I did not read the original book but in a sense it worked well, because I found the latest edition to be highly interesting. In particular as a psychologist, the descriptions of Bundy's childhood were informative and applicable to my work with children having severe conduct disorders and the often accompanying narcissism. I can recommend this book to all persons, but especially to those professionals hoping to better understand the underlying pathology and causes for this personality."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"There are hundreds, if not thousands, of books on various serial killers that terrorized America throughout the years, but none affected the country quite like Ted Bundy.He was the handsome, intelligent boy next door, working for the Crisis Clinic as work study during his undergraduate studies. She was a promising true crime writer volunteering some of her time as a way to possibly atone for the guilt she felt over her brother's suicide.During their late night shifts manning the phone bank, Ann Rule struck up an odd sort of friendship with the would-be serial killer - long before the world knew who Theodore Robert Bundy was. And, as he was thrust further and further into the headlines and the forefront of the nation's collective conscience, she struggled to reconcile her recollections of Bundy with the monster portrayed in the courts and news media.No case - and no killer - has haunted a person on the periphery of a media blitz as Ted Bundy has - and still does - haunt her to this day.This book allows the reader a very personal look inside the cases that held a nation in terror for almost two decades. Her friendship with Bundy gave her special access to looks at the inner workings of one of the U.S.'s most infamous killers.A must read for fans and the curious alike."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"This is the definitive book on Ted Bundy. I've read multiple books on the case good and bad. Ann Rule having known Bundy there is of course a personal note there in. Not biased though in my opinion. Ann Rule as always does a wonderfuly through job of giving us backround of Teds' early life and happenings that can be pieced together, right through to the very end. It's the best account I've found in that it truly gives an insiders look at the man and at least the act he presented to her and those in the vicinity. I like that she gives us a complete account of the trial, thought processes, and all around happenings top to bottom. It truly is the definitive book on Ted Bundy and the horrible crimes he commited. Ann Rule is one of the foremost true crime writers of our time. She delivers on all fronts as usual. A must for true crime buffs."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"A well-written, from the heart book with a perspective only the author could have. The addendums, written years after the first publication, provide good additional information and insight."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"The Stranger Beside Me, is told with infinite attention to detail and answers some of the questions that linger in our heads about the mysterious Ted Bundy, making this the most personal book about him. An unsettling, intensely personal inside look at one of the nation's most infamous serial killers, it gives an intriguing observation that will keep you spellbound as you hear much of Anne Rule's relationship with him. She recounts how she was an unsuspecting coworker (Seattle Crisis Center hotline operators) and a close friend whose suspicions multiply during his killing spree. He often sat beside her and shared thoughts, discussions and laughs with her. She is supportive and unsure of his guilt at first, but by the end she realizes he really is the wicked person committing these crimes. It's not surprising that Ms. Rule had no idea since he was one very clever individual. The adjectives to describe this book are too numerous to mention and once you read it, you will know why.Ted Bundy was many things: charming, witty, amiable, charismatic and polite. Most of all, however, he was a sociopath who killed with such rage and deliberation, this story will make you think twice about strangers who approach you in parking lots. I know he wasn't wired right, but I keep asking myself why? What REALLY made him tick? The account of Ted Bundy's killing spree at the sorority house gave me chills for awhile after reading it. He was, however, not the genius that some people make out to be: he couldn't finish law school and he chose to take his killing spree to Florida, of all places. The book also doesn't concentrate on his victims as statistics but gives them the respect and dignity they deserve in a culture that seems more fascinated with the killer than the victim."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Ann Rule's \\"The Stranger Beside Me\\" is probably the most frightening of all the accounts of Ted Bundy's murderous career. Why? Because Rule was a former policewoman, she considered Ted Bundy a co-worker and friend and never saw the sociopathic personality lurking behind his charming facade. As a society, I think we want to believe that we can easily spot those Bundys, Dahmers, Gacys . . . and Rule's book emphasizes the fact that we cannot. Those monsters blend in sometimes seamlessly with the rest of us.Rule's book does a huge service to Bundy's victims by recognizing them as more than just \\"Bundy victims\\". Reading about their dreams, their goals and their daily lives makes the horror of their deaths sting even more.Rule's sadness over the story comes through in nearly every page - - sadness at the loss of lives and sadness over what Bundy's life could have been and what he could have offered had he not been so consumed by murder. Having known Bundy before he became infamous as a serial killer, Rule gives insight into Bundy's personality and character, from his childhood, through his adolescence into his political and legal aspirations, all the while fostering a murderous rage toward women.An insightful book, one that makes you check and doublecheck your windows and doors and pray that you never cross the path of someone like Bundy.Definitely one of Rule's best books. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"For years, I was hesitant to give this book a try based on the amount of books Ann Rule has written. She seemed too commercial and exploitive of a true crime writer for my palate. I was pleasantly surprise at how much I enjoyed \\"The Stranger Beside Me\\". The best part was that I only paid a quarter for the book at a used book fair.Ann Rule worked with Bundy as a volunteer on Crisis lines for a Seattle mental health clinic. Bundy seemed to be a normal caring person as he befriended Rule, which was before his crimes started. However, something inside of him snapped. Stephanie, the woman that broke his heart, seemed to send him into a spiral of violence that would not end. The cycle was only interrupted by his incarceration, before he escaped and continued to kill. Nearly every woman he killed beared some resemblance to Stephanie.Rule shows tremedous skill in her storytelling, making the book tough to put down. Her chronology of Bundy's life, includes his confusion toward the identity of his mother as he was born illegitimate. The details of the crimes leaves little to be desired, as Rule does an excellent job describing the scenes without being at the crime scenes.As the main editorial review provided by Amazon.com suggests, the updated versions do not add much to the book. So if you have an opportunity to save some money, buy an older copy. Based on my experience, I am looking forward to reading many of Ann Rule's other book. I would suggest true crime fans do the same."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"The best true crime books (like IN COLD BLOOD) are less about the act itself and more about the lives and times of the victims. And the victims should never be forgotten, nor defined soley as those who lost their lives. This book expands the circle of victims to make the reader ache for everyone Bundy touched -- the dead girls themselves, the mothers and friends who must somehow accept the unacceptable, the dedicated but frustrated law enforcement officers who feel helpless to stop the carnage, even the officers of the court who must defend the indefensible ... Ann breathes life into them all.Then there's the havoc Bundy brought to his supporters. Ann, Meg, Stephanie, Sharon, his mother ... they all loved him, cried for him and fought for him until the evidence of his guilt became too overwhelming and repellent. And then these women had to live with the \\"what if's.\\" (What if I'd realized earlier that the \\"Ted killer\\" was my Ted? Could I have saved lives? Was there something I did that made him slaughter lovely, promising young women -- girls like me or my daughters?) He may not have strangled, maimed or wiped these women off the face of the earth, but he left them battered and bruised emotionally. It's one of the measures of what a monster he was that he didn't seem to notice, understand or care what his evil compulsion did to those who loved him. Ms. Rule makes their (and her own) plight so understandable, so human, that you feel you are walking in their shoes. By the end of the book, you count these women among Bundy's victims, too.Ms. Rule is not the writer Capote is -- there's no poetry here, and her prose never reaches the level of art you'll find on any page of IN COLD BLOOD. But her personal involvement and gift for observation make this book a classic of the genre, as well."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"This is truly a remarkable work. Ann Rule has written both an in depth account of the Ted Bundy saga from an insiders point of view as well as her own remarkable story. Ann Rule and Ted Bundy worked together at a crisis center. The book is non-fiction that reads like a great novel. Rule follows Bundy with a history of his early childhood that gives insight to why he might have turned out like he did. The book also gives an account of how Bundy also viewed the world and how he tried to beat the death sentence. The reader is left an enigma of a highly intellignet and charming man who is also a psychopath. Rule also does a remarkable job of revealing to the reader how she originally believed Bundy to the conclusions that she was forced to realize that he was a murderer. I was left with the feeling that this book was painfull for her to write. Rule also tells a bit about her life and how she ended writing true crime. This book will leave you unsettled and you will not be able to put it down."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"This is definately one of my favorite Ann Rule books so far. This book has a more personal touch than her other books because she actually knew him. I can't stress how great this book is, I'm on the last chapter right now and I had to force myself to put it down and do homework. Not only do you get to learn about Ted Bundy's murders but you also get to see him as a person. His background before he became known as a mass murderer is included. Ann Rule doesn't over indulge the reader in the gory details of the murders, but the effect of how horrid they were are still obvious. Like all of Ann's books the story doesn't end with the arrest of Ted Bundy, the court proceedings and events that ocured while Ted awaited execution on death row are also very interesting. Ann also shares letters she received from Ted Bundy over the years. Written from a friend to a friend. This is a great book that anyone with the slightest interest of fascination with serial killers should read"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"I was a fifteen-year-old girl in the South Seattle area during the \\"Terror of Ted\\".I ran with a crowd of other fourteen and fifteen year old girls who would freely hitchike around the Seattle area back then, usually in search of the next adventure ahead. Our travels took us way North, into Lynnwood, far east, into Issaquah and North Bend, and usually, into the U-District in Seattle.I remember being really afraid ... afraid to stick the old thumb out, even while in a gaggle of girls doing the same thing. I remember being really afraid whenever a VW slowed - we'd all squeal and wave the driver on. All this fear had been, of course, hammered into me by the news, by the schools, and by well-meaning family. But when you're young, you feel you truly are invincible, and that nothing can hurt you! And so, the group of us who hitched, were determined to not get into any car driven by a man named \\"Ted\\". We felt \\"safe\\" if we'd ask the driver his name. Foolish is what we really were.And of course, we all wore our hair long, straight and parted down the middle. It was the mid seventies. Every girl did!When the furor over \\"Ted\\", who'd by this time, moved on to Utah (and ultimately Florida) began to subside, the hitchiking lot of us finally wised up, and began to have our boyfriends drive us, or got our own drivers' licenses.This book re-lived for me the terror of those days, as a young girl, a frequent visitor to the U-District and Lake Sammamish Park off I-90 back then myself. I was never approached, nor were any of the girls I hung with, by the wavy-haired, good looking stranger with the eager smile.But with every brief introduction to yet another driver, another group of guys going nowhere in particular, I'll never forget the underlying fear that surrounded me. Those summers of Ted. Because we just never knew where or when he would appear next.Ann Rule captures this wonderfully in her 20th anniversary update."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"I read this book cover to cover in three nights -- late nights, scary nights. Ann Rule keeps readers on the edge of their seats even when they know the eventual outcome for Bundy, a given for someone like myself from Washington State. Ann was an acquaintance of Bundys and this makes her treatment of this sadistic fiend even more authentic, more personal, than the characters in some of her other books. The difference between this book, and in fact all of Ann Rule's books, and a mystery novel is the gaps. One is always left wondering, what happened here? Wouldn't knowing this make the story more coherent, weave it a bit more tightly? Sure, but real live mysteries are far different from fiction. More fascinating. Ann can't contrive a character and plot, she can only follow the evidence, as much as is available. This she does in a masterful manner, conducting hundreds perhaps thousands of interviews and wading through voluminous court records, newspaper accounts, and whatever else is available. How she does this year after year, producing riveting volume after riveting volume is the greatest mystery of all. If you have never read Ann Rule this book on Ted Bundy is the place to start."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"If you're a true crime aficionado then ths book is likely a must-read for you. As most people know by now, Ann Rule knew Bundy as a pleasant work colleague (at a suicide hotline, of all places) and friend before he was revealed to be a serial killer, and part of the book is devoted to her first-person interactions with him. The book helped propel Rule to fame as a true-crime writer. It's a well-detailed book and is free of a lot of the seeming hyperbole that characterizes some of Rule's other works - rather than constantly touting how \\"evil\\" Bundy is, Rule actually seems to downplay some of the awful aspects of his crimes. Because Rule shows that Bundy could act very pleasant and \\"normal\\" through her first-hand recountings, the book is especially chilling and sheds light on the behavior of psychopaths and how the killer got away with his crimes for so long, in a way that her other books do not. This is definitely one of Rule's more interesting and readable books, maybe in part because the Bundy story is more interesting, twisted and full of surprises than the average criminal's history."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"This book is an excellent read as it shows Ted Bundy through a person who thought she knew him but in fact didn't..The pain she felt when she as a friend had to choose between being loyal to him and at the same time having to realise that he was a cold blooded monster..It's after reading this book that I realise Ted could have done so much better with his life..He destroyed others and in the end himself..He was in so much pain but instead of seeking help,he decided to inflict more pain on others..What a waste of life!!Ann did an excellent job in writing this book & I hope one day she'll realise that there was nothing she could have done to help her friend Ted as in the end he chose his own fate.."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Ann Rule did a great job in reporting the true story of Theodore Robert Bundy. However, she often deviated from the story to talk about her personal life. The sections in where she wrote about herself interupted the flow of the novel. I beleive she tried to credit herself too much throughout the book. in some parts of the novel there was too much of a description. Some things could have been written better with fewer words. The overall story of Ted Bundy was awesome. The story itself was intriging and interesting to read. A.Paul"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"I HAVE READ MANY OF ANN RULES BOOKS AND I TRULY THINK THIS ONE IS ONE OF HER BEST. WHEN YOU ARE READING THIS, YOU ALMOST FORGET THAT YOU ARE READING NON-FICTION. IT'S COMPLETELY RIVETING AND YOU WILL FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PUT IT DOWN."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Ann Rule is a wonderful author and this is an amazing story. I couldn't help myself from turnig the pages. Ted Bundy is a horrible man, but was very bright and knew what he was doing. That's scary. This is one book that I could read over and over again."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"I am going to give this book 2 stars for some effort, but because the book was not only faulty in some areas but also there was some very unnecessary information about Ann Rule's friendship with Bundy. The bottom line is who cares if she worked with him and was friends with the guy? That doesn't make her any more qualified to write about him then anyone else. Miss Rule adds to much conjecture and her own personal opinion.Miss Rule also plays hard and loose with some of the facts. For instance she states that James Dobson (who interviewed Bundy just hours before his execution) is an evangelist and preacher. That's simply not true, Dr. Dobson graduated with a PHD from USC in psychology and is a fully licensed psychologist in California. He worked as the head of the pediatrics division of USC for 14 years. She calls him an evangelist because he has a radio show called Focus on the Family and is a Christian man. To me this sounds of sour grapes that Miss Rule didn't get the interview with Bundy. She also states that Bundy and Dr. Dobson had been \\"corresponding for years.\\" That is also not true. Ted Bundy had contacted James Dobson two years prior and wanted to schedule an interview.Finally Miss Rule states at least umpteen times that she had never seen anything strange in Bundy's personality or behavior when she was friends with him. This is so predictable, in that how many times do we have to hear that some creep who has killed people was \\"normal\\" and a very \\"nice guy?\\" The fact that Miss Rule didn't detect any abberation in Bundy's behavior is insignificant. Ann Rule says that she was completely shocked when Bundy began to confess, as if she still held to the belief that he was an innocent man being rail roaded until then, give me a break. I guess the only way that Miss Rule would have considered him weird or odd is if he was exposing himself while doing back flips.I was hoping to find more about Bundy's childhood and information into the investigation and trial. Ann Rule continues to give her opinion when it is not needed nor wanted. I don't care one iota that she knew him and I certainly don't think it is mysterious that she knew him. The guy had tons of friends and it is inevitable that someone would have written about their personal knowledge of one of the worst serial killers of the 20th century.If you are looking for insight into the investigation and why Bundy did this, don't waste your time with this book. It is too long, and Ann Rule spends way too much time talking about what she thinks and the times that she spoke with Bundy in her personal life. It's about as interesting and if I wrote about my conversations with my co-workers throughout the past year. It's boring.I would recommend \\"The only living witness\\" over this. Ann Rule used to write articles for detective magazines. Her writings are evident of that. Sorry to say but this reminded me of a trash novel."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"I do not know what it is about Ann Rule's writing style , but i just can not seem to get caught up in her books. And i really want to read a book on Ted Bundy. I have picked this up more than once trying to get into it but it just seems to drag for me. However i would prefer that to the embellishment so many \\"true\\" crime writers seem to put into their books. One day i am going to force myself to read this and maybe i will feel differently once i get through the whole book."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"THIS STORY KEPT ME ON THE EDGE OF MY SEAT.

I HAVE BEEN READING TRUE CRIME FOR ABOUT 4 YEARS AND THIS IS NO DOUBT, ONE OF THE BEST!"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Far too sympathetic a portrayel of Ted Bundy. The book has a wistful what-might-have-been tone to it.Ms. Rule claims that Bundy walked on his own two feet to his execution. A report from the prison, perhaps published after Ms. Rule's book, said that his legs collapsed and he was carried to his death. It would be nice to know he felt even a fraction of the fear he gave his victims."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Book is unbeliveable...no one would feel that way about a killer!! Even after she found out he was a killer she still was defending him!!"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Okay read. Sometimes rambled a bit in the foreward and conclusion. The storytelling was good; the facts clear. The book got off a bit when the author tried to justify her personal position in the Bundy case."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"I purchased this book as \\"acceptable. It was nearlybrand new. ALSO, it came in a very timely manner.thank you.."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"This was the first &quot;True Crime&quot; book I had ever read. I was drawn in to Ann and the story within the first few pages. Ann writes without the gore, so you don't have to worry about a week stomach. I still think about this store. It made me recheck all my locks on my windows even when my husband was home. Ted could be anyone, and Ann tells the story like only she can. You feel her struggle with her own feelings as she comes to realize that this &quot;friend&quot; is really a mad man who has killed all these girls, then thinking back to the nights they worked together alone! It will bring chills to you, because Ted was just a regular guy, like maybe that guy you work next to!!!!! All of her books are wonderful, I have read them all and am now a &quot;true crime&quot; reader, but this book is also a personnal account she tells so well."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"While reading Stranger Beside Me, I realized as I was constantly on the edge of my seat, that all of us have that weak spot, whether it be for a good book or a handsome man. I found the truth of Rules book ,on basic human behavior, to be bone chilling. Bundy was an average looking man with a wicked mind, but no one realized until it was too late!"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"A true sociopath. Ted Bundy could sell snow to the people in Alaska on the coldest day. But then, Mr. Bundy was no doubt the coldest man on the face of this earth. Ann Rule gave him the benefit of the doubt, never knowing how close to &quot;Mr. Death&quot; she was. With all her years of training, this sociopath fooled even the experts. No doubt that Mr. Bundy will remain in the history as the &quot;alltime&quot; person you NEVER want to sit next to. He never showed remorse even on his last day here on earth. &quot;Who,me&quot;? He will always believe that he was the &quot;perfect&quot; man. A true sociopath."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"I got this book because I was doing a psychology paper on Bundy and I loved it. I even got the movie. Im still reading it but I love it. Thanks Michelle"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"I first found out about this monster Bundy back in 1982 in a Reader's Digest article when I was a teenager . For many reasons,this case was one of my motivations for pursuing a career in law enforcement.This book by Ann Rule revealed many things that I never knew before about Bundy.He was arrogant and acted like he was the victim instead of the poor young women and girls whose lives he violently ended.Bundy not only manipulated his victims but also women he had friendships and relationships with,including Ann.Bundy faded from memory somewhat after he was justly executed in January 1989,(which I celebrated)but recently his horrible antics resurfaced when someone mentioned his name.This book, as disturbing and disgusting it is to read about Bundy's rampage,it is also very hard to put this book down.I was once again reminded what a demon possessed loon this guy was.He turned many lives upside down without any human feelings of any kind. In my opinion,he is in the same class as Osama Bin Laden,a brutal terrorist who met his demise to the cheers of many who long awaited justice."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"tells the story of ted budy with the use of facts but also manages to humanize him."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"As always, with Ann Rule, This book is written in a very organized way, which is what I really like about this author. I don't think any other true crime writer flows as easily as she does, while managing to get in all of the facts and informaiton. So I was completely enthralled in the book. But...I couldn't give it 5 stars because there was something picking at my brain, bothering me as I read this book, but I could not put my finger on it. I don't share the opinion that she exploited this whole nightmare, just for her own gain. I think it was just that I could not connect the actual depth of their relationship to her willingness to be unsure of his guilt, in light of all of the facts. When I say \\"all of the facts,\\" I do understand that she was not privy to all of the information that the authorities had. But even being privy to what would ONLY have been released to the public, logic tells me that she had to know he was guilty. At the very least, she had to know this by the time he had escaped from jail the 2nd time. Ann Rule had been a former cop. She was a TRUE CRIME WRITER. I find that those two facts largely outweigh the depth of her relationship with Bundy. When a parent, sibling, child, etc., cannot seperate themselves from the blaringly obvious, it is understandable, if not frustrating. But I didn't gleen that deep of a relationship between Bundy and Rule, even though there are several times during the book that she is quick to point out her self-struggle with her involvement (i.e., the counseling she sought) which I believe she portrayed genuinely. I just can't shake the feeling that somehow, we were misled to think she was in this denial so that it could justify her loyalty to him, and the longevity of her ability to share humor with him through his letters instead of being repulsed by the idea of it. These are just my feelings and my impressions, which I'm SURE will be scrutinized by her loyal fans. So I will end with a reminder that I did give this book 4 stars, or as I prefer to look at it--almost 5. This book deserves them."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"I am 28 and so was only a young girl when Bundy was executed. I had heard of him, but was not familiar with the extent of his crimes. Working in the forensic field, I am fascinated with the stories of true crime and serial killers. I am an avid reader but sometimes it is hard for me to find non-fiction books that really hold my attention. Not the case with this book. I received this book for my birthday and started it as soon as I finished the book I was reading at the time. I couldn't put it down!The original book ended before Bundy was executed but there are several follow-ups at the end that really carry the story through to today. Because Rule knew Bundy, she is able to provide much insight and goes above and beyond just the facts.I highly recommend this book if you are at all interested in knowing more about one of the most notorious serial killers of all time."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"So I am a bit of an alarmist, but honestly, Ann Rule's account of her friendship with Ted Bundy is riveting. Perhaps that word is overused, but it is entirely accurate to describe this story. Even if true crime is not your first literally passion, give this book a chance. Rule is magnificent."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Great book, I love Ann Rule's writing, she holds nothing back. She has fast become my favorite true crime author."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Ann Rule's book is an exhaustive examination of Ted Bundy. Originally published in 1980, it was published again with an update in 1989 after Bundy's execution, again in 2000, and the current version is dated April 2008. Rule has updated the book as new information has come in. With the recent release of Bundy's DNA (July 2011) it is possible some of the unsolved murders Bundy is suspected of committing may be solved. If so, then Ms. Rule will undoubtedly have to come out with another, updated version of this book pending further developments. This is a case, where, like the perpetrator himself, secrets have only been given up grudgingly but thanks to modern forensic science it appears we will have a fuller picture of the man and his misdeeds. At over 600 pages, not an easy or quick read, but an incisive portrait of a manipulative and psychopathic individual who appeared driven by impulses he did not understand or could not control and who had no remorse or contrition for his crimes."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"I've worked in prisons most of my adult life. I have looked many killers in the eyes...some who committed crimes as disturbing as Bundy's. You can see it in most of them. The most disturbing thing about Bundy is the fact that most people couldn't see it. Even his friend, Ann Rule, didn't see it.\\"The Stranger Beside Me\\" by Ann Rule is a brilliantly constructed book. It's amazing how she transitions from not knowing anything about the murders to not believing the murders to accepting that her friend, Ted, was a serial killer. It's shocking and interesting to read. This book includes a lot of details that I never heard anywhere until I read Rule's book.I rank this book as possibly the greatest true crime book ever written. It might be second to \\"Helter Skelter\\". I enjoy all of Rule's work, but this one is different. Her personal connection to the subject makes it even more disturbing. It's brilliant. Her very rounded background and relationship with Bundy give a perspective that we'll probably never see again in another book. I recommend it to anyone who likes reading crime books. It reads like a novel, only it's more difficult to stomach. It's real."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"I got interested in the Ted Bundy saga after watching a movie about his life. I've read one other book about him: The Only Living Witness: The True Story of Serial Sex Killer Ted Bundy.This one by Ann Rule differs insomuch as Ann actually had a real life working relationship with Ted at the crisis clinic in Seattle prior to his national infamy. This puts Ann in a unique position to comment on the Ted that Ted let her see. Amiable, smart, good looking, sharp etc she uses all the metaphors one would never tie to a serial killer of such magnitude or, a serial killer in general.Ann walks us through the time line of Ted Bundy from his early days with a seemingly brilliant career ahead of him to his final days where all hope for his life had run out. I enjoyed this book slightly more than the one I mentioned above as Ann offers some background to Ted only someone who knew him could. This allows the reader to peek into the mind of someone who, reluctantly, you have to assume is mad.She admits to being taken by his charm and charisma as were so many others with tragic consequences. She shares letters written between her and Ted when Ted was incarcerated before and after his convictions.She also talks us through her internal battle to come to the realization that yes, the Ted she knew was capable of the horrific crimes he was accused of. Ann was an up and coming crime writer who had connections, along with the respect, of various police agencies and this relationship made her privy to key people involved in the Bundy saga. She gives us the benefit of her conversations with the key people and offers us her personal opinion based on the facts presented and her own internal thoughts based on the man she thought she knew.I especially enjoyed the part of the book which came after Bundy's conviction for murder. Ann outlines all the appeals and what they were based on. These appeals kept Ted alive for some 9 - 10 yrs AFTER being found guilty of murder and sentenced to death in Florida's \\"sparky\\" electric chair. Also, Ted's overwhelming arrogance and disregard for anyone but himself are bought into view as he tried to engineer his own defense which included firing one after the other public defenders and his partaking in court room theatrics usually reserved for Hollywood.I deducted one star due to the fact I felt the book was finished about 100 pages before it actually did. Ann offers too much post opinion and rehashes her thoughts which basically added little to what had already been written. Still, I thoroughly enjoyed the book and would recommend it as a valuable narration on a dark, dark human being who could easily be termed \\"evil\\" personified."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"For a brief period in the early 1970's struggling writer and single mom Ann Rule worked as a volunteer at a suicide hotline. On at least some evenings she worked the phone bank, she was in the company of a college student named Ted Bundy, Bundy was pleasant company and good at his job. They became casual friends. And they both moved on, Rule to her career as a free-lancing true-crime writer (under the pseudonum \\"Andy Stack\\"), Bundy to various jobs in and out of Washington State government and also law school.One of the stories that Rule became involved in was the serial killer stalking the college campuses of Washington and some adjoining states; the victims were all vivacious young women in their early 20's with long, center-parted hair. It was on the day of this killer's most brazen attacks, kidnapping two women from a state park packed with thousands of people, that he finally acquired a name. \\"Ted.\\" (The name he gave to several young women he attempted to persuade to help him with a non-existent boat, his arm in a sling).Like more than a few people in the Seattle area, Rule noted Bundy's resemblance to the witness sketches, not to mention the name, and wasn't quite able to shove it to the back of her mind. Like these other people, she eventually went to the police and felt deeply embarrassed later.And then, Bundy was arrested in Utah for kidnapping and assault, and soon there were charges in Colorado for murder, and soon Rule, despite her friendship with Bundy, and his insistence that this was all a mistake, began to wonder if he was the Seattle \\"Ted.\\"He was. And he claimed victims in Utah, Colorado, Iowa (confessed only in the days before his execution), and Florida--including a pre-pubescent girl, Kimberly Leach. Rule does a smart, restrained job of chronicling the various investigations (she doesn't dwell on lurid details), and draws fast, vivid portraits of the women Bundy killed and does a powerful job of chronicling the ripples of misery and destruction that spread out from him as he drifted about the country.Several people have complained that there is too much of Rule in the book, but her presence is necessary; one of the major themes of the book is how little we may actually know about people we think we know well, and the deep turmoil of emotions that this stirs up. Rule writes intelligently and movingly about the emotional tug-of-war that Bundy stirred up in her, a conflict that will probably never be finally resolved."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"I have been reading Ann Rule books for several years but never got around to reading The Stranger Beside Me. I owned the book, but kept putting it aside to read other books. After reading her Green River book, I decided to finally read the book about Ted Bundy.Now, to preface my rating, I must tell you that in 1974 I moved to Florida with my family just after my high school graduation. I worked for few years going to community college before enrolling at Univ of Fla in 1978. This was the year that Ted Bundy came to Florida, to FSU, just up the road. I had never heard of him until the murders and the trial, but by then I was a student at U of F. It was horrifying and yet for us college students, a bit surreal. We took it seriously but then we really didn't. We still propped open our dorm doors at night so people could get in without keys. We still walked alone around campus at night. We were stupid and even the horror of Ted Bundy did not shake us up. So this is probably why I bought this book and didn't really want to read it... it was real and I was so close to it. I could have been one of his victims, all of us in college during those times could have been his victim, and it is hard to swallow.The book I am rating as 5 stars even though I don't believe it is her best book. It was her first real book and since she herself was a main character, I can imagine how difficult it must have been to write. I give her big kudos for going through with it, knowing the kind of criticism she was going to receive. The books has its flaws but I think it was a story that needed to be told and the fact she was right there as a part of it makes it a great book. If you are a True Crime buff, like me, you need to read this book. The story is important, but also the lesson that we can be so close to evil and not know it is important. Ann Rule was an experienced investigator and cop and yet she didn't see the evil inside of him. That fact makes it easier to understand why family members of so many \\"killers\\" can't believe the truth, even when confronted with the facts. Sometimes we can't see evil, we are too close."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"As I sat reading Ann Rule's riveting book, it occured to me that this piece of crime writing is actually a classic in American literature. Some may not agree. How many people can start to write about grisly murders and find out that a true friend that used to work by her side was the actual killer? This book takes one into the deepest,darkest, sickest recesses of Bundy's mind and lays him out for what he is, a creature that was unstoppable and who really could not stop himself from these horribly gruesome crimes. One even comes, at times, to care for Ted Bundy, and then just in time, realizes that you are caring for a monster, so sick that words can't describe him. I very much like true crime books, but this one is king of all that have been written and Ann Rule is the queen of her genre. Just beware before you read it. You will never be the same."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Ann Rule has masterfully written about Ted Bundy, her friend who also lays claim to being one of the worst serial killers in history.She elaborates on her background in law enforcement as a former police officer with family in law enforcement. Another aspect that sets her apart from most true crime authors is her training in crime scene investigations and her participation in crime expert seminars.In a strange twist of irony the author had signed a contract to write a book about the murders with no hint that the killer was someone that she knew.\\"The Stranger Beside Me\\" shows the contrasts in Ted Bundy- a very intelligent, politically connected seemingly charming man with a bright future and caring personality. Beneath all of that was a master conman and brutal murder fixated on a still unknown number of victims that fit a specific physical appearance. He was manipulative, thrived on media attention, and ultimately seemed to fear the end result that he meted out to his victims: death. He sure tried everything he could to avoid or postpone the death sentence he earned.What makes this book a true crime classic is the personal connection and insight that Ann Rule had with Ted Bundy. She tells the story not just as a writer, but an author that knew members of both sides of the investigation; the killer and many of the law enforcement members that worked the cases. An excellent book!"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"I would guess that this book is the best known and most read/popular book on Ted Bundy.Ann Rule was certainly in a unique position to write it. And she did a fantastic job doing it.Nobody can say that Ms. Rule isn't a talented writer or that this book isn't fascinating, gripping reading.I'm fascinated by Ted . I think I always will be. No other serial killer has ever held my interest and attention like he has.And I know that that thousands of others feel the same way.I normally read fast but it took me over a week to finish this because I could only take so much of the subject matter at once.I just finished it a few hours ago and I feel deeply shaky and emotional right now.I feel horror,disbelief,and extreme sadness for everyone involved here, but especially for both Ted and his victims.The whole thing is a complete, utter tragedy from start to end.How sad that so many young women were taken in the very prime of life,and how sad that Ted , a man with so much potential , was driven by an uncontrollable, compulsive mental sickness to kill them.Its also wrenching that so many of the girls were never found and were never able to have a final resting place other than wherever they were dumped at.I like almost everyone who has ever heard about these killings wish that it had never happened and that both Ted and the victims were still out there alive, living happy anonymous lives.As much as I like the book, there are a few things I'd like to mention:On the night before Ted's execution,Ann bitterly thinks to herself that she doesn't owe Ted anything. I have to disagree.I'd say that Ann owes Ted a great deal when it comes down to it.As much as I know that Ann was grieved and sickened by these murders and the fact that they were done by someone she considered a friend and as much as I know that she'd give everything up to have had none of it ever happen, the fact is that this book made her career.Ann was always a talented crime writer, but the fact that she knew Ted Bundy and has such a fascinating ,insider track in which to write a book about him with, made her career.It plucked her out of obscurity to become a hugely popular and successful true crime writer.Without Ted Bundy, I doubt that she would have achieved this level of success.I disgree with Ann's support of the death penalty, but I give her credit for not celebrating the execution and condeming the revelers outside the prison who did.Finally, its very hard to get a grip on how Ann actually feels about Ted now.The events in this book stretched for almost 30 years total(longer now,but 2000 was the last update},so of course her feelings changed over time.Even in later years though, her feelings seem to waffle.Sometimes she seems to almost hate him and says that she had kept hoping for a long time that the interest in Ted would die down, so she'd never have to think about him again.At other times, even though she denounces him as a psychopath who had no conscience and could have never been cured, sometimes she seems to retain some tenderness for him.Maybe she herself is still conflicted deep down about her feelings.In closing, Mrs.Rule does an excellent job in bringing to life many of the young women who were Ted's victims.I found many things out about them and their lives that I didn't know.Its always nice to see a portrait painted of someone instead of them just being a name and number on a victims list."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"In all the years since the murders by Bundy and his subsequent execution, I never read this book until now. The mind is a very mysterious organ. How is a murderer like Bundy created? Is it in his genes?At this time in Phoenix, AZ we have been experiencing the deeds of two sets of serial killers. Fortunately one pair of murderers have been apprehended. Of course we don't know the whole story behind them but it seems their life experiences are rather average. So what creates the murderer?I enjoyed (maybe wrong word) reading \\"The Stranger Beside Me\\" but it's still beyond my comprehension how someone can so compartmentalize their life.The last addendum was also interesting in that Ms. Rule is still receiving stories from \\"almost\\" victim of Bundy. We'll never know how many there truly were."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"As a fiction, the story would seem a bit far-fetched, so possibly the most amazing thing about it all, is that every word of this is truth. The author's angle on the case, having been a close friend of the seemingly benevolent Bundy, tremendously enhances the book. Bundy's unspeakable acts are chilling enough in themselves, but his dual-nature, expertly portrayed by Mrs. Rule, is equally as eerie. Mrs. is extremely objective in her portrait of Bundy and manages to capture both sides of his personality, the facade and the real man (and the places where the line between these two sides seems to blur). Mrs. Rule's masterpiece unquestionably ranks, along with such extraordinary works as the incomparable and never to be topped In Cold Blood and the recent masterpiece Devil in the White City, within the top 10 true crime books ever written."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Ann Rule was Ted Bundy's friend..indeed she might have seen him for a time as little brother, replacing the one who tragically killed himself. I've read many a book on crime, but never has the author known the subject so well. It lends a fascinating and spooky feel to the narrative. The book is a bit long and can be a bit slow at points, but that is bound to happen when the last 100 pages or so are updates (from '86, '89, and '00). Nevertheless, the Bundy shown is the whole man. I think that is incredibly important. Some will argue that Bundy is strictly a monster and should not be humanized. I disagree. What makes Bundy (and those like him) so terrifying is their very humanity. And their ability to so easily destroy the humanity of others."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"I know many are going to disagree with me, but this book about Ted Bundy wasn't all that great. There's a good deal of Bundy's biography here, but the relationship touted in the book regarding Ann Rule's friendship with Bundy seems, to me, to be stretching it for what she can. So she worked with the guy for a bit and then stayed in contact with him over the years... so what. That's like any of us writing a book about someone you worked with at a job you had in college. Rule seemed to be straining to show that she knew Bundy and were dear friends. I just didn't pick that up in this book. She seemed to be grasping to show she knew him. Otherwise, the book is a very good biography of a twisted man and his demented actions.Another thing that bothered me about this book is the softness of it. Let me explain; in I-5 Killer, Want-Ad Killer, and Lust Killer, the author lays out the crime scene and actions as you go along in those books, giving details of what happened in the various assaults and crimes. The author avoided doing that this time, simply noting that so-and-so disappeared on this date or was found in this condition. Rather than giving the scenario and actions of the crimes, Rule glazes over them until the Chi Omega house assault, almost as if she were trying to convince herself that Bundy didn't do these crimes.Overall, its a good book to biograph Bundy, but the author dwells on what seems to be a self-convincing thought process that her and Bundy were best buddies or childhood friends and spent dozens of years together rather than one time coworkers that stayed in touch. The whole court scenes are drawn out and appear to be space fillers but none-the-less it was certainly readable."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Ann Rule's 1980 true crime memoir is the gold standard for the last three decades of crime non-fiction. Rule holds a unique position as a renowned crime journalist and first-person participant in the life of prolific serial murderer Ted Bundy. The pair were co-workers and confidantes at a Seattle crisis hotline in 1971, just years before Bundy's killing and mutilation of young women ramped up in multi-state sprees. Rule was older than her friend, in the process of a divorce in 1971, and served as a motherly figure to the handsome man who charmed so many others around the nation (even after his conviction). Throughout his jailings on suspicion of burglary, kidnapping, attempted murder, and murder, Bundy reached out to his old friend via phone calls and letters. She was upfront with him about her book contract negotiates and her desire to transition from a magazine journalist to book author with a story about Bundy.The story is as much an exploration of Bundy's childhood, troubled life, complex relations with women, and crime as it is a meditation on friendship. Detectives in the first cases against Bundy asked to see his letters to Ann, and she sought psychiatric help to sort out her feelings on the matter. She was friends with the police, who trusted her not to prematurely reveal crime details and to whom she pointed out interstate connections between various crimes (both Bundy- and non Bundy-related), but she also felt a loyalty to her friend. She wondered if she was exploiting Bundy to advance her own career and secure a financial future for her children. After careful contemplation, Rule determined that regardless of Bundy's guilt, she would keep writing to him, she would provide a friendly ear, and therefore she was not using him. In fact, she realized she might be one of his few true friends, and the only female not under his manipulative spell (Bundy maintained several simultaneous long-term girlfriends while he was imprisoned).No one knows how many murders Bundy committed (he made a dozen deathbed confessions but refused to comment on any child murders). In her book, Rule, who long wrestled with Bundy's claims of innocence in the face of overwhelming circumstantial evidence, enumerates exactly which crimes she thinks Bundy is guilty of. She also describes her theory that Bundy's murders stemmed from the rejection he felt from a socialite college sweetheart (his victims all bore a striking resemblance to his one-time fianc&eacute;e). Rule is in a unique position to describe Bundy both objectively and subjectively, and her book is an absolute must-read. The twentieth anniversary edition contains both 1989 and 2000 updated on the evidence against Bundy and the culture of true crime and justice in America."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"After studying what makes a serial killer the way he is/was... I had a lot of books on Ted Bundy, but they were only by Chroniclers, men who were journalists, who only wanted to chronicle Ted's crimes as he sat on death row, they never knew him personally... and had made their judgments of his crimes in that manner... they didn't know the OTHER SIDE of Ted Bundy. Just the person he became sitting on Death Row.This is the first Ann Rule book I bought ever. She gives insight that other journalists that have \\"talked to bundy on death row\\" have not. She not only gives insight as a True Crime Writer and friend of every police precinct in Washington, but she also gives insight as a close friend and co-worker (in a Crisis Center) of Ted Bundy.We not only see how Ted was before and after he was caught in 3 states, but also what she thought of him during those times. She never sensationalize Ted the Monster, nor catered to \\"Poor Boy Ted\\", she just stated what she witnessed of him, and news articles on him.I must admit though, of all the serial killers I have books on from Women Who Kill to Jack Olsen's books... this one... after I was finished reading the last page, I couldn't go to sleep, I was wondering what would I do if someone came through my window, and didn't sleep well at all. The frightening thing about this book... is... What would you do in Ann's situation if you suspected, and knew there were investigations of serial sex murders on YOUR Best Friend... a very chilling account of \\"Ted Bundy As I Knew Him\\"-type of book. I highly recommend this."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Well, first of all, I don't really understand how the reader below said this portrayal was &quot;too sympathetic&quot;--why? Because it tried to portray Ted Bundy as a whole, complete individual? That's what makes this book work--showing that a person who can be as genuine and kind as any friend of ours can also secretly be one of the nation's worst serial killers. At any rate, in terms of the actual book, it's an engrossing story of Ted Bundy's life, with the added bonus of it being by someone who actually knew him. The personal touch didn't really contribute to a greater understanding of Ted, however; I don't think Ann Rule understands him any more than the average reader. What's most striking about this story is that both times he was caught (in Colorado and then in Florida), it was because he foolishly ran away whenever a cop happened along his path. It wasn't brilliant detective work that finally stopped him, it was chance. Pretty creepy!"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Even though \\"Stranger Beside Me\\" is a book about one of America's most notorious serial killers, it seemed overly long and inert--perhaps because it was written in the first person, and that person was Ann Rule. I put it down several times and had trouble picking it up again.The author had the perfect background for this story: she and Ted Bundy worked together as volunteers at the Seattle Crisis clinic in 1971; she was already a crime writer, and an ex-cop to boot; she was assigned to work on the case of the mysterious North-west killings long before Bundy was suspected of committing them. She also belonged to the same sorority (Chi Omega) where Bundy went on his next-to-the-last killing spree in Florida--the case that finally put him on death row.\\"Stranger Beside Me\\" has almost everything you might want to know about Theodore Bundy: his childhood; the shame he felt because he was illegitimate; his two escapes from prison; the murders he committed and those that he probably committed; the police who were involved in his case; the women who loved him; his court appearances; his confession; his death.However, the book also has a lot you might not want to know about the author: her bad dreams; her \\"extrasensory awareness of evil or danger\\" in various places connected with Bundy's murders; her feelings about his feelings; her on-again off-again loyalty to Bundy. There's a great deal of print taken up about how he was really tearing her up inside with all of his alleged wrong-doings, but I couldn't help wondering if the money she sent to him in prison played a role in his escape to Florida. I also couldn't help wondering if she stuck with him as long as she did (this is probably totally unfair) because of this book contract.Ann Rule does have a unique insight into the soul (if he had one) of a killer. This is definitely a one-of-a-kind true crime story. It's just that I feel it could have been tightened up and cut from 548 pages (the updated twentieth anniversary edition) down to around 350, or so by eliminating the author's personal psycho-dramas."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"This book reads like a preposterously coincidental fictionalized account of someone's acquaintence with serial killer Ted Bundy. It's a true story, which put my hackles on edge.Esteemed crime writer and former law enforcement officer Ann Rule KNEW Ted Bundy. She was FRIENDS with him. They SOCIALIZED. She sent him MONEY. As she was well older than he, and hardly fodder for his brutish obsession with tall, young, beautiful, long haired women, and the two developed an almost sibling-like rapport that spanned several years, his arrests in two states, and the entire North American continent.Throughout, Rule's memoir remains personal, which allows Ted's story to unfold without the grotesque and gruesome details that would drape a more traditional biography. We get to know this especially intelligent and creative young man, and to see him as he appeared to the world as one witty, amusing, and urbane. We see their friendship develop over time, watching it turn into a mutually enjoyable and important -- if at times long-distance -- friendship of mutual respect and regard.The same qualities allowed him to fool his victims, ensnaring them with nary a wimper or whine in their own defense. We hear the evolution of this crime wave of murder and abuse as Rule herself must have heard it: episodically, without full color details or explanations... yet with Ted-related coincidences too extreme for her to ignore, though too brutish to believe.Especially for the squeamish, I consider this book a fantastic chronicle. I am easily scared and very suggestible, but this book didn't give me nightmares, for Rule practically takes us by the hand and shares not Ted's story, but her perspective of Ted's story. Thus, we not only understand the dichotomy of Ted Bundy, but we share Rule's dawning horror as she realizes her friend, her correspondent, her attractive and amusing pal is, in fact, the insidious embodiment of evil who brutally and insidiously pillaged the lives of several dozen innocent young women.When Rule finally put together the idea of Ted with the reality of his crimes, she threw up. I wanted to do the same.This book is eye opening and enthralling. As our world becomes increasingly unstable and unpredictable, I find this book an important opportunity for the vicarious experience. Other Rule books are intriguing and compelling, but none of the others I have read lend the same scandalizing horror as this one. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"By far, the best book written about this mad man. Why? Because the author got to know the man behind the beast and tell his story as if we had known him. Ann Rule's account of the gripping murders brings to light how very close each one of us is to the horror and frightening reality of this world. This book never left me through the five or six times I have read it through...and it still sends chills up and down my spine. A must read for any true crime fan."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"The Stranger Beside Me, is told with infinite attention to detail and answers some of the questions that linger in our heads about the mysterious Ted Bundy, making this the most personal book about him. An unsettling, intensely personal inside look at one of the nation's most infamous serial killers, it gives an intriguing observation that will keep you spellbound as you hear much of Anne Rule's relationship with him. She recounts how she was an unsuspecting coworker (Seattle Crisis Center hotline operators) and a close friend whose suspicions multiply during his killing spree. He often sat beside her and shared thoughts, discussions and laughs with her. She is supportive and unsure of his guilt at first, but by the end she realizes he really is the wicked person committing these crimes. It's not surprising that Ms. Rule had no idea since he was one very clever individual. The adjectives to describe this book are too numerous to mention and once you read it, you will know why.Ted Bundy was many things: charming, witty, amiable, charismatic and polite. Most of all, however, he was a sociopath who killed with such rage and deliberation, this story will make you think twice about strangers who approach you in parking lots. I know he wasn't wired right, but I keep asking myself why? What REALLY made him tick? The account of Ted Bundy's killing spree at the sorority house gave me chills for awhile after reading it. He was, however, not the genius that some people make out to be: he couldn't finish law school and he chose to take his killing spree to Florida, of all places. The book also doesn't concentrate on his victims as statistics but gives them the respect and dignity they deserve in a culture that seems more fascinated with the killer than the victim."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Ann Rule's \\"The Stranger Beside Me\\" is probably the most frightening of all the accounts of Ted Bundy's murderous career. Why? Because Rule was a former policewoman, she considered Ted Bundy a co-worker and friend and never saw the sociopathic personality lurking behind his charming facade. As a society, I think we want to believe that we can easily spot those Bundys, Dahmers, Gacys . . . and Rule's book emphasizes the fact that we cannot. Those monsters blend in sometimes seamlessly with the rest of us.Rule's book does a huge service to Bundy's victims by recognizing them as more than just \\"Bundy victims\\". Reading about their dreams, their goals and their daily lives makes the horror of their deaths sting even more.Rule's sadness over the story comes through in nearly every page - - sadness at the loss of lives and sadness over what Bundy's life could have been and what he could have offered had he not been so consumed by murder. Having known Bundy before he became infamous as a serial killer, Rule gives insight into Bundy's personality and character, from his childhood, through his adolescence into his political and legal aspirations, all the while fostering a murderous rage toward women.An insightful book, one that makes you check and doublecheck your windows and doors and pray that you never cross the path of someone like Bundy.Definitely one of Rule's best books. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"This is the first Ted Bundy book i've read, but i am impressed with the amount of information and detail i have learnt about him.

Her conflict is evident, the book is well written and well researched. What a horrible tragedy for so many people!On the downside, I lent the book to a friend, and am now being blamed for her lack of sleep because she couldn't put it down.

How could she not after knowing Ted Bundy so well though right? This book is overloaded with detail which may bore some but adds all the backstory and behind the scenes info you need to be fully knowledgeable on Bundy's life, shortcomings and crimes.

It drives home the point that many serial killers don't look like monsters but rather the \\"guy next door\\". Women, I've read every book by Ann Rule and have learned, trust your gut and if something doesn't feel right, run. Don't feel guilty about turning down a strangers request for help for it may be a ruse. Thank you Ann Rule for this masterpiece into the mind of a serial killer."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"If you only read one True Crime book in your life, ''The Stranger Beside Me'' should be your choice. Author Ann Rule presents a chilling and disturbing portrait of one of American's most notorious serial killers, who just happened to be a good friend of hers. Rule's perspective on Ted Bundy's life, combined with her own writing skills, makes this book one of the best in its class.The author gives some background on Ted Bundy then traces her own meeting with him and their quick friendship. Bundy and Rule met while working late-nights at a crisis prevention center in Seattle. It was pure chance that a budding crime writer would be sitting right next to a budding mass murderer at the crisis clinic!Like many of Ted Bundy's college professors and other women, Rule found Ted to be highly intelligent, warm, caring, and handsome. Eventually they drifted apart as Ann began working on as a crime writer to document a string of recent murders in Washington state. The killings were horrific - young, attractive women were being abducted, raped, brutalized, and strangled to death. As Rule followed the cases as a professional, it slowly dawned on her that a young, male friend of hers fit the description of the killer!Rule follows Bundy's steps to Utah and Colorado, where more women are abducted and killed after he spent time in the area. Rule provides some background information on the victims that gives them life - instead of just being statistics. Most of them simply vanished while walking across a college campus or down a city street at night. Witnesses were few, but some remembered seeing a young man with a cast on his arm or leg, asking for help carrying something to his car.As the book progresses Rule covers Bundy's time in jail, legal battles, and his escape from custody and flight to Florida, where his manic killing spree re-emerges in a brief, 4-week flurry of attacks and killings. His final victim, one of about three dozen, was found dead in an abandoned hog shed, having been raped, beaten, and strangled. She was 12 years old.Reading a book this disturbing reminds me of how evil humans can be. Rule tackles the subject with seriousness and empathy, while at the same time not devaluing the victims with lurid descriptions of the crime scenes. I highly recommend The Stranger Beside Me, even though the killings were many years ago and Bundy has long since been executed for his crimes."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Ann Rule is the best true crime writer. She does not glorify or detail the crimes in a gory way. She always delivers the story with grace and compassion. This book is wonderfully written and the fact that she knew Ted is an extra bonus. Being from Florida this story was huge here. I highly recommend anything from Ann Rule."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"good book, well written. i thought bugliosi's book helter skelter was written better, but i still enjoyed this--definitely creepy! i want to read more true crime by ann rule since reading this!"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"I was looking forward to reading Ann Rule's - THE STRANGER BESIDE ME.Ann was in the unique position of having been friends with Bundy since 1971,working together at the graveyard shift of a Crisis Center. Ann wants to give us her slant of a man arrested for unspeakable acts of violence, yet seemed more to chronicle each detail of Ted's life which had me skipping ahead at times. This book I felt was way to long. A shorter more indepth study would have kept my attention.Ann postioned herself as a surrogate mother of sorts, beliving that if she was granted permission to speak with Ted, he might have stopped killing women. It reminds me of wanting to be best friends with the school bully. Ann does not want to share him.Ann writes well, yet I expected more insight to Ted Bundy, a master of disguise, a rogue, a murderer. She had at her fingertips the inside track so to speak, yet I came away dispointed. Ted was a sociopath, Ann could have provided a portrait of a monster, I got tired of reading how she \\"Just Could Not Believe Ted Was Capable of The Crimes For which he was Accused\\""},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"I read most of Ann Rule's work before this, her classic novel. One of my strongest impressions of her previous work has been the dignity and respect with which she writes about the victims. You can read the sympathy in her tone, though this sympathy never causes her to \\"sound\\" unbiased when describing the facts of the case. She also seems to describe the criminals in her book fairly dispassionately, though choosing adjectives and character traits that still allow her to express her overwhelmingly negative feelings about them.In The Stranger Beside Me, this familiar pattern falls apart. Understandably, her publishers wanted her to play up her friendship with Ted Bundy - and this she does. He is to Ann what I would consider a casual acquaintance, though she repeatedly calls him her \\"close friend\\". After working together at a Crisis Center telephone hotline and chatting between calls, they went their separate ways, remaining out of contact for years at a time. Once Bundy was arrested, a fugitive, re-arrested and finally tried and convicted, only during that progression did he seem to really re-enter Ann Rule's life, mostly (as far as I could read into the text of this book...) initiated by Ann herself.Her unique perspective into Ted Bundy's life and behavior could have made for a really fascinating book and character study, but somehow the latter goal was never reached. To her credit, Ann Rule never claimed to have any insight into Bundy's true character or personality. In fact, whether she intended this or not, her writing highlighted how very little she knew, suspected, sensed or intuited about him beyond the superficial. He was charming and handsome, she was a bit bewildered but also flattered by his friendship and correspondence. Now this may be because she was told to play up their friendship and as a consequence she repeated only what she knew: his whereabouts, his relationship with a certain woman, his cigarette brand preference - but as I read, I kept thinking: this wasn't a close friend of hers. She really didn't know him all that well.One more thing in that vein that I know has been covered in these reviews: I'm one of the readers who felt disappointed in the author's continued emotional support of Bundy even after it was clear he'd murdered many women, brutally and without conscience. After she was reasonably sure he was guilty she continued to send him money, to care about his emotional health, to write about him with compassion, to repeatedly describe his good looks, his smile, his eyes, his youthfulness, his intelligence.... I found this so distasteful at times I put the book down to think more about it. Even given that she was describing her own sense of disbelief that someone she knew could commit such crimes, she never seemed to pull back from a very caring, supportive tone when writing about him. She even only barely pulled back from the brink of seeming to make excuses for him and his \\"compulsion\\" to kill. I was uncomfortable with this, even as I acknowledged that what I was reading was a demonstration of how families of criminals can sit behind a mass murderer and still offer their love and support. Ann Rule demonstrates a mild case of this herself, and since I've gotten a feel for Ann through her previous work, I do have to acknowledge that this is how those irrational (seeming) feelings emerge.That said, the book was very readable though not as quick a read as some of her other stories. Yes, she still had compassion for the victims in her writing and she did a creditable job in describing the progression of events (though the flash-forwards and flash-backs were less cohesive than in her other work - I had to remind myself that though I'm reading this last, this is actually one of her earliest works). I tend to refer to the picture insets several times while reading one of her books - does the victim or the criminal look as I imagined, can you see any overt sign of malice in their eyes - and this book had several pictures I simply couldn't stop referring back to while asking: how could this have happened? how could he disguise such monstrous tendencies? would I have known this person had that potential if they approached me on the street?I found the final updated chapter revealing and thought provoking. Again I was disturbed by her admission that she continued to send Ted Bundy money in the hope that he would be comforted by it, comfortable, so that he could smoke... I again felt that this was so inappropriate I simply couldn't get my head around it. But that's me. You could still feel the ambivalence and confusion in her writing, and perhaps now, in 2009, ten years later, she's reached some kind of peace."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Ann Rule is my among my favorite writers, I read everything she has out there, her book on Bundy was chilling and one of the best on the subject"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"The most well known fact about this book is that its author - Ann Rule - knew Ted Bundy as a friend before he became the infamous killer he is remembered for. Naturally, this gives the whole book a special approach, and one that affects the author's very own point of view; negatively or positively, that's up to you to say, but I think she does a good job of it.What you get in this book is a good telling of the facts. It's a pretty long book, and it covers many interesting periods in Bundy's life.I would recommend it as a first book on Bundy. However, I have the impression that there was more to tell; specifically about the gruesome details of the cases. For instance, Ted did come back to the corpses of his victims and applied makeup to them; and according to his own confessions, he repeatedly came back to the bodies to perform necrophiliac sex and what not. I found very little on this in the book. Also, this is the first book on a serial killer where I have a really hard time to figure out the killer's personality. By which I mean. Bundy is obscure. He's definitely the most intelligent serial killer I read about, and believe me, the bulk of them are far from intelligent, despite glamorous Hollywoodian beliefs. Bundy had the brains, but his narcissistic issues still made him sound like a fool a times, as it never fails to do.A very interesting serial killer. I recommend this book for the unique point of view of its author and the thoroughly laid out timeline of the facts. Somehow, I feel there's more to be told, a lot more."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"From policewoman to author, someone who knew and actually sat next to and worked with Ted Bundy. She sure knew him well. This book is really long and has a lot of good details about the many years of crimes and the long times it took them to \\"capture\\" him-without him actually escaping. He was very devious! This is definitly NOT for anyone under 18-20, it has some very graphic accounts of what he did to the women, if you are squeemish, not the book for you."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Ann Rule really knows how to tell a story so the reader can feel every emotion! I had trouble putting this book down; then again, I had trouble falling asleep at night after reading it. The story is so detailed. I learned so much more to the Ted Bundy story than I remember seeing in the movie. Rule does a fabulous job of letting the reader get acquainted with the victims...you feel like you know them. And the fact that she knew Ted makes it even more scary. This was my first Ann Rule book, and I have purchased a few more of hers. I would highly recommend this book if you want to know everything about the most notorious serial killer of our time."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"This is an excellent true crime book. It has an unusual twist in that the author and the subject of the book, serial killer Ted Bundy, had a platonic relationship that arose from the time they were co-workers for a Seattle, Washington crisis center. Quite frankly, the author initially had no idea that Ted Bundy was anything other than what he appeared to be: a handsome, intelligent, charismatic, and articulate young man, who was, at the time, involved in local politics and later became a law student.When he became the suspect in the disappearance and murders of a number of very young, pretty women, the author was in total disbelief. As the evidence mounted against her friend, the author, who is a former police officer, could not shut her eyes to the reality that Ted Bundy was actually a very disturbed individual who was guilty of all of which he was accused and probably guilty of other such crimes for which he was not accused for evidentiary reasons. Consequently, the author would suffer some angst for many years, as she struggled to reconcile the Ted Bundy that she thought she knew with the fiend who was compelled to commit so many vicious abductions, assaults, and murders. It is believed that at least thirty-five young women, and probably a good number more, died at the hands of Ted Bundy.The author details the abductions, assaults, and murders of his victims from coast to coast, which crimes were ultimately to make Ted Bundy a nationwide household name, and an entity to be feared. The investigative efforts of law enforcement officers in the states of Washington, Utah, Colorado, and Florida are revealed, as are Ted Bundy's arrests and his trials. She also details his two escapes from custody in Colorado, the last of which would find him heading to the sunshine state of Florida.Florida was an interesting choice of state for Ted Bundy, as it is a death penalty state in which convicted felons, who have been given the death penalty, are actually executed. Notwithstanding Florida's stance on capital crime, Ted Bundy went on to commit a slew of shocking assaults and murders in Florida for which he was ultimately arrested, tried, and convicted. Considering the fact that Ted Bundy could have chosen to relocate to a state other than Florida after his last escape from custody in Colorado, it almost appears as if he had a death wish by going to Florida and continuing to give in to his sick compulsion. Unfortunately for him, Florida was quite happy to make his wish come true, and on January 24, 1989, Ted Bundy was executed, and his reign of terror was finally over.Those who like the true crime genre will enjoy this well-written and well-researched book. It is highly detailed and contains a great deal of information, some of it quite personal due to the author's relationship with Ted Bundy. She paints a very intriguing, intimate portrait of him, one that is three dimensional and complex. He was definitely a man whose benign and compelling external visage was at odds with his many internal demons, as he was a prolific serial killer. Externally, Ted Bundy was the sort of man towards whom women gravitated, and there was no dearth of Ted Bundy groupies once he made headlines.The interested readers should consider buying the twentieth anniversary edition of this book, rather than any of the older editions. The anniversary edition contains updates of the Ted Bundy story in which the author theorizes as to why Ted Bundy, a young man of so much promise, would end up the way that he did, and she provides some interesting and personal familial information from which the reader may draw his or her own conclusion. All in all, aficionados of the true crime genre will find much of interest in this book."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"My Mom bought me this books years ago when I was still enjoying my summers at the beach with high-school and college friends - none of my friends could understand my anxieties -UNTIL THEY READ THIS BOOK - he could have been anyone of the guys we met - on the beach, the boardwalk, the bars or parties, we were still carefree in a sense, but we had this knowledge in the back of our heads - we never travelled home alone again...if we even attempted too (while in relaxed state of mind) we were quickly reminded of the name Ted Bundy - it was enough to make us wait for someone to walk home with you...

How incredible is that? I have never read a book even half the length as this one, but I could not put it down. In fact, I read it twice. Erie, creepy, action-packed, and downright amazing, even if you are sickened by the grotesque acts of this brutal criminal."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"I am not going to attempt to summarize this book when so many others have reviewed it before me. However, Ann Rule has done an exceptional job of covering her experiences with Ted Bundy as a co-worker and as one who corresponded with Mr. Bundy through numerous letters after he left the state of Washington. Sadly, Mr. Bundy often appealed to the goodness in others in getting them to help him when he appeared handicapped with a cast on an arm or a leg prior to killing them. Ted Bundy is the classic example of how it has become impossible to trust even the most sincere person who has a desire to help another individual. Ted Bundy has shown there is no stereotypical individual as to what a serial killer should look like. The book is 456 pages long, but it certainly makes for gripping reading. I would not, however, want to read another book on Ted Bundy. This one was enough."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"I did not enjoy this book - I felt that Ms. Rule WAS in love with Ted Bundy and the fact that he wanted everyone but her, scorned her in the end. She &quot;had&quot; a poor writing style there are extreme inconsistancies in her grammar - and she rambled for pages and pages about uninteresting topics and people related to law enforcement. I did not find her book insightful at all and do not recommend it."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"too much about ted bundy, not enough about the victims. countless books have been written about this bundy parasite and nothing written about the victims except their death. ann seems to be honering bundy for some stupid reason. she almost tries to make excuses for him"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed &quot;The Stranger Beside Me.&quot; However, before I began reading, I was expecting something totally different. I was expecting a story of about someone and their crimes, etc. - what a normal true crime story usually goes through. What I wasn't expecting was the inner torment of the author on whether or not she should believe her friend.I can understand that Ann Rule was friends with Ted Bundy and that caused torment for as she hunted for the &quot;Ted&quot; murderer and wrote her book, but this book about SOMEONE ELSE was written in the first person - and not from Ted's point of view. It's all about her thoughts and feelings as things are happening in the Ted case and what she's going through.The book was insightful because she actually knew Ted as a person - sociopath that he was. She felt that she could trust him and share with him. I do understand that would put anyone in an uncomfortable position when you find out someone is a serial killer and, yes, it should be mentioned in said book about this serial killer you are writing about. However, it should not be the basis of the entire book.Read it for the information on Ted, but try to ignore the fact that the book is more about Rule than him."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"With her meglomaniacal need to insert herself for profit into personal tragedy, A. Rule had the audacity to re-release this thing with a new preface. It should be retitled \\"A Folly of Two\\" or \\"Shared Chilled Chablis\\" anyone? Or is that \\"Killed Hablis\\"...Ms. Rule produces letters they exhanged, this from Ted to Ann (emphasis mine):I send you this kiss,DELIVER THIS BODY to hold,I sleep with you tonight,with words of love untold,I would love you if I might,with WORDS THAT UNFOLD,these arms to PRESS YOU TIGHT.The banality of their exchanges produces the horror of this narrative - certainly NOT the quality of Ms. Rule's writing. If she'd gushed the adjectives brilliant, handsome, and tall anymore times somebody should've atleast thrown a thesaurus at her. At the same time, Rule's descriptions of the victims is lacking in depth that borders on coldness and jealosy.And what's up that Bundy kills girls in a Chi Omega sorority house which just happens to be Ms. Rule's pledge? She comments on their \\"intertwined fates\\" like it's all some romantically twisted coincidence. GAG.Anyway, chapter 22, pg. 231 paperback, suggests a powerful incentive to a sociopath. $$$!. In that chapter Ms. Rule details the book \\"deal\\" she'd made with Bundy sometime after they worked together at the \\"help\\" line (where vulnerable females commonly called in) that specified more $ to him for each additional chapter he wrote. Translate chapter into victim - a common format for true crime books - and you get a chilling picture. Ms. Rule was working for pulp true detective magazines (not working for the FBI as her early PR said) at that time and trying to get more money because her husband was dying.OK, this isn't just a trash Ann Rule review. The writing is mediocre and trite, as with all her books. The horror of Ted Bundy's swath through the seventies and her proximity to the case(s) is what makes the book interesting in a vicarious way, but even more interesting is looking for clues of their bizarre relationship. I'd love to get a hold of the classified sections of Washington newspapers from that period of his incarceration, and even before. Both of their oft repeated phrase \\"chilled chablis\\" takes on new meaning if one changes the first letters. Homo hablis is a branch of early man, habilis meaning something like \\"tool user\\" - like a club. There are plenty of double entendres and other word \\"games\\" to keep the amateur sleuthe busy trying to unravel Ms. Rule's psyche."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Ann Rule got lucky with this one in that she just happened to be associated with Ted Bundy when they worked together at a crisis clinic. If not for Bundy, Ann Rule would have gone nowhere as a writer. She has no sense of imagination or pace, and her books are always BORING! If you want to read a really great true crime author, read anything by Jack Olsen, may he rest in peace."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"I found the book to get a little slow at times because of the legal storyline, but still a strong five star read. This book really kept me going. If your reading this review and have an interest in people who do terrible acts of violence to other human beings, then I recomend this book. There are actually people out there like Ted Bundy - a true human monster. Scary!"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"One of the best true-crime writers, Ann Rule, actually knew Ted Bundy, the notorious serial killer. This book is based on his crimes, and on her personal knowledge of Bundy. It's a riveting book, and one of the best true-crime books I've ever read."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"This was a truly great book. Especially for me because I'm the type of the person who has to really get motivated by a book to continue to read it. The whole idea of tracking a serial killer and the killer ending up being your best friend is just an unbelievable plot. Also the setting never stayed the same, Ted Bundy was always on the run bringing us to different states and climates making the book very interesting. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys Ann Rule and her most interesting true crimes."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"a great book,i have read two books about ted bundy[this and the only living witness]and although i liked the other one slightly more this is still an excellent book[extra points because it was written by someone who actually knew ted personaly]."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"As a long-time fan of Ann Rule and devotee of the true-crime genre, I can't believe I've never read this book, but ... until now I hadn't.I probably can't add much to what numerous other reviewers have written, but I will say that I honestly didn't like this book as much as most of the others of hers I have read. I started out thinking it should be better, since she actually knew Ted Bundy, but I actually didn't like that aspect much. I think this is because I felt like the entire book had a underlying feeling of sympathy for Bundy that I found very distracting. I also thought it was longer than it needed to be.Bottom line: fascinating subject, but not the author's best work."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"ANOTHER MUST FOR THE SERIAL KILLER BUFF. NOT ONLY IS ANN RULE ABLE TO PROVIDE A DETAILED ACCOUNT OF EACH KILLING, BUT DUE TO HER INSIDE SCOOP OF BEING HIS UNKNOWN FRIEND, SHE PROVIDES INSIGHT OF THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS COMPLICATED MONSTER. HOW INTERESTING TO SEE THE FRIENDSHIP THIS PERSON HAD WHILE COMMITTING THE UNIMAGINABLE. ALSO, THE INFORMATION PROVIDED ABOUT HIS SELECTION & OF HOW HE SECURED THE TRUST OF THE VICTIMS IS INVALUABLE IN POSSIBLY PROTECTING YOURSELF OR A LOVED ONE. A NEVER WANT TO PUT DOWN BOOK!!"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"It is a great book. It gives a lot of phychological insights and shows very intriguing development of the main character."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"More than true crime, the story of Ted Bundy is true horror. An unbelievable, yet true yarn that made me re-evaluate human nature.Bundy was the prototype sociopath. Beyond that, he was amazingly intelligent and had a wealth of human talents. This makes the story all the more compelling and freaky. The man personifies true evil, and Rule does a remarkable job telling the story.At the end, the best explanation is that the SOB may have had a head injury that caused the wiring in his head to go bad. By the time I was done reading, I was pleading with Rule and with god for something that would explain the horror. That's as good an explanation as any I guess. Thank fu** he's dead."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"I devoured the three books I read,which included this one, but I feel three is enough. I wanted to read them because killers always seemed to answer that they didn't know why they felt compelled to kill or they gave answers which really did not satisfy my curiosity. Ann Rule's books contained the information which satisfied my curiosity. Previously I was for the death penalty, but now I am against it. I'm not religious, but I think Jesus was right when he said, \\"Forgive them for they know not what they do\\". In fact I dare say that we all live our lives the way we feel compelled to and we don't really know why we do what we do (including I myself). I believe free will is an illusion although we have to live as though it existed."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"I gave this book as a gift, so I don't know how good it is. I chose it because I thought it would be. As always the book came to me in a very timely manner."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"I was disappointed in this book, especially after having read Ms. Rule's Dead by Sunset, which was far superior.I agree with ALL of the other 2-star reviewers.The book is too long and there is too much documentation about Rule's feelings toward Bundy. As one of the reviewers wrote: &lt;&lt;She comes off as an enabler to one of the worst serial killers in history.>> I agree! I also thought, \\"If I read one more of his stupid letters, I'm going to scream!\\" I love true crime stories and I looked forward to finding out what behavioral therapists had to say about him, more about the women he murdered, more about how the authorities finally tracked him down and realized that he'd committed murders and other crimes in other states. (The made-for-TV movie with Mark Harmon made the \\"aha moment\\" much more dramatic.)I grew tired of reading about how the author felt about him, and how he acted and felt. Toward the end of the book, Rule was still concerned about him, about wanting to send him money, about wanting to reach out to him. I wanted to bonk her on the head and shout, \\"Reality!\\"For such a famous case, the book was quite lackluster, and did not hold my attention. I was also irritated with poorly constructed sentences, unnecessary commas, and the uses of \\"which\\" instead of \\"that,\\" and \\"anxious\\" instead of \\"eager.\\"If you'd like to read this book, I recommend getting it in your local library. Don't spend your hard-earned money on this book!"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Informative. Not very ppeasant to read but it keeps you glued to the story. I will read more of Ann Rule's books."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Was just waiting for the kindle version. Great book. Well written story covered in depth. Ann Rule really rocks it."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Ann Rule not only tells the story of Ted Bundy as she knows it, but in the process evaluates herself and her reaction as she comes to the reality that her friend is the &#34;Ted&#34; killer."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"This book was well written and researched. Ann Rule talked about Ted Bundy from the point of view of not only a concerned friend but a well informed crime writer. Good book, easy to read. Alot of information. This was actually the first true crime book that Ann Rule ever wrote. Pretty strange that it would be about her own friend that happen to be a serial killer. Which just shows that Ted was an intelligent man who was only inspired by other intelligent and well informed individuals."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Regarding the purchase in and of itself, book arrived quickly in the stated condition. That's a happy thing.The book was oddly, a delightful read. I found that I didn't want to put it down. I was a teenager when Ted Bundy was in the public eye. I knew he was a serial killer but pretty much nothing else. What an awful position for a person to be in, but Ann Rule's telling of her relationship, and the straightforward approach she took with both sides is a true testament of her character. The chances of having an opportunity such as that as a crime writer; the experience of *knowing* someone like that personally- I can barely imagine what it was really like even though she did her best to tell all. He was fascinating, and her ability to face and revisit the truth is more than remarkable- I'm running out of words to describe it.If you want a good solid read, to be transported to a reality that you likely cannot identify with to any extent, to try to understand the potential falseness of truth and to be left awe stricken, read The Stranger Beside Me. It is absolutely worth every turn of the page."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"This is a crazy story about one of America's most dangerous serial killers. Ted Bundy was one messed up soul and Ann does an amazing job of telling the story from her eyes (and relationship with BundY), as well as reporting what really happened according to police and the public. A great read."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"What is unusual about this book is that it was written by someone who was a fried of Bundy before he was suspected of committing any crimes and that the author is also an excellent writer. This gives us a unique combination of a compelling story written by someone who knows a great deal about Bundy personally.I disagree with the recent reviewers who think Ann Rule is too pro-Bundy. First of all she says she would not have stopped the execution at the end. Her views obviously evolved over the years. Secondly he was her friend. Just like his family, people can be of two minds and she said it was nearly impossible to overlay the person she knew with the monster he was. She calls him a monster and obviously does not excuse his behavior. She wrote a 600 page book describing the horror.Like the overwhelming number of reviewers her I think this is an excellent and compelling book. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Great Book. I have read it before but this recent release has more information added, such as women that have come forward reliving their stories to Ann about escaping Ted."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Considering the unspeakable horrors that Ted Bundy committed during his lifetime, Ann Rule's book is surprisingly devoid of gory details, which I appreciated. Although I enjoy reading true crime, I find myself turned off by lurid descriptions of beatings, rapes, and murders. Rule briefly mentions what Bundy did to the victims, but she does not dwell on this evil, focusing more on how Bundy approached his victims before abducting them. She tells the story from her own unique perspective as a close acquaintance of Ted's during the time he was committing many of his murders.\\"The Stranger Beside Me\\" moves at a quick pace, and I found myself unable to put it down, telling myself over and over that I would read just ONE more chapter before going to bed. The book itself is chilling, but well-researched, and the 2008 edition has a new forward by Rule, and also contains her addendums to all the previous additions. I would strongly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in true crime."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Ann Rule before she became a well-known true crime writer worked an evening a week on the suicide hotline with a young aspiring politician or lawyer named Ted Bundy. Nobody knows for sure when Ted started his killing spree so I can't say before or after he knew Ann Rule. Ted was charming, charismatic, and brilliant human being. Then there was the side of him that was dangerous, disturbed, and quite monstrous lurking inside him like a werewolf that changes during the full moon. Rule didn't think that the Ted she knew could be the same Ted that the Seattle Police were looking for. Anyway, this book chronicalizes her relationship with him but she doesn't shy away from the truth and remembers the victims as she does in all her books. They are the ones that need it most. Ted Bundy was a shocking serial killer because he appeared so normal, so charming, so good to be true, and that's when you know it often is. Rule does a good job in understanding Ted's girlfriend at the time, Liz, who was probably victimized by Ted's lies and his secret mask that conveyed this monster. She was his girlfriend at the time and with her daughter. Like Ann, Liz trusted Ted and loved him but like Ann, she came to believe in the awful truth that Ted was a vicious serial killer and we don't know how many victims are still out there because he was a slick serial killer who perfected luring his victims who were always female by using crutches, slings, and saying he was a police officer, and once the predator has his hands on his prey, there is no stopping him. Rule doesn't write about the reasons or the motives for Bundy's crimes. Why did he want the bodies? He would visit them after the fact and scatter their parts in dense Pacific Northwest Forest."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"This book is definitely Ann Rule at her best. What other true crime writer would have the opportunity (albiet unknowingly) to work beside a serial killer? I thought I knew the story of Ted Bundy before I read this book, but Ann has so many details and accounts of Ted that only someone close to him would know.I was fortunate I was able to hear Ann speak at a dinner about her relationship with Ted. It's scary to think that someone she considered a friend could wear a mask so well that no one knew or even suspected Ted of the horrible things he did. The only one who didn't like him was her dog and they could never figure out why at the time.I consider this book to be the only book on Ted Bundy worth reading. It grips you and you can't put it down until you're finished. And you wish it was only fiction."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"The best thing about this book is Ann Rule's unique perspective in being the only true crime writer who actually knew the killer as a friend before he committed his crimes! It's a fascinating read that is also heartbreaking for so many reasons. Rule perfectly describes the man she thought of as a younger brother, her affection and love for him, and the horror and true emotional pain she suffered as she slowly realized that he was a serial killer.Rule does a commendable and touching job of showing us that human relationships are extremely complex, and that emotions cannot be shut on and off like a faucet. Intellectually, she accepts that Ted is guilty and admits that she would not have stopped his execution had she the power, but she also confesses that she cannot forget the true friendship and affection she felt for the charming, intelligent, and seemingly open 24-year-old she met at Seattle's Crisis Clinic in 1971.Unlike many other books on Bundy (and there are plenty of them), this one allows a genuine first-person account of what he meant to people who knew him as something more than just a monster. It also proves unequivocally that Bundy's list of victims included more than just the poor girls he killed."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Overall, it is my opinion that this book is very well written. And, although Ms. Rule had published articles before, this book was a tremendous first effort.While I was reading the book, I kept thinking about what it would be like for me if a long-time friend of mine had been charged with multiple murders. How would I react? It definitely would not be easy to write a book about it. That considered, I feel that Ann did an outstanding job writing a balanced book and telling about the victims as individuals.I first heard of Ted Bundy when I saw the movie about him when I was in high school. I have always thought of him as the epitome of evil. This book helped shed some light on him as a person rather than just another murderer.I know quite well one of the first psychologists who evaluated him when he was arrested in Utah. He has believed that Bundy had a split-personality.I also once had a co-worker who still has the handcuffs that he used when he transported Bundy to USP. He had nothing good to say about the man.As for the book itself, there was one inconsistency that I noticed. In one subsequent chapter, she wrote that it was Julia Burr who'd had her arm in a cast. In the next, she wrote that it was Mary Burr who did.The book is quite well written. However, it seems as though she either really loves commas or overused them in an all-out effort to avoid using the conjoining word, \\"and.\\" That became a tad annoying after the first couple of chapters.Another annoying factor was that she continouously referred The Church Of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints as the \\"Mormon Church.\\" Also, she referred to Utah as \\"The Mormon State\\" rather than by its official nickname, \\"The Beehive State.\\" I'm not even from Utah and I know that.Other than those few things, I feel that the book was very good. I did find it interesting about the \\"Ted Groupies\\" being in love with Mark Harmon. The first time I saw the actor in anything was when he portrayed Ted Bundy. I had a very hard time seeing his characters on any show since then as a \\"good guy.\\" I always related him to Ted Bundy. The poor guy."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"This book is amazing. Rule strings you along throughout, and not until the end does she even name Bundy as the actual killer. This book made me wake up in the night in a cold sweat and I still couldn't put it down. One knock. Although I realise its part of the story, I wasn't fond of the constant switchings into Ann's life. She might have been able to make the book without it; she might not have. Either way, this book will keep you reading until the last page...three times over."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Ann Rule brings superb style to this most personal of her true crime narratives. Ex-cop Rule never suspected that her charming and intelligent co-worker at the Seattle crisis phone center in the early 1970's was a warped rapist-killer. But then Ted Bundy had most people fooled, including the state's Governor (Dan Evans) for whom he briefly worked. Still, as the decaying bodies piled up, suspicions grew. This narrative covers the many crimes by this monster (in four states), the convincing mask he displayed, the efforts of law enforcement, and his escapes from custody that led to further tragedy. We also get a lengthy look at his trial in Florida - where this former law student assisted in his own defense - and his weaseling attempts to trade confessions for time as the hangman approached. Rule describes her own role in this brutal narrative, and (as always) lets us know something about the tragic victims; a deed one hopes gives some measure of comfort to grieving loved ones.THE STRANGER BESIDE ME is a personal and absorbing narrative about a gruesome serial killer and the author's unwitting friendship with him. This book ranks with the best of Rule's many superb efforts."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"This is the book that got me started reading true crime, and it is rightly called \\"the classic story of serial murder.\\"Ted Bundy is now a household name and the embodiment of serial killers; however, when Ann Rule met him in 1971, he was a law student and fellow worker at a crisis center. Ann is assigned to write a story about several missing girls from Washington state...and the reader gets a front row view of not only the investigations, but Ann's growing horror and revulsion as she realized that the person responsible for these terrible murders is her good friend, Ted.Ted escapes, and Ann is guarded by FBI agents in case he tries to come to her for help in escaping. Ted calls Ann collect from Florida after being arrested and suspected of the Chi Omega murders, and hints that he would confess all to her. These and many other chilling stories provide a unique, highly personal view into Bundy's destructive life and drawn-out death.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"As with the other reviewers, I have nothing but accolades for Stranger Beside Me. Unlike other 'true crime' books written by attorneys (prosecuting or defense) who like to show off how smart they are, Ann Rule gives a balanced, sympathetic account of the very strange life of Ted Bundy. But more, much more than this is the relationship between the author and the subject. They were actually good friends before Ted's murder spree. Stranger Beside Me is as much of an account of how Ann Rule copes with this situation - that is, coming to terms with the fact that a friend and work colleague is actually a killer. Fascinating, almost beyond belief.Clearly Ann Rule profited from her relationship with Ted Bundy. She went on to become a very successful writer. However rather than exploiting the situation Ann's good fortune really is just a bizarre twist of fate. No doubt she wonders if she would be where she is today if Ted Bundy never existed, or if their personal link never existed. I think Stranger Beside Me proves that Ann Rule would have been a successful writer regardless.Bottom line: a &quot;best of breed&quot; piece of true crime fiction."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"I have almost finsihed The stranger beside me by Ann Rule and I would just like to share a little. This is the first True Crime book I have read and I would like to say it is also the scariest book I have ever read. I am having restless nights reading this book, but I just can't let it go! Ann Rule puts a lot of herself in to this book and although it is all factual and doesn't read like fiction at all, it stills chills you to the bone. Ted Bundy was a truly disturbed man and the way he managed to stay undetected for so long is one of the scariest things about him. The other scary thing is how the young women he attacked or kidnapped and murdered were so totally unaware of him and went willingly or they were asleep and had no choice when they were attacked. Brutal is a good way to describe the book, not only for its contents, but Brutual is also the effect it has had on me."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Ann Rule sees both sides of the coin--she tells the story about a friend who she worked with and socialized with. She also tells the story about a man who terrorized dozens of women, and received his just punishment. This friend/man was one in the same--Ted Bundy. You can feel Ann's trepidation as she discovers someone she likes and admires, is involved in some of the most heinous crimes in history. I recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Ann Rule is the best in the genre of true crime. Anything from her pen is always well-written and a great read."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"The author couldn't have put it better when she wrote that it wouldn't even be believable in TV or movie fiction that the person contracted to write about the disappearance of all the women would turn out to be good friends with the killer responsible. Because of this unique insight that Ms. Rule had it adds a deeper dimension to her work. She is very articulate and well written to begin with, but the personal touch her story brings really draws you in. You feel like you are getting to know Ted right along with her and almost want to believe he wasn't the killer just like she initially believed and wanted to believe. I have never read a true crime novel before and only read this because of a book club that I belong to. However, even though this isn't the typical book that I would read, I found it to be a page turner."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"If your a fan of murder/drama/real life then this is the book for you. I have read it many, many times. It was exactly what the seller said it was, fast shipping, great price. Highly recommend not just the book, but the seller as well."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"It's been a while since I read a book as good as this one! Can't wait to pick up another title from this author"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"This is the second time I've read this book. It was years & years since the first read. I like Rule's style of reporting and Bundy was a fascinating subject."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"or so I thought! I have sharp intuition as well as some psychic abilities. Therefore, I have always felt certain that I would have spotted something evil if I had met Ted Bundy. I couldn't comprehend how Ann Rule, especially with a law enforcement background, did not sense something very wrong with Ted Bundy. They worked closely at the crisis center and considered themselves friends. Ann Rule provides such extensive detail about herself and Ted Bundy.... enough that I am now convinced that I would not have sensed the horrific aspect of his being. This book is a fascinating read especially from a psychological perspective."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"An incredible story on all levels. Ann Rule writes clearly and succinctly of this disturbing murderer, Ted Bundy. She gives a personal insight into the gentle, caring man he could be so that the reader almost feels sorry for him. She writes of the murders without any sensationalism and of her relationship with Ted who was her friend. If you want a real idea of the events and the man, this is the book to read. I thoroughly enjoyed the honesty of the narrative."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"A good read for those interested in Ted Bundy, although I found there was a lot of re-cap and overlap which made it hard to stay focused at times."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"I really liked the way that Rule mixed the very professional description of the crimes with the very personal description of her friend, Ted. It was thoroughly creepy and seriously made me wonder about everyone I know. However, what I really appreciated was her focus on the victims rather then the killer. She makes a point to describe each victim as a person, what they did, what they liked, how they acted, etc, so you get the sense the people Bundy murdered were PEOPLE, and not just names on a list. I feel like she gave them an identity other then that they were victims of a horrible crime. I give her credit for that especially because of the fact she was friends with Bundy, and tried so hard to give him the benefit of the doubt for so long.My only complaint with the book is I felt it was drawn out. I didn't bother to look at how long it was (since I read it on my kindle, I had no real reference unless I checked the page number, which I didn't) and expected it to be around 300-400 pages. So that could be why I felt like it dragged a bit. But I also felt some of the trial and the epilogues could have been cut down (I would say the same about the crime description, but I felt she was trying to give each victim equal attention, and I think that was fair).Otherwise, the book disturbed and at many points seriously frightened me, while at the same time making me feel empathy for all the lives Bundy ruined. Rule is definitely an excellent crime writer, and this book will haunt me for a while."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"the author is able to provide a unbiased view of the subject. anyone wanting to know more about the subject, this is the book to read."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"This to me is one of the best Ann Rule books ever written. Itgives you a special insight into Bundy's torn up soul, up to a pointwhere I felt a slight jealousy not knowing him. What springs to mind is an almost perverted curiosity of &quot; Could this have happened to me? Would I go with such a handsome man just to find out he is the evil himself?&quot;"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Hard to believe nobody ever saw him or that he was never caught long before he was. Just goes to show that you should report license plates and unusual things to the police. Just unbelieveable."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Ann Rule is an excellent writer of true crime, and the Stranger is definately her best. She brings a level of dignity and respect for the victims and families that have survived these horrific crimes. Her insight into the psychology of both the victims and Ted Bundy are truthful and extraordinary. She maintains a level of humanity in a way few authors of true crime are able to. By the time you are finished with the book you have a greater understanding of psychology, sociology and the law. The most frightening part of the Bundy case is how clear Ms. Rule makes it that you may not know the true nature of the people you intereact with on a regular basis."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"The next novel that I'm going to write has a serial killer in it, and Stranger Beside Me is the first book that I read for research. (I've got a list of 20.)I started with this one because it is a personal story of what it is like to befriend a serial killer and extreme psychopath. In general, psychopaths are attractive to members of the opposite sex, but members of the same gender can tell that there's something off about them. Ann Rule's reaction to Ted Bundy is typical and thus a warning for all of us. Rule felt that Ted Bundy was one of the nicest, sweetest men she'd ever known. When they were through with their late-night volunteer shift at the crisis center, he walked her to her car because there are bad people out there. (Eek!) Bundy modeled the perfect gentlemen. Rule bought his act. I'm not condemning her, far from it. That's what most of us would do. That's one of the most important lessons in this book. Sometimes, the most perfect gentleman is also the most perfect monster.Rule's 20 year update of this book is fascinating. Her reactions, still, to the sweet, gentle Ted that she knew are unreconciled with the monster than dwelled within him. Psychopaths, whether they become serial killers or not, damage the people around them for a long time. (All serial killers are psychopaths, but very few psychopaths are serial killers.)While Rule's descriptions of Bundy's crimes are dispassionate and clinical, not sensational, I admit that I skimmed over them. I have too many nightmares as it is. Those chapters will give you more.Again, the most fascinating chapters in this book are of Rule's reactions to Bundy and her lasting friendship with him even after she was intellectually convinced that he must have committed those horrific crimes. Her analysis of herself and her own motives is every bit as fascinating as anything she writes directly about Bundy.Who's the nicest person you know, the very last one who you would suspect of being a psychopath who kills at night?TK KenyonAuthor ofRabid: A NovelandCallous: A Novel"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"This is a non-sensational, detailed and well-documented account of Ted Bundy's killing career. What makes it all the more gripping is the fact that not only did the author know Bundy but was his close friend. But, there was a side to him that she never knew. It was obviously a traumatic experience for her from which she still hasn't recovered.What makes Bundy alternately fascinating and chilling is the fact that he had absolutely nothing to gain from his murders. They were committed, apparently, for the sheer pleasure Bundy got from killing. The killings were the ultimate compulsion. Rule documents this quite well. What she fails to do is provide an understanding of Bundy, of what \\"made him tick.\\" This is not to fault her; I don't think anyone could. She provides considerable detail about some childhood traumas that Bundy suffered, such as believing for a long time that his mother was his sister, but ultimately these details don't explain anything. Many people have suffered from far worse traumas, childhood and otherwise, than Bundy, but hey didn't go on to become serial killers. So this is something we probably will never know.Ann Rule has since gone on to a brilliant writing career, but this is the book that got it all started. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"This was the first book I read by Ann Rule; I was hooked, not only on the book but the author's style. I finished it in 2 days, I couldn't put it down and couldn't wait to finish it. This is a must have for any true Ann Rule reader or collector.Cudos and my hat is off to her."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"I was scared out of my mind but I couldn't put it down. Here was the story of a madman, a monster, a truly sick individual whose greatest accomplishment in life was to viciously hunt down, murder and defile beautiful women. He mercilessly took their young lives from us- who knows what they could have been. Most of them were college coeds, some were already working with disabled children, and we lost them to the sick perversions of this notorious serial murderer.As much as we'd like to concentrate on the victims of the crimes, though, and as much as we'd like to mourn as a society for these innocents, we are drawn in by Ann Rule into the fascinating world of the killer himself. He becomes the star of the story and the women he killed are incidental. Sure, Rule gives us tiny bits of information about the victims, but some are almost just barely mentioned, mere footnotes in the biography of a depraved man.Ann Rule admits this as one of the sad results of what Bundy did. He stole their specialness, she says, by making them all blend together as mere \\"Bundy victims\\".I have only begun to read True Crime and my first books were by FBI profiler John Douglas. In his books, Douglas details the inner workings of sociopaths like Bundy, assuring us they are not \\"crazy\\" in the sense of having \\"no choice\\" about their forays into evil. They do it because that is what they love to do. An artist loves to paint and men like Bundy live to kill. (Bundy, however, is dead now- thanks to 2,000 volts from \\"Old Sparky\\", Florida's electric chair. He was sentenced to die in 1978 but managed to live, thanks to countless appeals, until 1989.)I read John Douglas's book \\"Journey Into Darkness\\" last year and I had no desire to pick up a book about Ted Bundy like I was some kind of Bundy groupie (of which there were several, disgustingly enough). But the angle of this book is that Ann Rule knew the man before he was ever a prime suspect in the grisly murders of several young women. Having no idea who she was working next to late at night, Ann was actually moved to believe Bundy would be \\"perfect\\" for one of her own daughters to date, were they older. Instead of being the perfect gentleman Rule thought he was, Bundy was a man with no conscience. He felt no remorse for what he did and indeed, he denied it until the end. For what were probably selfish reasons (he was a master manipulator), he confessed right before his death on January 24, 1989. (Eerily, I bought the book on January 24, 2004, exactly fifteen years after society was assured Bundy would never kill again.) But don't think Ann was a nave, eaisly conned woman. She was actually a cop in the 1950s and she was no dummy. What we have here is a man who is able to become whoever he needs to be in order to lure women to his trap- in this case a VW bug where he handcuffed them after bashing their head with a crow bar.What Rule fails to mention in her book, written in 1980 then updated twenty years later in 2000, is that Bundy kept his victims alive as long as possible to torture them. He was a sexual sadist and a coward whose last victim was only twelve years old and plucked from her middle school yard. I learned this from John Douglas. He has no sympathy for men like Bundy and perhaps Rule doesn't have sympathy for every last killer but Bundy was, after all, her friend and she perhaps felt it necessary to humanize him for the readers so we would understand."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"This isn't a book to read if you're just looking for a lot of gory details about what Bundy did to his victims. There is very little discussion about his necrophilic activities, his obsession with dead bodies, etc. This is, however, the book to read if you want an accurate, well-rounded portrayal of Bundy as a person and as a killer.Like another reviewer already stated, this book was fascinating on several levels. Just as interesting as the Bundy case is watching how Ann Rule herself changed over time. She went from steadfastly believing in her dear friend (as most people would if they were truly friends), to seesawing back and forth, to throwing up when she realized he was guilty after the Miami trial. Her account in this edition of what she felt like when he was executed (the original book was released prior to Bundy's execution) was thought provoking to say the least. She admittedly wouldn't have stopped his execution even if she could, but her grief over losing a man she cared about was also very evident and is just one instance of how multi-dimensional this book is.Also as another reviewer pointed out, I appreciated getting to know the victims as more than statistics. For all the books that come out, not just about Bundy but about killers in general, the victims the authors claim to care so much about are brushed over and given about as much thought in death as their killers gave them in life. This is not the case with The Stranger Beside Me. This is a well-rounded, multi-dimensional book that you won't be able to put down."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Ann Rule was just beginning her writing career when she met Ted Bundy, with whom she volunteered nights at a crisis hotline. Ted was ambitious, gentle, and sweet. Little did she know that he was the same &quot;Ted&quot; that she was helping to track cross-country, the &quot;Ted&quot; who killed young girls.Ann Rule is the consummate true-crime author, and this is her most personal, and shocking, book."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"My husband is currently reading this book and I can't wait for him to finish so I can read it again. I read this book a couple of years ago and I just couldn't put it down. It's a very shocking story and it's brilliantly told by the author. She builds up the suspense and like her you get to the truth in the end. Some people may not like this but sometimes I felt kind of sorry for Ted Bundy, he was such a brilliant, good looking an intelligent man, and it's really a pity that he threw away his potential by committing all those crimes. Why he did it? Was he insane? I personally think that he was some kind of schizophrenic who had some parts of him he couldn't deal with. But the truth no one will ever know why he did it...."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Ms. Rule's storytelling skills weave a chilling blanket around the reader enveloping them into the bizzare twisted life of Theodore Robert Bundy.If you think you know all about the infamous &quot;Ted Murders&quot; and about Ted Bundy himself, you probably don't.

I saw this book mentioned on the back of the book cover, for one of her other books. When I saw that she had actually known Ted, at the time he was loose in Washington, I had to read it. I couldn't put it down, because it is not only very well written, but how often can you get this perpective on a monster?? There are facts, and insights here you'll get nowhere else. I think I finished this book in about eight hours, straight through!"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"I was terrified when I read this book, but I couldn't put it down. I lived in Seattle at the time, and was totally creeped out when I drove by some of Bundy's old haunts. When I finished this book I called my Mom and told her to tell my sisters to never trust a man unless he had ten references. This book scared me so much that I swore that I would only read positive life affirming books from then on. Of course I never did stop reading true crime or thrillers, but none of them have seemed as horrible as The Stranger Beside Me. It's a great book, read it if you dare."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"&quot;The Stranger Beside Me&quot; is a story that I believe does not merit a lengthy review.

Ann was contracted to write a book about his case on the side without knowing he was the one responsible for the recent string of murders. The angle is amazing and has the effect of humanizing Ted, though there seems to be an impulse in view of future revelations, to cast him as being even more of a monster for the fact that he behaved like one a mere fraction of the time.Monstrous: The Autobiography of a Serial Killer but for the Grace of God"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"When you know the ending it is hard to write or read a book without being biased with the knowledge. This book weaves what was known and what was not at any given time so well that in your mind you keep trying to reconcile the two and for those moments you do not want to connect them to the end that is now so well known. The way she introduces Ted in the beginning and the way events unravel, you keep trying to juxtapose the known Ted Bundy and the mysterious and ruthless killer who left a trail of death in his wake, and like her, you simply cannot.What is also praiseworthy is that the author neither interrupts the flow with personal judgment nor does she glamorize the gore. It was mature and intelligent real-crime storytelling at its best.There are aspects of the relationship between the author and the main character that wants you to judge not Ted, but herself - did she lead Ted on so she could get a story out of it, all the time backing her actions with moral reasoning? In my opinion that is beyond the scope of this review and the five stars that I think the book deserves."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Being friends with and trusting a man who is actually a serial killer is very creepy. It is also sad to know that Ted Bundy took the lives of so many young woman who were just starting live on their own. I really enjoyed this book. I recommend it to anyone interested in true crime."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"This is an excellent true crime book. It has an unusual twist in that the author and the subject of the book, serial killer Ted Bundy, had a platonic relationship that arose from the time they were co-workers for a Seattle, Washington crisis center. Quite frankly, the author initially had no idea that Ted Bundy was anything other than what he appeared to be: a handsome, intelligent, charismatic, and articulate young man, who was, at the time, involved in local politics and later became a law student.When he became the suspect in the disappearance and murders of a number of very young, pretty women, the author was in total disbelief. As the evidence mounted against her friend, the author, who is a former police officer, could not shut her eyes to the reality that Ted Bundy was actually a very disturbed individual who was guilty of all of which he was accused and probably guilty of other such crimes for which he was not accused for evidentiary reasons. Consequently, the author would suffer some angst for many years, as she struggled to reconcile the Ted Bundy that she thought she knew with the fiend who was compelled to commit so many vicious abductions, assaults, and murders. It is believed that at least thirty-five young women, and probably a good number more, died at the hands of Ted Bundy.The author details the abductions, assaults, and murders of his victims from coast to coast, which crimes were ultimately to make Ted Bundy a nationwide household name, and an entity to be feared. The investigative efforts of law enforcement officers in the states of Washington, Utah, Colorado, and Florida are revealed, as are Ted Bundy's arrests and his trials. She also details his two escapes from custody in Colorado, the last of which would find him heading to the sunshine state of Florida.Those who like the true crime genre will enjoy this well-written and well-researched book. It is highly detailed and contains a great deal of information, some of it quite personal due to the author's relationship with Ted Bundy. She paints a very intriguing, intimate portrait of him, one that is three dimensional and complex. He was definitely a man whose benign and compelling external visage was at odds with his many internal demons, as he was a prolific serial killer. Externally, Ted Bundy was the sort of man towards whom women gravitated, and there was no dearth of Ted Bundy groupies once he made headlines.All in all, aficionados of the true crime genre will find much of interest in this book."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"I've read a few of Ann's books and really appreciated this one.

After reading one, I was hooked to her works, and very much hooked to this book. I'm only 21, and therefore didn't realize how much damage Ted Bundy did in the states, and just how many states he murdered in. I loved reading everything that went on and where. It was amazing to me that this woman, Ann Rule, knew Ted Bundy before anything was going on. It's always good and different to get the perspective from such a great writer, who also happens to be friends with the subject of the book. I must admit, towards the end when the updates were written, I got a little bored with the book. The story was now complete, and then it kept going on. I did read the updates, because I never remembered Ted Bundy, just the stories. So having a 2000 update was a bit helpful.I would say, a must read, even if you know all about Ted Bundy, but especially if you don't, like me."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"A very revealing and in-depth look into the life history and criminal habits of Ted Bundy. Ann Rule's take on the situation is made even more interesting by her personal acquaintance with Bundy. In addition, she is able to beautifully convey her watching the events of Bundy's brutal crimes and subsequent trials unfold before her eyes with a fascinating juxtaposition of disbelief, horror and compassion for a man she once considered to be a friend. Definitely a great book for anyone interested in true crime."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"High applause to Ann Rule!

And then she was knocked on her tail to find out about his secret horror. She met with him in prison andgathered the extra clues and details to make this outstanding, unparalleled novel. Highly recommended!!!"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"After reading this book, a presumably more personal account from a self-proclaimed friend of Ted Bundy, I think the author was manipulated and duped by this notorious killer. It's obvious that one of the traits of sociopath is the compulsion to write letters. For this is the only way to manipulate when they are locked up. We all heard countless stories about women being lured by inmates with letters and phone calls so they would be willingly sending money and care packages. Ted Bundy, just like the I-5 killer Randy Woodfield years later, was a compulsive letter-writer and phone caller. He used the letters and phone calls to manipulate many women at the same time so he could get what he wanted, be it money (Ms Rule probably spent over $600 on him, a big sum at that time), emotional support, or material goods. Based on this and countless times Ms Rule's \\"torn feelings\\", I can safely assume that she's one of the duped. During her correspondence with Ted Bundy, she was a woman about to divorce, had 4 young kids to support, meaning she's emotional weak and dependent at the time. Any woman with healthy emotional state of mind would not tolerate to be manipulated like this.Looking at the Washington State victims' photo, they could be sisters! I feel so sorry for the families who lost their beautiful daughters. If they were to live, they would be almost 50 by now. They could be someone's mothers, wives, and co-workers......... I cringe every time I think about the could-have-beens and would-have-beens for those beautiful girls.Another thing that struck me during the reading was how easy it is to break into a place. Ted Bundy must have farmed his target area to see which building's occupied by young women, which one was easy to get into, which screen was loose, and which lock was malfunctioned. The fact that a lot of his victims were hit in their dorm/home while sleeping was chilling. I have to double, triple check all my windows, doors, and locks to make sure they are secure. I think all women who live alone or with other women should do the same night after night before they can safely close their eyes to sleep.While I was looking at the few pictures of Ted Bundy, it struck me how much he looked like Greg Kinnear. Mr. Kinnear has the same handsome but changeable face. Mr. Kinnear also has the ability to play a normal guy with internal turmoil/evil type (watch The Gift). If there's ever a movie made about Ted Bundy, I think he's the perfect choice."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Imagine one of your co-workers who you are close to. Imagine spending hours with this person and discussing your lives with them. Then imagine some years later you discover that your friend is a serial killer. This happened to Ann Rule, the famous true-crime writer, in 1971 when she worked at Seattle's crisis clinic. One evening her boss told her that she had a new co-employee -- Ted Bundy. To Ann, he was an intelligent, kind and handsome 24-year-old. Little did she know, in 1974, Ted would become a viscous murderer, who killed at least 30 young women in four years.Ann Rule did an exceptional job on this book. She really focuses well on Ted's life, from his birth to being sentenced to death row. Also, she writes about each victim, staying away from the gruesome details of their death, but giving the reader a sense of their lives.

Then, you realize that someone you know, someone that you like and trust, is probably the murderer.

Yes, Bundy was charismatic, intelligent, and could have had a bright future. But it just didn't turn out that way. I wish there were answers to my questions, but there are none.

I would recommend it to anyone who wants an in-depth look into the real life of Ted Bundy. Ann Rule does a great job of giving the reader all of the facts and leaving the emotions up to you."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Ted Bundy obviously felt ashamed of his illegitimacy due to the nature of his birth. When he went to college, upon encountering others from a more affluent social-economical class, he felt even more self-conscious. It's so evident from his confession during his early twenties about his background and his anxiety at the matchability with Stephanie, his self-proclaimed love of his life. This reminds me of Tom Ripley, Patricia Highsmith's character in her Ripley books. Both from humble beginnings with an above-average intelligence, the glimpse of wealth and class made them hunger for more. We all feel the same more or less in our teens and early adulthood, the emotional struggle to try to &quot;fit in&quot;, to feel &quot;belonged&quot;, and the self-doubt and feeling of inadequacy. Thank goodness majority of us would eventually find our place in the society and our own skin. But a very few individuals went way wrong and traveled down to a path of no return. The saddest point is that Ted Bundy was brilliant in the field of Psychology. But then again, a lot of analysts admit that they don't necessarily read their own mind consciously and have the same tendency to avoid their own problems."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Despite being a huge crime reader, I don't usually read true crime. This book was recommended by so many crime fiction readers that I thought I'd check it out. I was interested in how one of the most noteworthy real life serial killers compared against his fictional counterparts.Many aspects of Ted Bundy's life of crime really are the stuff of novels, and no doubt have inspired many. Women of a specific and similar physical appearance disappearing all over the country are like something from a James Patterson book. Like Hannibal Lecter, Ted Bundy had formal psychiatric training and was experienced at administering the same psychological tests that were given to him in prison. He is cunning enough to escape prison, and adept at procuring fake identities and eluding the police. No maladjusted misfit, he was personable, charming, attractive to women - while capable of chilling rages where, in a single night, he could savage 4 different women, racing, bloodstained, from one college dorm to another.Much of the book is about Bundy's trials and time in prison - details absent from most fiction, which usually conveniently end after the perpetrator's discovery. While Bundy himself could hold his own as a fictional character, what really differs is the lack of any cohesive protaganist. While many individual police worked long and hard on his cases over the years, there was no idea for a long while that many of his attacks were connected, a situation that surely could not have escaped, for instance, a Lucas Davenport. Once the police finally manage to convict him - on only three of a known 35 and suspected 150 murders - the suspense moves to Bundy's repeated fight against his execution date, which is postponed many times in a morass of often less than inspiring legal wrangling.Whether Ms Rule's unique persective on the Ted Bundy case actually adds anything to the story is hard to say - despite their long friendship, she seems as baffled as everyone else as to how or why the kind and sensitive guy she knew could be a brutal and sadistic killer. Everyone who reads this by now knows the facts of the case, and it's hard to share any of her initial support of Bundy. This book's effectiveness is its thoroughness in showing the untidy fringes and loose ends that accompany real life crime - it's a scary, thought-provoking, and worthwhile read."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Interesting book, with an EXTREMELY unique perspective. That the author was the killer's friend before she knew he was at all connected to the murders, is the books main strenght...but also a weakness, in that it's hard to sympathize with her feelings that Ted should not be executed. The guy was a monster. But that is interesting, too, that her feelings of affection for him should remain. A very interesting, very readable book."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"No one can write true crime better than Rule. Any book she writes is a must have. The fact that she new Bundy is shocking. She writes with care, warmth and extreme knowledge of not only the killers but the victims and their families too. This book told the most accurate info on Bundy where some other books on him only concentrate on the gore aspect."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"This book is truly amazing, as it is not a dry report of an author set out to cover the subject of Ted Bundy, but a realer-than-real story of an author, who has set out to write a book, only to discover that the serial killer she writes about is that kind young man she knows from her work at the telephone helpline. Ann Rule really KNEW Ted Bundy, and that's what makes this book so fascinating. The pictures in it only add to that. I have had my share of crime and true crime, but I did ponder some nights about &quot;that shadow in the corner&quot;.....this book combined with the movie Sixth Sense REALLY kept me up three nights, only daring to fall asleep with the lights on!Good book, good story, here and there it tends to become slightly tedious, but all in all she does a great job in covering the story of one of the most feared men of his time. Try it!"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Ann Rule did it all. She knew Ted Bundy before she knew he was a serial killer and after she'd finally accepted he was one. She was also an experienced crime reporter who understood the legal system and sat through the legal proceedings as they dragged on and on. Meanwhile, Bundy kills throughout, with the worst being after he escapes from his first prison. Rule even links him with yet an earlier murder in his hometown when he was only 15, showing he started killing even earlier than she'd previously supposed. I read the 35th printing of this book, which is no small testimony to how right she's painted the portrait. If you're going to read about a serial killer, there's nothing like the real thing. I read this on a plane ride to Florida and, although I normally detest flying, I barely noticed I was in a plane, I was so engrossed in this book."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"There have been many Ted Bundy books, and I have read them all, but none are as well written as Anne Rule's. She knew the man, and beleived in him far too long. (like most of his friends). Excellent True Crime reading."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Maybe because this world is crazy enough these days, with all the senseless violence, hatred, internet broadcast beheadings, and other unspeakable atrocities, I'm hoping you won't read this book. I read it, Ann Rule is good, the story is definetely \\"story worthy\\", it's just very very disturbing and it affected me for a long time after I finished it. I related to these young women. I have long dark hair. The thought that I could have been one of Ted's victims if I had had the horribly unfortunate bad luck to live at that time and come across a maniac terrified me! I was so upset after reading about this monster's callous disrespect for human life that I couldn't sleep normally for about a month.On the other hand, I couldn't really grasp how Ms. Rule could write about her relationship with the killer in an almost normal way. Ted Bundy was dead when I read the book but I was still scared of him. That Ms. Rule could continue to correspond with the man, to actually touch paper that had been touched by a man who commited such atrocities is not something I was able to accept. Maybe she has some coping mechanism that I can't grasp. But I couldn't help but feel a little bit of dislike for the author. She just didn't seem that scared that a homicidal maniac who was proficient at jail-breaks was corresponding with her. I probably would have had a breakdown.Again, no complaints about the writing or the accuracy, but spare yourselves the anguish. The news is full of it already."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"For the first several chapters, I struggled through this book. The writing really put me off; even to the point where I almost put it down. It seemed like it was a good book by an untalented writer, if that makes sense. I stuck with it, however, and was soon very glad I did.The book is surprisingly unbiased; Ann balances emotion and fact very, very well. I've read many true crime books, and most of them are either overly-sensational or insulting to the reader's intelligence. This book is neither.This book is the complete story of Ted Bundy that no other author could have written. Knowing Ted gave her the insight to write the book with compassion and empathy. It is the most touching true crime book I've ever read. In fact, it really doesn't belong in the tired genre of &quot;true crime&quot;. It's right up there with Capote's &quot;In Cold Blood&quot;, as far as I'm concerned. Highly, highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"I am Ann Rules' most devoted fan. She can do no wrong. Her word is gospel. I have everything she's ever written. Keep up the good work Ann. See you at Whidbey Island Writer's Conference in 2003...maybe with a true crime book of my own by then! Love you!"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Why Ann Rule spends the majority of her book giving the Beast from Hell the benefit of the doubt, I'm still trying to figure out. I'm sure she's not another hopelessly devoted Bundy Groupie. Maybe she's just being politically correct. Perhaps he's like one of her own sons. Whatever her reason, she gives new meaning to the concept \\"loyal friend\\".Satanic minds like Ted Bundy's are masters of deception and they know their enemies and \\"friends\\" better than these naive people know themselves. Their reason for living is to draw nourishment from other people - mostly women - dead or alive. And use it to satisfy their own evil appetites. And they're good at it. Rarely are they without a steady supply of clueless women to spoon feed them with affection and forgiveness.But when sharp-eyed, perceptive pros (like seasoned law enforcement officials) catch these Bundy types off guard, their cool-guy masks fall off and they lose it. That's when they scramble to summon a gullible woman, eager to run their errands and send cash donations.Ann's Bundy story is supported with provable facts and she tells it well. In the end, she can no longer deny that he's a criminal of the lowest order, but I wonder - does that old nagging doubt about his guilt still creep in when she's looking somewhere else?Well, at least the book had a happy ending."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"A Stranger Beside MeI read Ann Rule's version of Ted Bundy and his life of sadistic murder. She is a good authur but with this peticular book, she threw so much of her life into it as much as she did his. The story kept going back and forth from present to past and back again. I realize that she knew him but the story was to be of him, not her. I found an error in which she discribes his daughter being four and a half when they first thought he would be executed, but in truth she was three months short of being four. Previously the author has mentioned that she was born in late October of 1982, The execution that she is mentioned in is inJuly of 1986. It's not that it's dreadfullly important but it bothered me that if she got those dates mixed up, were there more. Other than these points I would have to say that the book held my interest and like another viewer, it has caused me to lose sleep and be startled easier since finishing the book. I am reading more of her books that I have ordered to see how they compare."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"As having an interest in true crime novels, I thought that this woull provide an insite not often seen of serial killers - the viewpoint of someone who knew the killer.This book seemed to drag on and on of how the author could not believe that the Ted she knew would do the thing he had been accused of. Even his escapes from jail were given reasons for being normal.While it was a well written book, there was just too much sympathy for the accused, making it a rather biased book.It was worth reading, but don't look to this book to give any insight into why the accused acted in the manner he did."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"The author's relationship with Bundy makes the book riveting; it's also its great shortcoming, as we are introduced to Bundy the charming scoundrel, rather than Bundy the monster. Ann Rule states that she would have gone for Bundy herself if she had been younger, or chosen him for her daughter if she had been older. Rule waxes eloquent about Bundy's attributes; he is brilliant, charming, handsome, dazzling, a prince among men, a star in the Republican firmament. Could such a beautiful man be all that bad, really? She was enthralled by him, and it certainly shows. It's a sad fact that we are seduced by outward appearances and charisma, rather than discerning the true character inside. Bundy was foul to the marrow, but he had a smile to die for. And many women did just that."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Ted Bundy I was in a relationship with someone who had the same kind of dual Personality.Thank God I got away in time."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Fascinating and extremely quick read of the story of serial killer Ted Bundy, written from the point of view of a \\"crime writer\\" who coincidentally was at one time friends with the killer. This author disturbs me nearly as much as Ted Bundy though! She is at best the most naive crime writer ever born, or at worst a knowing witness of a serial killer's career from beginning to end, possibly simply to further a dying writing career. For someone so sure of her clever criminal mind, the author fails again and again to put 2 and 2 together, at least according to the yarn she tells you in the book. Here's some examples:-when the Washington murders first start taking place, the only thing known about the suspect is a brief physical description, that he goes by \\"Ted\\" and that he may drive a Volkswagen. The author's old co-worker (Ted Bundy), matches the physical description, lived blocks from the missing girls, and after a quick check by the author, drives a Volkswagen. Author's conclusion: coincidence, not worth following up on.-Author's old co-worker Ted leaves Washington to go to law school in Utah; murders stop in Washington. Similar murders that the author reads about begin in Utah. Author's conclusion: coincidence, not worth following up on.-Later on, Ted is finally at least a serious suspect. He is arrested and convicted on kidnapping charges (but not murder) in Utah; author's conclusion: that can't be Ted, they got the wrong guy. Author starts sending Ted money on a regular basis!!!-Ted escapes from jail and disappears. Author's mom mails clippings of grizzly mass-murders in Florida shortly thereafter, at a time when authorities had not yet linked them to the escaped prisoner Ted. She attaches a note saying \\"It sounds like the 'Ted' murders. I wonder...\\". Author's conclusion: coincidence, not worth following up on.Maybe I'm way off here, but any dope should have put it all together by then. Of course maybe that just explains why the author WRITES about crime instead of SOLVES crime.Also beware of the last 50 pages or so. Extremely slow going, and also full of the author's sympathies for one of the most brutal killers to ever walk the earth. Pretty sad really."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"I have read all the full-length books by Ann Rule and some of the short story collections. \\"The Stranger Beside Me\\" was one of her first and, yet, the last one I have read. I couldn't believe the effect it had on me. I cried for Ted Bundy, I cried for Ann. Incredible story. The fact that Ann worked beside Ted and was his friend, makes it even more amazing.Anything written by Ann Rule is hard to put down. She describes the characters so well.Fabulous author!"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"As a historian of the Pacific Northwest History, I found this book to be a must ready. It is a well written book of one of the most well known and well feared local figures.As a long time resident of Seattle's University District, I was shocked on how well Ted Bundy was a part of this neighborhood. Dante's, Bundy's hang out, is still in business today."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"I could not put this book down. I read it in 5 days. Excellent!"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"I read this book years ago and just reread it while on vacation. I enjoyed it so much more than the first time, although I loved it then. It really is a true crime classic, and as an avid TC reader, this one has my vote for all time favorite, right behind \\"In Cold Blood,\\" and \\"Blood and Money.\\" If you've read it before, read it again. This one stands the test of time!"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"How many times have you heard people watching the news when a killer similar to Bundy and Dahmer make comments like, \\"How could anyone be friends with THAT?\\" For years I wondered this myself until picking up Ann Rule's book, The Stranger Beside Me.Imperative to the story, which some people are complaining about, is Rule's own reactions to a man she never dreamed capable of committing the heinous crimes he proved to be more than guilty of in the end. She gave an account in the beginning of knowing an unsure, intelligent, bright young man whom she'd spent hours with working a suicide prevention hotline (yes, I find that baffling as well), having gotten to know and respect him well. He was not, as some people pointed out, insane, but a man who was intelligent beyond most people's grasp, and that is probably what made him more frightening than anything else. For all those people who don't understand, I empathized for years until reading this account. Given her portrait of the young college student she'd first met, I could see how a relative or friend doesn't want to believe the worst about somebody they have been so close to, yet most people don't get it because they have never, and probably never will, know a notorious sociopath who is clever enough to compartmentalize his life to the degree that Bundy did. In fact, I still find it amazing that Rule was capable of corresponding with him long after realizing that he was guilty. The individual human mind is capable of conjuring up coping mechanisms in ways science and society may never figure out, and Rule probably had to keep corresponding with him in order not to break. It is obvious from her writing the years of strain she has gone through. How did she know that, later being contracted to write about the elusive killer named Ted, that it would turn out to be her dear friend? You have to walk a mile in her shoes before judging her, and it's not an enviable position.I'm pleased that she gave the victims a tangible quality in their lives, so as to preserve the lives of their spirits in some way. After all, as she had stated, nobody really remembers their names except those close to them, and Ted is still a \\"star.\\"The story still bothers and scares me tremendously, makes me wonder if my neighbors have something to hide. After all, the Bundy monster is gone, but how many are out there free that have taken his place? I bet some of you have contemplated the same. One thing that is more terrifyingly certain is this: Bundy was NOT insane, he was evil, and that is more frightening than a madman. When he escaped to Florida, did he think the death penalty there would keep him from killing again, or was it a death wish? We may never know. Apparently, the lack of catering to his gargantuan male ego was what fueled him to kill again when he realized nobody recognized him in the Sunshine State. This was when I really began to hate him, and it would have been sooner if not for Rule's human portrayal. After his Florida rampage, they couldn't kill that selfish, conceited, egomaniacal sociopath fast enough. To me, if it's possible, the crimes seemed even worse than if they'd never caught him at all. Then again, would they have escalated anyway?Ann Rule's book both shows the chilling factors of a man who could seem so human, have everything going for him, yet be so emotionless as to let his violent fantasies turn him into a glimpse of hell. The only reason he confessed to so many crimes was to save his own life. The only reason he didn't confess to more was to save his own life. His tears were all for him, and in the end, none of his manipulation and tactics saved him. For this, and for the sake of his would-be victims, I am most grateful."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Even though \\"Stranger Beside Me\\" is a book about one of America's most notorious serial killers, it seemed overly long and inert--perhaps because it was written in the first person, and that person was Ann Rule. I put it down several times and had trouble picking it up again.The author had the perfect background for this story: she and Ted Bundy worked together as volunteers at the Seattle Crisis clinic in 1971; she was already a crime writer, and an ex-cop to boot; she was assigned to work on the case of the mysterious North-west killings long before Bundy was suspected of committing them. She also belonged to the same sorority (Chi Omega) where Bundy went on his next-to-the-last killing spree in Florida--the case that finally put him on death row.\\"Stranger Beside Me\\" has almost everything you might want to know about Theodore Bundy: his childhood; the shame he felt because he was illegitimate; his two escapes from prison; the murders he committed and those that he probably committed; the police who were involved in his case; the women who loved him; his court appearances; his confession; his death.However, the book also has a lot you might not want to know about the author: her bad dreams; her \\"extrasensory awareness of evil or danger\\" in various places connected with Bundy's murders; her feelings about his feelings; her on-again off-again loyalty to Bundy. There's a great deal of print taken up about how he was really tearing her up inside with all of his alleged wrong-doings, but I couldn't help wondering if the money she sent to him in prison played a role in his escape to Florida. I also couldn't help wondering if she stuck with him as long as she did (this is probably totally unfair) because of this book contract.Ann Rule does have a unique insight into the soul (if he had one) of a killer. This is definitely a one-of-a-kind true crime story. It's just that I feel it could have been tightened up and cut from 548 pages (the updated twentieth anniversary edition) down to around 350, or so by eliminating the author's personal psycho-dramas."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"As a crime writer, Ann Rule was \\"in the right place at the right time\\" as far as Ted Bundy is concerned... That she can provide the facts along with personal, first-hand anecdotes regarding Bundy makes this book all the more mesmerizing... It is so eerie and macabre, that it is almost too bizarre to be a true story!!!For anyone interested in true crime, this is one that definitely should not be missed..."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"I found this book highly stimulating, I was unable to put it down.Ann Rule's inside perspective brought a new light to the Ted Bundy story. The facts, the drama, the familiarity, all brought together makes this book extremely well written, easy to follow, and gripping to read! Great job Ann !!My boyfriend (who hates to read anything other than car magazines) gave it a read (to see what all my hype up of the book was about) and he finished it in about 5 days ! Now he's ready to read about the Green River killer. If a book can turn a non-reader into a reader, thats 5 stars in my book! And I am ready to read it again (I read it about 2 years ago)."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"This book will keep you wondering until the end whether or not they got the right guy...I, like Ann Rule, did not want to believe that this man could commit these heinous crimes. That is why I believe that readers MUST read the 2000 version (Bundy was executed in 1989) as it includes some VERY important updates at the end of the book.A very well-written book. The reader can feel Ms. Rule's pain as she struggles with coming to terms that this seemingly incredible man is really a wolf in sheep's clothing."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"This was my second Ann Rule book and it will not be my last! I was looking for something creepy yet interesting to read and I found it all in this book. I couldn't put it down for a week. If you like to read true cases this is the book for you, no doubt."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"A fantastic read. Ann Rule managed to bring forth the gruesome tale of Ted Bundy's psychotic behaviour fantastically."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"This book, \\"The Stranger Beside Me\\" by Ann Rule, is truly terrifying. My husband works the night shift, and that's when I get most of my reading done. Even though Ted Bundy is dead, I wished my husband worked days more than once while reading this book so he would be home with me! Despite the fact that I was scared out of my mind, I still couldn't put this book down.Ted Bundy confessed to murdering over 30 women in the most brutal fashion in the 1970's. Most of the women were college age, early twenties, stylish, with long dark hair parted in the middle. His youngest victim was [...]. Only a couple of his victims survived. He would stalk them as they were out walking, then pounce at an opportune time, such as when they were walking under a dark bridge or alley. Sometimes, he killed more than one girl a night, such as the Chi Omega sorority murders, when he left two for dead and severely injured two more before going to another house and bludgeoning another girl who also lived. That happened after he escaped from prison a second time and ran to Florida, where he was free for several months.Ann Rule has a great writing style. It's detailed but moves along at a good pace, and flows very nicely. She gets the point across matter-of-factly of how horrific Bundy's crimes were without getting too grisly, which is something I appreciated.I can't believe she actually knew Bundy while he was murdering these women, was friends with him. Of course, she didn't know he was a killer, but I can't imagine being in that situation. How did she feel about it? How did she accept it? How could someone so charming and so normal by day turn into such a madman at night? What was wrong with him? Nothing spectacular happened in his life that would give us an explanation. It's a mystery. He is one of the reasons I believe some people are just born with those bad inclinations, and people like Ted Bundy choose to act on them.This book is highly recommended for anyone interested in true crime or horror stories, because this book is certainly horrifying."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"I originally read the book mainly for the purpose of a term paper I was doing for school. I'm majoring in Criminal Justice and find the minds of serial killers to be so interesting. So, when I chose to do my paper on Ted Bundy, I figured I would be reading a book simply to get a term paper written. However, I ended up loving the book and couldn't put it down. I found myself looking forward to having free time just so that I could use that free time to read more of the book and get further into it. Needless to say the book was great from beginning to end. I definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys True Crime books, especially when they are written by someone who personally knew the person who the book is about."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"This is one of the best true crime books that I have read. Ann Rule does a great job at presenting all the aspects of Ted Bundy's life. So many true crime books merely tell you the crimes and how the criminal was caught, but Rule gives you many deatils of Bundy's life and the lives of his victims. Many questions I usually have after reading a true crime book were answered here. Rule does a wonderful job giving the readers information about the victims. The victims aren't just numbers in a trail of horror. They are actual people who you grieve for as you read the book."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"The sheer number of Ted Bundy's known and suspected victims may well satisfy most people that his execution should be the end of his story, but it should not and \\"The Stranger Beside Me\\" does not answer what is begged: why? Did something in society create what truly was a monster or was Bundy truly a human form of pure evil? Ann Rule is not to be criticized for not answering in her book, a masterpiece in detailing the horrors that Bundy inflicted on his known victims and posing the frightening likelihood that others still buried endured his torture. Rule was, after all, blinded like everyone else by Bundy's purported grace and all those other attributes assigned to \\"decent\\" people. For anyone seeking the definitive answer, if they care, are likely to be disappointed that \\"The Stranger Beside Me\\" doesn't provide it. Illigitemacy? A love relationship gone bad? Can these two simple factors alone or together and which so many other people have undoubtedly experienced so fracture a human psyche that it abandons every shred of humanity? It's doubtful, leading us to conclude that some other horrific force was at work. Still, Ms. Rule's book is a great read for no other reason than to feel the numbing trauma of Bundy's catastrophic acts, even if they aren't satisfactorily explained."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Ann Rule did a good job of re-telling the true story of Theodore Robert Bundy. However, she often focused too much on herself and her personal accomplishments rather than on the story of Ted Bundy. Some of the sections where she talked about herself interrupted the flow of the novel. The fact that she actually knew Ted Bundy gave the book a more personal touch. Her in- depth knowledge about Ted Bundy gives the reader the feeling of knowing who he really was. Ann Rule wrote the story of Ted Bundy unbiasly. She leaned neither to his innocence or to him being guilty. This gave the story a more true quality. The overall story of Ted Bundy, told in The Stranger Beside Me, was intriguing and interesting to read. I am looking forward to reading another one of her novels. Ann Rule is really the &quot;Queen of True Crimes!&quot;."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"As another feminist, I found Reviewer Gwen's comments to be knee-jerk and utterly off-base (also, seeing woman-haters everywhere is pretty much why people roll their eyes when they hear the word &quot;feminist&quot;). Because if anyone does just the slightest bit of research--pulls old newspaper photos and clippings, views video of courtroom testimony, reads other books on the subject, etc.--you'll see that Ted really *did* attract a ridiculous number of women to his side. They flocked to him in droves. As Rule points out, this is a fascination &quot;some women&quot; have with serial killers. Rule's observation of a common phenomenon (check just about any psych text or, better yet, talk to a shrink to verify its frequency) hardly classifies her as a cruel, cowardly woman-hater. &quot;We&quot; don't need to keep that in mind, &quot;we&quot; should just read this book for a fascinating and intimate glimpse into what drives a sociopath."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Most people seem to speak well of this book. It's not that I didn't like it so much as it didn't satisfy me. There are descriptions of grizzly murders, and Ann Rule has the advantage of personally knowing Ted Bundy, so she's got a better view than most. Nevertheless, I feel like I'm reading a newspaper account. We don't get under the skin of Bundy; we don't know what makes him tick; we know very little of his life. When I finished, I didn't feel I really understood anything."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"This was the third &quot;Bundy Book&quot; to come out with &quot;Stranger&quot; in the title. The first two were the paperback &quot;Ted Bundy: All American Stranger&quot;, which was rushed into print on the heels of the Chi Omega verdict and Richard Larsen's &quot;Bundy: The Deliberate Stranger&quot;, which came out shortly after the Leach verdict. Larsen's book served as the basis for the TV miniseries starring Mark Harmon and then fell out of print. &quot;Stranger Beside Me&quot; had better legs and remains in print to this day. This book's success comes from Ann Rule being a better writer who wrote from a better perspective. Although Richard Larsen also knew Bundy personally, he was not as close to Bundy as Rule apparently was. Factually, the book appears about as accurate as any other of the plethora of Bundy books, but all these books suffer from a common failing: wittingly or unwittingly, they tend to glamorize a sadistic, brutal recreational killer who really was no stranger than any of the other &quot;serial killers&quot; who captured the headlines of the last half of the 20th Century. This alone separated Bundy from the pack: he was an articulate pretty boy. If you feel you really must read about such a monster, this book is about as good as any of the other Bundy books and probably better than most of them."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"I decided to read this book because it was a recommendation for readers (after Alice Sebold's Lucky). I am not a true-crime fan. And I worked as residential treatment staff for mentally ill for several years. Sociopaths are rare... but they're out there. I am convinced they are born as is, that some part of their brains just doesn't have the capacity to feel anything. The smart ones study &#34;normal&#34; people's facial expressions. I think if Ted Bundy was a young man in this day and age, someone would have reported his behaviors, and red flags would've gone up. Ann Rule, in this day and age, would have had courses chock full of studies identifying psychotic behavior, as well as bipolar and antisocial behaviors. Ted Bundy killed at a time when forensic science was still in its infancy... imagine how great it would have been to be scientifically sure to have evidence against him. For anyone interested, Jomathan Kellerman wrote a non-fiction book called Savage Spawn, about young sociopaths. And The Psychopath Test is making the rounds also. Ted Bundy used his normal white guy looks back in the 70s... these days he would find his prey was not so easy to obtain. And I really hope Ann Rule has gotten some therapy for what is either survivor's guilt or Stockholm Syndrome. Hopefully by now she realizes that she was being used by someone who probably laughed at every check or book of stamps she sent. She would not have gotten any kind of confessions out of him... he was feeding the authorities what they wanted so he could continue to be the star of his own movie... and to live. Really good book thoughtfully written. I just threw up in my mouth a little each time Rule tried to describe Bundy's &#34;good points&#34;. He had none. It's good he's dead."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Here you go. A great tale of someone who worked beside Bundy. This is kind of a trashy genre, but I personally can't help myself. And this does have its insights. I read this in college, so I don't know as I'd call it a literary masterwork, but very readable. The story of how Bundy worked in a crisis center was really chilling. One of the mind-blowing things about Bundy was that his girlfriend was working with the FBI as she suspected he was the culprit, yet she stayed with him for two years afterward. This book is full of weird turns like that; how someone right next to you is a full-blown psychopath. The stuff of nightmares."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"I had heard of this book, of course; had wanted to read it for years, so when this 20th anniversary edition came out, I decided to give it a go. I had a pre-conceived notion: OK, this is going to be a really interesting biography of Ted Bundy, with the added attraction of having been written by a former dear friend. Fast, easy crime reading, I thought.I was wrong. This story is so chilling, so frightening, it grips you in the gut. Ann Rule has simply stated the facts. No sensationalism, no gratuitous gore, no psychobabble. Just the facts. As they happend. And even though the reader might think of Ted Bundy as &quot;old news,&quot; and even though he was executed in 1989, this book makes one check to see that the doors and windows are locked.There are actually two stories here: one describes the gradual disintegration of a seemingly normal, affable, brilliant man into a sexual psychopath so evil, so methodical in his vicious killings, that one wonders if he was at all human. The other story is that of Ann Rule herself, a decent, hard-working, middle-aged mother of four who meets and befriends a nice young man working beside her in a crisis clinic. A man she regards as a younger brother; a man she views as a close and trusted friend. The slow but inexorable realization on Rule's part that this man is in fact an unspeakably violent serial killer is as painful to read as it was for her to experience.Each victim is described in terms of such respect and such anguish that even a family member, I think, can feel that his or her daughter has been given a chance to shine, a chance to be more than a victim, more than a nameless number (8th girl killed, and so forth). The poignancy of these girls' very human preoccupations and lives serves to outline the contrasting horror in even more detail. That is why Rule does not have to defile the victims with intricate detail. The contrast between their young lives and their terrible deaths is enough in itself.Rule's new Afterward, written in 2000, is fascinating. She has not &quot;recovered and moved on&quot;; there is no real &quot;closure.&quot; She has come to accept that the incomprehensible contrast between Ted the Dear Friend and Ted the Monster will never leave her, and will never be fully explained, no matter how many facts she sifts, no matter how much progress has been made in understanding the sexual psychopath. It is her fate to have known Bundy in all his skins; it is our privilege to read her account of it."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"This is an excellent true crime book. It has an unusual twist in that the author and the subject of the book, serial killer Ted Bundy, had a platonic relationship that arose from the time they were co-workers for a Seattle, Washington crisis center. Quite frankly, the author initially had no idea that Ted Bundy was anything other than what he appeared to be: a handsome, intelligent, charismatic, and articulate young man, who was, at the time, involved in local politics and later became a law student.When he became the suspect in the disappearance and murders of a number of very young, pretty women, the author was in total disbelief. As the evidence mounted against her friend, the author, who is a former police officer, could not shut her eyes to the reality that Ted Bundy was actually a very disturbed individual who was guilty of all of which he was accused and probably guilty of other such crimes for which he was not accused for evidentiary reasons. Consequently, the author would suffer some angst for many years, as she struggled to reconcile the Ted Bundy that she thought she knew with the fiend who was compelled to commit so many vicious abductions, assaults, and murders. It is believed that at least thirty-five young women, and probably a good number more, died at the hands of Ted Bundy.The author details the abductions, assaults, and murders of his victims from coast to coast, which crimes were ultimately to make Ted Bundy a nationwide household name, and an entity to be feared. The investigative efforts of law enforcement officers in the states of Washington, Utah, Colorado, and Florida are revealed, as are Ted Bundy's arrests and his trials. She also details his two escapes from custody in Colorado, the last of which would find him heading to the sunshine state of Florida.Florida was an interesting choice of state for Ted Bundy, as it is a death penalty state in which convicted felons, who have been given the death penalty, are actually executed. Notwithstanding Florida's stance on capital crime, Ted Bundy went on to commit a slew of shocking assaults and murders in Florida for which he was ultimately arrested, tried, and convicted. Considering the fact that Ted Bundy could have chosen to relocate to a state other than Florida after his last escape from custody in Colorado, it almost appears as if he had a death wish by going to Florida and continuing to give in to his sick compulsion. Unfortunately for him, Florida was quite happy to make his wish come true, and on January 24, 1989, Ted Bundy was executed, and his reign of terror was finally over.Those who like the true crime genre will enjoy this well-written and well-researched book. It is highly detailed and contains a great deal of information, some of it quite personal due to the author's relationship with Ted Bundy. She paints a very intriguing, intimate portrait of him, one that is three dimensional and complex. He was definitely a man whose benign and compelling external visage was at odds with his many internal demons, as he was a prolific serial killer. Externally, Ted Bundy was the sort of man towards whom women gravitated, and there was no dearth of Ted Bundy groupies once he made headlines.In the updates at the end of the book, the author theorizes as to why Ted Bundy, a young man of so much promise, would end up the way that he did, and she provides some interesting and personal familial information from which the reader may draw his or her own conclusion. All in all, aficionados of the true crime genre will find much of interest in this book."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Without a doubt, the coincidence that found Ann Rule already acquainted with the prime suspect in a series of brutal murders is one that would be hard to believe if this were fiction. But it's not -- Rule, contracted to write the story of the elusive &quot;Ted,&quot; discovers that her former colleague, Ted Bundy, curiously resembles the profile of the killer. Rule's later career as one of the most spectacularly successful true crime writers was significantly enhanced by the publication of this book. She writes with a surprising candor of the intimacy between herself and the Republican Party aspirant and law student who was eventually put to death after committing an unknown number of killings in an unknown number of states. Bundy's episodic rampages through the states of Utah, Washington and Florida are well known, and he is, in many ways, the most &quot;famous&quot; of modern serial killers. On the constitution of the serial killer as a modern identity, there's probably nothing better than Mark Selzer's book Serial Killers, a fascinating study of this modern pathology which traces the identity assumed by Bundy and other back to Jack the Ripper. The Ripper, as the first elusive, anonymous, random killer to gain notoriety in popular culture, offered an &quot;identikit&quot; profile for the serial killer which Bundy, as &quot;Ted,&quot; fits perfectly.Rule's book reads like a curious amalgam of true crime and romance fiction, and, in many ways, this is a love story of sorts. Rule's fascination with Bundy reminds us of the charismatic powers of the sociopathic personality, and its plaint, adaptable face in this competitive culture we find ourselves in. Some might find her portrait of Bundy disturbing: she remains, through most of the book, reluctant to acknowledge the severity and hideousness of his crimes. But she acknowledges them, finally, in her graphic retelling of courtroom testimony, and in her humble incomprehension of the pain that Bundy brought to the lives of many. If you're looking for a book about this iconic figure, it's hard to go past The Stranger Beside Me. One way or another, it's become a classic true crime narrative. Rule taps into the rule of contingency that dogs serial killings: everything takes place merely because of opportunity, coincidence, random fate. And everything seems to have a moral, though Rule is properly reticent about what the moral here might be. My only hesitation concerns the way in which Rule introduces the victims: in some ways, it's more like a roster call than the poignant series of vignettes she intends. There are facts here that have been better discussed elsewhere, perhaps, but because of the strange coincidence that drew Rule and Bundy together, it's a powerful book."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"\\"THE STRANGER BESIDE ME\\" is undoubtedly one of Ann's best books. It is a cautionary tale of how someone who appears to have everything going for him, as Bundy did, can have another, hidden and dark side altogether. Bundy appeared to be the all-American \\"golden boy\\" but in reality, he was a sexual sadist, sexual predator and necrophiliac dominated by dark and unmentionable compulsions which he felt compelled to act upon.Rule's book is chilling because it shows that anyone can be \\"taken in\\" by these psychopathic (now called anti-social) personalities. In reality, Ted Bundy was nothing but a black hole. The appearance he made to all he came in contact with, including Ann Rule, was meant to fool people. His outward appearance was carefully thought out to reassure others and impress them that he was really \\"going places\\" in life and had everything going for him.Rule's book is eerie because she shows that much of what Bundy did, while maintaining this \\"perfect\\" image to the outside world, was carefully thought out, especially the disappearance of Lynda Ann Healy, who has still never been found. The only earthly remnant of Lynda was part of her skull, which detectives found on Taylor Mountain. Bundy was a devious, cunning, and wicked man. Ann is lucky because she could easily have become one of his victims. She worked with him alone at nights and the realization of this must still haunt her today. She worked beside him and truly thought she knew him, but she didn't. Thus, the title \\"the stranger beside me\\" truly is an apt one. I think this should serve as a cautionary tale to many women who think they have met \\"Mr. Right.\\" Perhaps women should heed the old adage \\"the jury is still out\\" when meeting someone new, especially after reading this book!"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"I have read this book several times since it was first released. It is very hard for me to read or watch anything about Ted Bundy since my cousin was his last victim. I would recommend this book to anyone that has ever heard of Ted Bundy. It is scary to think that this kind of thing can happen anywhere, anytime. Ann Rule shows you how you think you know someone but really not know them at all. Even though Bundy finally met his match, it's sad to think we will never know how many victims there really were and what kind of pain and horror they might have suffered. Too bad Bundy's life ended so quickly!"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"This book is one of the most definitive books on serial killer Ted Bundy, and for good reason: author Ann Rule actually knew and worked with him at a Seattle-based suicide &amp; crisis hotline. Bundy seemed an unlikely murderer; friends knew him as a smart law student, a man with an interest in state politics, and a man with a longtime girlfriend. Like most people, Rule wasn't sure what to believe when Bundy was first arrested on kidnapping charges in Utah in 1975. She stayed neutral and wrote this book, and the result was a fascinating account that manages to walk the fine line between good taste and opportunism.The Stranger Beside Me covers a lot of ground in its attempts to paint a clear picture of Ted Bundy. Countless acquaintances of Bundy are quoted or mentioned, and Ann Rule's past experience as a police officer gave her inside access to the investigations that most people could only dream about. She also manages to describe her strange relationship with Bundy without making herself sound overly important, thereby keeping her credibility above reproach. Bundy is revealed to be a hollow, warped, sadistic predator, not at all the cassanova that the press sometimes made him out to be. This book is fascinating on many levels, and Rule's careful research also shows.For all these reasons, I couldn't give this book any less than five stars. The only real complaint that I have is that the book often has a wandering feel. The book isn't just about Bundy; it's also about Ann Rule and how she followed the case and later the trial, even sometimes speaking with Bundy or writing him letters in jail. As a result, the focus of this book often seems to waver. But it is hard to blame Rule for any of this because Bundy himself was a wanderer, committing his crimes in several western states (that we know of) before finally ending his criminal career in Florida. His crimes were numerous and terrible and his personality was very abnormal, resulting in a very complex and tragic story. Rule glosses over some of the worst details, but it's just as well; there is no way for anyone to fail to appreciate how awful Bundy was. True crime doesn't get much scarier than this."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"As a true crime fan, I have read many books by countless authors. Ann Rule is the only author who has completely explained the proper definition of a serial killer.This book is a fascinating look into the human mind and a man, Ted Bundy. I would like to thank Ann for finally describing and telling this story.This is a must read for any psychology student and true crime lover."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"And i would say this book is also one of the greatest insights into the life of a Serial Killer, in this case one of the most known and prolific Serial Killers of the modern era, ever. Ann Rule has created a masterpiece that delves heavily into the mind of Ted Bundy, and she also keeps you hanging with every passing chapter of this 498-page book. It's hard to put this book down when reading it.Ted Bundy has to be one of the most famous, and in my opinion, most fascinating Serial Killers ever. I have read about countless Serial Killers, i own many books on Serial Murder, but this one by Ann Rule, \\"The Stranger Beside Me\\", is undoubtedly the most gripping, realistic and most involving one i have ever read. What makes it so unique, mainly, is the fact that the Author, Ann Rule, was a good friend of Ted Bundy's. They had met and become good friends at a Crisis Clinic (Of all places for Ted Bundy to have worked..) where they both worked for a time. From their first meeting in 1971, when Ted Bundy was 24 and she herself was nearing 40, all the way to the early-mid 80's, Ann Rule kept in touch with Ted Bundy.This book is so deeply involved, so heavily investigated and well-thought out. Another unique thing about it is how Ann Rule tends to write and describe certain things. Her way of writing, at least in this book as i don't happen to own any of her other books unfortunately, just keeps you on edge. The facts, dates and information about each murder is extremely in-depth, as is the letters and calls Ann Rule and Ted Bundy made to eachother, and what Ted Bundy has said on tape to Police Detectives and Investigators that worked on the case.The updated chapters, from the mid to late 80's, are also a great highlight and a good reason to pick up this book. The whole book is such an interesting read, and so hard to put down when reading, that it's a mistake to pass up on this. If you are at all interested in Serial Murder, or if you are interested in Ted Bundy and his story, certainly without a doubt do not miss out on this. Pick this up straight-away, you just will not be disappointed. Ann Rule has written a classic book that will go down in history, or at least in this genre of writing's history, as one of the greatest. 5/5 is really an understatement.Also check out books such as; \\"The Only Living Witness\\" and \\"Conversations With a Killer - The Death Row Interviews\\" by Stephen G. Michaud and Hugh Aynesworth, and also \\"The History of Murder\\" by Colin Wilson, a massive 639-page book that has extremely in-depth coverage of Murder all through the ages. From the years 1000 through to the Columbine Massacre of April 1999, it chronicles everything from Vlad the Impaler, Marquis de Sade, through to a very detailed and very long chapter on Serial Murder and leads into \\"Serial Killers of The Nineties\\" which is a detailed guide to some unknown and less famous Serial Killers."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Despite being a huge crime reader, I don't usually read true crime. This book was recommended by so many crime fiction readers that I thought I'd check it out. I was interested in how one of the most noteworthy real life serial killers compared against his fictional counterparts.Many aspects of Ted Bundy's life of crime really are the stuff of novels, and no doubt have inspired many. Women of a specific and similar physical appearance disappearing all over the country are like something from a James Patterson book. Like Hannibal Lecter, Ted Bundy had formal psychiatric training and was experienced at administering the same psychological tests that were given to him in prison. He is cunning enough to escape prison, and adept at procuring fake identities and eluding the police. No maladjusted misfit, he was personable, charming, attractive to women - while capable of chilling rages where, in a single night, he could savage 4 different women, racing, bloodstained, from one college dorm to another.Much of the book is about Bundy's trials and time in prison - details absent from most fiction, which usually conveniently end after the perpetrator's discovery. While Bundy himself could hold his own as a fictional character, what really differs is the lack of any cohesive protaganist. While many individual police worked long and hard on his cases over the years, there was no idea for a long while that many of his attacks were connected, a situation that surely could not have escaped, for instance, a Lucas Davenport. Once the police finally manage to convict him - on only three of a known 35 and suspected 150 murders - the suspense moves to Bundy's fight against his execution date, which is postponed many times. Bundy repeatedly gains time by promising to confess - although already convicted, confessions to the any of the dozens of outstanding suspicious disappearances are a powerful bargaining tool for him due to the closure that it brings to these victim's relatives. The thought of so many real families in such uncertain agony - some of them, still - is very upsetting.Whether Ms Rule's unique persective on the Ted Bundy case actually adds anything to the story is hard to say - despite their long friendship, she seems as baffled as everyone else as to how or why the kind and sensitive guy she knew could be a brutal and sadistic killer. Everyone who reads this by now knows the facts of the case, and it's hard to share any of her initial support of Bundy. This book's effectiveness is its thoroughness in showing the untidy fringes and loose ends that accompany real life crime - it's a scary, thought-provoking, and worthwhile read."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"I realize that the author was not objective in writing this book because of her acquaintance with Bundy, but I found the book much, much less than objective. I suppose I should have gotten a book by someone else because I was looking for a novel that gave all of the facts and was very straight-forward. This came off a little \\"fluffy\\", which I admit is not the best choice of words for a novel about a serial killer. At one point, Rule wrote something along the lines of how it was such a shame that all of Ted Bundy's victims were so young, beautiful, and intelligent. (Because it would be so much more excusable if they were dumb, ugly, and old!) Also, the descriptions of various people, from Detectives to victims, was too flowery for my taste, containing lots of adjectives and cliches. The editing was also a problem, almost a nuisance. An example is that one of the possible victims' names is Ann Marie, which she writes multiple times as either \\"Anne Marie\\" or \\"Ann Marie\\", and sometimes refers to her as \\"Ann\\", just before calling her \\"Ann Marie\\" again. She states on one page that it took the jury just under 7 hours to deliberate, on the next page it's less than 6 hours, and finally it's back to 7. And my final complaint, a big pet peeve of mine, is that she stated some events as being \\"anticlimATIC\\" (instead of anticlamACTIC)- maybe she was referring to being against the weather?Other than those complaints, I was satisfied with the portrayal of Bundy and with the amount of information given. There is much detail, including names, dates, jury selection, judges, etc. Overall a decent book if you don't mind the above issues."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"This was one of the best books I have read in a long time. How tragic for all those young girls to fall prey to such a vicious monster. On the other hand, what a tragic waste of life for Ted Bundy who one day could have very easliy have been a high ranking member of society. Ann Rule did such a great job in capturing every aspect of this monster better then anyone else ever can, on a personal level. Great read for anyone interested not only in True Crime, but Ted Bundy himslef."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Very interesting because of Ann Rule knowing Ted Bundy and what she went through. True Crime author involved with the person she is writing about makes this a one of a kind. Not knowing her friend is her subject until he's a suspect! I like the fact that she shared her personal struggle with writting this book. One of my favorites by Ann Rule."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"The Stranger Beside Me is the best true crime book I have ever read. However, it is also the most disturbing, so much so that more than once, I vowed not to finish it. Of course, I did finish it, and the story will probably stick with me for a while.The book is, for the most part, a chronological account of Ted Bundy's life. It's fascinating that the author was actually friends with Bundy before she knew he was a killer. The book is filled with devastating accounts of the crimes that he was accused and later convicted of. Rule also explores possibilities of how and when he became obsessed with murder. Interesting reading, but keep the lights on and the doors locked."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"I have been fascinated and terrified by the Ted Bundy murders since I was a little girl. He was a bit of an iconic anti-hero in my hometown of Seattle. When I was a teenager, I picked up this book for the first time, and over the years I've read it over and over again. My first copy became so dog-eared I passed it onto a friend, who bought me the updated version. Ann Rule is one of my favorite authors. I was always an avid reader of both fiction and non-fiction, but I have been so accustomed to her writing style, I scarcely want to read anything else anymore. I'd recommend this book to anyone, whether they enjoy true crime or not, whether or not they're familiar with the Bundy case."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Ann Rule, a true-crime author, is hired to chronicle the hunt for a brutal serial killer. Slowly she comes to realize that the homicidal maniac police are searching for is her beloved friend and co-worker. No one can make real life characters as compelling as Ann Rule, and The Stranger Beside Me is a masterpiece. And what makes later editions worth the trouble of seeking out is the additional material Rule adds, often in answer to readers' questions."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"If you have yet to read this book, I envy you. It was the first true-crime book I ever read, and remains one of the best to this day. Read this book at night, alone in the dark, and you will be terrified. But the book is very multi-dimensional. The victims are not treated as mere props, you will truly feel for them. Rule, a mature woman and former police officer, was taken in by Bundy's charming persona. Her gradual (and very reluctant) realization that he was a serial killer make an engrossing story. The lesson is that \\"charm\\" is not necessarily a god-given personal attribute, but could be the tool of a manipulative human predator. If this aspect of \\"The Stranger Beside Me\\" is of interest to you, try reading \\"The Gift of Fear\\" by Gavin DeBecker. It contains a lot of fascinating information on identifying the tactics of manipulation."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Ann Rule was a Seattle policewoman who turned to journalism, specializing in True Crime around the northwest coast. Of her many books, this is the only one where she had personal knowledge of the perfect son, law student, social worker, and \\"trusted friend\\". Rule started writing this book before she found out that the suspect in these serial killings was her friend and co-worker, Ted Bundy. [Was he the inspiration for \\"Hannibal Lecter\\"?] Rule says there was nothing in Ted's record that could predict his future (p.xi). Yet there were incidents in his behavior: suspicion of auto theft and burglary (p.12), rifling lockers and stealing from drunks (p.14). His first girlfriend believed Ted used people and took advantage of them (p.15); she was also out of his class. Ted had other disappointments (pp.16-17). But he returned to college and became an honor student in psychology. Ted told stories to gain sympathy from a Professor (p.20). [A sign of a manipulator.] But otherwise Ted seemd to have a bright future (p.21).Ann Rule worked as a volunteer for the Seattle Crisis Clinic in 1971. Ted was one of the work-study students there. They both helped to save lives (p.25). Ted was helpful in his advice to Rule (p.27). Ted's slenderness disguised his physical strength (p.29); racquetball and bicycling. Rule admired him. Ted was a conservative Republican who believed in law and order; Rule never saw any anger (p.32). Ted had a \\"compartmentalized\\" life, moved in many circles where no one really knew much about him. Ted's relationship with Stephanie changed, due to Ted's bitterness. Did Ted court her so he could reject her as she had earlier rejected him (p.47)? She survived this and married someone else. After this, the first victim disappeared.Rule's life continued, a single mother with four children, writing reports on cases for the police, then writing stories for publication (p.49). Rule was a Deputy Sheriff in many of the counties, and spent time with various units (p.50). After young girls disappeared, Rule believed the killer would be a violent man, someone let out of prison too soon (p.77). Ted had a letter or recommendation from the Governor of Washington (pp.106-107). His coworkers at the Dept of Emergency Services noted his resemblance to the \\"Ted\\" at Lake Sammamish (pp.108-109). So did others (p.110). The murders in the Seattle area ceased but new murders occurred in Utah, Ted's new home (Chapter 13). But Ted failed to abduct and kill a young woman; Ted impersonated a police detective to fool this victim! After this young woman started to disappear in Colorado; some of their bodies were found (pl143). Early one morning a Utah HP sergeant noticed a VW Beetle driving by; he followed and stopped this car, and arrested the driver for evading an officer, and possessing burglar tools. Now things began to fall inot pale, and Rule received a phone call from Ted (Chapter 16). Those who worked with Ted couldn't believe the charges (p.157). Rule wrote to Ted in jail, and received Ted's letters. [Rule doesn't say that her association with Ted provided a powerful competitive advantage for her book.] The divorced single mother who lived off and on with Ted admittted he would leave in the middle of the night for hours, often when the girls disappeared (p.166). The police checked Ted's credit card records and telephone bills. Ted had been in the area where girls disappeared (p.175). Prison psychiatrists found Ted to be \\"normal\\" (p0.217); but he was sober then. After his second escape Ted travelled to Tallahassee FL and attacked girls at the Chi Omega sorority. (Rule had pledged to this organization - was Ted sending her a message?) A police officer noted a car coming out of a parking lot early in the morning, followed and stopped it. The suspect resisted arrest, but Patrolman David Lee caught one of the Ten-Most-Wanted. Ted's murder spree was over (Chapter 34). The rest of this book end this story, with Rule's personal experience at the trial.Ted's trial in Miami was televised live; was this a first? The bite marks on Lisa Levy's buttocks first linked a victim to Ted (p.397-398). Rule said Ted was found guilty becaase he fought against his defense lawyers (p.403)."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me","review":"Fate made her friends with a young, handsome, charismatic young man named Ted Bundy.

If you are a big B*WITCHED fan then this is a must have."},{"Title":"Robert the Bruce: The price of the King's Peace","review":"Great historical fiction is my specialty and discovering Nigel Tranter has been a real treat. This the first thing I have read by this author and for me it was also a fine introduction to a crucial period of Scottish history. This 3 part series covers the life of Robert Bruce, a truly dashing and gallant hero if there ever was one, and it is a true rags to riches story. The whole series is well written and though lengthy is a pleasure to read with a medieval feel to it. There are many battle scenes throughout the book, and detailed strategies described, the Scots being so outnumbered by the English had to be very clever to win.Book 1 - Opens with Bruce in his 20's, a spoiled young nobleman, forced like all the other Scottish nobles to pay homage to Edward of England and be his lackey. Later his meeting with Elizabeth de Burgh, and finally the birth of his ambition.Book 2 - Hitting rock bottom with the capture and executions of his brothers, the imprisonment of his wife, and his other female relatives kept in cages, he is finally driven into the wilderness to live as a hermit. Eventually, he rises again and is able to unite the many clans and tribes from the northern Highlands with the Norman/Celt mixed nobles from the south to fight together for the common cause of Scotland. Part 2 finishes with the Battle of Bannockburn.Book 3 - Finally the undisputed King in Scotland though there is still the ongoing struggle to have England recognize Bruce as King of Scotland.A novel I will enjoy reading again, especially loved the parts about Christina MacRuarie, ruling woman of the isles, also the Highland chiefs and sea captains. So much historical detail with never a dull moment."},{"Title":"Robert the Bruce: The price of the King's Peace","review":"I have now read this book 3 times and enjoyed more each time.

The young Earl of Carrick, Robert Bruce and his younger brothers are enjoying the attentions of Edward and living a care free life.Two events change all this, the Battle of Stirling Bridge, which unites the common Scots people behind a commoner called William Wallace, and the slaying of the Red Comyn at Berwick, on holy church ground. Robert immediately declares himself King of Scots.What follows is a marvellous account and insight into a remarkable period of Scottish history. The way Tranter protrays Bruce's internal turmoil, of being excomincated from Mother church, worrying over his diseased body and the consist struggle to free Scotland ; the obsession that Edward Plantagent has with crushing Scotland and the hounding of Bruce, keeps the reader's fullest attention.This book is a must. Superb, excellent, buy it."},{"Title":"Robert the Bruce: The price of the King's Peace","review":"I first was introduced to Nigel Tranter when I bought this book in a castle gift shop on a visit to Scotland. On my next visit, I bought every Tranter book I could find as this book was so fabulous! In fact, after reading many, I think it's his best work, and I continually read it again and again. No other book can bring Scotland to life as this does. It allows you to get into the heads of Robert the Bruce and William Wallace like no other book does. You HAVE to read this book! A 10 is not praise enough."},{"Title":"Robert the Bruce: The price of the King's Peace","review":"There are many great writers in the field of historical fiction. But there are few storytellers. Storytellers are so much more than a writer. In the Gaelic, they are called seanchaidh and they were the keepers of stories, lore and history of the Clans, the historian, the recorder. When the seanchaidh wove his tales of magick, Auld Gods or warrior-kings of Scotland, he was not recanting something created from his mind; he was passing on oral heritage that was handed down through the ages.Nigel Tranter was a seanchaidh, and he is sadly missed. Yes, he was a highly successful writer, but he was so much more, and in the tradition of old, he wove many tales of Ancient Scotland as few historians could.And THE BRUCE TRILOGY is Tranter at his best (a wee bit redundant since Tranter was always at his best). Tranter created the three books of the Trilogy to bring forth the tale of Robert Earl of Carrick who went on to become Robert the King, but he does not just tells the story, he brings Bruce alive for you to meet, to understand. He was a young man caught at the centre of Scotland's struggles. It was a separate country from England, having its own kings since the dawn of time, but Edward Plantagenet - called Edward Longshanks because of his great height and long legs - was determined to unite all of Britain. Two men stood in his way: William Wallace and Robert Bruce. Wallace (see Tranter's THE WALLACE) was a shooting star that lit the conscious mind, giving cry to a national identity Scotland often lacked, since Clan ties and oaths were generally put before homage to the King. Wallace created the spark, in common man and noble alike, that Scotland was a country and would never bow down to the English King. By very nature of whom he was, a commoner, Wallace drew Edward's wrath as no noble ever would, so Wallace's pivotal roll in Scotland's struggle to remain free was cut short. It then fell to Bruce save Scotland, a man in his twenties, who not only had to fight his family's role for him, Edward's attempt to bend him and control him while at English court, but ultimately saw him fighting 2/3 of his own Country due the mighty Clan Comyn's determination to put one of their own on the throne. You feel for Bruce, his loss of his family, the imprisonment of his wife, sister and daughter, jealousy of his brother, and maybe will understand him more as man after reading this. So much power and force behind the man and the story as only Tranter could deliver.This is a complex history, since Bruce often was seen as serving himself more than Scotland, witnessing him making homage to Edward on four separate occasions. But you learn why Bruce bought his time, played both ends against the middle, and succeeded where Wallace failed. Tranter does not just tell you these events happened, he make you see Bruce the man, not the man who would be king. Tranter opens a door into Scotland's past, and permits you to walk with him, walk with Bruce, not as a historical figure, not a King, but as a man, faults, fears and all.This is a magick that transcends being a writer, even a very good writer. This is a tale told with wonder, passion and awe by fireside by a seanchaidh.If you have never read Tranter, I cannot image a better introduction to Scotland's Seanchaidh. Once you read him, you will hungrily devour the rest of his works.WISE WRITERS AND READERS Recommended Read"},{"Title":"Robert the Bruce: The price of the King's Peace","review":"I purchased &quot;The Bruce Trilogy&quot; from the Gift Shop at the National Wallace Monument in Stirling, Scotland during a recent visit. I was already learning a tremendous amount about Sir William Wallace but wished to learn more about the complex, mysterious Monarch known as Robert the Bruce. I could not have asked for a better resource. Nigel Tranter's narrative prose takes you from Bruce's early day's as a young Earl still on courting terms with Edward I of England through his transformation into Scotland's Savior and Liberator. I also enjoyed learing about the historical innacuracies surrounding other resources such as the film &quot;Braveheart&quot; of which there were so very many. But most of all, &quot;The Bruce Trilogy&quot; leaves one with a deep appreciation of what the Scots went through and survived as a people and a nation in the face of a level of adversity and aganist odds that could scarcely be imagined--even by today's standard's. Nigel Tranter is truly a gift to the realm of Scotland and the realm of literature alike. A marvelous piece of work."},{"Title":"Robert the Bruce: The price of the King's Peace","review":"Although the film Braveheart is tremendously entertaining, it suffers as history. Part of the problem is that it is based on Randall Wallace's book rather than Nigel Tranter's. Nigel Tranter was the pre-eminent historical novelist of Scotland, and although William Wallace's tale is epic, it pales in comparison to the life of Robert the Bruce. Bruce's life is so full of adventure, tragedy, heroism, intrigue, and statesmanship, that any author of fiction would be hard pressed to just imagine the story line ... but this is based on factual events. A must read."},{"Title":"Robert the Bruce: The price of the King's Peace","review":"Nigel Tranter is an amazing author. He has brought all Scottish history to life with his series of Scottish historical novels. You can tell his research is incredible and he keeps things historically correct down to the detail. He just adds emotion and dialogue the way he thinks it happened. These are more history than fiction. It is History that breathes. This is the story of Robert the Bruce and how he went through amazing times of hardship and despair to claim the throne of Scotland and free them from English rule. This was my first Tranter book. I will not rest until I have read them all. Anyone of Scottish blood or even just interested in Scottish history should read this book. There is no dry factual text here. It is pure life, emotion and thought. Robert the Bruce lives again through Nigel Tranter."},{"Title":"Robert the Bruce: The price of the King's Peace","review":"I can't add any more to the other reviews except to say it's the best novel I've ever read. After reading it I acquired dozens of Tranter's other works, including many from the Bannockburn gift shop, and have been absorbed in nearly all, but none are as good as The Bruce Trilogy."},{"Title":"Robert the Bruce: The price of the King's Peace","review":"This book is well writtten from beginng to end, very accurate despite the book being fiction. I had real problems putting the book down because of the drama that was Scotland.This book is a must for history lovers everywhere with romance, murder,wars,backstabbing and man's greed for money above their country.The bruce shows what live was like in Scotland in the early 13th centuary as brutal and short. It is a reminder of what a major achevement Scotland had against hugely overwhelming odds.This man put up with every indignities imagineable, including his sister and wife being caged outside for many years.This is a great read for me as I live near many of places in the book, Melrose Abbey being the main one.I highly reccomend this book to anyone intrested in war and romance novels. Brillant !!!"},{"Title":"Robert the Bruce: The price of the King's Peace","review":"Nigel Tranter is one of those exceptional authors that can bring a half remembered (or half forgotten?) legend to life. The depth of his research is apparent as is the feel of and for his country and social conditions prevailing at the time of the story. His coverage of the obvious gaps in history, (caused by Edward's desire to destroy the culture as well as later events that destroyed the records) pass unnoticed. He truly is a master of the genre.Tranter's story of the Bruce is told with depth, passion and a style that can transport the reader so that they live the story as it unfolds. The characters are superb as are the depictions of the events (political, military and otherwise) leading to the re-establishment of the King of Scots. In all highly commendable."},{"Title":"Robert the Bruce: The price of the King's Peace","review":"I received the book ordered promptly and on time. We are well pleased with the purchase. My sister-in-law purchased volume 1 and I now have volume 3. We will share when we go the mountains for vacation. Thanks for sending the book so quickly."},{"Title":"Robert the Bruce: The price of the King's Peace","review":"After quickly plowing through this book in 3 weeks, because it was due back to the Library, I decided to read it again, taking copious notes and locating the places mentioned on a map of 13th century Scotland. I am now a proud owner of my very own copy of this magnificent book. I have added this book to my most favorite books of all time and it sits along side other 1000 page tomes like: \\"Pillars of the Earth,\\" \\"World without end,\\" \\"Shogun,\\" \\"The Agony and the Ecstasy\\", and several others that are my constant companions. The Bruce trilogy will take you to the depths of despair and then elevate you to new heights as you live with Robert the Bruce from his brash beginnings, growing into a man and winning Scotland. This book allows you to do what truly great books should do; transport you to the time and allows you to live as a companion with Robert, William Wallace and Edward \\"Longshanks\\". Read and let yourself be absorbed in the life of \\"Bruce the Hero King\\" at the turn of the 14th century."},{"Title":"Robert the Bruce: The price of the King's Peace","review":"This is the fourth copy of The Bruce Trilogy I have purchased over the years. My kids have taken my previous copies, with my approval of course. This one is currently on loan to my stepmom."},{"Title":"Robert the Bruce: The price of the King's Peace","review":"Excellent fictional account of actual historical events in the history of Scotland about 700 years ago. It was of particular interest to me since I share Robert Bruce's last name and have traced my ancestry back to him.Tranter makes the history come alive with his brilliant writing."},{"Title":"Robert the Bruce: The price of the King's Peace","review":"The Bruce is acknowledged as King of Scotland, but now he has all the problems of a ruler, as opposed to a rebel, and must also try and deal with King Edward, in England, and be formally recognised as a king, himself."},{"Title":"Robert the Bruce: The price of the King's Peace","review":"This book greatly exceeded my expectations. I had read a 'similar' book by Sharon Kay Penman, which was excellent also by the way, and had hoped to find books of similar quality by other authors. Nigel Tranter met my hopes and I thoroughly enjoyed the read."},{"Title":"Robert the Bruce: The price of the King's Peace","review":"All Scots and ALL English should be required to read this book."},{"Title":"Robert the Bruce: The price of the King's Peace","review":"I am nearly 52 years of age and not much given to callow enthusiasm but after reading the story of King Robert I can say that the Scots are very fortunate to have Mr. Tranter. If only our own country were so blessed. On a scale of 1 to 10 I say 1000."},{"Title":"Robert the Bruce: The price of the King's Peace","review":"I first read this book about four years ago. I am a sasanach Englishman and it made me ashamed to be English. The book instilled in me a passion for Scotland which has not diminished even to the point of calling my two sons: Robert Bruce and Jamie Douglas, though I have to say my Jamie is much sweeter than the Black Douglas portrayed. Nige Tranters book is a passionate account of the fight for Scotland's freedom from the English invaders but also a contest between the warring faction Scots tribes. It has all the hallmarks of a Shakespeare tragedy including Politics, Love, Backstabbing, Murder, Duplicity etc. It is for all of this that I am purchassing this book again. My last one has been worn out."},{"Title":"Robert the Bruce: The price of the King's Peace","review":"The Bruce Trilogy is actually a set of three separate novels written by Tranter about Robert the Bruce of Scotland, and I think enough previous reviewers have stated the basic outline of the novels that I don't need to restate it again. This was a fascinating story of an honorable, courageous man and an incredible military tactician, and his battle for freedom and peace for Scotland from the English, and most especially Edward I and II. The author did a marvelous job bringing not only Robert to life, but the secondary characters as well. I did find the third book, The Price of the King's Peace to be a bit slower than the first two, but in the end culminating into a spectacular finish as Scotland and Robert find peace at last.Well worth taking the time to read this for anyone interested in this period in history, I found it both fascinating and educational at the same time, and isn't that what historical fiction is for after all? And I loved the epilogue with James Douglas as he made his final battle cry, \\"Lead on Brave Heart\\". Although I am probably the only person on the face of the planet who hasn't seen the movie. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Robert the Bruce: The price of the King's Peace","review":"A quality read without question. I was with The Bruce. I struggled right along with him.. My my, I cried at the end, and at some parts in between.. Mr. Tranter was a talented man who knew his country and its history well. Whoever said that Tranter cannot write like Penman, I say, read it again. To love your country, to give up everything and everyone for the good of it.. Wow, Im off to read Wallace, for he is in this novel as well, and just makes it enough that I am happy that he has his own tale to tell."},{"Title":"Robert the Bruce: The price of the King's Peace","review":"The Bruce Triology is an oustanding work detailing the life and times of Robert the Bruce. Fictionalized or not, it creates for the reader a real place in time and the reader shares the atmosphere of time and place. The terrain, the battles, the people, all come alive in this book. A great book that leaves several of the other books by Tranter lacking. If this book is truly based on historical facts and events, then the movie Braveheart is an interesting tool to compare and contrast for they have little in common."},{"Title":"Robert the Bruce: The price of the King's Peace","review":"Another excellent novel from Nigel Tranter which vividly brings the period of Scottish history &quot;The Wars of Independence&quot; too life. Mr. Tranter masterfully weaves his story &amp; set it out on a template of people &amp; places that you almost feel you can relate too. His characterisation of &quot;The Bruce&quot; is excellent as well, shown almost as a man torn between ambition &amp; a duty to his people. I wish I could give this book more marks than 10, that's how much an impression it made on me. Excellent!!!! :o)))"},{"Title":"Robert the Bruce: The price of the King's Peace","review":"A good historical treatment which is all the more enjoyable thanks to the period language used by the author. Puts William Wallace in perspective."},{"Title":"Robert the Bruce: The price of the King's Peace","review":"I really enjoyed reading this trilogy. Bruce's story is an inspiration. I had already read it in paper format, but enjoyed it again the second time."},{"Title":"Robert the Bruce: The price of the King's Peace","review":"THis was a great buy it is 3 books in one. I read \\"The Wallace\\" by the same author. The first book focuses much of the time during the William Wallace era, but from the Bruce's perspective."},{"Title":"Robert the Bruce: The price of the King's Peace","review":"The book gives and excellent flowing history, is easy to follow and challenges the reader to be able to put the book down. It is well written in that the reader can actually enter into the character feelings and situations."},{"Title":"Robert the Bruce: The price of the King's Peace","review":"If you have seen the movie 'Braveheart' and want to know more, but have time only to read one book, then this is the one for you (OK - it's three books in one!) Read the truly amazing story of Robert the Bruce and his 30-year struggle for Scotland, told with Nigel Tranter's trademark mix of excellent research and good storytelling. (MacBraveHeart, May 1999)"},{"Title":"Robert the Bruce: The price of the King's Peace","review":"Tranter succeeds in bringing to life all the characters from this crucial period of Scottish history. His portrayal of Robert the Bruce presents a hero of the greatest magnitude - a man every great leader of the modern world should be familiar with.Our hero, Robert Bruce, is introduced as a young dandy in British high society - a protege of his future nemesis, Edward the first of England. His struggles to gain freedom from the oppressive English monarchy for the Scottish people make for a marvelous tail of adventure, romance and heroism, well ended with the tale of Sir James Douglas and the Brave Heart.The historical accuracy of this story makes it an important read for any fan of the medieval British history."},{"Title":"Robert the Bruce: The price of the King's Peace","review":"I had much pleasure reading &quot;The Bruce Trilogy&quot; and &quot;The Wallace&quot; both by Nigel Tranter, and both at the same time, as events were concurrent. I have read nearly all of this author's books and these are two of my favorites. Not the most favorite but perhaps 3rd and 4th.The film director of &quot;Braveheart&quot; should have done a little more research as he would have discovered that Robert the Bruce would have, according to the legend, been the true Braveheart. When you read the book, witness what it was that Jamie Douglas cried out as he made his fatal charge against all odds, and find out why........here is the Brave Heart."},{"Title":"Robert the Bruce: The price of the King's Peace","review":"Containing three books originally published under separate titles, this trilogy tells the story of Robert the Bruce, who became King Robert I of Scotland. It begins with THE STEPS TO THE EMPTY THRONE, which portrays an impetuous strong-willed young man who agrees to co-govern the country with his personal enemy in an attempt to win its independence from England. The effort soon fails and Bruce steps down, but then he makes a separate move to unite Scotland under his sole leadership. Amongst much internal fighting, he makes great strides.The second book, THE PATH OF THE HERO KING, reveals a passionate, courageous leader who has learned to win over some of those who would oppose him through a mix of diplomacy and cunning. The winning doesn't come easily, though. Bruce is excommunicated as well as harassed by Edward I's efforts to keep Scotland under England's control. This story culminates in the Battle of Bannockburn, which was an amazing win for the Scots.THE PRICE OF THE KING'S PEACE, the third book, tells of the years of struggle to obtain a peace treaty from England after Bannockburn. During this time, Bruce's brother takes Scotland's fight into Ireland in a blatant ploy for power. Bruce's dealings in this treachery reveal a savvy leader, whose goals ever are to strengthen Scotland's independence. The story ends with his death.All told, the trilogy covers about 1296 to 1328. Tranter is at his best when describing the history while the interaction between characters is sometimes stilted. Nonetheless, lovers of historical fiction will enjoy the action and adventure as well as a story that sticks close to the facts. I enjoyed books 2 and 3 the most."},{"Title":"Robert the Bruce: The price of the King's Peace","review":"I, being of Scottish descent, found this book to be especially informative and compelling. Tranter gives such life to all the characters and such detail regarding the progression of conflict between the Scots and the English that the book is a real treasure. Just as many North American tribes learned they had to unite so the different tribal organizations within Scotland itself had to learn to co-operate with each other to have any chance at defeat King Edward's armies. One understands what is at stake for Scotland...it's people and culture destroyed by the English for England's own gain or win the right through suffering and bloodshed to live as Scots in a country of their own design. I devoured this book."},{"Title":"Robert the Bruce: The price of the King's Peace","review":"I have owned this book for years. I've read it six times. End up with tears in my eyes every time when the King and the Primate look back over their lives together, fighting for the freedom of their beloved country.A HUGE story that will totally engulf you in the lives of the characters. If my house were burning down, I would return to rescue this one!!"},{"Title":"Robert the Bruce: The price of the King's Peace","review":"This is the third book in a trilogy on the life and times of Robert the Bruce, King Robert I of Scotland.

Nigel Tranter is (was) an awesome author, great attention to factual historic details. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Robert the Bruce: The price of the King's Peace","review":"Hi again, friends;THis little review is to let you all know,( not that you really care) what i am reading, now. I have purchased about 20 books the last half-year, and have read approximately 11 of them. From Dostoevsky (2), Dumas(3), Tolstoy (1),Joel C. Rosenberg (2) Margaret George (1), B. Cornwell (1) now N. Tranter's \\"Bruce Trilogy\\"( is that 1 or 3 ??). I am 2/3 of the way through it and it is very exciting. The Battle of Bannockburn at the end of Book 2 was so real, it seemed Mr. Tranter was actually there. The characters are well-drawn and come in and out of the story at just the right times. Robert the Bruce comes across as a truly very human person who was humble and wise. Yes he did terrible things that we could not stand for in our time, but they couldn't be helped. The King Edwards' ( pere & fils ) were vicious to the extreme in regards to there Scottish subjects( ahem ).If there is a flaw in the book it's the archaic Scottish dialect that grates on our modern ears. some of the terminology of the landscapes were hard to figure out, at first, but I think ive got the meaning of them If someone does a new edition of this work in the future, maybe a glossory of terms or footnotes would be helpful to those not familiar with the Scottish dialect.In the future, I may look into Diana Galbaldon's \\"Outlander\\" series and the \\"Outlandish Companion\\" to get some of these straight in my mind.I'm going to try and finish the 3rd book of the Trilogy by the weekend, then I think I'll tackle the \\"Tales of Genji\\" or \\" A Suitable Boy\\" ( or maybe something heavier, heh, heh ).Keep reading, everyone and enjoy your favorite authors and books.I recommend this book, highly!"},{"Title":"Robert the Bruce: The price of the King's Peace","review":"This book is an in-depth, detailed dramatization of the life of Robert the Bruce. No stone is left unturned. You will need to be REALLY interested in the subject, because the book is long. However, it is well-written. Robert strikes you as a real man of flesh and blood; not just a name from history books. His wife, Elizabeth de Burgh, is a feisty match for him and their love story adds spice to the tale."},{"Title":"Robert the Bruce: The price of the King's Peace","review":"After seeing Braveheart in the theatres 4 years ago, and seeing it over and over again on video, the flame that this movie has sparked in me still has not abated. That is one of the reasons why I went searching for a book to read about Sir William Wallace. Am I glad that I did a little research ahead of time and chose to read about Robert the Bruce instead! The man was so admirable, I can't even begin to express my esteem for him!Based on the reviews that I read on this page, I decided to buy Nigel Tranter's account of The Bruce's life versus all the other readily available biographies. I couldn't have made a better decision!My life was put on hold while reading this book! I just could not put it down! I would read a little of it in the morning, go to work, and come home and read it some more in the evening until the wee hours of the morning! That's how consuming this book was!This book was so good, and the man revealed was so nobel, that I almost wished they had portrayed him more accurately in the movie. Just almost...since Braveheart is my most favorite movie of all time. If they had made it any differently, I might not have been so inspired, might never have gone searching, might never have read this book....Well, whether it is sad to say or not, my life is back to normal now, since I have just finished this book this past weekend. But my spirit will never be the same again. Thank you King Robert, for the inspiring life that you lived. Thank you Mr. Tranter, for putting it into words."},{"Title":"Robert the Bruce: The price of the King's Peace","review":"The saga of Robert the Bruce, King of Scots, contaporary of William Wallace, is enthralling in its vivid imagery and detail.

Both trilogies are outstanding, and after having read both Robert the Bruce has left a deeper impression upon me than William Wallace, something I would have never believed. A movie of Robert the Bruce should be made which does him justice. His portrayal in Braveheart (although I like Angus McFadden's character) doesn't do him justice after reading this. The Bruce of this trilogy is a character I will remember a long time. I read on the internet Mel Gibson bought the rights to Steps to the Empty Throne. Make the movie Mel!!"},{"Title":"Robert the Bruce: The price of the King's Peace","review":"I read this a few months ago. I was recovering from a back injury and thankfully I had this book with me. There aren't many books that pull this level of detail and numerous character introductions without overwhelming the reader. It engages you from the beginning and gets better and better as you read. I let out a long breath when I was done,and I actually felt as if I had accomplished the deed of freeing Scotland myself. Spectacular!"},{"Title":"Robert the Bruce: The price of the King's Peace","review":"I wanted to know more about the Scottish war for independence. There are a lot of romance novels featuring handsome Scottish warriors but frankly I wanted to try to understand the actual history behind it without having to wade through dry details. I do not know how true to historical record this collection of 3 novels are but it feels very realist. It is horrifying what the Scottish people had to endure at the hands of the English. It was a very brutal period of history (\\"Braveheart\\"). The problems that Robert Bruce and his people faced were enormous.Bruce was a young man when he got caught up in the struggle. He could only guess what actions to take. The author does an excellent job in fictional form trying to interpret what it must have been like for him. There are cautionary lessons here for current times. This collection is for anyone intrigued by the choices made by rulers and the ruled. As this is three novels in one, it is a huge book. It is not something easily carried around but very worth reading."},{"Title":"Robert the Bruce: The price of the King's Peace","review":"I do not read many books but I was introduced to Robert the Bruce through another book called \\"The Great Scot\\". I searched for another book on the subject and came across this one. For any person who does not read that often, the book is extremely long but the author kept is so interesting that it didn't require any work to read. Everything flowed together neatly and sufficient amount of details were added to give your imagination enough data to create the whole scenario in your head. Very good job by the author!"},{"Title":"Robert the Bruce: The price of the King's Peace","review":"Tranter has written so many excellent books about midieval Scotland - the Bruce Triology is my alltime favourite!!!"},{"Title":"Robert the Bruce: The price of the King's Peace","review":"The Brue Trilogy is without a doubt the finest book to be written for a very long time.It is as exact and detailed as it is well written with flair and passion.Mr Tranter has given this fool great pleasure by bringing such an amazing and near perfect book to print.I refuse to say even the remotest thing about the book...just incase i do spoil it for any of you...But to let you all know...this is where the true Black Douglas comes from...simply breath taking!...and for the record....im English...and it made even me feel bad and good at times...All that remains to be said is....Thank you for sharing your talants Mr Tranter."},{"Title":"More Space: An Inspirational and Practical Guide to Adding More Space to Your Home","review":"Fay Sweet has authored a lot of remarkable modern design books. More Space is no exception. She has found, and photographed, some of the most interesting home additions I've seen to date - all of them unique. I especially enjoyed the basement and attic additions/expansions. This is not a practical how-to guide, it's a book about what's new and innovative in home additions."},{"Title":"More Space: An Inspirational and Practical Guide to Adding More Space to Your Home","review":"I checked this book out of the library, and started flipping through the pages, and the author has some really interesting pictures of innovative ideas that transform small spaces."},{"Title":"More Space: An Inspirational and Practical Guide to Adding More Space to Your Home","review":"We are working on deciding how to add more space to our house. I thought this book was exactly what I wanted. It wasn't. It was not helpful at all. I rarely give poor ratings and I want to be very clear as to why I gave this book such a low rating.There was very little thought put to providing a reader with the overall picture of the house both before and after the space was added and the impact the addition made upon the home. THis is a big issue when speaking of additions. I believe, you have to think of resale value, usability, melding the old with the new and so on. I believe this book did very little in terms of communicating any of this to the reader.1- There were no floor plans or drawings to show the before and after of adding space to a home.2- There were very few before and after photographs to show how adding space impacted a home. The photos that were included, and there were alot of photos, really didn't show how the space melded with the old. The other thing I noticed was that many of the photographs seemed to be taken at night so you could see the add on lit up, and although this was neat, I would want to see it during the day as well.3- Everything was really about light and windows and was very 'out there' in my opinion. For example, there was an addition of a second story/loft over a kitchen and the floor? Glass so you could look right down to the kitchen through your glass floor. Very unrealistic if you think of cleaning and privacy at the very least. A lot of boxy, square add ons that had no meaning to the original house. A gorgeous brick home was topped with copper for example. It might have been award winning, and it might appeal to some, but I thought it was down right ugly.In ending, I thought this book was not very helpful. I thought there were some interesting ideas, but not enough information to see how I might use these ideas with my own home. Also, it leaned heavily towards the 'outerspace, streamlined' type look with lots of glass and chrome. This did not appeal to me and would not appeal to those of us who want the more traditional look. There are other books out there about doing additions that are more useful. I would suggest that this book is for those people who like the artsy/space look with lots of glass and chrome and odd additions with no care to the original home."},{"Title":"Guide to Undergraduate Business Programs in the USA 1999 (Guide to Undergraduate Business Programs in the USA)","review":"The books by this publisher are just plain horrible They are simply advertisments from the business schools. There are few good business schools displayed in the book. It is not the least objective because schools only pay to to published in their.

Seemed interesting. Took it home and read it in two days. Couldn't put it down. Starts out a little slow, but picks up quickly. A great read."},{"Title":"The Longest Night","review":"If you like WWII thrillers with the good guys struggling to overcome long odds to defeat evil personified in the Third Reich, this is the book for you. I do agree with some earlier reviewers that the book takes a while to build up steam, but then it holds your interest, non-stop.The endearing character of Mouse goes through a change of heart because of the responsibilies thrust upon him and the love that he finds along the way.There's lots of action and suspense. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Longest Night","review":"I'm not finished reading this book yet, but I so far I think it's pretty good. The one thing that I absolutley love about this book, is that it has a little bit of everything. It has war descriptions, love, hate, betrayl, and ofcourse the Nazis in Europe. The people in this book are on a mission to let people around the world know that Jews were in mortal danger, and to show that they could be saved; but this is lost along the way in the first half of the book. It slowly goes into it, but that's fine because it makes up for it with the obstacles it provides for the characters. This book has so many different characters in it. It has gangsters, soldiers, engineers, police officers, jews that escaped from concentration camps, and other. I like how in the beginning of the book each person was on their own, but then everybody gradually come together. After reading this book, for awhile I started to think that the Mouse (the main character who is a hit man) is good, and that him killing all those people along the way was ok. The book does that to you because the characters in this book seem so real. I'm very eager to finish this book."},{"Title":"The Longest Night","review":"Gregg Keizer's first novel takes us back to the territory that Ken Follett, Greg Iles, and Jack Higgins used to explore so well in their earlier novels: Nazi-infested Europe. The Longest Night has no spies, just a guy nmaed Mouse, who is a Meyer Lansky employed hit man from Brooklyn, and who just happens to be Jewish. We follow Mouse on a mission to Europe in which he is charged with helping to liberate a train-load of Dutch Jews who are headed for concentration camps.The writing is very good,especially the description of war-time Europe, and the story is well-told. The only thing holding me back from giving this 5 stars is that the pacing is slow to build up momentum, and this kind of book should be more tense.I will read Keizer's next book, and hope he delivers on the promise shown here."},{"Title":"The Longest Night","review":"In 1943 American hit man, Leonard \\"Mouse\\" Weiss knows he is fortunate to still b alive as he botched up his last assignment by allowing a witness to survive. Brooklyn Jewish crime boss Meyer Lansky knows that Mouse has been a loyal employee for years, but must make an example to others that failure is unacceptable, but does not want to have his man killed yet he cannot have him hang around the town.Instead, he decides to give Mouse a second chance when Danish Jews contact the mob boss for help. To make a case for world intervention, they need money and weapons to seize a train carrying Dutch Jews to certain deaths. Mouse will make the drop, but the New York thug, who considered absconding with the loot, finds he wants to help the resistance to the atrocities, but also lands in trouble in which failure means the deaths of not just him and the innocents are involved.This terse historical thriller is similar to Jeffrey Deaver's Garden of the Beasts with its hitman hero but has its own delicious flavoring being seven years later and outside Germany. Mouse, a terrific antihero turning into the people's champion, mostly tells the tale so that the audience can see his emotions running the gamut including horror of the atrocities. He makes the action-packed story line with his stunned horrific look at the state sponsored terrorism that gripped Europe during WW II.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Longest Night","review":"A first time author with an original premise. Mouse is a charactor who impresses. The author has a flair for the dialect of the different peosonalities involved. This is a must read that doesn't let the reader catch his breath."},{"Title":"The Longest Night","review":"The story begins with a unique and interesting premise, but it is squandered with a preposterous ending. The two main characters are well developed and endearing, but most of the supporting cast are caricatures. The story becomes increasingly less plausible as it approaches the climax, including a totally absurd sex scene (pun intended). A ridiculous ending is compounded by the invocation of deus ex machina to save the \\"hero.\\" Greg Iles' Black Cross is a far better rendition of a \\"Saving Jews from the Holocost\\" story."},{"Title":"The Longest Night","review":"This book is extremely disturbing. It is undeniably well written, with intricately plotted detail, interesting characters, and an amazing plot. But the problem is that it operates entirely in the realm of fantasy.The book also seeks to glorify Meyer Lansky, a notorious leader of organized crime in America . See this book for an excellent portrayal of him: Meyer Lansky Mogul of the Mob.The book seeks to turn back time and rewrite history by imagining that a Lansky-financed rescue operation of Jews in Nazi-occupied Holland might have succeeded. In this sense it is an exercise in utter futility.The book also presents some disturbing ideas: that American Jewish Mafiosi are ethically superior to Israeli Jewish Zionists, since the former kill only business opponents while the latter kill innocent Arab women and children. It also suggests that with enough money a person can accomplish anything.The book is infatuated with smoking and the gruesome details of murder. In the entire four week span of the plot not one character ever eats or drinks (but they do defecate; perhaps the author is anally fixated and never moved on to the oral stage?)The book is very cold blooded. All the main characters, while they are acting out their violent rages, are fantasizing or daydreaming about their wives or lovers.This book is part of a recent cultural phenomenon of Jews imagining \\"what if\\" they could have gone back in time and changed the outcome of the Holocaust. Such a genre of both books and now films is not only a waste of time but a dangerous distraction from the very real problems that we face right now, today, for instance the poisoning of our children with toxic vaccines, developed in many cases by Jewish scientists who instead of considering the immorality of their behavior are daydreaming and fantasizing about how they wish they could have gotten back at the Nazis. Even the Nazis themselves were enacting a revenge scenario from Germany 's prior national and economic humiliations.So all people it would seem simply shadow box with their own ghosts from the past and claim innocent victims in their psychotic behavior of denial, projection, and wish fulfillment. And Jews are not the least of these perpetrators."},{"Title":"The Longest Night","review":"The hero of this story Mouse Weiss,a hit man for legendarymafia leader Meyer Lansky,messes up a hit on a rival of Lansky's.Lansky has to get him out of town so he cannot be identified.Lansky is approached by a group of Dutch Jews to help them rescue Jews being shipped to concentration camps and their deaths.They want Lansky to provide muscle and cash to rescue atrain of Jews and call attention to their plight.Lansky volunteerthe services of Mouse Weiss and puts up $100,000 to finacne theirmission.Weiss joins forces with some incredible characters tosteal this train.One of the main characters that he meets is Rekawhom he falls for.Mouse originally intended to steal the $100,000and flee.His plan is thwarted and he has to carry out his mission.He ends up showing character and bravery.This is a very good book that you will enjoy."},{"Title":"Maisy Goes Swimming","review":"As each piece of clothing is gradually removed from Maisy, your child will learn about getting dressed and undressed as well as the name of so many items of clothing building up to a fun-filled conclusion on the last page - Maisy actually swims up and down the pool."},{"Title":"Maisy Goes Swimming","review":"Good old Maisy. Her adventures tend to be as large or small as the daily activites that children themselves partake in. Appearing in cleverly constructed (and mighty strong) books, Maisy is cheery without ever becoming pendatic. She's light-hearted but never tiring. Maisy is, in fact, the perfect companion for any child beginning to read. She is also a great help to those parents that want their kids to see reading as a fun activity.In this particular Maisy venture, the little white mouse wants to go swimming. The weather outside must be frightful because our heroine is covered from tip to tail in warm woolly winter clothing. It is up to the child reader to remove each article as instructed. So off goes the hat! Open goes the coat. Away goes the sweater, the trousers (love those Lucy Cousins British words), t-shirt, socks, and bright orange underwear. Then the child places the swimsuit onto Maisy and off goes the cheery mousey for a dip in the pool.The book's a treat, no question. Parents reading it to their children had better put the book back together correctly before another reading, however. No child would want to read through a book where Maisy's hat was already off or her swimsuit was already on. That would spoil half the fun. The trick of removing or outfitting Maisy in these articles of clothing come in the book's clever construction. Using thick paper that can stand up to little hands, it's a treat to watch Cousins's thick lined drawings moving up or down. The only part of the book that's a bit flimsy is, sadly the last picture. In theory, if you pull on a specific tab, Lucy goes bobbing along in the water. In practice, she's more likely to get stuck, or the tab may just get pulled out altogether. On the whole however, this a cute creation. Any child who's a fan of Cousins, mice, or just the trick or interacting with a book's character physically will have a ball with Maisy's small scale adventure. A bucket o' fun."},{"Title":"Maisy Goes Swimming","review":"As a preschool teacher, I find this book, a great tool to teach and reinforce vocabulary for clothing, as well as colors. The pull tabs also develops fine motor skills for youngsters. Maisy books are the right speed for 2 to 3 year olds. Children also learn about dressing and undressing. This book also rates two thumbs up by my two and a half year old niece."},{"Title":"Maisy Goes Swimming","review":"We are big Maisy fans around our house. But I wish I had listened to the reviewer who said that the tabs and flaps are cumbersome on this book (and we've got dozens with which to compare it). Also, the story line just doesn't work. She's in winter clothes and takes them off to go swimming. I guess if she's going to an indoor Y... Here's a solution for the obvious problem though. So you don't have to go back through the book yourself to put the clothes back on Maisy before your child reads it again, just read the book back to front with your child and put her clothes back on. That actually makes the experience a little more interesting."},{"Title":"Maisy Goes Swimming","review":"Maisy captures a child's attention. Maisy is going swimming. Most preschool children love to play in water. This book teaches children their colors and the names of articles of clothes."},{"Title":"Maisy Goes Swimming","review":"This book has a very simple concept - taking off all of Maisy's many layers of clothing and then putting on her bathing suit so that she can go swimming. My 2 year old son loves it to pieces - literally. Unfortunately it's not very robust, but even now with half the pages in tatters it's still one of his favorites."},{"Title":"Maisy Goes Swimming","review":"A fantastic Maisy book - my daughter (2) loves it. Not only do we get to read about another wonderful Maisy adventure - Maisy getting ready to go swimming but we help Maisy get undressed and into her swimming costume. It had really helped my daughter give her clothes a name and also which bit of the body they go on. This book enables you to help Maisy get dressed and undress by use of flaps and pull tabs - my daughter loves doing that as well. It has helped her understand the concept of on and off, up and down, and colours."},{"Title":"Maisy Goes Swimming","review":"This book is one of my daughter's favorites.

It has let them use their love of art and love of nature in one place. I love the detailed illustrations that let them learn about all the insects they are interested in."},{"Title":"Great Tales of Terror and the Supernatural","review":"I've read all the stories in this book at least 3 times. Most of the times I skip around, but twice I've read straight through -- the stories are so consistently good, and, though wide ranging, complement each other so well. These are NOT horror stories. Horror (to me, at least) implies not only more explicit violence, but also an attitude that reality is, at core, physically and morally chaotic. &quot;Dark Descent&quot; is a horror anthology -- &quot;Great Tales&quot; is for the most part (although &quot;The Great God Pan&quot; and H.P. Lovecraft's 2 stories provide some exception) more old-fashioned &quot;ghost stories,&quot; and what mystery genre critics would categorize as &quot;English cozy&quot;: pleasant characters, warm surroundings introduced all the better to scare you with later on. The evil is seen through a hole in the curtain, so to speak, and never engulfs. The first group of stories (&quot;Tale of Terror&quot;) are not exactly supernatural, but extremely suspenseful, with wonderful denouements. Poe's &quot;The Facts in the Strange Case of M. Valdemar&quot; is wonderfully horrible - a dying man is hypnotised to keep him alive (it turns out to be a mistake, of course). &quot;Suspicion&quot; by Dorothy Sayers is NOT a murder mystery, but a perfectly built-up tale of suspense. I've read it a dozen times and the pace of the story still catches me. &quot;Home for Christmas,&quot; in which a nice doctor kills his bossy wife before leaving on vacation, would make a great Hitchcock movie. &quot;Moonlight Sonata&quot; is the short but shocking story of a man who stays overnight at a friend's house and awakens to an unpleasant visitor (not a ghost, but worse). Despite the emphasis on surprise endings, all of these stories have such great style and atmosphere that they are often, if anything, better the 2nd or 3rd time around. The second group, &quot;Tales of the Supernatural,&quot; have all the qualities mentioned above but are more wide ranging in terms of imaginativeness. My Man M.R. James fits right in here, of course, and 2 of his best tales - &quot;Oh, Whistle and I'll Come to You, My Lad&quot; and &quot;Casting the Runes&quot; - are featured. Also Guy de Maupassant (&quot;Was It a Dream?&quot;, in which a young lover spends the night mourning the death of his mistress in a cemetery, is fabulous). Also Rudyard Kipling; E.F. Benson; Algernon Blackwood (&quot;Ancient Sorceries&quot; features a mild-mannered Englishman oddly drawn to a small French village with a history of witchcraft); and such great titles as &quot;The Screaming Skull&quot; and &quot;The Haunters and the Haunted or The House and the Brain&quot; which, despite the campy names, will leave you far from laughing. There are stories in this section, also, that would better be categorized as fantasy (&quot;The Celestial Omnibus&quot; and &quot;Adam and Eve and Pinch-me&quot;). I liked them a lot even though I don't usually read fantasy. The majority are SCARY, though, and all are well-written by any standard (Henry James gives us &quot;Sir Edmund Orme&quot; and Ernest Hemingway tells of &quot;The Killers&quot;). If you like a more modern style, more explicit sex and violence, less atmosphere and more cut-to-the-chase, this book probably isn't for you. But if you like good, old-fashioned, solid, subtle, clever writing, with lots of atmosphere as well as great plotting (and you like to be scared), then this is a must-have."},{"Title":"Great Tales of Terror and the Supernatural","review":"I am now on my second copy of of the Wise and Fraser anthology. I read my first copy (purchased in the late 1950's)to death. Over many years this book has remained one of the greatest anthologies of scary stories ever put toghter. As the title implies it is broken into two parts; stories that have terrifying situations and supernatural stories. It was first published in 1944 so do not look for stories by Stephen King or Cliver Barker. What you will find are wonderful stories that either already were or have become classics.The terror stories include some adventures such as Connell's, \\"The Most Dangerous Game,\\" and Collins' \\"Terribly Strange Bed.\\" The Supernatural stories include greats such as M. R. James', \\"Casting the Runes\\" and Edward White's, \\"Lukundoo.\\" (If \\"Lukundoo\\" does not make your skin crawl I suggest that you have your skin on too tight) There is also E.F. Benson's, \\"Mrs. Amworth\\" which I believe to be the best short vampire story ever written.Here are 52 stories packed into an anthology tht belongs on the shelf of anyone who likes scary stories and is a basic staple on the shelf of a collector."},{"Title":"Great Tales of Terror and the Supernatural","review":"Over a year ago I had been overcome with the urge for horror fiction, but all the modern writers left me a bit cold. Even Stephen King, though he crafted many great tales, still writes in that modern way that will cheat, and throw in sex and violence when the ability to create atmosphere falters.If you are looking for pure mood, and want to read writers that had complete respect for the language, then buy this book. Even one not normally inclined to horror fiction will find this endlessly entertaining. You will turn back to this book for years. It's sad, but there are few who write like this anymore. In my mind, it's understatement that provokes the sense of dread that many of these tales convey."},{"Title":"Great Tales of Terror and the Supernatural","review":"Now this is what I call an anthology. I have a special affection for this one because it's where, as a child, I first encountered three stories which have remained important to me ever since - Saki's &quot;Sredni Vashtar&quot;, in which a sickly boy makes a god of a ferret and is well rewarded; Guy de Maupassant's &quot;Was it a Dream?&quot;, in which a bereaved lover has a vision of corpses rising from the grave to inscribe the truth about their lives in place of the pious lies upon their gravestones; and what was probably my first Poe story, the out-and-out nightmare &quot;The Black Cat&quot;. Other gems among the fifty-odd here include Robert Hichens' &quot;How Love Came to Professor Guildea&quot;, one of the most disturbing ghost stories ever written; Conrad Aitken's &quot;Silent Snow, Secret Snow&quot;, a haunting study of childhood madness; and Richard Connell's &quot;The Most Dangerous Game&quot; - a breathlessly paced tale of sadistic sportsmanship which was turned, by the makers of King Kong (and on the same sets) into a far superior piece to the more famous, but idiotic, film. Wagner and Wise have managed to include virtually every famous name in the field (at least up to 1944), and they've almost unfailingly chosen from the authors' best stories. Besides the comparatively clumsy &quot;Dunwich Horror&quot;, Lovecraft is also represented with &quot;The Rats in the Walls&quot;, one of his first masterpieces; LeFanu is represented with &quot;Green Tea&quot;; Oliver Onions with &quot;The Beckoning Fair One&quot;; Arthur Machen with &quot;The Great God Pan&quot; and M R James with &quot;Oh Whistle and I'll Come to You, My Lad&quot;, one of the handful of truly great tales by this largely overrated (if academically acceptable) writer. Other contributors include Dorothy L Sayers, H G Wells, E F Benson, Algernon Blackwood, Richard Middleton (the comic &quot;The Ghost Ship&quot;), Charles Dickens, Edith Wharton, Edward Lucas White (the downright horrible &quot;Lukundoo&quot;), Isak Dinesen and Rudyard Kipling. If you know your tales of horror and the supernatural, you'll probably know some of the stories already; but the sheer size and scope of this collection make it a safe bet that you'll find some previously undiscovered treasure here as well. If you're tired of inept Stephen King imitations, this book came out two years before the prototype was born (the oldest author featured is Balzac, born in 1799). And if you don't know the field and don't know where to start, I can't imagine a better place. This hardcover edition is also extremely well made, with Fuseli's &quot;The Nightmare&quot; as wholly appropriate jacket illustration."},{"Title":"Great Tales of Terror and the Supernatural","review":"This book was published in 1944. It contained 52 short stories by 42 writers. There were 22 from Great Britain, 15 from the United States, 2 each from Ireland and France, and 1 from Denmark. Three of the authors were women: Sayers, Wharton, Dinesen.The collection was divided into tales of terror, which took place completely in the material world, and tales of the supernatural. The pieces ranged from the 1840s (Balzac, Hawthorne, Poe) to 1942 (Dinesen), covering virtually each decade. Two-thirds of the stories were from the 20th century.From the early or mid-19th century, there were Bulwer-Lytton, Wilkie Collins, France's Balzac, Ireland's O'Brien and LeFanu, and Hawthorne and Poe from the U.S. From the late 19th century, Hardy, Kipling, Machen and Wells, France's Maupassant, and from the U.S., Bierce and Henry James.Those from the 20th century included Hichens, Jacobs, M. R. James, Blackwood, Saki, Onions, Forster, Benson, Coppard, De La Mare, and Collier. And from the U.S., O. Henry, Crawford, Wharton, Lovecraft, Connell, Hemingway, Faulkner, Woollcott and Aiken.The book collected a number of classic horror stories: \\"The Black Cat,\\" \\"The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,\\" \\"The Haunters and the Haunted,\\" \\"Green Tea,\\" \\"The Boarded Window,\\" \\"The Horla,\\" \\"The Monkey's Paw,\\" \\"Oh, Whistle, and I'll Come to You, My Lad,\\" \\"The Beckoning Fair One,\\" \\"Sredni Vashtar\\" and \\"The Rats in the Walls.\\"Some of the others were interesting especially for an atmosphere of menace (Blackwood's \\"Confession\\"), description of madness (Aiken's \\"Silent Snow, Secret Snow\\") or struggles against man and nature (Connell's \\"The Most Dangerous Game,\\" Carl Stephenson's \\"Leiningen Versus the Ants\\"), their irony (Saki's \\"The Open Window,\\" Collier's \\"Back for Christmas\\"), cynicism (Maupassant's \\"Was It a Dream?\\") or as a particularly good example of an author's concerns (Lovecraft's \\"The Dunwich Horror\\"). Stories by Wells, Benson and Household included a tribal curse, a modern vampire and what could've been a werewolf.The tale by Bulwer-Lytton, from the 1850s, has been called the first modern story about a haunted house; it contained a powerful description of a haunting and, as if that weren't enough, threw in mesmerism, a near-immortal, and an astonishing shift in time. One by Blackwood involved the revival of a man's memories of earlier existence. One by Machen dealt with a spirit called from another world by an overconfident surgeon, and contained a seductress who wrecked men's lives. It was interesting for the way conventions of the time forced it to hint at sexual matters, and for calling up a spirt by means of a surgical operation on a patient's nerve, so different from the way an author like Lovecraft would've done it.The anthology contained great examples of horror focused on the mind (\\"The Black Cat,\\" \\"Pollock and the Porrah Man,\\" \\"The Haunters and the Haunted,\\" \\"Green Tea,\\" \\"The Horla,\\" \\"The Beckoning Fair One,\\" \\"Silent Snow, Secret Snow\\"). For this reader, the collection would've been even more enjoyable if more of the pieces hadn't just described a supernatural or other event but also probed more deeply things psychological.Some of the other tales -- Hawthorne, Charles Collins, Henry James -- were among the more ponderous ones. And stories by Wilkie Collins, Hardy, O. Henry, Sayers, Hemingway, Coppard, Forster, Middleton and Dinesen contained little that seemed frightening; a number of these came from authors who usually wrote outside the categories of terror or the supernatural. Relevant writers who might've added something to the collection: Irving, Twain, R. L. Stevenson, Stoker, Lord Dunsany and Elizabeth Bowen.Other large anthologies of horror fiction include The Supernatural Omnibus (1931), A Century of Creepy Stories (1934), A Second Century of Creepy Stories (1937), Dark Forces (1980), The Arbor House Treasury of Horror and the Supernatural (1981), The Penguin Book of Ghost Stories (1984), The Penguin Book of Horror Stories (1984), Masterpieces of Terror and the Supernatural (1985), The Dark Descent (1987), The Penguin Book of Vampire Stories (1989), The Mammoth Book of Terror (1991), The Omnibus of 20th Century Ghost Stories (1991), Final Shadows (1991), Masterpieces of Terror and the Unknown (1993), The Oxford Book of 20th Century Ghost Stories (1996), The Oxford Book of Victorian Ghost Stories (2003), The Mammoth Book of Haunted House Stories (2005), The Mammoth Book of Modern Ghost Stories (2007), American Supernatural Tales (2007) and The Oxford Book of English Ghost Stories (2008).Smaller volumes -- below 300 pages or so -- include The Ghost Book (1926), Great Ghost Stories (1930), Great Tales of Horror (1933), Best Ghost Stories (1945), The Second Ghost Book (1952), The Third Ghost Book (1955), The Supernatural in the English Short Story (1959), The Pan Book of Horror Stories, Vols. 1-30 (1959-88), The Fontana Book of Great Ghost Stories, Vols. 1-20 (1964-84), The Fontana Book of Great Horror Stories, Vols. 1-17 (1966-84), The Thrill of Horror: 22 Terrifying Tales (1975), Roald Dahl's Book of Ghost Stories (1984), Weird Tales: Seven Decades of Terror (1997) and Haunted Houses: The Greatest Stories (1997)."},{"Title":"Great Tales of Terror and the Supernatural","review":"I first discovered this thrilling, enthralling, hypnotic collection of gems back in the early 50s, during a wintry night with freezing rain. Needless to say, this was a great combination to burn this collection into my memory and I've already gone through six copies. My favorites are &quot;The Great God Pan&quot; and &quot;The Dunwich Horror&quot;, with &quot;Sir Edward Orme&quot; and &quot;Afterward&quot; coming in close. These tales inspired me to write my own collection of weird stories, &quot;The Secret of Jimmy X and Other Stories of the Macabre&quot; that came out in early 2001. &quot;Great Tales&quot; introduced me to Lovecraft, Wharton, Machen and no matter how many times I pick up this thrilling anthology, I'm always instantly hooked. You can have your Stephen King and Anne Rice. Give me a classic tale of horror like &quot;The Rats in the Wall&quot; or &quot;Afterward&quot; any day of the week."},{"Title":"Great Tales of Terror and the Supernatural","review":"Though I agree with the others who have reviewed this book that it does not feature much of the explicit violence that has come to typify late twentieth century horror, I consider this anthology an invaluable addition to the library of anyone interested in the genre's roots. This anthology spans the time period from roughly 1800 to the 1930s--from Poe to Lovecraft, in other words. The chills in these tales tend more toward the atmospheric than toward the gross-out, but chills they are nonetheless. There is not a bad story in the collection, and it provides a fascinating sample of the breadth and diversity of the horror genre. Also, for readers wondering how these stories have aged, I teach several stories from this anthology in a course on horror literature, and I can tell you that they clearly retain their power and effectiveness with an 18-year-old audience. Even better, these stories force them to reconsider modern horror and evaluate authors such as Stephen King within a much deeper tradition."},{"Title":"Great Tales of Terror and the Supernatural","review":"I first bought this book when it was sold for $3.95. Yeah, a long time ago. I especially love the fact that it was divided into tales of terror, and then tales of the supernatural. The tales of terror were fun, but the supernatural tales were fantastic. Lovecraft, MR James, Oliver Onions, Algernon Blackwood...so many more. All of the tales were well worth reading, including the Bulwer-Lytton, but some of them were incredible. If you love good horror and terror, minus the supurflous sex and gore of modern horror, buy this book.

Both are classic horror."},{"Title":"Great Tales of Terror and the Supernatural","review":"Great Tales of Terror and the Supernatural is just that, a collection of some of the GREATEST tales of terror and the supernatural ever written.

This collection is an essential in any well rounded library, even if you are not typically a horror or ghost story fan."},{"Title":"Great Tales of Terror and the Supernatural","review":"This is the bedrock of horror anthologies; the quintessential collection of spine-chilling tales; the keystone in any serious horror buff's collection. Without it, your library is pitifully incomplete. However, I must caution you that this book only contains wonderfully enduring classics, i.e.: tales that have withstood the test of time. If you want the ... stuff---blood, guts and worms ad nauseam---look for the works of more .... .... This one will be around a fifty years from now, when late twentieth century horror ... is dust in the wind."},{"Title":"Great Tales of Terror and the Supernatural","review":"Well, this great book is full of 52 fine otherworldly tales -- that are well written and never too long. So, it amounts to a huge hoard of phantasimal prose Blood Gold -- at very modest cost. The classical hardbacked sewn binding, quality pagination and good standard font allow for easy reading of this sturdy tome. The 52 tales are well-picked to represent the best of elder eldritch authors. In particular, as the editors remark in the Introduction -- these tales have been picked especially with concern for internal coherence -- allowing for easier following by the reader and a crucial suspension of disbelief for full impact. This reader most especially treasures the amazingly fluid, clear and sharp Introduction -- with great balanced metaphysical overview of the background and foreground of phantasimal worlds +++"},{"Title":"Great Tales of Terror and the Supernatural","review":"This is yet another one of the books that was required for my Arts & Humanities class \\"The Horror Story\\"...I must say that I'm quite glad that I was introduced to this novel.This book houses some of the greatest horror stories since the genre came into existence. I have a new appreciation for Edgar Allen Poe. Algernon Blackwood is an AMAZING writer, quite possibly my new favorite. There is even a story written by O. Henry!This book could easily be considered a bible among those who are horror-genre fans. I can't say much else about this book other than IN MY OPINION it is worth the money you will spend on it and the time you will spend reading it."},{"Title":"Great Tales of Terror and the Supernatural","review":"The book was in perfect condition. Arrived in a timely fashion. A great collection of spine-tingling tales from some of the best authors."},{"Title":"Great Tales of Terror and the Supernatural","review":"With this compelation you get 52 short stories with 20 of them in the section of terror and 32 in the supernatural section and they are in chronilogial order of the authors births whith many of them being from the 19th century and a few from the 19th and 20th centuries.I enjoyed most of the stories in the terror section with most of them being good, a few okay ones and a bad 1 or 2 otherwise the stories in the terror section were very well picked. Too bad I can't say the same for the supernatural section because I thought that most of them weren't that good. A few of them are very good and left me with a sense of awe like \\"The Great God Pan\\", \\"The Dunwich Horror\\" or \\"Confession\\". A few of the stories were okay and quite a few I thought were bad like \\"Ancient Sorceries\\" or \\"Out of the Deep\\" to name a few and the reasons why I didn't like some of the stories is because some of them were boring and some I thought had bad endings while the story leading up to the end would be good it would just let me down in the end like in \\"Ancient Sorceries\\".If you like 18th century type ghost stories or writings or you think that you might be interested in them then I would recommend this book because there are some very good stories many good and a few bad but overall this is a good book to read."},{"Title":"Great Tales of Terror and the Supernatural","review":"They quickly notified me when they were shipping it and it showed up fast. The book arrived in excellent shape. I am very pleased with the level of service provided."},{"Title":"Great Tales of Terror and the Supernatural","review":"I have been a devotee of supernatural and horror stories since I first began to read. This was the very first one I ever read, and it's still -- after too many to count -- the best. The editors made the best possible selections from such masters as H.P. Lovecraft, M.R. James, E.F. Benson and numerous others. The biographical introductions to the stories are excellent. The editors even give the sound advice to not read too many of the stories at one sitting, so as not to lose the wonderful creepy effect and impact of one or two at the most. A bargain at twice the price."},{"Title":"Great Tales of Terror and the Supernatural","review":"Despite the best-seller list popularity of horror novels, the horror genre is often best served by brevity. Remember all the ghost stories told around campfires -- the swift build from unease to terror, the surprise ending whispered or shouted in the dark. The short story format may be the ideal medium for serving up such visceral pleasures. Think of this massive anthology as a box of poisoned chocolates -- taken one at a time, the stories are most effective, delightful and only a little unsettling.This book is almost a necessity for serious students of the horror genre, for anyone who wants to know where writers like King and Koontz got their inspiration . . . or for anyone who just likes a good scare. Wise and company's anthology is a classic for many reasons: its historic scope, its inclusion of various types of horror (from &quot;The Monkey's Paw,&quot; a brutal little cautionary tale that would be right at home by a campfire to the subtler depiction of obsession and madness in the little-known &quot;The Beckoning Fair One&quot;). There is something for every taste here, from old-fashioned ghost stories to more cerebral suspense. The anthology seems designed to show the range and richness of horror fiction. Of course, concentrating on mass and variety has its drawbacks -- if you are interested in tracing how different strains of the genre developed, you're on your own, because the editors offer no guidance. And despite its size (this is a hefty book; you wouldn't want to carry this with you in your briefcase or backpack) &quot;Great Tales of Terror and the Supernatural&quot; is not a comprehensive overview. Types of horror fiction with which modern audiences are more familiar are under-represented. There is little violence, despite the presence of so much death; the collection may even seem a bit genteel. Also, women writers are given short shrift although many women worked the fields of the supernatural from the eighteenth century on. Still, the editors have worked hard to distill the brightest and best (or should that be the darkest and best?) of this surprisingly venerable genre. Buy it. You'll want to read and reread these stories -- maybe even beside a convenient campfire."},{"Title":"Great Tales of Terror and the Supernatural","review":"I literally have dozens of horror anthologies, however, this is one, if not the best collection of classic horror/terror stories I have ever read.It does contain many stories which have been included in other books of its kind, yet there are also quite a few which are rarely to be found in the more typical collection.This book is a definite MUST for the library of every fan of the classic \\"scary\\" short story."},{"Title":"Great Tales of Terror and the Supernatural","review":"I can't really say with any of the other stories, since I'm not as familiar with them. Maybe they've been abridged, too. Maybe not. But \\"The Most Dangerous Game\\" has been drastically cut. And it suffers for it. Nearly all of General Zaroff's exposition and back-story have been removed. This omission takes one of literature's most memorable villains, and turns him into a two dimensional stock character. Worse yet, the dinner scene no longer plays like a verbal sparring match, with Zaroff gradually revealing his plans. There's no suspense in it anymore. Now, it plays more like \\"Please pass the roasted potatoes, Mr. Rainsford. By the way, I hunt people.\\"The three star rating reflects my disappointment at the editing of this particular story. \\"The Most Dangerous Game\\" is one of my favorite stories of all time. I'm deducting two stars for getting a gutted version of it."},{"Title":"Great Tales of Terror and the Supernatural","review":"as others here have elaborated on, and detailed some of the mastery compiled within this amazing collection, i'll be brief with my comments...if you're seriously looking for \\"the perfect horror anthology...\\" put simply: you've found it. this deliciously thick volume has been one of the cornerstones of my macabre short story collection for quite some time.... and, honestly... i'm quite certain it always will be. it has earned it's place amongst the very best within my bookshelves.for any / all fans of horror this tome is simply a must-have.

This collection features some of the best that the genre has to offer."},{"Title":"Great Tales of Terror and the Supernatural","review":"This book is, quite simply, the best collection of 19th and early-20th century short fiction of the dark variety in existence. First published in the 1940s, this single (albeit fat) volume is a goldmine of the roots of modern horror, a great way to see where today's horror heavyweights got their inspiration and influence.Some authors whose stories appear within: Bierce, Blackwood, Dickens, Faulkner, Hawthorne, Hemingway, James (both Henry & M.R.), Kipling, Lovecraft, Machen, Poe, Wells, and many more, a good mixture of horror genre regulars and more conventional or 'literary' authors to whom dark fiction was a departure from the norm. If many of those above names are unfamiliar to you and you consider yourself a fan of dark fiction, you owe it to yourself to read this book.[Sidenote: The book also contains two of my all-time favorite short stories from two slightly lesser-known authors: Richard Connell's \\"The Most Dangerous Game,\\" and W.W. Jacob's \\"The Monkey's Paw.\\" As far as I know, this is the only single volume that includes both. The latter story is, in my humble opinion, THE most perfect scary story of all time.]Once again: Wagner & Wise's collection is the best thing of its kind."},{"Title":"Great Tales of Terror and the Supernatural","review":"Review: Murderous spouses, ancient curses, talking corpses, seductive ghosts--over a thousand pages long, presenting 52 stories from 33 authors, this collection is massive and dated, halfway a historical fragment and halfway a resource, fascinating but deep enough to drown in. It's so vast that it's almost impossible to review: no single opinion can reflect so many stories. There are a few classics here, just as many minor offerings from famous authors, and plenty of forgettable selections. Half the joy is simply seeing what's included, because not all of these authors or stories would be considered genre now--and as such, this collection is a fascinating snapshot of the creation of canon and genre. The exclusions are also telling: there's only one vampire story because \\"these stories all tend to be very much alike\\" (760), and only three female authors (which seems to be a fault of the general climate more than the book's enthusiastic editors).As pleasure reading is concerned, the introduction recommends slow going and I concur. Volumes like this are longterm bedside companions; try to hurry through them, and the stories become so many bricks in a wall. Classic horror has a different pace from modern horror, often finding an uneasy balance between atmospheric subtlety and heavy-handed themes such that it both bores and batters. But then along will come a story like Hawthorne's \\"Rappaccini's Daughter\\" with its haunting, insidious beauty, or Lovecraft's superbly crafted imaginings of the unknown, or even Blackwood's tales, deeply flawed but rewarding patience with fantastic atmosphere. There are also authors and stories which helped create the genre but are now forgotten, and pleasant surprises such as Benson's skin-crawling \\"Caterpillars.\\" There's more emphasis on action than modern readers may expect, and a sprinkling of gallows humor. There are too many duds to recommend it to a casual reader, and the selections are too arbitrary to make it the only classic horror anthology you own, but Great Tales is often fascinating and occasionally great fun. It's an enjoyable, if random, overview for fans of the genre, and I loved it. To my surprise, the anthology is still in print--so if you stumble upon it, I well recommend you pick it up and read a few tales."},{"Title":"Great Tales of Terror and the Supernatural","review":"I read this (more than once) as a teenager in the 60s. It introduced me to some of the really classic horror and suspense story writers, like M.R. James, Le Fanu, Machen, Lovecraft, etc. Most of these are quite effective in creating terrifying moods. The Bulwer-Lytton story, in particular, scared the crap out of me, and still does. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Great Tales of Terror and the Supernatural","review":"This was the best introduction of horror short stories for me. I am aware of so many top-notch writers due to this compilation. Modern short stories have become a let-down to me after reading this book. You have to go backwards to find solid reading material. There is really no need to get into specifics because the proof is on the pages - many of these stories have left me amazed, and if you do not already possess the stories in this anthology, I strongly recommend this book. It is the main source of my awareness of the classic horror short story genre. I read this book and tried to find more like it, and many anthologies do not live up to this selection as far my tastes are concerned. I only wish that Herbert Wise would edit more anthologies. I love short stories, and though I am not a die-hard short story fanatic, I believe that these writers are so superior that anybody would become an instant fan reading them."},{"Title":"Great Tales of Terror and the Supernatural","review":"Nearly fifty years ago, in the mid-sized Midwestern town where I spent many of my formative years, with some windfall paper route money, I purchased the Modern Library edition of \\"Great Tales of Terror and the Supernatural\\" (published by Random House, edited by Herbert A Wise and Phyllis Fraser). That particular edition was eventually worn out from extensive reading and re-reading and had long since disappeared from my possession; but several months ago, at a Montgomery County Public Library sale in Troy, North Carolina, thanks the alertness of my sharp-eyed wife, I purchased, for a mere pittance, the *original* edition of this book, published in 1944; it was like encountering a long-lost friend! The dedication page consists of an Old Scotch Invocation: \\"FROM GHOULIES AND GHOSTIES AND LONG-LEGGED BEASTIES AND THINGS THAT GO BUMP IN THE NIGHT, GOOD LORD DELIVER US!\\". Of interest also is that on the publication page the following appears: \\"THIS IS A WARTIME BOOK - The Text is complete and unabridged, but every effort has been made to comply with the Government's request to conserve essential materials.\\" It was in my Modern Library edition that, as a teen-ager, I first read classic supernatural stories by Algernon Blackwood (the well-known \\"Ancient Sorceries\\" and the lesser-known \\"Confession\\" [but not \\"The Willows\\" or \\"The Wendigo\\"]), F(rancis) Marion Crawford (\\"The Screaming Skull\\" [but not \\"The Upper Berth\\"]), M(ontague) R(hodes) James (\\"Casting the Runes\\" [my favorite of all of his 30 stories] and \\"Oh Whistle and I'll Come to You My Lad\\"; both stories, incidentally, illustrate James's adroit and effective handling of understatement), H(oward) P(hilips) Lovecraft (\\"The Rats in the Walls\\" and \\"The Dunwich Horror\\"), Arthur Machen (\\"The Great God Pan\\" [but not \\"The Inmost Light\\"]), Oliver Onions (\\"The Beckoning Fair One\\"), Edgar Allan Poe (the well-known story \\"The Black Cat\\" and the lesser-known but even more disturbing \\"The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar\\"), and Edgar Lukas White (the eerie \\"Lunkundoo\\"). Also among the 52 stories in this collection are some powerfully-effective adventure stories: Richard Connell's \\"The Most Dangerous Game\\", Geoffrey Household's \\"Taboo\\", Carl Stephenson's \\"Leiningen versus the Ants\\", and H.G. Wells's \\"Pollock and the Porroh Man\\". (Undoubtedly because of the publication date, there is nothing here by Robert Aickman [e.g., \\"The Inner Room\\"], Clive Barker [e.g., \\"In the Hills, The Cities\\"], Stephen King [e.g., \\"Dolan's Cadillac\\" {terror} or \\"The Mist\\" {supernatural/preternatural], or Joyce Carol Oates [e.g., \\"Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?\\"]). The editors provide an Introduction, an Introduction to the Notes, and interesting and comprehensive biographical sketches of each of the authors. Over the past few months, I have enjoyed becoming re-acquainted with these stories. Although there now exist more modern collections of these types of stories (e.g. David Hartwell's \\"The Dark Descent\\", \\"The Oxford Book of English Ghost Stories\\", and \\"Roald Dahl's Book of Ghost Stories\\"), this out-of-print book is well worth acquiring, if you should be fortunate enough to happen upon it in an estate collection auction, at a library sale, in a thrift store, or at a used-book seller's."},{"Title":"Great Tales of Terror and the Supernatural","review":"If I would have to choose five books to take with me to Mars, this would be one."},{"Title":"Great Tales of Terror and the Supernatural","review":"This book is a compilation of some wonderful classic horror tales.

Henry wrote delightful short stories, always with surprising and often humorous endings. He is a great American literary treasure."},{"Title":"The Best Short Stories of O. Henry","review":"...This anthology contains 21 tales set in New York City at the dawn of the 20th century, but also offers readers a bonus of 4 tales set in the exotic tropics of a fictitious banana republic. O Henry focuses his curious literary microscope on the diverse lives of various residents of this internationally-famous metropolis. Some of his protagonists can claim idle-rich status, but more represent the middle class and many the poverty-stricken milieu. Indulgent readers will discover the flavor of a past century, rub shoulders with men on the other side of the law, and commiserate with thwarted lovers--while privately anticipating the trademark ending with a Twist.But the author's style reminds me of P. G. Wodehouse's moonstruck romantic pairs; the tales predate TV's innocuous \\"Love, American Style\\" episodes, in which we do not take their amorous escapades seriously. Then, to throw us off guard, he spikes the anthology with a few pathic and even tragic stories. One suspects that he was gently trying to raise the social consciousness of the literate public. Various ethnic groups, with their inherent city-acquired bigotry, become the target of his nible wit, especially the Irish and Italians. After all, his beloved olde New York was a true melting pot from the kitchen of Ellis Island.Narrated in both first and third, person, these stories incorporate flagrant slang and, for humor, one actually boasts a canine narrator! They challenge contemporary readers with their antiquated vocabulary--intermigled with literary, Biblical andartsy references. O. Henry will repeatedly send one to a dictionary or encyclopedia with his liberal sprinkling of foreign words. Like the British before him, O. Henry contemplates the danger of the temptations of a tropical paradise. Will Yankees actually \\"go Native\\" like so many English did before them? Of course, the real cocoanut conundrum is to choose your five favorite stories from this delightful smorgasbord!"},{"Title":"The Best Short Stories of O.

If I rate something lower than a three, it means I could've spent a few coins more wisely."},{"Title":"The Best Short Stories of O. Henry","review":"A collection of 100 or more short stories by O. Henry? My mouth waters already! It's hard to imagine any literary treat that can be enjoyed in small doses more pleasurable than this. I have spent over a year savouring these stories, reading them one by one, tasting his delightful choice of words, digesting his fascinating story-lines, and the warm satisfying afterglow that comes after a typical twist at the end. O. Henry began writing short stories as a prison inmate, and he quickly fine tuned his skills behind the bars and developed into an excellent storyteller. Born William Sydney Porter (1862-1910), he produced 270 stories under the pseudonym O. Henry. His stories are superbly outstanding in at least four ways, each illustrated with five of my personal favorites.Firstly, his brilliant use of language. These stories were written in the first half of the twentieth century, and O. Henry's use of language easily surpasses that of most contemporary writers. Not only does he have an extensive vocabulary, but his writing abounds with similes and metaphors that breathe sparkling life and depth into his stories, marred only by the occasional \\"Lordy\\". \\"Ulysses and the Dogman\\" is a fine example of his skills with a language, metaphorically portraying dog owners as victims of Circe, in a hopeless enchantment to their leashed pets. Also exemplary is \\"Madame Bo-Peep of the Ranches\\" where a ranch manager has a heart fenced by barbwire just like the ranch on which he lives, and yet the twist at the ending suggests that perhaps we were completely mistaken. \\"A Comedy in Rubber\\" uses wonderfully elevated language to farcically portray a class of people today known as ambulance chasers. And \\"Sisters of the Golden Circle\\" revolves around the profound bond that exists between two married women who are strangers but yet sisters \\"of the plain gold band.\\" \\"An Unfinished Story\\" employs profound metaphors of angelic hosts to tell the tragic story of poor Dulcie's struggle for survival.Secondly, his unique insight into the social conditions of his time. O. Henry has a great understanding of the trials of the lower class, and he frequently pictures the lives of ordinary people of early twentieth century America with warm and sympathetic colours. His characters are frequently the overlooked: the struggling shop girl, the unsuccessful artist, the impoverished. Admittedly, some of his images can be hard to comprehend for modern readers, and the distance that time has placed between us and O. Henry's beloved New York means that some of his verbal pictures will be harder to understand and identify with. But his genuine sympathy for the oppressed cannot be missed. \\"The Gift of the Magi\\" is the signature O. Henry story, probably his most famous tale which recounts a poor young couple who both give up a prized possession in order to purchase a gift for one another - but ironically a gift intended to complement the other's prized possession that they have just given up. Another story which display his ability to picture the social conditions of his time - but always with the trademark twist - is \\"The Pendulum\\", a wonderful portrait of the daily routines of an poor couple and the bursting anxiety of a married man, until the bubble bursts. \\"The Cop and the Anthem\\" was the first O. Henry story I ever read, and humorously recounts the unsuccessful attempts of a man to get into jail for the winter - it remains vivid in my mind as a memorable favorite. \\"The Furnished Room\\" is a tragic and shocking story of suicide, depicting the depths of despair and desperation of the impoverished.Thirdly, his warm humour. O. Henry has an uncanny ability to portray the mundane and the ordinary in the most elevated language. Frequently he pits two characters together in a remarkable way so that one outshines and complements the other. And on other occasions he crafts the most ingenious and humorous schemes for outwitting others. One of his most popular stories is \\"The Handbook of Hymen\\", recounting the tale of two men in a winter cabin, one armed with the hilarious Herkimer's handbook of Indispensable Information. And then there is O. Henry's fictional character Jeff Peters, a man who comes with the most ingenious money-making schemes, two shining examples displayed in \\"Jeff Peters as a Personal Magnet\\" and \\"The Exact Science of Matrimony\\". \\"Let Me Feel Your Pulse\\" pokes fun at doctors, while in \\"Next to Reading Matter\\" an overly eloquent character wins the heart of a senora with streams of articulate talk about the mundane.Fourthly, his ironic twist. One of the distinctive characteristics of O. Henry's short stories is the ironic twist at the end, which never fails to surprise and entertain, sometimes reversing the entire story line in a concluding one-liner. O. Henry's suspense and trademark ironic twist ensures that readers who have a good literary taste in short stories will not be disappointed. Like the Jeff Peters stories, \\"The Love-philtre of Ikey Schoenstein\\" also feature a brilliant scheme - but a scheme of romance - and the way it backfires is unforgettable. Other delightful examples of ordinary stories with a glorious ironic twist include \\"Witches' Loaves\\" and \\"While the Auto Waits\\". The twist that comes at the end of \\"The Hypotheses of Failure\\" is so perplexing, that you'll have to re-read the entire story after reading the ending - but completely delighted at the way in which O. Henry has misled you. But perhaps one of O. Henry's best uses of the ironic twist comes in \\"The Last Leaf\\", a warm and tragic tale describing how a dying artist proves as resilient as the last leaf on the wall outside, and through the self-less sacrifice of another.The Wordsworth collection is superlative, because it contains more than 700 pages of literary gems. It consists of 100 stories, showcasing a wide range of O. Henry's short-story talents. A few popular favorites are missing, such as \\"Schools and Schools\\", \\"Shearing the Wolf\\", \\"The Green Door\\", and \\"The Pimienta Pancakes.\\" But the reality is that nearly all O. Henry's stories feature his trademark ironic twist, as they do his warm humour, his unique insight into the social conditions of the time, and his brilliant use of language, and that every story in this collection is a literary delight worthy of inclusion. The inaccessibility of some references for modern readers does not prevent these stories from being always entertaining and enduring!

I was reading O'Henry's masterpiece !!!If you want to loose your family and friends ; If you want to burn you house all the way to the ground ; if you need exscuse to brake up with you girlfriend - a must read for you !"},{"Title":"The Best Short Stories of O. Henry","review":"O. Henry's short stories are tiny masterpieces. Each story takes literally only minutes to read (they're an average 6 - 12 pages long), but they are brilliant in plot and character development, each with an unexpected twist of some sort at the end, and each different from the other.The stories are set in New York City at the dawn of the 20th century, so there is much that is slighly unfamiliar, especially some of the language (who knows what a &quot;masher&quot; is, anyway?). This aside, I found myself laughing out loud more than once, and frequently shaking my head at the entertaining and masterful way in which each story unfolded. A recommended read."},{"Title":"The Best Short Stories of O. Henry","review":"This is a very good collection of my favorite short story author.It's hard to imagine anyone who hasn't read and loved O. Henry, but if for some reason you have discovered this work yet, this collection is a great place to begin."},{"Title":"The Best Short Stories of O. Henry","review":"My father recently sent me some of his books after my parents moved to a smaller home in Oregon. Included in the mostly newer books were a few old ones from his college days. Among them was the original 1945 version of \\"Best Stories of O. Henry\\". Anyone familiar with American Literature knows of William Sydney Porter, better known as O. Henry. He is famous for his short stories that lead you down a path which swerves, at the end, in a direction you hadn't anticipated. Along the way are many colorful characters out of American life around the Turn of the Century (That's the Turn of the Century BEFORE this latest one). Not only are his characters a worthwhile part of every story, his settings often give another interesting view of life 100 years ago. All this evolves in stories that often are no more than 4-5 pages in length. These snapshots almost always conclude with an ironic and/or surprise ending. His best known story, which is the opening selection in this collection, is \\"The Gift of the Magi\\". The other story of his that I always recalled, \\"The Ransom of Red Chief\\", is also in this book. It's one of the handful of longer stories and runs a whole 12 pages. Among my favorites \\"discoveries\\" in this collection are \\"The Cop and the Anthem\\", \\"A Blackjack Bargainer\\", \\"Squaring the Circle\\", \\"The Pendulum\\", \\"The Last Leaf\\", and \\"The Count and the Wedding Guest\\". There are 30 other stories in addition to the ones I've cited. Some went a bit long which sounds strange to say about a short story. However, one gets used to the rhythim of O. Henry and certain stories take you out of that rhythim. Some stories may not conclude in as surprising a manner as others but they are still worth a look at life and customs a century ago.According to the Editorial Review shown above, O. Henry wrote over 600 stories in his life. I'm not interested in reading that much of his work. However, I'm glad I read these 38."},{"Title":"The Best Short Stories of O. Henry","review":"I couldn't find the edition that I read, so will review here. I read O'Henry's \\"heart of the West\\", his group of stories about Texas. O. Henry (or William Porter) actually lived in Texas just before the turn of the century, and these stories therefore reflect what life was actually like for the rough and ready cowboys and their women. His characters are real, and his stories are true little gems. O. Henry's love for this place (Texas) at this time comes through over and over. O. Henry wrote for the common people, and because of that they loved him. They could see themselves in each one of these stories. These stories are all wonderful, but my personal favourite was \\"The Handbook of Hymen\\". It is so wryly funny, that I laugh about it still when I think of Sanderson Pratt and his little book of facts and how that book helped him successfully court a rich widow lady. Idaho Green's little book of poetry written by \\"Homer K.M.\\" did not stand him in good stead with the good widow lady. Hilarious!"},{"Title":"The Best Short Stories of O. Henry","review":"I love this book! It even got my 12 year old son's attention. It's great if you don't feel like you have enough time to read a whole novel.

I gave it to my husband as a gift, and he mentions it to so many of his friends and family. Good and intoxicating reading!!"},{"Title":"The Best Short Stories of O. Henry","review":"O. Henry's wonderful short stories are characterized by four prominent elements.He clearly understands the nuances of the times about which he writes. He has an amazing gift for capturing the personalities of people from many, many stations in Life. He is an incredibly superb story-crafter. His skill at introducing and managing Humor is among the very best in the entire histroy of American Literature.One can always debate the story selections in any \\"Best of...\\" book but this one is a delight."},{"Title":"The Best Short Stories of O. Henry","review":"I would recommend this book to anyone that has a good imagination and a good sense of humor. These short stories are entertaining and very funny. One short story \\"The Ransom of Red Chief\\" is a real classic. There is a companion short created for television starring Struther Martin and Jack Elam. It is fun to have your children, grandchildren, or nephews read this short story then watch this classic short together."},{"Title":"Modern cookery for private families","review":"This 1845 cookbook has been perhaps the most influential cookbook in the last 150 years. It is now obvious to me why great British writers such as Delia Smith rave about this seminal cookbook.It's actual title is \\"Modern Cookery, in All its Branches: Reduced to a System of Easy Practice, for the Use of Private Familiies\\".Reading Acton's beautifully written recipes, and later learning how much she was plagiarized by Elizabeth Beeton (1861) and others (barely changing the amount of an ingredient or two) it's clear to see how her cookbook's codification of many French and typically British recipes has been the tremendous ground on which nearly all great British and American cookbooks have directly or indirectly arisen. Yes, pretty strong words!I have often, when reading other writer's referencing one of Acton's recipes, wondered what Acton's entire book was like. Now that I have an 1845 copy of the 683 page masterpiece, I realize that nearly none of those quoting recipes had ever read one from her book, and just copied what others said were her recipes!! Yes, the delightfully clear and instructive recipes, beautifully in her own words, put to shame the hollow words others incorrectly ascribed to her. Whether it's her Mullagatawny soup (she's often given credit for first writing a recipe of it or another recipe, you will enjoy reading her own poetic descriptions and instructions. This is not a Rachael Ray type 30 miute quickie, but a book to be savored by cooks and non cooks alike, to give a view of bith proper cookery and of a time long past."},{"Title":"Modern cookery for private families","review":"If you enjoy reading cookery books then you will love this one. Forget glossy photographs of the finished dish which serve only to depress the average cook. Forget celebrity endorsements of particular branded ingredients. This book - first published in 1845 - is nothing but recipes, useful diagrams and line drawings.There is an invaluable conversion chart at the beginning of the book for conversion from metric to imperial measurements which also shows a modern interpretation of cool, hot, very hot etc oven temperatures. There is a comprehensive index and a glossary of terms used in the book. Eliza Acton would have been cooking on a range which did not have exact temperature regulation. Cookery is not always an exact science as demonstrated in this book.The quantities used in the recipes may be too large for modern families but it is easy to halve or even quarter the quantities to make recipes manageable for today's cooks. The recipes are divided into twenty seven sections - starting with soups and moving through sauces, boiling and roasting, boiled puddings, baked puddings, pickles, confectionary etc.To modern readers cooking times given may seem excessive though perhaps some of it can be looked at as akin to slow cooker recipes. In fact I think many of the recipes could work very well in today's slow cookers.Eliza Acton provides her own observations at the end of many of the recipes as well as providing variations on many of them. There are footnotes providing further information and offering opinions. On page 310 for example she comments on the appalling waste of food amongst the better off and how this could be better used in feeding the poor. She calls it \`one of the most serious domestic abuses amongst us'. Clearly waste of perfectly edible food is not a new concern!This is a book to browse through and to wonder at how English cookery has changed over the years. Butter and cream are used in many recipes and lard for frying. However in spite of frying in lard the author always advocates draining food after frying until it is quite dry.There are clear indications that the author and presumably her readers were interested in the effect of food on health such as this from the section on cakes \`. . . more illness is caused by habitual indulgence in the richer and heavier kinds of cakes than would easily be credited by persons who have given no attention to the subject.' She says she has included a small number of cake recipes because her readers like them. She herself does not consider meringues unwholesome because they are so light.I was surprised at how many herbs and spices are used in the recipes and how the author emphasises the importance of fresh ingredients as well as using up left-overs. She includes pasta and polenta recipes as well as curries and recipes from many European countries.This is a marvellous book to browse through and to try out the recipes and it is a useful historical document especially for readers of Anthony Trollope and Charles Dickens for example as they will find the dishes mentioned in those authors' novels listed in this book. I can see I will be browsing through this book for many years to come."},{"Title":"Modern cookery for private families","review":"It's hard to add much to the previous reviews, but this is a terrific book for anyone interested in the history of British cookery (which, of course, influenced the food of most of the other English speaking countries). As the first \\"modern\\" cookbook, with specific amounts and ingredients and instructions on the techniques of preparing the dishes, it's still possible for contemporary cooks to prepare Acton's recipes with accommodations for today's kitchens and ingredients. There are many fascinating revelations in this book (and also in the original Mrs. Beeton's). Perhaps the most surprising is the frequent use of cayenne pepper. That puts an entirely different perspective on English food, which has been accused of being bland and boring. (Interestingly, contemporary updated editions of Mrs. Beeton omit the cayenne -- it seems that more recent Britons lost their taste for spicy foods.) Since cayenne pepper is not an indigenous ingredient, it's probable that it came to Britain as an influence from India and the West Indian colonies. In any event, it seems that people in the 19th Century were more adventurous in their eating habits than we've given them credit for! I definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in mid-Victorian cooking as it was transitioning from cooking over open fires to more modern ranges. It's true that Mrs. Beeton plagiarized a lot of Acton's work, but Beeton's book was written in 1865 and she updated the recipes for more modern cooking techniques, so both books are actually very helpful in seeing how cooking was evolving during the 19th Century."},{"Title":"Modern cookery for private families","review":"Having gained much from its sister volume, the 1938Madame Prunier's Fish Cookery Book, I was disappointed by this book. Dating from 1845, it goes too far back in time to be of much practical use, even in the fundamental ideas and 'what could go with what' department. Whilst we are happy to use liquidizers and blenders instead of mortar and pestle, sieves and strainers, and refrigeration sets us free of many of the constraints under which both Acton and Prunier laboured, unlike Prunier, much of Acton is rendered completely redundant through it no longer being necessary or even desirable to salt, pickle and preserve as our ancestors did, and then to devise ways of using the resulting products with their heavy concentrations of salt, vinegar and sugar. And Acton was doing much of her cooking on an open fire, spit-roasting meat, suspending pots and balancing pans on trivets. Solid fuel ovens and ranges were just coming in; cooking with gas or electricity were both dreams for the future. On the infrequent occasions when Acton bakes something, she usually \\"sends\\" it to an oven, a service provided by bakers after the day's bread was done. But that involved time, a journey, allowing your servants to rub shoulders with those of others, and giving someone else control over the cooking of your dish; altogether not desirable in Acton's view.She would be easy to parody: ingredients are almost invariably \\"thrown\\" into the pot; a staggering number of things (including fish) are cooked in gravy made by boiling a large joint of beef or veal for many hours; and she dresses her own dislikes - which include onions and any vegetable not boiled to death - as concern for those of delicate constitution. She boils carrots for one-and-a-half to two hours! Yet she is remarkably keen on cayenne and mace (nutmeg, she writes, can be too overpowering and allspice is definitely NOT recommended). I always imagined it was white pepper that the cook Alice encountered in Wonderland used so liberally, but perhaps it was cayenne and it was Acton of whom Lewis Carroll was making fun. (Alice was published in 1865; the cook in Alice was also much given to throwing things.)With her 32 chapters, Acton works methodically through a multi-course main meal, assigning separate chapters to soup, fish, the different meats, sauces, and so on. Half way through the book, with sweets and desserts, we begin to encounter the odd recipe that could be adapted to modern use. For me, the first was a puff pastry tartlet filled with a vegetarian mincemeat extended with apple. She tells us it is a German recipe, and it is by no means the only recipe that she has acquired from abroad. Given her strong prejudices in many areas, that and her extensive use of rice and pasta come as a surprise. The book even concludes with a chapter of 'Foreign and Jewish Cookery'.Her advocacy of the nutritional value of potatoes on the basis of their being almost the entire diet of \\"thousands of people....capable of accomplishing the heaviest daily labour\\" has to be seen to be believed. And that at the time of the Irish potato famine - and construction of most of Britain's railways by Irish laborers.As with the text, some of the line drawings of long-obsolete pieces of equipment are of period interest - and a possible source of comedy. The book is certainly not without value, and it is good that a few thousand more copies will be circulating in a sturdy and attractive binding. However, it has to be recognised that it offers little of relevance to producing a meal in the contemporary kitchen."},{"Title":"Affirmations of Wealth: 101 Secrets of Daily Success","review":"After two years of roller-coaster depression, panic attacks and migraine headaches I decided I had enough and wanted a whole lot more out of life.A year ago I read notes from a speaker that appeared at an event in New England, part of her talk was about this book and how it had changed her life and that she requires her reps (she and I are both reps for a well known company) to read it and put the components of the book into practice.If they were not willing to do that she felt that they were not coachable, thus they did not join her in business. Selective yes, but after reading and putting into practice components of the book I can now see why.I never noticed that section of the notes at the time but when I decided to change my life for the better I picked up those notes again and read them and read the section on &quot;Affirmations of Wealth&quot;.Got the book and poured through it and in the process I have found honest and true revelations about myself that I never knew existed and in turn with the power of affirmations I have been able to begin quantum changes in my life as well as shifting from the focus on negatives and not being able to see clearly towards my goals to the focus on positives and what must be done to bring about lasting and enduring wealth into all areas of my life and the lives of those that I touch and love.&quot;Affirmations of Wealth&quot; is a book that when combined with your own actions can create an amazing shift in your life - but only if you want change to happen in your life and you are not afraid to embrace the opportunities that await you.It is also the book that I now require my own new representatives (that I help to start their own businesses)to read."},{"Title":"Affirmations of Wealth: 101 Secrets of Daily Success","review":"I am a motivational book and tape junkie.

Perhaps third world countries still use this stuff."},{"Title":"Too Scared To Cry: Psychic Trauma In Childhood","review":"After many years of fostering displaced and traumatized children, this book gave me landmark understanding of their emotional state and behaviors. I will never forget the recurring themes of the young children at play and have since found observing play as a valuable tool in unravelling the mysteries of trauma in toddlers. I am especially intrigued by the effects of pre-verbal trauma since many of the babies that have come through my home, or stayed by adoption, have told their &quot;trauma stories&quot; through their behaviors. They have no words yet to describe their experiences. The effects of sexual trauma at a very early age are well described in this book. It is something most of us would rather not think about, much less deal with on a daily basis in a three year old. This book has helped me do that. Another book that was very helpful along these lines was Unspeakable Acts, an account of a daycare sexual abuse case in Florida. While very graphic and detailed, more journalistic in style, it helped me recognize the many symptoms and effects of sexual abuse on very young children and also gave me insight into the bizarre psyches of the perpetrators."},{"Title":"Too Scared To Cry: Psychic Trauma In Childhood","review":"I enjoyed reading this book, but I also had problems with it. Most of the information comes out of the author's own experience working with children who had experienced what she describes as psychic trauma. Primarily her subjects are the children of the Chowchilla kidnapping that took place in 1976, but there are other children that she refers to as well. While her work is important and interesting, it is certainly not the last word in trauma research. I was particularly distressed by her tendency to dismiss and invalidate the children themselves while imposing her own interpretations of their experiences on the very children she was researching. Questioning a child's ability to remember their own reality is very problematic for me, and stating as a fact a great many things that she does not document made me wonder what on earth her agenda was. She tended to alienate her subjects with her inability to believe the things they shared with her in trust and confidence, and I suspect that she lost a great deal of valuable understanding in the process. As I said, I enjoyed reading the book and I'm sure it will be a valuable addition to my reference shelf, but I do take issue with her bias and her own interpretations of experience she herself did not face. It is for this reason that I will keep her nearby as I continue my own research and understanding of trauma and recovery."},{"Title":"Too Scared To Cry: Psychic Trauma In Childhood","review":"&quot;Too Scared to Cry,&quot; is a seminal book.

I highly, highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Too Scared To Cry: Psychic Trauma In Childhood","review":"Terr gives wonderful insight to the world of trauma in children. Not only does she show how it affects their behaviour, but she also delves into how the mind deals with trauma.She presents her findings in such a way that it is enjoyable to read, while at the same time it is very disturbing that these atrocious acts occur in any society, much less in our own neighborhoods.The section of the book that I remember most vividly is how behaviour is changed after the traumatic event. She gives many insights as to how to recognize these behaviours in both children and adults. Because she uses many celebreties (authors, film makers, etc.), the behaviours that she is describing are that much easier to comprehend.I think that raising the awareness of people that deal with children on a daily basis is a very important cause, that should be much higher on our priority lists than it is."},{"Title":"Too Scared To Cry: Psychic Trauma In Childhood","review":"This book provides an excellent framework for identifying and diagnosing PTSD in children.

That portion of the book is fascinating and stimulating, and her insights seem well-grounded and profound. The less good parts deal with repressed memory and satanic abuse, and the book's 1980's age really shows there. The bad parts of the book read like the papers of a frustrated english student where she draws conclusions about a particular author's childhood trauma from fictional works."},{"Title":"Too Scared To Cry: Psychic Trauma In Childhood","review":"This is a very difficult book to read because it's so heavily doctored to be read as a novel that I don't believe for a moment that what Lenore Terr quotes these children as saying are actually the words that came from their mouths. A great deal of her research, if it can suitably be called that as this book is not at all written as a documented study, is based upon satanic rituals and pseudo-scientific methods of psychological and psychiatric treatments.Additionally, Lenore Terr abides by a great deal (if not all) of Freud's research and methods. Quite frankly, Freud's work reads like the manifesto of a pedophile group as does a great number of parts in this book. For a book about traumatized infants and children, there is a great deal of gratuitous descriptions of naked children being raped and abused.From a scientific viewpoint, I can't see how these descriptions are beneficial at all to anyone for any reason aside from shock value and potentially providing fodder for Freudian pedophiles. As the survivor of child molestation, rape, mental abuse, and physical abuse, I stand by this opinion. I have been diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and am currently studying child psychology with an emphasis on treating PTSD so I believe I have a great deal more insight into how a subject like this should be broached. With all due respect, Lenore Terr should never have been allowed to treat children, write this book, nor, most certainly, been awarded for her work. I am appalled by the medical field for having ever gratified her.Oh, and why would you speak \\"blandly\\" so frequently to traumatized children you're supposed to be treating? Frankly, I would like to know what the hell she thought she was doing and if she ever received any sort of training on how to talk to children. Someone please tell me that she never had children of her own.As for my opinion on Freud, any scientist or aspiring scientist in any specialty field worth his or her salt knows that the only reason Freud ever made such a fuss was because everything he said was so appalling and horrific. Honestly! He apparently really wanted children to be sexually excited, didn't he? Don't pedophiles react the same way when they try to explain their feelings for children? Justify it by saying they wanted it? Remember: Just because someone is loud and controversial, doesn't mean they're right or even sane.And, yes, I do realize how dated this book is, but that doesn't at all excuse the fact that this woman completely disregarded these children as human beings, remarked that four year olds were sexually excited during her sessions, and wrote about children in sexual positions (several times per chapter). There's also the very obvious issue that if this book were to have ever had any scientific merit or relevance, it would have been written in such a way that made it clear that that was her intention and not in such a way that made it sound like a *sensational* partially-true crime book."},{"Title":"Too Scared To Cry: Psychic Trauma In Childhood","review":"THis book, struck my right at my heart.

If the truth is not confronted soon and dealt with the consequences will be catastrophic.

Note of caution, there is very little in this book on designing model rockets from scratch beyond the basics. I was designing a rather advanced rocket and this book didn't help me very much.But when taken for what it's intended for it's a rather good book. It gives a lot of advice that you might not have come up with on your own and in fact is a pretty good guide for anyone who is a light hobbyist model rocketeer and is looking at getting into clubs and more frequent and serious model rocketry. He keeps the book interesting and amusing with some comments that I found absolutely hilarious. For example he always refers to trees as &quot;Rocket Eating Trees&quot; and in one illustration he has a rocket saying &quot;Bye Bye&quot; as it is carried off with the breeze.

Highly recommended for beginners and experience rocketeers alike."},{"Title":"Handbook of Model Rocketry","review":"The 7th edition of this great handbook is getting a little \\"long in the tooth\\" now, but it is still essential reading for anyone who wants to get into model rocketry, regardless of whether you're main interest is low, mid or high power rockets. Of all the books about model rocketry that I own, G. Harry Stine's handbook is the best value for money."},{"Title":"Handbook of Model Rocketry","review":"Model rocketry has come a long way since this book's first edition was published and the book does a great job of covering the basics of \\"How to get started\\" while addressing the ever expanding set of topics being introduced 40+ years later. The book provides some of the hobby's history and the 'hows and whys' of model rocketry. The book balances detail such as mathematics to compute aeronautical computations with rules of thumb one can use if science and math are not as interesting as building and safely launching a cool model rocket. While the book does not comprehensively cover mid and high power model rocketry topics, it does address some of the basics for those 'moving up'. Photos and illustrations are great."},{"Title":"Handbook of Model Rocketry","review":"The Handbook provides you with just about everything you would need or want to know about building and flying model rockets. It covers from how to prepare a motor for flight and how to attach fins, to more complicated things such as boost gliders and clusters. Through the whole thing, descriptions are detailed. Mr. Stine's humour keeps what could be some boring but important items fun, guiding you from your first rocket to scale masterpieces. Join the fun!"},{"Title":"Handbook of Model Rocketry","review":"I've been reading this book since I was a kid. An absolute great introduction to model rocketry. So instead of restating/echoing what others have said, I'll just go to my minor complaint.The picture quality is pretty bad. I do desktop publishing for a living so I sort of look for these things out of habit more than most. Every picture is low resolution and has WAY too much compression applied (low-quality setting). This is very easily seen by tapping to magnify any picture. You'll see a lot of \\"crunchiness\\" and compression artifacts. For example, the basic rocket flight illustration graphic early in the book. All the lines and words have light gray dots all around them - these are from too much compression. There's really no reason they should be there. The pictures could and should be nice and sharp - and you should able to magnify/zoom a reasonable amount (at least _some_) and still have the picture be sharp.Again, i consider this is a minor annoyance as the pictures are there and you can see what they are. They should just be a bit better.This is an excellent book and worth getting for a lot of great, rounded info on the hobby."},{"Title":"Handbook of Model Rocketry","review":"This is a very good introductory text for someone not familiar with the world of model recketry, and gives a thorough overview of the hobby. It is a bit too simplified for readers experienced in the applied sciences, and is focused more on your typical high school reader. Also the use of the American pound and inches system is a bit of a nuisance to readers familiar with the International metric system.Still it is a very good product and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Handbook of Model Rocketry","review":"As a boy, I checked this book out of the library so often, that when I turned 12 my parents bought me my own, brand new forth edition, hardbound copy. Over the years I have read it cover to cover too often to count.The section on aerodynamics and drag was especially engrossing to me. By the time I was fifteen, I hit a stumbling block in my understanding. I couldn't figure out how to determine the coefficient of drag. Many years later as an undergrad engineering student, I finally realized that the coefficient of drag can only be determined experimentally (Unless you're an aeronautical engineer trained in using some very sophisticated fluid dynamic modeling software).I probably only flew my rockets once or twice a summer. But I dreamed about them all year long. The Handbook continued to captivate and inform me from the time I was a boy, until I was educated as an engineer. Moreover, it introduced and prepared me for many subjects. From physics to materials, to construction, to history, and much more.If you know a boy or girl (young in age or young at heart) interested in model rockets, I highly recommend this book. It will be valuable from the first day, and for the days that turn into months and years after that."},{"Title":"Handbook of Model Rocketry","review":"Great reference for all levels.

Carry it with you if you want to know about engine sizes, stability, recovery devices, everything you need to know to shoot your rocket into the sky and bring it back in one piece (I should add as a side note that rockets that go bad are kind of fun to watch, but really hard on the makers nerves)."},{"Title":"Handbook of Model Rocketry","review":"This is a wonderful way to introduce kids into the value of math. They will learn about aero dynamics to boot. It's not a 'math' book, it's just that you have to learn a few formulas to be able to do the more entertaining projects. Harry does a great job of explaining the how's and why's of Rocket science in an entertaining way. He also throws a little history in there. This print is older but it hasn't changed much.

Even someone who's just curious about Model Rocketry will learn a lot from it."},{"Title":"Handbook of Model Rocketry","review":"This is without a doubt the best book on model rocketry I've ever seen, and I read it from cover to cover. It deals with every aspect of rocketry in a very accessible manner (for example, presenting formulas for various calculations, but not requiring their use). It is organized so that the reader can focus on single aspects of a rocketry program (for example, separate chapters on aerodynamics, rocket propulsion, recovery systems, altitude measurement). I am a science teacher and coach to two Team America Rocketry Challenge teams, and I keep copies of this book available for my teams as reference. I wish it had more information on electronic payloads, but that is a more advanced topic, so it is very forgivable.

If you need to know anything about model rocketry you should buy this book."},{"Title":"Handbook of Model Rocketry","review":"When I first read this book, I was merely a 15 year old begginer to the wonderful hobby of rocketry. After having sifted all the fundementals and vital information that made up this fascinating field, I found that what I intially thought to be simple was, indeed, the result of meticulas and crucial technical planning. Rocketry is fun, however the complexity and engineering of a rocket lies hidden. This book enveils that complexity and helps the reader comprehend it in a relatively easy manner. This is an extremely good aspect of the book because it spares the reader of the frequent hair-pulling frustration due to confusion.The preliminary chapters allow the reader to become more deaply familiar to the general aspects of the hobby. Things like basic model rocket components and construction as well as how to get started in order to eventually become deaply involved in the hobby are covered in these sections. You'll find that much of the information in this section is, most likely, stuff you may already be familiar with if you're a more experienced novice.The book then procedes to more detailed and more technical aspects of rocketry. From chapters 5 and on, more technical information is presented, however, in a format that makes understanding easy. Rocket motors, ingnition systems, stabilty, rocket aerodynamics and altitude determination are some of the many aspects covered.Another great feature of this book is that BASIC type computer programs that simulate and caculate crucial values and overall rocket performance can be found in the books's appendix already written. All you have to do is re-write the code in a BASIC computer program compiler and you're ready to make complex mathematical calculations for your rocket design in a matter of seconds.All in all, a great reference that any model rocket enthusiast will want to cherish forever. I also find that this book is great in terms of further inspiring young rocketeers, like myself, to persue a career in the field of rocketry and aerospace. It sure has for me!Thankyou Mr. Stine!"},{"Title":"Handbook of Model Rocketry","review":"The late Harry Stine is owed by all of us model rocket enthusiasts, active and (like myself) inactive, a debt of gratitude for the work he did to make model rocketry safe, and, more importantly, legal.While in the end Mr. Stine was not in synch with the average model rocket enthusiast (which were going into high powered rocketry) he was still admired by all for his contributions.If you want to find out the basics of model rocketry, up to a discussion of the then emerging (big time) high powered rocketry, this book is your bible.

Stine took it further by talking about the aerodynamics of rocketry, how to build large models, boost gliders, how to form clubs and oversee ranges, scale modeling.. and on and on...In fact, there are many tables in the book that even a veteran rocketeer would have to refer to almost daily to retrieve important information.

A must have for all model rocket enthusists."},{"Title":"Handbook of Model Rocketry","review":"This book is probably the definitive work covering the \\"model rocket\\" hobby and the industry that surrounds it. The book will tell you everything you need to know to design, build, and fly \\"model\\" rockets. It will also tell you very specifically what model rocketry is and isn't. Very recommended.However, the book didn't quite meet my expectations--I do have a complaint:First, an explanation is in order. In hobby rocketry, there are two very different concepts: \\"Model\\" rocketry and \\"Amateur\\" rocketry. Now, I'm going to over-simplify: In Model rocketry, hobbyists use commercially-manufactured rocket motors (they don't build their own) and build flying models; while in Amateur rocketry, the rocketeers often build their own motors (and often much larger rockets that wouldn't be considered \\"models\\").OK, so what? The author(s) completely, and without exception, condemns home-built rocket motors (and by extension Amateur rocketry), saying there is no such thing as a safely constructed and flown home-built motor--and one way or another, this point is emphasized many times over. In my opinion as an engineer, this is somewhat ridiculous, but the author is entitled to his own opinion too (and at least one of the authors is (was) a bona fide rocket scientist). Home-built motors may not be for the grade-schooler, but neither is auto racing.If you're interested in propellants, burn rates, nozzle geometry, and saving a lot of money on rocket motors (especially meaningful if you're building larger rockets) you won't find it here, nor will you find a sympathetic ear.Buy this book first. Then if you really want more, don't be dissuaded--try \\"How to Make Amateur Rockets\\" by John Wickman (he's a rocket scientist too), \\"Modern High Power Rocketry\\" by Mark Canepa, and \\"Amateur Rocket Motor Construction\\" by David Sleeter."},{"Title":"Handbook of Model Rocketry","review":"G.

Bandit, and his case that Vicki fought for so well was a very important watermark in exposing the myths and half truths that cause so many local authorities accross the country to blindly deem certain breeds of dogs as dangerous. I want to love this book because of this, however, for me the book was to difficult to read. Vicki uses extremely complicated sentence structure and seems to enjoy putting the reader through the wringer before she makes her point. I had to come back to this book a few times to finish it. I believe this is a story we all should be aware of, unfortunately the style of writing alienates it from a good deal of it's prospective audience. If you're well read, go for it, if not just expect to go through a mental obstacle course before the book is finished!"},{"Title":"Bandit: Dossier of a Dangerous Dog","review":"Ok, ok, Hearne can be annoying with the long philosophical musings.

This gripping story. (Skip the \\"philosophy\\" which seems weirdly inserted into this fascinating story anyway.) Hearne has done the research. She understands and communicates the myriad elements of the pit bull and dangerous dog hysteria. You'll come to the end of _Bandit: Dossier of a Dangerous Dog_, a well informed citizen on the issue of blanket, breed specific, dog bans.Your heart will be touched by old Bandit's story. You might not take your right to dog companionship quite so much for granted anymore. You may find (god forbid)you need this information in your own town. As for the reviews above mine... you have to understand (or admit) everybody is an expert when it comes to dogs.

Others feel her training methods were too harsh. But Vicki Hearne knew a great dog, and how to write about one. Be warned: This book is politically incorrect and may make you do something really stupid, like adopt a pit bull. Vicki Hearne is, after all, the one who said, \\"It is true that Pit Bulls grab and hold on. But what they most often grab and refuse to let go of is your heart, not your arm.\\""},{"Title":"Bandit: Dossier of a Dangerous Dog","review":"This isn't a book about dog training, although it talks about that quite a bit. It's not even a book about dogs really, although it talks about dogs all the time. It's really about our relationships with dogs, how they fit into our lives and our society and our mythology. Hearne taught poetry at Yale, but her real calling seems to be dog training. Her writing is funny and dry and full of information, and sooner or later she'll say something that annoys you. But if you can't take a little annoyance you should have a dog. And she's probably only annoying you because you are carrying around some misconception about dogs."},{"Title":"Bandit: Dossier of a Dangerous Dog","review":"This book should be required reading for anyone interested in the problem of biting dogs. It is extremely well-written, researched, referenced, and very informative.My one reservation is that the author advocates the use of choke-collar training. There is so much to be gained from modern psychology and operant conditioning when training an animal. Pain in animal training is totally obsolete.But this one small quibble doesn't spoil an otherwise engaging and thought provoking read! Very few fiction or non-fiction dog books can hold a candle to this one in scholarship and quality of writing.You will need to read it at least twice to absorb all the subtleties."},{"Title":"Bandit: Dossier of a Dangerous Dog","review":"I have owned and trained multiple breed of dogs and Ms Hearne is very right about the issue.

Those that believe in Positive Reinforcement training consider her techniques and ideology to be cruel and unnecessary. For instance: holding a dogs head in a hole filled with water to stop the dog from digging. There are other methods that can stop the behavior without using such barbaric methods. Her techniques should not be used, and notice, the aggressive dogs she deals with are never rehabilitated into mainstream doggy life as it were. They are never trained to the point of being trusted. So much for her methods."},{"Title":"Bandit: Dossier of a Dangerous Dog","review":"Hearne's beautifully written book is, oddly, never referenced by people who loudly defend the 'fighting' breeds of dog from scrutiny. Hearne was a skilled and charismatic writer who can almost sell the utter malarkey that pit bulls have been unfairly maligned by 'the media' and 'hysteria.' But apparently, her complex, elliptical writing style and fascination with philosophy are a 'downer' for people who just want outrage stories about beaten dogs and biased media outlets. How very revealing."},{"Title":"Bandit: Dossier of a Dangerous Dog","review":"I started reading the book with quite high expectations, and at first these were fulfilled. However, after a while, Vicki Hearne's personal opinions of dog people and the world in general becomes uninteresting and at times even annoying. It would help if she stuck at least a little bit more to the subject matter, the story of Bandit and the problem about dangerous dogs in general. But instead, she glides off into philosophical thoughts which nobody really wants to hear about anyway and trying to convince the rest of the world about the viciousness of the media and politicians. Still, it was a nice, but different attempt to the dog-bites-person problem."},{"Title":"Bandit: Dossier of a Dangerous Dog","review":"I was deeply disappointed in this book. The only good thing about this book is that at least it does not blame the dog. The author is misinformed about canine behavior --and since this book reads as though she knows what she's talking about, she is spreading this information.

However, every man in this book is young, thin, and handsome. I hate seeing older gay men, fat gay men, and the guys who wouldn't be asked to model for a magazine not being portrayed here.

It's been invaluable, now that so many \\"lost\\" albums are being released on CD, particularly because so many such reissues don't have the liner notes from the original album.Sure, I've found a couple dozen errors -- leaving out band members or even entire groups, or mangling the history. And the album listings are often incomplete, or don't list the correct year of release. Of course, it's also not much use for beyond 1981 or so.But I haven't found a better general guide.You glean all sorts of wonderful stuff by just skimming. I mean, who knew that the studio musician Teddy Jack Eddy was really Gary Busey? And now I want the album recorded by jam supergroup Free Creek. (Though I might settle for the one album made by Giants.) The real jewels are from the late 1960s: I'd never heard of bands like Rotary Connection or Savage Rose or Stray Dog. And references go back further, mentioning more than a few influential players from blues, jazz, & country.What sucks is that, now that we've got this Internet thing, this book isn't out there, getting revised every year or two, forming the central point for a massive database of rock & pop music.But if you're a serious fan of slightly older modern music, & want some help in tying together the pieces, or maybe helping you look for reviv4ed classics or old vinyl, this ought to be on your shelf."},{"Title":"The Story Of The Secret Service","review":"As the leading civilian authority on the Secret Service, I modestly recommend this 1957 book by Ferdinand Kuhn (pen name?).

Baughman).Vince PalamaraSecret Service expert (History Channel, author of 2 books, in over 32 other author's books, etc.)"},{"Title":"The Story Of The Secret Service","review":"This book was advertised as a hardback book and it was a soft-covered book. I was really disappointed."},{"Title":"Winter Song","review":"In the previous book circumstances had thrown together Raymond of Aix, nephew by marriage to the King of England and Alys of Marlowe, the daughter of an English Knight. Raymond, fleeing from his mother's smothering affection, is enchanted by Alys' good sense and competence. Now, despite the difference between their social positions, Raymond is determined to have Alys for his wife.Change the names and this could probably describe hundreds of second rate romances. But there is nothing second rate about Roberta Gellis. And the book is not about the wooing and winning, but what happens after the marriage is made.Alys has to deal with a difficult mother-in-law, a venal bailiff and a tricky politcal situation. She also has to deal with her own fears that she cannot live up to Raymond's social status. Raymond's mother lives a life of idleness that Alys takes to be the usual role of noblewomen. Alys, however, is far to competent and lively to dwindle into a mere noblewoman.As always, it is a pleasure to see Ms. Gellis deal with the medieval mindset. There's no misplaced 20th century sentimentality. If her characters are somewhat softer than the history of the period would suggest was usual, it is always for a good, logical reason in keeping with the thought of the times.This one is not an easy book to find but well worth the search."},{"Title":"Winter Song","review":"I recommend this book strongly to those who like Roberta Gellis other books, and to others who like this genre"},{"Title":"Winter Song","review":"Characters are fully fleshed people. History is woven in and given a personal touch from a smaller perspective than the royal. Each book wants you reading more. Each story is unique."},{"Title":"Winter Song","review":"Roberta Gellis has done it gain. One learns more about life in medieval times from her writing than any other author. She provides an attractive and plausible heroine and hero. She teaches the reader history in the most painless fashion and is painstakingly accurate in her details."},{"Title":"Winter Song","review":"In this sequel to Siren Song, Alys and Raynond have married and journey to France to his home in Aix. The book is filled with adventure, misunderstandings, describes battles, a kidnapping and has a really nasty villain. Though at times it seems to bog down, the book on the whole is quite readable. I would have liked more emphasis on the historical happenings and less on the fictional lovers, but I am sure I am in a minority on this."},{"Title":"Winter Song","review":"book was believable as to the time period it was in, characters were interesting and there was a story not just romance, comic moments were cleverly done. I love to read about this time period and this was a location I had not read about before."},{"Title":"LADIES' NIGHT.","review":"Ladies' Night trades on a fundamental male fear: namely, what if the women in our lives suddenly turned on us? Ketchum answers that question in typically brutal fashion, positing a scenario wherein New York City becomes a battleground in the ongoing war of the sexes.The story begins when a chemical tanker collides with a car near 72nd Street and Broadway, spilling its sweet smelling contents. We later learn that the liquid that gushes forth is \\"an airborne chemical poison, a psycho-sexual hormone cocktail\\" designed to drive women \\"bats*** and terminally homicidal,\\" a remnant of research from the Vietnam war. The release of this chemical awakens something in the women it touches. For some, it is a mere increase in libido, but for others, it unleashes unparalleled savagery.As Ketchum says in his introduction, Ladies' Night \\"is basically a story about some guy trying to get home after a really bad night at his local bar.\\" The guy's name is Tom, and his odyssey through the ravaged streets of New York to save his son will keep you on the edge of your seat. There are also plenty of other trademark Ketchum touches here, from the guy who gets seared on a grill to a woman who tears open her victims' throats with her teeth.Actually Ketchum's second novel, the book shows its influences--the parallels to Night of the Living Dead are obvious, from the atrocities committed by what amounts to mindless zombies to the ironic, pathetic end of one of the book's main characters (although Ketchum does a nice slight of hand here). At its core, the book is a horror novel for men. Let's face it guys, on some level, many of us fear women. We certainly can't claim to understand them. But we depend on their essential stability, and fear the loss of their companionship. That's what makes the book resonate for those of us with XY configurations. For women, it's a chance to take a little vicarious revenge. For men, it's a terrifying projection of a secret fear. Women--can't live with 'em, might get killed by 'em."},{"Title":"LADIES' NIGHT.","review":"Ketchum pretty much re-hashes \\"Night of the Living Dead,\\" except it's women who are transformed into homicidal, cannibalistic, zombie-like killing machines (although the Z-word never appears in the book) who are out to kill everything with a pair of testicles after a strange chemical spill in midtown Manhattan. Nothing special, except the gore factor is especially high in this novel, even for Ketchum. Lots of splattery goodness for indiscriminating gorehounds looking for a quick hardcore horror read. Definitely recommended for fans!"},{"Title":"LADIES' NIGHT.","review":"I am a fan of the horror genre, and this is quite an extreme example; but with a refreshing approach. It is the women who are effected by a strange toxic spill, not only causing them to become violent but also loosing their real selves in the process. Kind of like horny, hungry female zombies. They begin to attack all of the men only because they are men, but also when they sense a woman has not changed with them, is not like them, they attack her too. The one thing I felt should have possibly been expanded on is the fact that it is the women who are violent beyond control, in a society where men are suppose to never strike a woman. I wonder how different it would have been in reverse; were the men effected I believe the women would have been even more violent in their defense. Very interesting subject.In a short 166 page story, Ketchum manages to bring his characters to life, and portrays one woman's transformation into something unknown even to her very well. The focus of the story is one man's journey from his neighborhood bar back to his apartment to save his son...from his wife.This book does contain some very graphic gore and splatter, so be prepared. But it is a very fast read in that it moves like a movie through your head. I could see this becoming a horror movie very easily."},{"Title":"LADIES' NIGHT.","review":"This book is very underdeveloped. The characters never really have time to grow, and in the end you care little what happens to them. And the thing is that this book was originally 400 pages, and included a much larger back story, but was trimmed down for sake of pacing (all in the introduction).What this book does have going for is great pacing, extreme action, and feels so cinematic that it seems so perfect for the silver screen (which is actually happening, and is being directed by Stuart 'Re-Animator' Gordon). Once this story starts it never stops, and that is one of its greatest assets, and also the thing that brings it down the most.Because of the pacing most charcters are left sevearly underdeveloped, and almost seem like they aren't needed in the book, and a lot of situations are also very predictible (especially one characters demise). Plus the book features several grammer and spelling errors that should have been corrected before the book was published.A good quick read for horror fans, but don't expect anything deep or overly involving. This is just a perfectly written 'Resident Evil' type book that has a jet pack attached to it.*-This book is not for the squimish or prudish. There are several graphic sexual scenes, attempted incest, and more gore than you can shake a stick at. Also, most of the violence is against women, but is all in the form of self defense, rather than for domestic reasons. There is also a few scenes of violece against younger children, both male and female, but again for self defense reasons, and not domestic or explotative reasons."},{"Title":"LADIES' NIGHT.","review":"I did not like it as well as his other books, but still entertaining. I would certainly buy more of his books."},{"Title":"LADIES' NIGHT.","review":"Interesting if not even clever variant of the usual crazy/zombie-apocalypse story. But there is no deep plot involved, only mayhem and gore and a more-or-less foreseeable ending. Great potential but ultimately short of breath on the last pages."},{"Title":"LADIES' NIGHT.","review":"this book was a little too scary and not too realistic, for me. I will try to find another of Ketchum's books, to see if I might like a different story."},{"Title":"LADIES' NIGHT.","review":"I really enjoyed 'The Girl Next Door'. I thought it was a good book and it scared the hell out of me. So I bought the next book in line. I'm about 70% through it and I find myself groaning in frustration and yawning with boredom. I called this book porno for psychos because it reads like a thirteen-year-old boy's idea of great sex. 'Man, I'm gonna slam it in her about 50 times and then dis her!' Only in this case, our young boys are gutting instead of rutting. Our women are savages, out of control maniacs who are so pissed off that they're horny that they feel compelled to rip all of the men to shreds. I do not think that this is a good book - or even a good premise. I have little or no sympathy for the lead man, Tom, a cheating louse who - now that he faces death - regrets his behavior. Please. Give me a break. Not to mention that I think his infected wife is about to rape their 8 year old son? I'm not sure if I am even going to finish it. The problem with pornographic material like this is that no one really cares about the story. In the world of porn it really is wham bam thank you ma'am. So after my fix of 80 or 90 juicy wet homicides, I'm done."},{"Title":"LADIES' NIGHT.","review":"Read the book and found it decent. Sadly cant recommend as a favorite in the Ketchum line. If you want to see a film, which was very enjoyable to me, based around a similar plot watch the British film \\"Doghouse\\". At least that made me laugh because of the jokes. This book made me laugh when I think I should have been frightened. Guess the whole intro stating it as too graphic to publish was due to the fact of the year it was supposed to come out. Its pretty tame in my opinion compared with some other novels I have read. Just my two cents."},{"Title":"LADIES' NIGHT.","review":"I have read a few novels by Ketchum and this would not be on my top 5 list for him. the story was somewhat interesting, but seemed like it lacked something essential to the plot. The concept was not that original either..think night of the living dead meets feminism! If this will be the first novel that you are reading by Ketchum and do not want to be turned away from his writing..I would recommend that you start elsewhere.(You might want to consider \\"The Girl Next Door.) Overall it was an ok novel...but no more than that."},{"Title":"LADIES' NIGHT.","review":"Jack Ketchum's long-buried (due to its violent nature, naturally) followup to Off Season finally gets a new life thanks to e-readers, and it turns out to be a fantastic riff on Night of the Living Dead that's as much about the battle of the sexes as it is about graphic, pulp horror. Ketchum opens the e-version with a long discussion as to the backstory of the piece that's worth reading, but ultimately, the combination of the widespread revulsion at Off Season and the perceived misogyny of Ladies Night kept the book from ever really getting a release. And while I understand the first from a financial perspective, I think the second is entirely missing the point. Ladies Night is indeed about a night in which, for reasons which are only hinted at throughout, the female population of a city essentially turn into bloodthirsty killers, and the violence inflicted both by and upon women could easily lead some to feel that the book is a fantasy outlet for male rage. But I think that's missing the point. I think it's more telling that Ketchum's original tagline for the book was \\"In the battle between the sexes, one side just fired the opening shot.\\" This is not a book that leaves anyone looking good; both sides are both victims and victimizers, albeit on a massive and horrific scale beyond what you see in a typical divorce case. All of that being said, the subtext wouldn't matter if this didn't succeed as a horror piece, so it's nice that this works so well as grisly pulp horror. The only real downside comes from how closely Ketchum sometimes sticks to the Night of the Living Dead template; there are moments that feel less shocking simply because you can feel that film's shadow forcing Ketchum's hand. But for every moment like that, there are dozens more that play out in entirely other ways, resulting in a spectacular piece of mayhem and bloodshed. You can probably guess, but Ladies Night isn't for all tastes. If you've got a taste for this kind of thing, though, this is a damned good piece of pulp horror."},{"Title":"LADIES' NIGHT.","review":"Over fifteen years in the making, Ketchum's Ladies Night is a fun, fast paced read. This was originally supposed to be his second book, following Off Season in 1981, under the title The Mantis Syndrome (obvious title when you read the book) and was 400 pages long. He trimmed it over the years and tightened it, the final page count coming in at 166 pages.The story starts on the night of a full moon in a NY bar. The women start acting weird, aggressive and feral. There's something in the air and it makes women go crazy with murderous rage. Before long, an all-out battle of the sexes ensues throughout New York City. We follow Tom and Bailey along with a group of men as they try to survive the onslaught of animalistic zombie-like females. Not all women have gone nuts; a select few appear to have remained untouched. Question is, which ones?Ladies Night unfolds at break-neck speed and is a real page turner. It's not for everybody, though; a good amount of scenes are extremely violent and/or depict erotic/sexual situations. If you're a fan of Ketchum, you'll most likely enjoy this one. Not his best, but very entertaining.The only negative comment I have to make is in regards to the more grammatical aspect of things; the book is plagued with spelling errors, grammatical errors, lack of punctuation (some sentences are five lines long without any sign of a comma). Clearly nobody proofread the book. A shame. If you can get over these details, you'll enjoy yourself."},{"Title":"LADIES' NIGHT.","review":"I don't quite understand the harshness and negativity towards this book. This is, after all, a Jack Ketchum novella. If you grabbed this and meant to get &quot;The Good Earth&quot;, I can see your confusion. I enjoyed this book because I believe I took it the way it was intended- as an over-the-top, mindless excursion into a independent horror movie. This is &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; with an updated location and a plot twist. This is not Jack Ketchum's deepest, best written, most thought provoking work. It is a fun, wild ride through one night in a city gone to hell. A good time if you allow yourself such indulgence."},{"Title":"LADIES' NIGHT.","review":"I must first say I am a huge Jack Ketchum fan. Read all his books and \\"Ladies' Night\\" was the last one.After two chapters I was lost. I even had to look up his book on Amazon and Barnes and Noble to see if maybe it was a short story book or if it really was meant to be a complete story.By the fifth chapter there still isn't anything that ties the chapters together. We aren't introduced to any of the characters, unless you count telling us their names an introduction.By page 74 I knew that if I were to put the book down and never pick it up again nothing would be lost. I wouldn't be left wondering how the book ended, or who was still alive/dead. It really is that bad.The only real exciting part about this book is that I caught at least two glaring typos that made me stop and re-read the sentences over and over. With this book, not such a good thing.Overall, I was hugely disappointed by this \\"story\\". It's in quotes because it doesn't have a plot. Nothing. The entire book is full of knifings, killing, and utter mayhem. But since you really don't know the characters you don't tend to care what happens to them. Okay he died, next... This reminds me a \\"story\\" an angry teenager would write. Lots of blood and guts, but no real substance."},{"Title":"LADIES' NIGHT.","review":"Unless your sole purpose for reading this book is to hear 1,000 descriptions of people killing each other with knives, guns, household items, etc., skip this one. Every other Jack Ketchum book I have read (The Girl Next Door, Stranglehold, Off Season, Joyride) is MUCH better than this one. This book's plot is as follows: one night of everyone killing everyone else in a small portion of New York City because of a chemical spill that makes all the women become psychotic foaming-at-the-mouth brutal killers. That's it. There's no sub-plot, definitely no character depth whatsoever, and you end up not caring whether these people die or not. I purchased this book anticipating another great story on a par with Girl Next Door and Off Season, and it's hard to believe that the book is even by that same author. Frankly, watching &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; was a better time investment than this book was (cheaper, too). I kept reading only because I was expecting the plot to eventually develop and get some depth - it never happened. Come on Jack - you can do better than this. Maybe you should stick with books based on true stories because they seem to be your only strong point."},{"Title":"LADIES' NIGHT.","review":"This is the absolute worst novel Jack Ketchum has ever written. I don't know what these readers that gave it such a high rating require in their reading material, but evidently, not much. It has no plot, no character development, mindless, senseless violence, and makes absolutely no sense. I am a Jack Ketchum fan and have read just about every novel he has written, and I can't believe he wrote this drivel."},{"Title":"LADIES' NIGHT.","review":"I liked this book. I have read &quot;The Lost&quot; by Ketchum as well as one or two of his short stories, and clearly, while the depth of &quot;Ladies Night&quot; is different, I knew what I was getting into, and it met my expectations. Exceeded them.This was an action-horror novel with a satirical twist (and those who live NYC can appreciate it a little more). Ultimately, the author was not out for as much character development as in his other novels (but then again, the foreward fo the version I read said he had cut this book down in size dramatically, probably by a woman). Oooops, mysoginistic! Two ways to look at that one: He is either portraying women as the villians (anti-woman) or saying that women were getting revenge against the men who created the cosmetic (designed to please men) that turned the women into man-killers. Whatever. My only regret was that since the foreward told me he was inspired by the movie Romero flick &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; (which I have seen umpteen times), I could see what would happen in one late scene when he started spelling it out for me.This is a short, fun, hardcore horror novel that is meant to thrill. That's about it. I think many authors of the horror and suspense have gone down this road, and I like it when authors do different things. Take the man Joe Lansdale, he knows the deal.All IMHO."},{"Title":"LADIES' NIGHT.","review":"I'm a big fan of extreme horror, but this is the pits. It is invariably poorly written, and I'm amazed this novel made it to the press. What's worse, the text is rife with typos.Just another indication that just because you get published doesn't mean you can write worth a damn."},{"Title":"LADIES' NIGHT.","review":"This book is awful. Even Friday the 13th looks like a masterpiece when compared to this piece of trash."},{"Title":"LADIES' NIGHT.","review":"Tom Braun and his wife Susan aren't exactly a picturesque couple. Thus it comes as no surprise that Tom continually spends late evenings in bars and cheats on his wife. Unfortunately, their son Andy is caught in the middle of his parent's childish banter and family chaos. One life-altering evening turns this family's, along with most of New York's, perceptions on the nuclear family and male/female relationships upside down.When a tanker trunk with \\"Ladies Inc.\\" emblazoned on the side crashes in a quiet area in New York, an area it doesn't have authorization to be in, it liberally spills its contents all over the road and into the surrounding atmosphere. The local authorities deem the contents of the spill to be safe, based merely on the assumption that products coming from a women's label are more than likely benign. Moreover, the smell emanating from the spill is one of sweet cherry, similar to lollipops, which must of course be harmless if not favorable. This aforementioned assumption proves fatally incorrect. The chemical load the truck was hauling procures a discomfiting, bestial effect in women, forcing them to savagely attack males in their vicinity. Be they former friend or foe.Tom, while at a local bar, absorbs the evening's strange turn of events with traumatizing clarity as he witnesses first hand the metamorphosis of surrounding women into gruesomely instinctual brutes and mantis-like predators. He must get home to his son Andy, who is currently alone with his wife Susan. Hopefully before it is too late.This concept is not entirely new in the horror genre. Ketchum weaves his plot in a very Romero-esque fashion, and even admits to drawing from the \\"Dead\\" trilogy for this particular tale. However, Ketchum chooses to give women the role of ruthless savage while the males run for their lives. Some unforeseen visceral instinct takes over, and the body count rises in true repulsive zombie fashion.I am certainly one to appreciate some well-placed gore and vivid descriptions. However, I felt as though Ketchum let the grotesque extravagance take precedence over the plot in this particular form of this novel. The extreme horror genre need not be a mere roller-coaster ride of bloodshed and carnage. In his forward, Ketchum states that this 164 page book was originally about 400 pages, and one of the longest books he'd ever written. Furthermore, he states that there was originally slightly more character development and a few additional side-plots woven into the now sparse and thin story line. I, for one, would love to see his original version find its way into print.In addition to the hackneyed, bare-boned plot, this book is fraught with typos and editing errors. Though they don't themselves detract from the plot, they do indeed become a nuisance.I have always been, and will continue to be, a fan of Jack Ketchum. However, this particular book is not his best work."},{"Title":"LADIES' NIGHT.","review":"This Jack Ketchum novel is one of the few that doesn't require a second mortgage on your house in order to procure a copy. I think people selling copies of his novel \\"The Girl Next Door\\" are now requiring a buyer to give them their first-born son for a copy. After reading this book, \\"Ladies Night,\\" I don't really understand what all of the fuss is about. I should admit that this is the first Ketchum novel I've read, so I can't confirm his greatness in the eyes of many based solely on one slim book. Apparently, Stephen King mentioned him in his book on writing, and now thousands are going crazy trying to snap up Ketchum novels.Despite many errors in the book, I did like \\"Ladies Night.\\" In the preface to the book, Ketchum relates several amusing anecdotes about how the book came about. \\"Ladies Night\\" came out in the late 1990's, but Ketchum says he wrote it in the early 1980's. Despite the immense amount of time Ketchum spent writing the book (detailed outlines, research, in-depth character analysis), every publisher rejected the book due to the high level of pornographic violence. It is not difficult to imagine the chagrin Ketchum felt when his carefully crafted 400-page novel failed to reach publication. Ketchum then hooked up with a screenwriter/playwright who made significant reductions in the size of the original novel. After this failed to produce results, Ketchum began to circulate the story around to movie studios in an attempt to get the tale to the big screen (or at least a straight to video release). Eventually, the book made it into print. This 160+ page novella is the result.The plot of \\"Ladies Night\\" is one we've seen many times, with slight variations, in both books and movies. A tanker truck involved in an accident spills an unknown fluid in the streets of New York. Unfortunately for the men of New York, the odor of this fluid causes a majority of women to develop rather unusual symptoms, including hypersexuality and a propensity to kill, horribly, any man they can lay their hands on. The main character, Tom Braun, must get home in order to save his son Andy from his mother, Susan. This is easier said than done, however, as the streets of New York rapidly slide into bloody chaos. Packs of women roam the streets, killing and maiming pedestrians, spouses, and cops. Several side stories describe, in more than graphic detail, the omnipresent murder and mayhem. Bottles are broken in faces, eyes soar out of sockets, heads are caved in, men are run over by cars, people are set on fire, and necks and chests are torn to shreds during the course of the story. Bodies topple with frightening consistency as Tom battles his way home to save his son. The gore quotient increases rapidly as the book nears its bloody, and grim, end. This book is not sunshine and smiles.While the story is definitely entertaining, mostly due to the battle of the sexes theme, there are a lot of problems with the book. First, I think I would like to read the original book he wrote in the 1980's. If what Ketchum says is true, I think the original would clear up a lot of the problems I had with the book. With this kind of apocalyptic story, I want a lot of background on the events. I want to see the actual breakdown of society and I want to discover why it happened. You don't get that depth here. We never find out where the liquid came from or who made the fluid. Ketchum says in his preface that he covered this in great depth in the original. If Ketchum is as popular as his book prices warrant, why can't we see the original?Second, the character development is flat as a pancake. The only real insight we see in the book is with Andy, Tom's son, and even that is scarce. I realize that in a book like this, the gore is often the main character, but other authors do more with characterization in books that are just as gory. Ketchum, if he developed his characters, would achieve greater shock value when they die suddenly, as several do in the course of the story. Unfortunately, the attempt at brevity sacrifices the characters.Third, I would like to know who edited this book. They should be fired. You know it's bad when you feel like picking up a pen or pencil to mark in commas and correct misspelled words. I know my grammar isn't great, but when I read something that is a published work, I expect a lot more than what I found here. I would be embarrassed if I wrote a story that had this many errors. I started to wonder if this is the condition the story was in when Ketchum turned it in for publication. If it was, Ketchum needs to buy a few grammar textbooks and spend some time working with them.Overall, this is still an entertaining book. I spend a lot of my time reading classic literature and history books, but I shall always have a weak spot for horror novels. In \\"Godfather III,\\" Michael Corleone once said, \\"I try and get out and they keep pulling me back in!\\" That's me with horror novels and films. I'll read more Ketchum, but I am not going to pay the exorbitant prices some of his books command to do so. Bring back the mass-market paperbacks!"},{"Title":"LADIES' NIGHT.","review":"When certain chemicals are applied to the opposite sex's visage, specific emotions are brought into fruition. Sometimes its a feeling of heightened bliss and attraction, other times its love and devotion, and still other times its safety and a feeling somewhat like home. When chemicals that have been manufactured for warfare are applied, however, all deals are off and, for the men of New York City, its run for your lives time.Basically a B-movie in practice, this story focuses around the lives of one character, Tom Braun, and the people surrounding him as all the women that come into contact with a certain mystery chemical become primal killing machines. These individuals include his son, his wife, his infatuation, the bartender he keeps to cope with his infatuations, and other people met along the way, all struggling for some way out of the nightmare that has fallen on them in a twenty-four hour period (and that smells like Cherry lollipops, for anyone interested in holding their breath). It is because of this that I thought the book was good but, at the same time, that it also lacked in some regard as the streets slicked with gore. The characters were noticeable and the effects were gruesome and sometimes even applaudable, but the outside world ramifications weren't really focused on at all. The setting sometimes teemed but more than often were just barely touched, and some of the momentum is lost toward the last portion of the book. Still, the last statement made in the book was something that, in many ways, I found to redeem much of that.For someone looking for a quick read that is slicked with the internals of the unfortunate, this might be something that you might be interested in. It has quite a few little deaths that seemed, well, painful, plus it goes into detail about random acts of violence going on all about the city. If you need the backgrounds painted for you and the city described in more than a minimalist perspective, it might be something that you might want to save for later."},{"Title":"LADIES' NIGHT.","review":"I'm now starting to get into what I call \\"Splatter\\" novels (that's \\"horror\\" and \\"suspense\\" fiction with excessive violence and gore, not mention a strong sexual content). I've already purchased several books by Jack Ketchum, Edward Lee, and Simon Clark, to name a few. I've also quickly discovered that sometimes too much violence and sex disrupts the flow of the book, while at other times it seems to be just the right amount, moving the story along at a breaknecking speed.Such is the case with Jack Ketchum's LADIES' NIGHT. This is a relatively short novel, running in at a 167 pages. It's fast paced, tense, and definitely not for the squeamish. The story begins when a tanker truck is involved in a traffic accident in the middle of New York City's West Side. The unknown contents of the truck spills out onto the streets, and its cloy, sweet cherry scent spreads throughout the inner city, infecting most of the female population.By nightfall, the women of NYC have become sexually aroused with a powerful blood lust that leads them to wanting to kill every man in the city. When Tom Braun and his wife notice a beautiful dancer masturbating herself with a broken wine bottle during a roof party at the top of their apartment building, it's the first sign that the night is going to get even stranger. After the party is over and the demented dancer has been subdued by security, Tom decides to visit the local bar for a nightcap. Within a couple of hours, the women in the bar are brutally murdering as many of the men as possible, while Tom and the bartender, Phil, fight their way outside to the street, stepping out of the frying pan and into the fire.The sounds of the night are filled with the screams of dying men and the demonic laughter of vengeful females. Tom realizes that the women in the city have gone bezerk and that his young son, Andy, may be in danger at their apartment. It's going to be a battle to the death as he and other men fight their way through the streets in an effort to save Andy...a boy who may already be dead at the hands of his mother.LADIES' NIGHT is one of those fun reads that reminded me of movies like Night of the Living Dead and Halloween. It's popcorn entertainment that thrills and makes you jump in all of the right places. Mr. Ketchum doesn't hold back on the blood and gore in his descriptions of men and women being killed in the streets of New York City; yet, rather than being a turnoff, it actually works for me. There is no in-depth character development here, but who cares? Most of the characters in this novel are going to be dead by the end of it. This is definitely a short roller-coaster ride of death and destruction that's to be enjoyed for its pacing and intensity.I liked LADIES' NIGHT enough that I intend to purchase some of Jack Ketchum's other novels, THE LOST, HIDE & SEEK, OPEN SEASON, and THE GIRL NEXT DOOR. Naturally, this novel isn't for everyone. If you're not into \\"splatter\\" fiction, then save your money for something else. If, however, you want to read some dark, violent, sexually oriented fiction that can make you laugh at times, then give this novel a shot!"},{"Title":"LADIES' NIGHT.","review":"Ladies' Night is quite a departure for Jack Ketchum. The book's intro tells us that he wrote this book in the early 80s and worked on it ever since. And now, the final results has been published. And it looks a lot like an Urban-city version of Night Of the Living Dead. In this book, a strange chemical is realeased in New York city and every single woman becomes a zombie-like creature who is thirsty for blood. And so they go after the men.The book is fun, gory and fast-paced. It is a quick read. It made me grin quite a lot. I love Ketchum's ironic style. He loves to play with words, giving many words or sentences double meanings. And he is not afraid to shock his readers. This book isn't for the faint of heart.Ketchum fans should find this to be a fun read. It's not Ketchum's best, but it's still a Ketchum book."},{"Title":"LADIES' NIGHT.","review":"First of all, take the warning on the cover that this book contains upsetting, graphic subject matter seriously. I'm a longtime horror reader, and while I read and enjoy many authors, only a handful of them have disturbed me to the point of giving me nightmares after I read their work. Jack Ketchum, aka Dallas Mayer, is one of them. If you're a JK fan (or have read and finished Off-Season or The Girl Next Door), you'll know what I mean. And if you love JK, pick this up fast if you haven't already. It's one of his best and most memorable. It's also one of his most cold-blooded, which Ketchum readers will know is saying a lot.Ladies Night (great title, by the way) takes place over a short period of time-about 24 hours, actually. The plot reminded me of Cronenberg's &quot;Rabid&quot;, Romero's Dead trilogy, and Phillip Nutman's &quot;Wet Work&quot;. A virus that the government developed, presumably as a weapon, leaks out and quickly begins to effect females only. The chemical/disease causes women to slowly but completely lose their minds (note: insert PMS joke of your choice here). The main symptoms are women becoming homicidally violent, with their hormones and sex drive also going berserk (and not in any sort of a fun way). The plotline mainly focuses on the residents of one apartment complex, but also carries into the insanity on the streets as well. It's almost a twist on &quot;Night of the Long Knives&quot;, with women as the ones who gang up and take over.One of the more upsetting elements of the story is that families are quickly and completely torn apart. Sons, brothers, boyfriends and husbands have no choice but to defend themselves against the woman they love most in the world, and one of them is going to have to die in almost all these cases. Also, a few rare women are immune, so they have to defend themselves against other women and also men who might think they're a threat.I have yet to talk to a male who has read this book. My husband doesn't read fiction, but if he did, I know this would scare the you-know-what out of him. Come to think of it, with all due respect, I can't imagine any man not being disturbed by this book, for obvious reasons. Men who have an especially moody spouse or close family member...maybe they should read a different title instead. I think women readers will also be scared by a whole different element. Every woman has probably felt on the verge of losing it completely and felt a fear that they might lose control and hurt someone. It's a cliche, but especially during one week of the month. Women know they have this inside them, and the book plays on that fear.Before I read this book, there's a couple pieces of information I already knew from my college majors of Women Studies and Deviant Psychology. One is that both PMS and pregnancy have both been used successfully as a legal defense for murder charges. The other is that women as a rule fight more viciously and nastily than men. &quot;They just want to do the most amount of damage in the shortest time possible, and they'll fight dirtier than any man to do it,&quot; as a Jerry Springer security guard said in an interview when asked who they were most scared of getting between in fights. These facts seemed amusing to me (though not to any men I told) before I read this book, but now I'm not seeing any humor in it at all. It came to my mind over and over while reading &quot;Ladies Night&quot;, and I remember having to shove it to the back of my mind because the book was already scaring the ... out of me enough.If you're a Ketchum fan, this is a must read. It's up there with The Girl Next Door and Off-Season as one of his most disturbing and memorable works. I think that most Ketchum readers will agree that there are scenes or images from these books that have stuck with them and even haunted them for a loooong time. I first read this book years ago, and it still gives me the creeps to think about. Like TGND, I re-read it because the prose and plotline had such a strong, lasting effect on me...and I realized it was just as upsetting, if not more, as the first time. I'll never forget the son fighting desperately for his life against his formerly loving mother, and the ending was one of those that actually jumped out and smacked me in the face. I don't recommend this book for anyone that is easily upset or disturbed, or anyone who is already afraid of women. If you like your horror fast, hard, and nasty, then this is for you. I recommend it strongly for horror fans, both male and female, who want a novel that they'll never forget."},{"Title":"LADIES' NIGHT.","review":"Intrigued by what I had read about the author, inspired by the reviews contained on this website, I couldn't wait to read LADIES NIGHT. And the first of the book doesn't disappoint, as Ketchum masterfully sets the stage for pending disaster, develops the plot and inserts interesting sub-plots of tension and conflict among all of his characters. The table is set for a grand seat-squirmer......and then the book goes over the top. Do you remember the scene from the movie, \\"The Shining,\\" the scene where the elevator doors open and a river of blood comes cascading out to bathe the lobby with gallons and gallons of crimson? Such is the case with LADIES NIGHT, as horror and suspense are carelessly cast aside in favor of mindless gore, gore, and more gore. Halfway through the book the reader becomes so desensitized to all the blood and guts it is impossible to care what happens to the characters. Instead of being wrapped in the story, I found myself chuckling after each grisly scene, asking myself, \\"OK, what kind of mutilation are we going to see next?\\" Ketchum is, if nothing else, imaginative when it comes to chopping, stabbing, smashing, cleaving (insert any verb you want) people to pieces.I take back my earlier statement: this is a seat-squirmer, but only because of the discomfort caused by all the glaring typos and inept editing. (It would appear that the copy editors at Gauntlet have never heard of a comma, colon, or semi-colon.) Save your money if you're wanting a nailbiter: LADIES NIGHT starts off with much promise then fizzles into a bloodsoaked whimper."},{"Title":"LADIES' NIGHT.","review":"pretty crazy book. not very gory as led to believe. still, if you ever are curious to know what would happen if every woman in the world went pyscho, check this book out!!!!"},{"Title":"LADIES' NIGHT.","review":"LADIES NIGHT might not be the most original horror novella, that's for sure, but undoubtable a highly enjoyable splatter epic for gore hounds.Yes, the story is derivative. Author Jack KETCHUM himself admits it in the introduction and freely cites SHIVERS, Canadian horror auteur David CRONENBERG's first horror movie, as his main inspiration. Of course LADIES' NIGHT's thin plot also borrows heavily from other movies, mostly of the ever popular zombie genre (e.g. the ending in particular ripps off NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD). And yes, this is not great literature. If th&iacute;s is what you are looking for, search elsewhere.However this brief novella is hugely entertaining. Okay, the plot is thin - so what? Face it, most horror films or novels aren't that original or new, either. And as far as the poor style other reviewers bemoaned is concerned I actually think that the (intentionally) pulpy style works in the book's favour.Set in New York (which is always a good thing) LADIES' NIGHT's story begins with an horrible traffic accident, which causes a tanker's biohazardous cargo (of course a chemical weapon developed by the military) to escape. A cherry flavoured lollipop smell wafts through the Big Apple's West Side, infecting most women, who turn into homicidal maniacs within hours, attacking every man at random. The book details the desperate attempts of a man to return home to his flat to save his son. Not an easy task, since streets and avenues are full of murderous crazy women, more than willing to kill...While Tom tries to get home, his son has to defend himself against his mother...LADIES' NIGHT is one hell of a gory read! It is no exaggeration when I tell you that after the set-up (around 50 pages) the blood never stops to flow. After the 50 page mark there is rarely a page, often not even a paragraph, without over the top violence and mayhem. A woman throws her baby out of the window, another one takes over an abandoned police car and runs over each man in sight, a black man meets a VERY nasty end at the grill of a fast food restaurant (a scene which will likely cause an aversion against hamburgers for squeamish readers), a female teenager douses her parents with lamp oil and sets them ablaze... The variety of things used to kill, maim, mutilate, and hurt is impressive: of course knives and blades of all kinds, guns, bottles, glasses, baseball bat, fire extinguisher, molotov cocktails, pans (!), cleavers, scalding water, poker, fireplace tongs, TV sets (!), bow and arrow, ice pick, axe,...And in case characters run out of items they could use as weapons they use their bare hands and teeth! The various deaths and injuries are described in all their gory glory. You get the idea.Despite the continous carnage however it never gets repetitive or boring. The story moves at a breakneck pace and the violence never stops. There is also some sex thrown in for good measure (...). There is an apocalyptic feel to LADIES' NIGHT like in the best zombie movies. The use of the New York setting is great and adds to that aforementioned large scale apocalyptic feel.All in all a clear recommendation for gore hounds and fans of extreme horror!"},{"Title":"LADIES' NIGHT.","review":"I've been looking for LADIES NIGHT for several years and finally resorted to doing something I almost never do: buying a book new, at retail. This was worth it.LADIES NIGHT is set in Manhattan during a very short time span. A chemical truck overturns in a residential neighborhood. The driver and a woman in a Buick are killed instantly. Goo spreads over the streets: it smells like cherry lollipops. We don't know exactly what the compound is, but it's nothing nice.That evening the weather is warm and pleasant, but women begin to behave strangely. Soon the streets of the city are soaked with blood as women literally from ages eight to eighty are turned into killing machines with men as their targets.Ketchum sets strict discipline for himself. Some of the women exposed to the toxin were just passing through the city, so they'd be in the suburbs or on their way to other places. Mayhem is probably erupting many miles away, but he has the good sense to limit himself to a small geographic area and let us imagine what's going on elsewhere.Eventually we see the main character, Tom, embark on a quest to redeem himself after being a rotten husband and indifferent father. He needs to travel a few blocks to his apartment to find what condition his wife, Susan, is in and to check on the safety of his teenage son.Ketchum admits the influence of several sources on the story. Obviously, Romero's film NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and Cronenberg's film THEY CAME FROM WITHIN. I was reminded, too, of another of Cronenberg's films from the seventies, RABID.There are lots of unanswered questions that I'd like to know about. As order begins to be restored, the police are told to use their own judgment in shooting any woman on sight if they suspect her to be infected. Would the toxin wear off eventually, or does it completely change brain chemistry? What would be the probability of an antidote? Are there any women who are immune to to unusual estrogen levels or other health conditions?Somewhere there's a 400 page version of this, and I'd love to read it. As is, I'm doing something I very rarely do: I finished LADIES NIGHT at 2 this morning, and today I started over from the beginning.Two warnings before I'd recommend this book to anyone: it is brutally violent. Don't think that this character or that is immune to being slaughtered: that doesn't hold here. And it's not a finished product: there are too many errors that a proofreader should have caught.Darn. There's got to be some way we can get our hands on that 400 page version. Ketchum can advertise it like when the uncut version of Stephen King's THE STAND came out: It's the book THEY wouldn't let you read."},{"Title":"LOVE OF A GOOD WOMAN : STORIES","review":"We all know that there are quite a lot of people who believe that Alice Munro is one of the greatest short story writers alive, and I could not agree with them more. But let me say what I particularly like about Alice Munro, what distinguishes her from other great writers.First of all, there is a unique impression of authenticity. There are certain conventions in fiction about what is regarded as important or interesting; Alice Munro ignores them. She knows that tiny incidents can be the defining ones. She knows that spending a weekend with one's own daughter can be an unbearable challange which almost drives you mad. These stories do not gloss over the mundane aspects of life we have to struggle with most.Second, Alice Munro's stories believe in human dignity and choice. Hers is a moral universe. It's not just the title story which shows us a person making a choice. We tend to just let things happen to us and pretend we cannot do anything about them; these stories show that sometimes we can (but they do not deny that very often we cannot). There is also a great story, &quot;Jakarta&quot;, which implies that such choices are not valid forever; it's not enough to decide against betraying your husband today. The decision may feel momentous, but if you decide otherwise tomorrow it doesn't matter all that much. The problem is, however, and the story shows that too, that when you take those decisions you are very often incapable of feeling their impact.Read these stories! This is a book for grown-ups. It will help you understand the world."},{"Title":"LOVE OF A GOOD WOMAN : STORIES","review":"I have been reading Munro's stories for years and even the profound admiration I had for her work could not prepare me for the force of this collection. It is literally impossible to find a better book. Each one of Munro's stories is worth hundreds of lesser works. The prose is gorgeous, the vision expansive yet percise and humane. Read, &quot;Save the Reaper&quot; last. It is a reworking of American fable and Flannery O'Connor that shows Munro has surpassed even that great American writer."},{"Title":"LOVE OF A GOOD WOMAN : STORIES","review":"In the title story of this collection, Enid, the self-sacrificing practical nurse, is transformed into someone else after she has the sickly and evil Mrs. Quinn as a patient before Mrs. Quinn dies. Without warning, Mrs. Quinn confesses conspiring with her husband to conceal a murder.Up to then, Enid thought of Rupert Quinn as a good man and devoted husband. Does &quot;the love of a good woman&quot; have the power of redemption:? Read the story to get Alice Munro's always astonishing perspective on the subject of goodness.In another fine story from this collection, &quot;Before the Change&quot;, a young woman uses an abortion to test her father and her lover and they both come up short.In &quot;Jakarta&quot;, my personal favorite, Sonje is such a good woman that she takes on the care of her lover's blind mother while Cottar continues a traveling, leftist journalist. But Sonje is not a fool though she may be a saint as her old friend Kent discovers.The collection contains such thought-provoking studies that it could influence the way you live your life."},{"Title":"LOVE OF A GOOD WOMAN : STORIES","review":"Alice Munro is able to convey in twenty pages more character and depth than many people understand about themselves or their loved ones in a lifetime. She allows us to embrace our flaws and accept them with grace and understanding. She is an amazing writer and a voice of humanity to be admired."},{"Title":"LOVE OF A GOOD WOMAN : STORIES","review":"I loved this book. It really makes you think about the underlying motives and loyalties that exist in people. Alice Munro examines the everyday sort of person who must make certain choices and live with it. In reading this book I found myself asking questions and feeling slightly disturbed by my lack of certainty on many issues this book addresses. I love the way she uses language and her use of detail is superb. It will make you think and wonder and imagine all at the same time. What a wonderful writer she is!"},{"Title":"LOVE OF A GOOD WOMAN : STORIES","review":"First, let me say that I'm a huge fan of Munro. Let me say that &quot;Open Secrets&quot; is THE book (okay, one of the books) I recommend to people for books that I love. And most of her early stuff ain't bad either. Let me say that as a way to lighten my negative opinion about this book. I think this book can be summed up by one of the characters in the first story (I'm paraphrasing) who's thinking about how as she got older she realized that life took more than she had and left her with less. (Something to that effect.) These stories read as if this were Munro's problem too, as if she's given her best and now she's still got to give more and she's out of gas. The stories seem tired. Case in point: she replaces the brilliant connections and observations she used to make in a paragraph with ten-fifteen pages of incidentals. So much seems like padding. Anyone has a hard time topping themselves as they get older, granted. And I think it would be hard for any mortal to write a book like &quot;Open Secrets&quot; in the first place, and I think it's doubly tough to try and top that. Frankly, I think she didn't top it this time or get very close. And I don't know if she's trying so hard. Since &quot;Open Secrets&quot; she's had a &quot;Best of&quot;, this collection and the National Book Award. After reading these stories I think the award was given for the body of work she's created and not for the book itself. &quot;The Love of..&quot; feels like a book written to capitalize on someone's reputation and not to capitalize on what lies ahead. And who knows? Maybe she has another &quot;Open Secrets&quot; in her to share. I hope so."},{"Title":"LOVE OF A GOOD WOMAN : STORIES","review":"This must be some of the most beautiful prose I have encountered. I cannot say enough about the way Munro turns a phrase, takes the commonplace to an extraordinary place, uses language. This is not a book to take to the beach -- rather, this is work to be savord for the nuance, the subtlety and the ordinariness-turned-on-its-ear. Buy the book."},{"Title":"LOVE OF A GOOD WOMAN : STORIES","review":"Get this collection simply for The Children Stay, one of themost effective evocations of ache and regret ever set down on paper (and then, because she is Alice Munro, she quickly shows us how ultimately meaningless regret can become in an individual life, given time). In her stories, there are no right or wrong choices, there is no fate, and the stories often extend long past the consequences of her characters' actions, for better or worse, often, whatever they've done, however extreme, they are not punished nor rewarded. They are not saved. The moments of recognition or realization are sterling, perhaps, but not permanent in her characters' lives. They go on."},{"Title":"LOVE OF A GOOD WOMAN : STORIES","review":"I have a hard time reading short stories sometimes, but these were excellent. The first one, which titles the book, is almost a novella, very well crafted. With a murder at the center of the story, you read about how this death has affected different characters, and their take on it. My second favorite story is My Mother's Dream, a very vivid account of family dynamics at a time of loss and happiness.Each one of these stories left me satisfied, with a sense of completion, and that is something i often miss when reading short stories. I highly recommend this excellent work by Alice Munro."},{"Title":"LOVE OF A GOOD WOMAN : STORIES","review":"Alice Munro was recommended to me as a master of the short story form and I was not disappointed. This collection is wonderfully deep and complex - simple and ordinary on the surface but seething with subtle passion beneath.Her ability to shift time and viewpoint is effective and powerful.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"LOVE OF A GOOD WOMAN : STORIES","review":"I am officially obsessed with this book. It is absolute, utter GENIUS and this is the fifth time I am reading it cover to cover. These stories are cinematic, crackling with realness, mysterious and magical. They cast a spell and stay with you long after you've read them. Read them again and again to sift through their many layers and be with their characters who are as real as our family and friends. Thank you Alice Munro!!!"},{"Title":"LOVE OF A GOOD WOMAN : STORIES","review":"All things considered, my favourite fictional narrative is the short story. If you read a novel, you may struggle through a hundred pages before realizing that you have wasted your time. A short story can avoid this dilemma by giving the reader either instant gratification or dissatisfaction. Two universal attributes of a great short story are that they are short and that they tell a story. Anything else is a long narrative.My favorite short story writers are Chekhov, Maupassant with defernce to William Trevor and Penelope LivelyYears ago I read the Moons of Jupiter an earlier collection of Ms. Munroe. They were enjoyable with all the attributes that I look for in a good short story. She has an obvious grasp of human relationships. though the quality that I liked best was the emphasis on choice. Everyone was free to make their own decisions, no Thomas Hardy predeterminism here. The later collection shows a change in technique. Jakarta, Save the Reaper, and Rich as Stink (what a sense of poetry!) are complex stories with frequent shifts of time and place. I find this constant confusion distracting. Please don't abandon the sequential universe!!!There are however many qualities in this collection that I enjoyed. The first episode with children in a small town in the late forties was similar to my own experience in a mining town during the war. Her portrait of the awful Mrs. Quin was masterly and believable. The problem is that I do not think that the linkages of the three seperate events really succeeds. By far the most successful story is the Children Stay. This is about a Canadian Anne Karinina scting out her role while playing in an amature dramatic production of Anouilh's Orpheus. Here we have a woman willing to leave her husband and family to run away with a semi itinerant for immediate sexual passion, which is of only brief duration. I liked the final scene in Rich as Stink wher Karin, wearing the wedding dress of the wife of her mothers lover suffers third degree burns when it catches fire. This is a nice ironic twist as it implies that marriage for Karin is like playing with fire. Meanwhile Anne and Derek (the mothers lover)have resumed their marriage and run of into the sunset.For me Jakarta was the story that provided the most interest. The background and action mostly take place in the sixties. Two couples are used to illustrate the two divergent views of society at that time. Kent and Kathy Mayberry are a conventional careerist couple, Kent being a pharmacist climbing the corporate ladder and Kathy a middle class housewife. Sonia and Cotter are are a counter culture couple. Cotter is a progressive journalist and Sonia the adoring doormat of a wife. The first part trace the friendship of Kathy and Sonia and uses two short stories The Fox by D.H. Lawrence and Kathleen Mansfield's The Bay to show the essential way that these two marriages differ. Kathy sees marriage as an equal partnership though as witnessed in the beach party shes not above having a fling. Sonia is Lawrence's ideal women seeing herself as an adjunct to her husband . She would never cheat on her husband though he openly sleeps with many other woman. The fate of the two couples is interesting. At the end of the story Kent is married to his third wife a girl younger than his daughter . Cotter who disappeared in the late sixties is presumed to have died in Indonesia. We are led to question whether this is genuine or staged. In spite of the implied setup, Sonia still dreams of going to Indonesia to find him. After this event Sonia spends many years looking after Delia Cotter's blind mother. Once a doormat always a doormat.My final thoughts is that when Ms. Munroe sticks to her regular style she is very good at capturing the time and place of an event. When she expands we are confronted with a blizzard of words hiding cryptic clues and at times a meandering narrative. At this point I long for my Chekhov."},{"Title":"LOVE OF A GOOD WOMAN : STORIES","review":"This book is wonderful. Munro packs more into a few pages than most authors get into a full length novel.

It was this Alice Munro book, so I just had to read it. After 3 chapters I couldn't find a logical outcome for the story line and the chapters did not interrelate. I tossed this book. I will always remember it as a book of stories that go nowhere and test your patience along the way.R.S."},{"Title":"LOVE OF A GOOD WOMAN : STORIES","review":"In Munro's Love Of A Good Woman 8 stories set in British Columbia or Ontario involve secrets and choices. Of these 8, only 2 are good. \\"Save The Reaper\\" and \\"My Mother's Dream\\" are the only two stories that have a plot! You know plot? Conflict + Resolution? The other six are just story fragments, offering a smidgen of conflict (someone isn't happy) and smidgen of resolution (a decision is made with no impetus whatsoever put on the results). Yawn. When the conflict is this vague, it does not lend itself well to a short story format. To resolve such character-driven conflicts as these, the stories need room to breathe. Instead these short stories avoid happy and inevitably sit-comish endings or pessimistic endings and are left with only one other option: no ending at all. Maybe this is supposed to be presented as clever or provocative but in my mind it was frustrating. If only they were expanded into individual novels. Who can't come up with conflicts and leave them unresolved? However, Alice Munro's unpretentious dialogue and revealing characters are intriguing and when she uses them in actual complete stories, such as Reaper and Dream, near- perfection is achieved. The only reason I say \\"near\\" is because of a tiny (but huge) disjointed sentence in Reaper. As the grandmother character finds herself out of one perilous situation and into another; sitting next to a prostitute with her grandchildren in the back seat of her car, Munro's preoccupation with sex thrusts the reader back into reality. Momentarily ruining the fantasy. Up to that point, I found my heart beating synchronously with the grandmother- and when the prostitute touches the grandmother's thigh I found myself wondering if things could get any worse. But then I was jarred out of the story altogether. The grandmother was slightly awakened and turned on by the prostitute! Yeah, right! However, I ended up liking the story so much that I'm making an effort to ignore that line (obviously with little success so far). My Mother's Dream at the end was complete perfection (a good note to end on). It had a fully realized plot and no absurd sexual remark. If only the rest of the book was that good."},{"Title":"LOVE OF A GOOD WOMAN : STORIES","review":"I would only recommend this book if you have trouble sleeping at night and need a sedative.

I am a regular reader of short novels published on New Yorker and seems most stories in this book were published there, according to the introduction. I have to admit that I still could not understand why Ms. Munro is such a big figure in North America's modern literature world. The stories are full of too many pieces of ordinariness and dullness, and make you feel the heaviness of your life. Her stories makes you feel like, &quot;Why do I have to read in words about some DULL things I've seen/experienced in my life?&quot; By the way, I've lived in eastern Canada for 9 years and have very warm feeling towards that region.And her writing is also so plain and REGULAR! (I love Peter Mayle's style, by the way, which makes you appreciate English as a language so much.)Perhaps this has nothing to do with Ms. Munro but my personal reading preferences."},{"Title":"LOVE OF A GOOD WOMAN : STORIES","review":"i don't kno"},{"Title":"LOVE OF A GOOD WOMAN : STORIES","review":"This is an amazing collection, arguably Munro's best (but that is saying a lot). Like many of the best short story writers, Munro is fully steeped in localism and vernacular, and while her stories are not as violent as Flannery O'Connor's or as bleak as Raymond Carver's, hers is one that shines a light on unpleasant truths, but ones that reward us with understanding.That Munro is a feminist is unarguable, but one that fights small battles instead of loud ones. Like the last story in this collection, \\"My mother's dream,\\" one gets a genuine sense of what life is like for a woman caught in life almost without choices, and how this reality is passed down to her child. Nowhere have I read a more powerful description of what it is like to be a woman, and if I were one, this story would be my manifesto. It is in the small moments, artless and unguarded, that you taste Munro's bitter world, but one that has an aftertaste that being familiar is ultimately comforting."},{"Title":"LOVE OF A GOOD WOMAN : STORIES","review":"After the first fairly gripping story, the fiction quickly falls into some Alice Mundane prose and it seems like it's going to be that way for the long haul. The author seems to have forgotten the necessity of plot in several stories, and the reader is left dragging along to the end only because of confidence in an otherwise accomplished writer. &quot;Cortes Island&quot; has some worthwhile character development, but &quot;Jakarta&quot; and &quot;Save the Reaper&quot; feel like directionless wandering, as if Munro is playing the grandson's alien chase game with her story development: see a possibility, grab onto it there for a while and see where it goes and then grab onto another. While this technique can certainly be successful and give the image of &quot;living&quot; or &quot;evolution&quot; fiction, it doesn't always work, and these three stories prove it.Furthermore, the &quot;shocking&quot; action of her characters is not believable enough because, despite all the drawn-out development, the reader still can't see the justification in the character's minds. Sure, everyone does the unexpected sometimes, but if all Munro's characters do that, we lose the idea of the story. Pauline, for example, in &quot;The Children Stay,&quot; seems to feel too much devotion and affection for her children to be able to just forget them completely for a wild night of sex that leaves her sore, even though they interrupt her life. Most women find that children interfere with the professional, artistic, social (etc) lives they had before becoming mothers, so what sets Pauline apart to actually be able to leave the girls forever for a romance that turns out to be a fling anyway? Munro didn't prepare us enough for her decision, and the story is weakened.The real genius of her work starts to emerge again, though, with &quot;Rich as Stink.&quot; A mature little girl and her childish mother create an interesting role reversal which must meet its limits finally in a powerful way, when nature takes charge. This story feels glued together with real intrigue, although the purpose and development of the minor characters could have been improved.&quot;Before the Change&quot; is reminiscent of Munro's previous work, with a letter-writing young woman revealing her story to her (ex) lover. Here we see Munro's capability with powerful character development and loose links which neatly connect in the end.Certainly the finest story in the collection is the last-- &quot;My Mother's Dream&quot; was so intricately handled it is worth an award by itself. Munro provides, finally, a more appropriate number of characters for a short story and is able to present and enrich them throughout the work effectively. She brings us into the world of the family here, pulling us in with suspense and connection, making us truly care about the people and hope for them and with them and get completely involved. Finally, as is true of the entire collection as well, Munro does not disappoint us in the end.Just when you were about to say, &quot;She's losing her knack for the great short story form,&quot; she whacks you with three whoppers and whispers, &quot;My dear, I am never too old to tell a great tale.&quot;"},{"Title":"LOVE OF A GOOD WOMAN : STORIES","review":"Alice Munro's stories leave you pondering long after the story has stopped (they never end).

(\\"My Mother's Dream.\\") \\"The Children Stay\\" is horribly cliche, the Munro version of a Lifetime movie. Perhaps the only good stories in this collection are \\"Before the Change\\" and the title story. Go back to stuff she wrote in the Eighties and you will see why she is so renowned for her writing. Here she's just going through the motions."},{"Title":"LOVE OF A GOOD WOMAN : STORIES","review":"Munro's tone and style have only improved with time. The Love of a Good Woman has depth and insight the mark the author's rare voice. A true delight to read, filled with pathos and moments that will cause the reader to smile softly, thinking, &quot;Yes, I know exactly how that feels.&quot; Worth the price and for many, will be a beloved part of a personal library; it stands repeated readings."},{"Title":"LOVE OF A GOOD WOMAN : STORIES","review":"The theme of this short story collection is the various paths that love escorts individuals down. Some of the stories are filled with passion; other nostalgia. The characters vary as the stories vary. Love can be man and woman, mother and daughter, siblings, etc. The stories do not always end happily ever after as the characters dive deeper into morass due to one exposure after another of some dark secrets.Alice Munro has a deserved reputation for some of the best literary works of the nineties. Her current anthology, THE LOVE OF A GOOD WOMAN, overall is a well-written collection, but does not seem to reach the level of excellence set by the author in her previous works. Though several of the eight stories are excellent, some of the tales seem to need constant shock therapy to keep the heart pumping as Ms. Munro reveals one new disjointed surprise after another to keep the story line moving, but only jolts the reader's flow. Overall, this is a fabulous book, but readers need to be aware that it is not on the Munro level of quality.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"LOVE OF A GOOD WOMAN : STORIES","review":"This collection of anachronous, dense short stories intrigued me. As a first-time Munro reader, I at first found it difficult to appreciate the patterns, details, and lack of plot. Eventually,however, a common thread develops and the reader is drawn in to these dream-like stories. &quot;Save the Reaper&quot;, contrary to what other reviews might say, is the jem of the collection. The look exchanged between the little boy and the grandmother near the end make this story the central story around which the others revolve. The understanding look that says, &quot;Don't worry, I'll keep your secret&quot; provides a central theme for the collection. &quot;The Love...&quot; provides portraits of secrets, the uncertainty of the thoughts and actions of loved ones, and the burden that comes with this knowledge. A must-read for someone learning to get past looking for a plot."},{"Title":"LOVE OF A GOOD WOMAN : STORIES","review":"The title story alone is worth the price of admission. It's like Agatha Christie on acid: A murder mystery told from several different points of view, but a murder mystery in the same sense that \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\" is a murder mystery. \\"Jakarta,\\" with its jarring time-shift, is also a memorable story. Alice Munro paints a vivid if often bleak canvas of provincial Canadian life, and each of her short stories contains the depth of character and density of plot that you'd ordinarily find in a novel."},{"Title":"LOVE OF A GOOD WOMAN : STORIES","review":"Just read it and you will know for sure how astounding a writer can be. Try it and you will not regret it."},{"Title":"LOVE OF A GOOD WOMAN : STORIES","review":"It has to admitted right up front that this is not a book I would ever have chosen to read on my own. However, as it was a selection for our bookgroup, I plowed in, and unlike many others in the group, finished it. Now, I'm sure that there is a demographic somewhere, for whom these eight stories really resonate and connect with -- but it sure isn't me. Set in the mid-1940s through the 1980s, the stories (five of which were first published in The New Yorker) take place in Munro's own milieu: Ontario and and British Columbia.In general, they are about everyday life and the quiet desperate struggles that go on in ordinary lives, and are thematically bound by a sense of disappointment. Indeed, this is not a book to give to the newly affianced, filled as it is with dissolving marriages and forlorn women (good luck finding a positive male character anywhere in the pages). Repeatedly in these stories, the reader is confronted with women whose lives have not evolved the way they had expected or desired. Now, this is certainly a truth in life, but the stories all start to run together after a while. And when there is an incident that stands out, it feels unbelievable. For example, one story climaxes with a girl getting set on fire, another has a moment where a grandmother feels a sexual frisson when touched on the leg by a young woman, another has a daughter unwittingly talking to her father's corpse, another has a loving mother abandon her children, and so on. In each case, a tale of the problems of ordinary life is suddenly turned into melodrama with a jarring change of pace.Certainly Munro is a skilled craftswoman, her prose is clearly labored over with great care and precision, but that only gets you so far. None of the characters are particularly interesting or compelling, and one is hard-pressed to care about their respective situations. There's a wan fatalism holding them all down, and that makes for gloomy reading. It might be that coming across them over time in The New Yorker, they'd feel a little more individual, but when collected, it feels like a one note concert. It should be noted that the title story is a bit different, much longer and much more scattered in style, it's also much more interesting. The last story is also stands out, as it is the only one that offers a sense of hope or happiness, which is probably why it was placed at the end of the book. So, while Munro does have a dab hand at description, the lack of interesting people in the stories and the uniformity of tone leave me unlikely to recommend this collection to anyone I know."},{"Title":"LOVE OF A GOOD WOMAN : STORIES","review":"Once again Alice Munro reveals her exquisite knowledge of the less stellar human qualities.

Munro can certainly tell a story. The only criticism I have is that occassionally she jumps around in time so I was not sure where I was - but it all eventually comes together.

However, one frequently overlooked form of communication with the aliens consists primarily of that most simple of methods: voice contact, or &quot;conversation&quot; by means of opening one's mouth and speaking. In &quot;Other Voices,&quot; the story of a small group of people and their brave attempt to establish a link with aliens they assumed to be benevolent Space Brothers, the idea of communication by means of the spoken word is explored and produces some surprising results.&quot;Other Voices&quot; is essentially a reprint of a book entitled &quot;The Saucers Speak,&quot; by George Hunt Williamson and Alfred Bailey. Originally published in the 1950s, it still has a great deal of relevance to today's UFO scene. Much of what the authors prophesy has indeed come to pass, and the warning the aliens send about nuclear war and environmental doom is still as urgent as it ever was in spite of the thawing process that the Cold War has undergone in recent years.Williamson and Bailey, according to Timothy Green Beckley's new and updated introduction, &quot;were ham radio operators who claimed contact with extraterrestrial beings who were continually broadcasting messages to them from spaceships circling in the Earth's uppermost atmosphere. At the time, these authors came under fairly heavy verbal attack as the mere idea that aliens were setting foot on our world seemed a much more remote concept than it might now be considered in this day and age.&quot;Times may not have changed as much as Beckley would hope. Ridicule continues to be the norm for witnesses who come forward with tales of contact with aliens. Even further, Williamson and Bailey are clearly examples of what was called in the 1950s &quot;contactees,&quot; a term that today is shunned by even the mainstream UFO community and is understood to mean people on the outer edges of the lunatic fringe.But &quot;Other Voices&quot; still manages to reach impressive levels of credulity. The authors at one point say that the aliens instruct them to project their own thoughts onto the message to a lesser degree, implying that the human mind tends to cloud the transmission. That looks very much like a telltale realistic detail that separates alien intent from the &quot;psycho-babble&quot; of mere mortals.At another juncture, the authors say that the young people of their time are beginning to be schooled in the true doctrines of the aliens, receiving a message about peace, love and brotherhood. That statement, first made in the early 1950s, seems uncanny when one recalls the blossoming of the Flower Children in the next decade, armed with their message of pacifism that could conceivably really have come from outer space because it was so alien to the mindset of America's youth prior to those times.Beckley's introduction also recounts numerous other instances of radios and televisions being jammed with strange voices speaking messages about impending doom, so it is apparent that the phenomenon continues unabated to the present day. While &quot;Other Voices&quot; serves on one level as a refreshing bit of 1950s contactee nostalgia, it also stands the test of time and continues to breathe life into the idea that radio and television voice contact with the Space Brothers may one day be the method by which their existence is finally proven and the deliverance they promise is actually realized."},{"Title":"Other Voices","review":"As another reviewer noted, this is a reprint of THE SAUCERS SPEAK by George Hunt Williamson and Alfred J. Bailey, from 1954. Williamson was one of the more unusual figures to emerge during the classic era of \\"saucer contactees\\" in 1952 - 57. He became a follower of pioneering contactee George Adamski in 1952, but the two soon broke up because Williamson insisted on continuing his own contacts with friendly space aliens, via Ouija board, instead of depending on cult leader Adamski to provide the Space Brothers' latest opinions on everything.I never met Adamski or his competitors such as Truman Bethurum and Daniel Fry, but those who did told me that if you spent much time with these guys, the mask would sooner or later drop and they'd say something like, \\"can you believe that people really believe this stuff?!?\\" Williamson would never have had such a moment. You can still purchase on the Internet a CD of him \\"channeling space-alien Hatton in the Sol-Tec language, giving the history of the legendary planet, Maldek.\\" He's completely serious! You can see him beginning to invent this semi-comical \\"language\\" in the book under review here, except that he calls it the \\"Solex Mal.\\"Much is made in the book's introduction, and in another introduction by T. G. Beckley, of short-wave Morse code radio communications with space aliens, but in fact essentially all the communications reported in this book are via a home-made Ouija board. The board messages make a bit of sense, although they manifestly have nothing to do with space aliens and a lot to do with gentle competition between Williamson and Bailey as they moved the water-glass \\"planchette\\" around a hand-drawn pattern of letters and numerals on cardboard. It's a good thing there are so few \\"radio contacts,\\" since they tend to go like \\"SR AGFA AWA PERI K-4 K-4 PERI AFFA AGFA ZO PERI.\\"Williamson's aliens have about the same messages as Adamski's aliens, or Adamski himself in books of \\"wisdom\\" he wrote in the 1930s. All the planets of the solar system are earthlike, the sun is not hot, all \\"space aliens\\" are completely human, and all are good Christians, but they seem to know a lot of Theosophy as well. And they are convinced that the human race will destroy itself in an atomic war before the 1950s are out.The author of the first \\"introduction,\\" Beckley, doesn't seem to have read the book closely, because he retells the urban legend of Marconi picking up mysterious radio signals \\"from Mars,\\" apparently unaware that within the text Williamson tells a totally incompatible variant of the same legend.I'll save for last the thing that had me rolling on the floor with laughter. Perhaps the most famous line in the 1950 movie THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL is the message from alien Klaatu to robot Gort, something like \\"Klaatu barada nikto.\\" Williamson and Bailey don't turn a hair when they get a message from \\"Zago of Contact Group\\" that goes, in Solex, \\"Udum Regan Vec Yonto Nictim Barraga.\\" No report as to whether Gort received the order, or what he then did!"},{"Title":"Other Voices","review":"THIS HAS TO BE ONE OF THE MOST FANTASTIC ADVENTURES INTO THE UNKNOWN. . .Until recently, I didnt realize that there was a copy of OTHER VOICES still in print. A collector of Ufo and New Age books -- a good friend of mine -- had told me about reading some of the works of the late researcher George Hunt Williamson. I was familiar with the fact that Williamson was one of the purported witnesses to the famous contact between contactee George Adamski and the space being identified as Orthon in Adamski's FLYING SAUCERS HAVE LANDED book.I was immediately turned on to this volume because I remember over a decade ago I was in North Carolina visiting relatives in the small town of Lumberton when a strange things began to happen. Mysterious voices were being picked up on the radio, tv sets and even over the telephone. The voices was very mechanical soundling -- like a computer (if anyone knew what a computer was back then). The voice always said the same thing -- something about how it was circling over head in a space craft -- and it would be about the same time at night that the voice would start talking, repeating the same thing over and over again.I read an article by editor Timothy Green Beckley that he wrote for the now defunct SAGA magazine, about how even astronauts were hearing such voices on their closely monitored wave bands only open to NASA communications. Who is behind these OTHER VOICES? And what are they really trying to say? Williamson tells his own story matter of factly, and Beckley tries to make the most of what is seemingly happening.Voices talking to us from out of thin air are nothing new. Read LOST JOURNALS OF NIKOLA TESLA and other such volumes if you want background into this type of material.

It's argument for, on the one hand, a rethinking of \\"race\\" as a fixed category of socio-cultural identity while also interrogating the continuing existence of racism is hardly new in the early 21st century. Yet, this book may well be the best current humanistic monological presentation of these ideas. In this regard, it provides a welcome antidote to reactionary \\"end of race\\" or \\"end or racism\\" debates that have arisen among both black progressives and conservatives alike. Well done."},{"Title":"After Race: Racism After Multiculturalism","review":"Darder and Torres's book makes a simple yet powerful claim: \\"race\\" is an ideological construct that progressives must dismantle and debunk if they are to understand and to combat the racism that continues to damage society. The book thoughtfully explores the colonialist and pseudo-scientific genesis of the ideology of \\"race\\" and argues that, while the term \\"race\\" has no actual referent, the term \\"racism\\" most certainly does: processes of racialization continue to reproduce oppressive structures in the United States, even as the major institutions of that society claim to embrace diversity and multiculturalism. In an accessible yet highly sophisticated way, the book delineates both contemporary political impasses and ways forward for progressive thought and action."},{"Title":"After Race: Racism After Multiculturalism","review":"This book clearly calls for a serious engagement of racism, within the context of the deep economic impoverishment still experienced by working class communities of color in the United States. The issue here is not that \\"race\\" does not matter, but rather that it is not the color of one's skin that should be the central or sole focus of our struggle! Rather, the actual problem is the disgraceful manner in which racism and other inequalities are perpetuated within an unruly political economy. Racism here refers to the inherent structures and systematic relationships of power within institutions and society, predicated across a variety of differences, including \\"race\\", to disempower and undermine communities of color. The truth is that this is a book that must be carefully read, particularly those chapters that contend with linguistic genocide, the destructive impact of neoliberal testing policies on student's lives, or the deep historical ideologies that created the current social conditions---conditions where the intellectual abilities and capacities of entire populations are collectively signified within schools and institutions by the color of our skin.The manner in which the media spun racialized rhetoric within President-elect Obama's campaign, well-illustrates that racism is still alive and well in the U.S. Not to mention that, in no way, does Barack Obama's presidency mean that the quality of life has fundamentally improved for the majority of people of color who live in the lower economic rungs of U.S. capitalist society and all those whose economic well-being has plummeted in the last decade. Lastly, the authors' long histories as serious, engaged scholars and activists belie any reading of this text as \\"neo-conservative propaganda\\" or \\"neoliberal (talking heads) scholarship,\\" given that the book is a formidable critique of precisely those political traditions and how their disabling policies of inequality manifest themselves within racialized educational institutions. Moreover, the central message of the text is this: We cannot fight racism, outside of a serious and sustained critique of capitalism and its gross inequalities. And as such, racism must be understood beyond simply race relations or notions of psychological dislikes or fears of skin color, but rather as sustained social and political oppression, intimately linked to the control of material conditions within this society and around the world."},{"Title":"After Race: Racism After Multiculturalism","review":"Basically this is neo-conservative propaganda disguised as neo-liberal scholarship, in my opinion it is not helpful if you want to develop a full understanding of the role important race still plays in America...it basically dismisses that it matters anymore, an argument that unqualified talking heads are fond of but that pretty much every other credible academic that has any expertise in the issue has dismissed."},{"Title":"American Streamliner: Prewar Years","review":"This is a great resource book for your railroad library if you are interested in the streamlining era. If, like me, you custom paint model trains, then this book is even more important because of all the color photos it contains.

Written in 1926 about pioneers in microbiology, it covers only the earliest achievements in the field. At the time of writing, penicillin was still two years away from being discovered by Alexander Fleming. The diphtheria vaccine had just been invented. But as a history book about the early days of microbiology, this book has yet to be surpassed. And this is why this book is so great. These diseases are scary when you read about the symptoms and perhaps people have forgotten how scary they are, resulting in the vaccine avoidance we unfortunately see today. The book was very thoroughly researched and written in very plain, very understandable language. Sometimes the author Paul de Kruif would put words into the microbiologists' mouths, such as stating what they must have been thinking at a certain time. But this just added to the fabric of the story. Unfortunately, some wording is now considered racist, but this was very minor given the context of the book.

Nevertheless, I'll always remember how scientifically inspiring it was for me to read Microbe Hunters for the first time (and many years have passed since then). De Kruif has a talent for dramatizing the actions, thoughts and discoveries of the scientists, making them think out loud on the pages, and giving the book a feel that is more like entertaining fiction than the history of science.Although I loved reading this book, I agree with the previous reviewer who advises that we should \\"...be aware that the author shares the racial and social biases of his time and class (mid 1920's)\\" as the book is marred by some passages that are (to say the least) objectionable in this respect, and highly distasteful by today's standards. This is a real shame, because were it not for such racial slurs this book would otherwise have been well suited to young people with an interest in science. Because of these issues, I don't recommend this as a book for kids. If you are among those who can overlook these shortcomings (at least temporarily, while reading the book), and take the book for what it is (i.e. a product of the very different times in which it was written), you will likely enjoy the spirited writing style that de Kruif uses so adeptly in portraying the history of microbiology.This book has been in print for an impressive length of time, especially considering the fact that the topic is science. I believe that major reasons for its longstanding popularity include that de Kruif used great storytelling techniques which allowed him to engage a broad audience of scientists and non-scientists alike in reading and enjoying Microbe Hunters.

It is a wonderful book for anyone to read; certaijnly not designed for kids primarily.

I had read Microbe Hunters and so knew the effects of chemical drugs on the human body were usually disasterous. They dont work for long and they have horrendous side effects. I had to return to the hospital because getting into my own bed didnt have the therapudic effect I had hoped.I did get better in the hospital. I went home and back to work in two weeks. The doctors were astounded. They believed lithium had saved a person from a life of insanity.In 18 moths I had to stop taking lithium. I had mind blowing abdominal pain and uncontrolable bowel movements from it. My doctir insisted if I stopped taking it my mania would return full blown. Plus I would have withdrawl symptoms. In short he said i would lose my mind and they wouldnt be able to get me back.The lithium would have killed me so after a few months I secretly stopped taking it. My symptoms didnt come back. I didnt have withdrawl problems.Lithium had nothing to do with my recovery. My psychosis was triggerd by losing 30 pounds in a month. That wasnt on psychiatrys radar screen. I gained the weight back and the problem NEVER RETURNED. I was told I would never work again and the episodes would recur one or twice a year for the rest of my life.They didnt.Schizophrenia runs in my family. Both my father and his mother were diagnosed with it. Their lives were ruined by the medical process of the time used to treat it.Mine hasnt been.Thankyou, Microbe Hunters!Oh the racist thing.

It also includes some racial slurs that pop up out of nowhere--standard for the time, I'm sure, but startling and offensive nonetheless.Despite this, the book is a fast and interesting read, and provides a good deal of color for scientists whom most of us previously regarded as dry and distinguished. I don't know how much liberty he takes in building these characters, but I will now never forget Leeuwenhoek.The book ends with Paul Ehrlich in the early 20th century, so the past hundred years of infectious disease research obviously isn't covered. It's definitely a fun look at the history of science and disease, however, and I recommend it for anyone interested in the topic."},{"Title":"Microbe Hunters","review":"I am amazed at the positive reviews. I purchased this book for a \\"nostalgia trip,\\" recalling that it was one of my favorite books in early adolescence, in a small, rural town, a high school with a marginal library, and few books in the science section. Upon reading it again, I was appalled at the poor quality of writing. No only is it clearly prejudiced, it is inexcusably so, even for 1926. That de Kurif did not later revise it to reflect a more objective perspective and a more lucid treatment seems inexcusable. Certainly, underneath the awkward prose and inexcusably obscure vocabulary there lies interesting recounts of scientific exploration, but for such a \\"classic,\\" a revision would have certainly been in order. Though I struggled through it, I am sure that in my youth I found it even more frustrating, underlying content notwithstanding. As a retired teacher, I would never suggest it to any young reader."},{"Title":"Microbe Hunters","review":"I first read this book when I was in grammar school (K-6 level)and found it absolutely fascinating. I couldn't put it down. As a graduate of UC-Berkeley (BA, MS in biology), I highly recommend it not only to aspiring scientists, but to all who enjoy 'mysteries' - true life mysteries! When I was a med student at Albany Medical College, we took physiology and pharmacology in the &quot;T-Smith&quot; building. Theobald Smith was a grad of AMC. You will find his story here in &quot;Ticks and Texas Fever&quot;. My copy is falling apart, but I consider it an old friend. It is one book that should be in everyone's library.

To this day, I feel this book did more in promoting good handwashing techniques than all my nursing instructors ever could. I was thrilled to find the book still accessible through Amazon.

A great addition for any science or medical buff! Also enjoyable but a little more tough to read &quot;The Hot Zone&quot; and &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot; and &quot;The Comming Plauge&quot;.

But come on, these scientists risked their lives and very often died trying to cure the sick in Africa. So can we can cut them a little slack for not being as gloriously enlightened as us, even if they were infintely braver ?People familiar with biethics or medicine will see a world where many ethical questions that had not been defined.

Part of our reading materials were The Hot Zone, Demon In The Freezer, and this wonderful book I've just finished, Microbe Hunters.Never have I read such wonderful books one right after the other. After I finished each one, I thought that one was the best book on microbes. They are all wonderful in their own ways, but this book on how it all started is endearing in that it was written so long ago (1926). When the author speaks of something happening in the 1890's, that's over a hundred years ago to us, but was just yesterday to the author.Today, we think of ourselves as medically advanced and very knowledgeable in science. However, one hundred years from now they will look at our methods and shake their heads in wonder at how we could have done such silly things. Likewise, we wonder about microbe hunters of 100 years ago. But we would be wise to understand the baby steps they all had to take to get us where we are today.This is truly a remarkable book on the history of how we got to where we are today. If only De Kruif could have written a similar book that takes us from 1926 until today. Alas, he died in 1971, having left us with a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Microbe Hunters","review":"&quot;The Microbe Hunters&quot; charts the amazing shift in medical knowledge from both the historical and philisophical viewpoints. Dr. de Kruif's genius lies in the fact that he can transform the highly technical jargon of medicine into a compelling story of men versus nature. It is very readable!He maps the course that men such as Pasture and Koch blazed into the realm of scientific methodology that is still revered today. You will feel the heat of the battle as the individuals depicted herein challenged the conventional wisdom of their day and transformed medicine from superstition to a healing art.I was first introduced to the book in a class on microbiology, but obtained a true education in how curiosity, dedication and perserverance on the part of a few pioneers changed our view of nature forever. This book is a must read for anyone wanting to undrstand numan nature or the strange and wonderful word of pathogens. As a college professor I recomend this book to anyone who wants to find the inspiration for education in one book."},{"Title":"Microbe Hunters","review":"I read this book as a child and it was fascinating reading. Some of what is described is still current (Pasteur's rabies vaccine) while some treatments are long out of use (Ehrlich's \\"magic bullet\\" for syphillis was actually derived from arsenic and had a fair amount of side effects-an accurate cure would not be developed until the discovery of Penicillin). Also some of the attitudes taken by the writer are racist such as the quip along the lines that \\"you couldn't tell the Africans with sleeping sickness apart from the healthy ones because they were all lazy\\". This should remind people of the dichotomy that existed in society then. Also biology then was like a manic gold rush. There were no restrictions on testing medicenes so that famous scientific figures would test the treatments on friends, family or if they were brave, themselves. One thing that was strongly prevalent then was the optimism of a cure for the various diseases. There was no sense of a pharmeceutical industry trying to quickly bring to market a highly profitable drug, whether or not it was safe or effective or even more than slightly different from other medications. There was no sense of cynicism then. Once the germ theory was developed, people realized what lived amidst their world and sought to find ways to have people live better and healthier lives. So you can dismiss some of the outdated attitudes and ideology and see this book as specimen on a microscope slide, frozen in time, to be examined from a new perspective"},{"Title":"Microbe Hunters","review":"We already owned one copy of Microbe Hunters but lent it out to a friend of ours who teaches high school science -- so we needed another copy. Microbe Hunters was recommended to me when I was interviewing a girl for a job at Borders bookstore. I asked her to tell me about her favorite book and she talked about Microbe Hunters with such passion that I HAD to find a copy.This is a great book to give to students of all ages who express a great deal of interest in biology, microbiology, medicine, or general history. The individual biographies are engaging and exciting as we travel with scientists through the breakthroughs in exploration of some of the smallest of our Earth's inhabitants.It should be noted to modern readers, and this is covered in the book's forward, that De Kruif uses some language and stereotypes that are unacceptable in modern society. In one of the last chapters in particular, De Kruif describes free black men as \\"negroes\\" and refers to them as belonging to someone else. He also describes black people as lazy. This only occurs briefly, but can still be a jarring while reading. With a concerted effort to understand (but not excuse) the author's social misunderstanding while not discounting the otherwise observant narrative, the racial issues do not ruin or overly detract from the amazing book.I highly recommend Microbe Hunters."},{"Title":"Microbe Hunters","review":"Because so many eminent researchers point to this book as an inspiration, I was excited to read it. I was quite disappointed that the author is more than just a little racist. In the text, the noble white man saves the ignorant black, brown and yellow man described by the most vulgar of epithets. De Kruif may be a man of his time, but the attitude is nonetheless disturbing. I was also surprised that for an otherwise scholarly approach, De Kruif uses the words virus, bacterium and microbe interchangeably.

Then again, there's a good chance you won't unless you want to do something tricky. Negus walks you through, step by step, how to configure Red Hat/Fedora for pretty much anything it's capable of doing, albeit a ***basic*** configuration.Advice for beginners. If you are a Microsoft user, stay a Microsoft user unless you have a compelling reason to change (money and stability are usually the two best reasons to change - and stability is debatable with XP), are comfortable with computers, are willing to read your butt off, and don't need specific applications that are only written for Microsoft. Always remember: ***in general***, computers do not make money. They just don't. They ***usually*** just make doing whatever it is you do to make money easier, i.e., they save time.

The explanantions are logical, ordered and actually work really well. In addition there are tips and windows how-tos for connecting windows to various Fedora provided services such as file servers, print servers and so on.I am really impressed with this book because it just what the average tinkering user wishing to escape the grip of Microsoft needs to get underway and free from closed source, proprietary OS's that cost jumbo dollars...for $35 you get a really robust, excellent OS (I run it on 2 computers: 1 file/print/database server and 1 desktop) that is fun to play around with and explore as well as 1100 pages of explanations on how to do most of things you'll probably ever need to do (some linux documentation can be obscure and not overly useful if you have to wade thru masses and masses of HTML pages looking for an explanation). It's not guru depth stuff for the most part, but puts you well and truly on the correct path to guru-ness if you wanna go that way. or alternatively, is a just plain excellent if you wanna enjoy a life free of Microsoft (it's a good feeling...!) I have both this and running Linux, O'Reilly (isbn 0596002726), and personally I think this is significantly better value because of its clear content, breadth and depth, clarity in explaining how to do things and you get the OS with it!So come on...buy it, try it, take control of your PC away from Microsoft and put it back into your hands. Christopher Negus has a lot to tell us and teach us...This book assumes nothing about your prowess or familiarity with PC's. If you can read and follow 10 step procedures, then you're in business. Sure, there are some pages on linux games, the desktop,publishing and multimedia and such that I consider a bit obvious, but they still cater for the total newbie I guess. So they can't be bad...but the remainer is all good stuff: particularly the 200-400 page sections on administering fedora, network and server set up. Masterful!Overall: an excellent book that is well written, clear, concise, intertesting and a gateway to opening up your vision to a truly fine OS: Fedora.

Unfortunately that's the truth. What you get here is a bunch of stuff. For one thing, you get the operating system itself. And while you can download the coftware free, you'd better be prepared for a pretty long wait, at 56K about a hundred hours for the four 650 MB image disks.I say \\"introductory\\" because there are so many subsidiary packages included in the basic Linux distribution and these can be treated only superficially. For instance MySQL gets about 35 pages. This is enough to get the software up and running, and a little bit about the SQL language. But you're not going to be a power SQL programmer after just 35 pages, you've only touched the surface. And of course each other big area (Apache Web Server, Mail Server, LDAP and a whole lot of other sets of initials) has it's own set of books to expand on what's here.But you've got to start somewhere, and here's a good place.

It does a fine job of portraying the plants in your garden as wild and raunchy, not to mention absolutely unscrupulous in the pursuit of their goals. The author, Angela Overy, is absolutely shameless in her presentation --although, for the record, she does not cross the line into pornography: The occasional bras advertisement, and a strategically placed lily on page 47, but nothing worse than what you might see between the covers of Cosmopolitan.The book, by the way, is more an overview of propagation strategies than a detailed analysis of physiology. She does go through the naming of parts and the basics of sexual maturation in plants, but then veers off into the politics of inter-species cooperation. Namely, how plants blackmail, bribe, and proposition birds, bees, beetles, ants, slugs, and butterflies (to name a few) in order to ensure successful cross pollination.This book covers quite a bit of ground in its own irreverent way. It's got some interesting pictures depicting the color perceptions of several common pollinators, some very interesting material on Plan B strategies for pollination, and whole lot of really fascinating trivia. The juxtaposition of perceptions about plants and human sexuality is definitely attention grabbing, but it's the captions, which range from frankly informative to ludicrously suggestive, that make this book worth the cover price."},{"Title":"Sex in Your Garden","review":"This is an amusingly written book with a catchy title.

I think that this book could be excellent as a way to introduce younger students to the whole idea of sex and plants, or plant sexuality if you will. This subject is one that needs to be understood much better than it is now. Unlike most botany texts on the subject, this one is in plain English and it is fun to read. Hard core plant scientists may object to its tone and some of the wording, but I don't think it was intended for them in the first place. I expect that this book would be a good tool for getting students from grade 7-12 interested in some basic botany. Actually though, it would be informative for all of us &quot;grown ups&quot; too. I'm the author of Allergy-Free Gardening, from Ten Speed Press, and am especially interested in plant sexuality as it relates to allergies.

Christopher S. Wren, former New York Times correspondent did just that. Upon retirement, he strode out of New York City and made his way to his home in Vermont via the meandering Appalachian Trail. Along the way, he kept company with a motley crew of other travelers, ominous black SUVs, mosquitoes and his memories. This isn't just a travelogue of sights along the way, though, it's a layered story of a man's life at a turning point, weaving remembrances (some harrowing) from a long life lived in many foreign places into the new, unfolding story of a man who is no longer what he was.It's not to be confused with Travels with Charley, John Steinbeck's wonderful tale of travel across the country with his trusty poodle. Steinbeck was in search of his country's identity, but Christopher Wren's goal is more personal -- he's searching for his new self.Wren's self-designed rite of passage fulfills the requirement of all such rites: redefinition. He begins his journey as a man at the end of a professional life, graduating into a gray, undefined role as &quot;retiree&quot;. He emerges from the trail with a deep understanding of the meaninglessness of such titles and the resilience of human character.The editorial reviews above mention that the book will be appreciated by hikers and lovers of &quot;off beat adventures&quot;, etc. I think the book will be appreciated by anyone who wants to understand better how to be an adult and, last time I checked, that was everybody."},{"Title":"Walking to Vermont: From Times Square into the Green Mountains -- a Homeward Adventure","review":"Christopher Wren's walk is relatively short and tame compared to others who have written of trekking. Despite the lack of dangers, Wren's observations are interesting, humorous and educational. His editorial comments were keen and moved the book along by mixing daily events and thoughts in just the right doses.The book did bog down along the Appalachian Trail (just like most long walks bog down at points). Overall, the book is an enjoyable, educational, easy read and well worth the time I invested in it."},{"Title":"Walking to Vermont: From Times Square into the Green Mountains -- a Homeward Adventure","review":"I have yet to hike the Appalachian trail, and I'm only 41, but I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The author has some wisdom well worth sharing, as well as a very candid view of his experience. I didn't feel he was in denial at all. Rather, he was realizing that 65 isn't so old, after all. This book is about the physical AND emotional journey into retirement. If you are interested in human nature as well as mother nature, chances are you will enjoy it. I gave it 5 stars to make up for some of those 2 star submissions. I've given it to my Mom, who has read it and enjoyed it and plans to give it to my sister. I wouldn't be surprised if it makes it's way to my Dad after that ... Enjoy."},{"Title":"Walking to Vermont: From Times Square into the Green Mountains -- a Homeward Adventure","review":"This book started out slow, but it really picks up and is an interesting read, especially when the author hits the Appalachian Trail. I found it hard to put down the book at that point."},{"Title":"Walking to Vermont: From Times Square into the Green Mountains -- a Homeward Adventure","review":"\\"Walking to Vermont\\" is a worthy addition to anyone who collects, reads, and enjoys books on the culture of walking. I especially enjoyed it because it is also a worthy addition to literature related to the Appalachian Trail, and sits on my bookshelf besides Bryson's \\"A Walk in the Woods\\", Emblidge's \\"Appalachian Trail Reader\\" and Hall's \\"A Journey North.\\"This is not a book of discovery -- Mr. Wren knows who he is and is comfortable in his own shoes (but perhaps not his socks). The story reads like both a narrative and a memoir, as Mr. Wren recounts events and stories collected in a life as a foreign correspondent.Fans of the Appalachian Trail and of the literature associated with it will be very familiar with the themes: trail magic, trail angels, trail names, and the wonderful people that make up the hiking culture.I have been to the Hanover Ben and Jerry's and have never had a \\"White Blaze.\\" I will protect my source on who informed me about it, however..."},{"Title":"Walking to Vermont: From Times Square into the Green Mountains -- a Homeward Adventure","review":"A good book for those who are interested in nature, human and otherwise. At age 65, this New York Times foreign correspondent walks out of the Times building and just keeps on walking. Four hundred miles and five weeks later, he is at home in Vermont. This book chronicles the ups and downs, humanly and geographically, as he hoofs his way on New York city streets, over highways, under bridges, through towns and villages, over the Appalachian Trail, arriving home just in time to feed the cats. Henry David Thoreau is his philosophical mentor as he ponders things like the best way to carry a backpack, filter your water, boil your oatmeal, keep the mosquitoes away, pamper aches and pains, and decide upon a suitable trail name. Along the way he meets an interesting variety of fellow travelers, most walking for reasons that go way beyond just exercise. Civilization is never far away, and the author meets up occasionally with his wife and friends, when he forsakes the Daniel Boone lifestyle for that of the aging jet-setter dining in an exclusive restaurant. He admits that after these respites he is glad to hit the lonely trail again. During the book the reader is treated to gentle flashbacks that reveal Wren's adventurous career as a reporter in Russia, China, the Middle East, and other exotic locales. These recollections seem a bit shoehorned in, but they are necessary to understand how far the author has come. After what he has seen in his life, a hike of four hundred miles is just a walk in the woods. Those like me who are generally the same age as Wren will find the book a nice reminder that we're not over the hill yet. Wren says, \\"Life seems sweeter once you accept that it cannot endure. The best part of growing old is that welcome relief from being merely young.\\" Great stuff for a graying head! Upon finishing the book, I went out for a good, long walk. But I'll be back for supper."},{"Title":"Walking to Vermont: From Times Square into the Green Mountains -- a Homeward Adventure","review":"I would call this a quiet book; pleasant storytelling with rippling rhythms of then and now. The author is a retired N.Y. Times foreign correspondent who attends his retirement party in Manhattan and then the next day starts walking to Vermont (near Hanover) where he is going to live. He walks on the Appalachian Trail where the distance is almost 400 miles and he accomplishes this in 5 weeks moving through 5 states. He tells of his experiences while on the trail with frequent interjections of incidences overseas while doing his work for his newspaper. I feel he could have elaborated more about his overseas experiences as they were interesting, but they took up from one paragraph to one page...oh well, I guess that is another book. He meets some interesting characters on the way, but because of the nature of his quest, nothing is permanent. I thought he hiked in a most sensible manner as every so often he would rent a motel/cabin, get a good meal in a local cafe, and take a shower/bath to clean off all the accumulated crud, and stop in to see past friends in their homes (which were on the way) and stay for a day or two. He accomplished lhis goal and derived great satisfaction in doing so and then wrote a book about it."},{"Title":"Walking to Vermont: From Times Square into the Green Mountains -- a Homeward Adventure","review":"Living the vicinty of NYC, i am always amazed at the people i see every day.

The authors ability to bring his past ventures in to simular standing is also a great asset to the books adventures. We all want to know how it comes about."},{"Title":"Walking to Vermont: From Times Square into the Green Mountains -- a Homeward Adventure","review":"By Bill Marsano. I wanted to like this book. I too am a walker, enlisted in the non-combat infantry. Of a proximate age to Wren, I walk all over Manhattan, weekly crossing the Brooklyn Bridge just for breakfast; I have walked in Tuscany and Liguria and on Cornwall's windy, sea-banged coast.But this is not a book about walking, however much one-foot-in-front-of-the-othering occurs therein. It is about the change of life called retirement, and it is rooted in denial.The author, age 65, has retired as a foreign correspondent for the New York Times. He refuses to be a retiree who can't let go, who hangs around to see &quot;how things are going at the office.&quot; So far, so good; but I really got no clear idea of his plans other than to &quot;walk into retirement&quot; in that prissiest of New England states, Vermont. That's the one where faux-rustics think the NEW L.L. Bean is the REAL L.L. Bean. (And thank heaven for SUVs, hey?)Wren's denial is of his age: 65. He doesn't rant and moan about it but he does intrude it at times and in ways that hit the floor like a brick. When he's grateful, for example, that younger hikers don't notice or at least mention his age, I'm embarrassed for him. A tone of defeat creeps in each time, when in fact some hint of triumph is deserved. It is not nothing, after all, to walk at the age of 65 some 400 miles from Times Square and up the Appalachian Trail, even if the destination is Vermont. It is an accomplishment at any age.Denial damages his walk. He's out of shape, but won't exercise. He has a bad knee, but ignores it; for his arthritic ankle he buys a doctor-prescribed ankle brace ($80!) but leaves it in his pack unused, despite frequent pain. Now about that pack. It weighs 50 pounds! Wren takes far too long to realize that's far too much and even longer to do anything about it. And when a tick bite hints at Lyme disease, Wren dabs it with suntan lotion. That's not brave. It's dumb.Despite some amusing or informative incidents, Wren's storytelling shows just how retired he and his reportorial curiosity are. He starts themes but doesn't finish them: &quot;Yes, there are bears in the woods, but you don't need to meet them.&quot; (So . . . ?) What will the ex-marine he meets do in civilian life? &quot;Go into the family business, sir.&quot; (Which is?) Readers seeking compensating tales of foreign-correspondent life will regret it. Wren has too many, most relentlessly dull and clumsily introduced: &quot;Stretching back against the rock . . . . I sought out the Big Dipper . . . . These were the same glorious constellations I had studied one night in the Ogaden desert of Ethiopia, out with a band of guerrillas who were at war with the government.&quot; Then it gets worse. Much worse.Wren convincingly paints the Appalachian Trail as a rather unpleasant experience. Even the young hikers he meets are usually dirty, smelly and exhausted. They use pseudonyms called 'trail names' and don't talk much: Some are social misfits or running from personal troubles, others are just too tired. One is so used up he eats uncooked oatmeal. The worst of Wren's fellow travelers talks too much, however; that would be America's original smug bore, Henry David Thoreau. In a real failure of imagination, Wren lugs some Thoreau along and frequently shares its dead weight with poor us, apparently unaware that this Waldensian faker was a freeloader always running home for a hot lunch cooked by mommy. Quoting him is prima facie evidence of having too little respect for your audience. Just remember this much: When college is over, so is Thoreau. OK?Come we now to the writing and editing. With the latter we can easily dispense: The publisher evidently did. Surely there was no editor of this book; just someone who had lunch with the author? (Yeesh, what a racket. And all those years I worked for a living.) As for the writing, it never rises above the pedestrian, and I make no pun. It never gets as good as workmanlike and is often visibly worse. Wren inhabits a world in which &quot;battered&quot; taxis drive him to &quot;ramshackle&quot; towns; where the beers are &quot;frosty,&quot; the sandwiches &quot;scrumptious&quot; and the steaks--oh my god, the steaks!--are &quot;seared to perfection.&quot;Walkers have a tradition of writing really fine works: RLS, Hilaire Belloc come to mind, as do Wordsworth, Coleridge and Hazlitt, among many others. But then this is not a walking book. It's a plodder.--Bill Marsano is a professional editor and an award-winning writer on travel, and wines and spirits."},{"Title":"The Heritage of French Cooking","review":"I borrowed this book from a dear friend, and find that from Apicus to the present, it is, together with Sunset Country French Cooking, my favorite in my library.

All of his early influences and heroes are looked at with an excellent and informative manner. However this is not a autobiography by any means. It does exactly what the title says, dissects him and many other people in the music scene. This is a book for Manson fans who have read all the usual stuff, and want to dig a little deeper, it clearly explains his ideas and points of view on his music and what he is trying to express.

The interesting points are that many of the macro items discussed are eerily similar to what is happening in the US today. The bigger point of interest is where the Japanese system had a leveraged corporate debt issue, the US has both a corporate and a personal debt issue. Therefore, what are the implications when we as a society start to pay off on this debt? and when/if the Government changes their fiscal policy and starts to balance the budget? No matter, the markets will figure this out before most Americans realize what has hit them.

Also, the way Coonts explains things is very vague, and confusing in the way he explains who each character is."},{"Title":"The Minotaur","review":"We thought Captain Jake Grafton died at the end of &quot;Final Flight&quot; when he deliberately flew his F-14 into a cargo plane carrying stolen nukes. We were wrong - as the first few pages of &quot;Minotaur&quot; make clear. The Minotaur is the codename for a Russian spy blamed for leaking sensitive military secrets to the Russians. Many think the spy a myth, but Jake Grafton - now permanently grounded and assigned a desk in the Pentagon - has to consider the mole real enough. Given control over the Navy's new stealth bomber program, Grafton confronts mysterious accidents and the mysterious death of his predecessor. He must also confront the program's more mundane obstacles - like the fact that it's impossible to design a truly effective stealth plane, and that the most promising design will be edged by the more politically attractive one. While most writers would wax eloquently on the virtues of their techno toys, Coonts looks at the advanced technology aircraft in his book dispassionately. Stealth aircraft, Coonts warns us, are underarmed, not very maneuverable, and very short-ranged. The USAF's stealth fighter, for its whiz-bangs, is essentially a Navy A-7 that (for the moment) can evade any radar in the world and drop a total of two bombs, both being the sort of high-tech toys that never work. (This book came out before Desert Storm). Combining the rigors of the program with an espionage story is pretty daring, and Coonts tries some nifty tricks. Unfortunately, though a promising idea, to many charachters really are dual charachters with assumed identities - neither of which are defined before being revealed to be other ill-drawn charachters. There are too many secret agendas and cross-plots, though Coont's writing encourages re-reading. The charachters that aren't mysterious - &quot;Toad&quot; Tarkington, Rita Morovia and Grafton himself remain pretty crisp, though we haven't any of the great charachters from the first &quot;Intruder&quot;. Still a worthy read and among Coonts' best."},{"Title":"The Minotaur","review":"I guess I must dare to be different. Unlike everyone else who raves about this book, I found it boring the few times I have read it.Stephen Coonts is a good author. His book \\"Flight of the Intruder\\" may be considered a classic novel of Vietnam; it was even made into a movie. The protaganist in that book, Jake Grafton, became a recurring figure in a series of novels about Naval aviation. The Minotaur is the fourth in the series.In this book, Jake Grafton has survived a kamikaze attack on a ship carrying a terrorist who tried to capture nuclear weapons from an aircraft carrier (the main plot in the book \\"Final Flight\\"). Jake has recovered from his wounds and is dealing with the consequences of his actions. He is a hero to the nation for his actions and was awarded a Medal of Honor. However, the military considers him a renegade officer and would prefer to see him go away. However, because of his noteriety, the Navy was forced to keep him on active duty but made him \\"suffer\\" for his actions by giving him a staff position at the Pentagon. For Jake, it was the kiss of death for his career.His role at the Pentagon was to coordinate work on a black project to build a stealth aircraft for the Navy. Additionally, the project was also working to develop a radar-cancelling device that would make stealth technology obsolete.The main premise of the book is the espionage being conducted by various individuals to sell the secrets of the project to the Russians. Jake got the job after his predecessor was killed when an individual felt that his cover was blown. Jake eventually figures out who is ultimately giving the secrets to the Russians and learns why it was being done.The book is quite long, nearly 600 pages. There are many subplots taking place in the book, at least six I can think of. Though the espionage-related subplots are intertwined, the number of characters involved can make it confusing to follow what is happening.The subplot with Toad Tarkington (Jake's main friend) may make more sense if one reads Final Flight first, as he is a key player in that book. But it isn't necessary to understand this book; it just gives more background for him.The book is interesting if you are curious about the workings of the Pentagon and the behind-the-scenes political maneuvering of the military. But most people probably already know how political anything involving the Defense Dept., especially procurement, is.Ultimately, the book is long and boring. Unlike the other books in the series, there is no action. No bombing targets, no shipboard life anecdotes, no real anything. Even the espionage aspects aren't that thrilling, though the way they are written can be confusing until the very end. There were some interesting parts but, unlikely other books in the series, this was easy for me to put down; I didn't have to read \\"just one page.\\"Honestly, the only reason I read this book more than once was to figure out exactly what was going on (the first time I read it was in high school). The \\"big reveal\\" at the end sounds entirely plausible, that the \\"little people\\" are simply cannon fodder for politics. The convoluted storyline and multiple subplots can be difficult to follow, especially with the number of people that are mentioned.If you are reading the \\"Jake Grafton series\\", you may as well read this one. But, in my opinion, Flight of the Intruder is the best of the series, followed by Final Flight. It may be because I'm in the Navy and the politics are too realistic, but The Minotaur is just too boring, in my opinion, and will be going in the donation bin."},{"Title":"The Minotaur","review":"This is the sixth Stephen Coonts book I've read, and the first one that I liked so much that I'm giving it five stars.&quot;The Minotaur&quot; combines two main stories that are cleverly interwoven with each other.Story 1: There's a traitor, code named Minotaur, somewhere high up in the Pentagon who is channeling America's top military secrets to Moscow. Amazingly, the Russians don't know the identity of this mole, so not just the FBI but also the KGB are feverishly doing everything they can to find out who this traitor is.Story 2: The U.S. Navy is in the midst of a procurement project to obtain a new attack aircraft to replace the aging A-6 Intruder. The new airplane will be based on stealth technology, including a top-secret device to actively suppress radar reflections.I found the procurement story to be especially interesting. There's a lot of presumably authentic inside information on how the U.S. military handles the procurement of a major weapons system. The political skullduggery involved was fascinating, with a high-ranking U.S. Senator manipulating the process in an attempt to get the contract awarded to a company in his state. This Senator was more interested in his own re-election than in whether the Navy got an optimal, or even usable, aircraft!Mixed up with the two main stories are a fair number of sub-plots, most of them concerning the lives and personalities of various people in the book. These sub-plots display Stephen Coonts' talent for creating characters who are real people, not the cardboard clich&eacute;s that populate most techno-thrillers.Overall, the most enjoyable aspect of this book is the way it draws you into the story and makes you want to learn what's happening behind the scenes and why. Who is the Minotaur? Why is he (or she) passing secrets to the Russians? Will he/she be stopped?Unless you have a very good memory, I would recommend that you create and maintain a list of the main characters in the book. Otherwise, things can become rather confusing, and your chances of guessing who the Minotaur is will be minimal.There are some very exciting descriptions of the test flights involved in the procurement project, first with a modified A-6 Intruder and then with two different prototypes of the new stealth attack airplane. These narratives, and some general descriptions of the joys of flying, are an added attraction in &quot;The Minotaur.&quot; Stephen Coonts' background as a pilot and flying enthusiast is obvious here.If you like techno-thrillers populated with real people, and if you are interested in flying and especially in military aircraft, then I'm sure you'll like &quot;The Minotaur.&quot;Rennie Petersen"},{"Title":"The Minotaur","review":"I truly loved the story of the devolopment of a new military jet with all the difficulties that comes with such a development, a weird man who has devoloped a new generation of Stealth technoligy who isn't to easy to make a deal with is one example.

Jake Grafton, just back from his harrowing, near-death experience in the Middle East, is struggling with his position in the Navy and with life in general.

Fearing a bland, paper-pushing position, he finds himself as the head of a team charged with investigating and recommending a next-generation Navy fighter. At the same time, the US is at the height of the cold war with the Soviet Union and espionage efforts are in full swing. Coonts brings together a number of range of characters, while blending a number of sub-stories within the main story. The book moves quickly, with frequent plot twists and uncertainty until the end about the position and motivation of a number of the book's characters.

The Grafton series in its beginning were military procedurals, about Grafton's early adventures as a carrier pilot in the Vietnam era. Later installments are more about espionage. I started with the latter, and worked my way back to the former. The latter are good but not exceptional, enjoyable for their low-key and realistic tone. Grafton's character comes through more in the earlier ones, where Coonts' love and knowledge of flying add another dimension to the books, and where you get a better sense of what a stand-up guy Grafton is, and why - more so than in the later books, when he is a high-ranking officer bureaucrat sleuth getting called in to deal with sensitive matters, and where younger characters get most of the action.This book combines both elements. Grafton at its outset is literally on the beach - recovering from crash injuries that have ended his flying days, and in bad odor with the Navy despite having won the Medal of Honor, his career seemingly shot for his problems obeying orders.He snaps out of a long-term funk when he gets the call to manage development of the next-generation stealth attack bomber, as the Soviet Union begins to cave at the end of the Cold War. The project has not only the usual procurement and political problems - Congressmen with axes to grind, manufacturers with inside tracks, Pentagon employees susceptible to bribes - but a possible penetration by a disturbingly high-level spy.FBI agent Luis Camacho, charged with tracking the spy, enters the mirrors-upon-mirrors world of counterespionage, playing his cards so close to his chest his own deputy doesn't know what he's up to, or why.Sidekick Toad Tarkington is put to work navigating the experimental models, working next to the skilled but inexperienced (and beautiful) test pilot Rita Moravia. Toad has to work through this particular working-with-a-woman thing as the two must test the plane with politicians breathing down their necks.I couldn't put it down. Coonts does a great job particularly with the counterespionage, keeping you guessing until the end. Both Grafton's nostalgia for flight, and Tarkington's and Moravia's revelling in it, are well portrayed, helping expand and deepen the prose."},{"Title":"The Minotaur","review":"I very much enjoyed this high-tech (which is not quite up to Clancey), detective, spy thriller. Coonts does a great job of personalizing his characters (and here, I think, better than Clancey). This was the first book I've read by Coonts, and it was great even out of order for the series. I'm very happy to see that readers think there are better books by Coonts out there. They must be very good indeed."},{"Title":"The Minotaur","review":"I picked up The Minotaur the morning after I finished Final Flight, and while it was better than a lot of the bilge I've read over the years, it was definetly not my favorite Coonts tale (I think that position will forever be held by Final Flight).

It is a well crafted product, but much of the story itself is just mediocre. 5 stars for the writing and 3 for the story averages out to 4 stars.I got it for $1.99 as a Kindle Daily deal, so I don't feel cheated. I probably would have felt at least a little cheated if I had paid full price.Its a long book that delves at length into both the Pentagon procurement process that is of course inevitably tied up with politics, and high technology being a force multiplier for the US. Most of this was believable, even if 30+ years later some of the technology discussed (e.g. - active cancellation) still has not come to fruition.It might well have been a better book if it had just skipped the silly espionage stuff. None of that was believable to me. It was just too convoluted, especially as the book progressed.I bought it mainly because I remember how much I enjoyed reading Flight of the Intruder, the first book in the Jake Grafton series. This book was fun to read, but not even close to being in the category of a really great book like Flight of the Intruder."},{"Title":"The Minotaur","review":"The book was hard to follow at times but it kept me in suspense right up to the end.

It took me forever to finish because it was so boring. The action was lacking. The references to floppy drives and lack of cell phones were amusing.

Although I'm not an avid fan of the long running Jake Grafton series, I'd enjoyed the couple I'd read and figured the price was right.Reading this 25 years after the original publication makes it feel more like an historical novel. Stealth technology is new and exotic. Spies stealing documents copy them onto 5.25\\" floppy disks. Not even the first Gulf War has occurred yet. It's all a little nostalgic. However, the age of the book isn't what made it a chore to finish. It was a plot primarily centered around the political mechanics of new weapon acquisition (in this case a navy stealth fighter). Coonts is a good writer and the portions with some action and suspense were very good, but weapon acquisition is a boring process no matter how adroit the author might be. The book would have been too long even with a more interesting storyline, so I consider finishing it an accomplishment."},{"Title":"The Minotaur","review":"I've enjoyed all the Jake Grafton books I have read.

Interesting and full of intrigue."},{"Title":"The Minotaur","review":"Stephen Coonts is on my favourite author list and when I got my first Kindle I quickly found that this was the only book in the Jake Grafton series that I had missed.This is a direct follow-up from the end of \\"Final Flight\\" where fighter pilot Captain Jake Grafton deliberately rammed another plane to prevent nuclear Armageddon. After many months Grafton has recovered from his terrible wounds but is still facing up to his mental wounds. His wife Callie despairs that she will ever see the old confident Jake back again.One day Jake is invited by the Pentagon to take an office job - something of an anathema when he really wants to go back into action. But he soon finds that his new super-top secret job of evaluating advanced stealth fighters and combating espionage is as challenging as being in action.Grafton's navigator, Toad Tarrington, was not as seriously injured (only one rod in his leg) and is fit for active service. When he hears that Grafton is headed for the Pentagon he decides to follow him and join Grafton's team. There he meets his match with Rita Moravia, a top-gun female pilot who quickly decides that Toad will become the love of her life, and Toad quickly agrees. Toad and Rita feature in several later Jack Grafton books.A lot of this book focuses on aeroplanes and flying and is very militarily detailed so it may not be everyone's cup of tea. But it does provide an interesting bridge between Grafton the pilot and Grafton the Admiral and intelligence operative in later books."},{"Title":"Round the Horne: Volume 1","review":"I bought this two CD set as a gift for my American husband and he loves it. I used to listen to Round the Horne back in the 1960s in the UK, and hearing these episodes really took me back; it seemed that everyone was a huge Horne fan in those days. At school we all talked about \\"trolling\\" here and there, or greeted each other with \\"'ello me deario\\", in our best Rambling Sid Rumpo accent.There wasn't very much of the language or references that I needed to explain to my husband, and he laughed his socks off all the way through, so I think American listeners will get just as much pleasure from Round the Horne as Brits of a certain age.Well, well worth a listen."},{"Title":"Round the Horne: Volume 1","review":"This CD contains four complete episodes from the BBC radio series 'Round The Horne'. To my mind, it's better to hear the complete episodes rather than highlights from the many shows, even though this means that the standard of the material is somewhat uneven. The shows built on the characters and catchphrases created by the talented cast of comedians and well-known both to the live and the listening audience, of whom I was a regular member. Back in those days, radio was still the main vehicle for entertainment of many in Britain and RTH was immensely popular.Whether the humor translates well to an American audience, I'm not sure. It's essentially British and of its time. For me, it brings back Winter evenings, sitting in front of the fire and laughing at the verbal antics of Kenneth Williams, Hugh Paddick and Betty Marsden, all pulled together by the avuncular Kenneth Horne. If you're British and over 60 years old, it's probably going to do the same for you.

William K. Black, former Director of Litigation for the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB) and Deputy Director of the FSLIC, borrows the statement for his account of the Savings and Loan crisis from the perspective of a regulator. Black is now famous as an anti-fraud crusader who coined the term \\"control fraud\\" to describe corporate fraud perpetrated by someone at the top levels of a company who can control the safety mechanisms intended to prevent and detect fraud and thereby get away with looting the company for personal profit.Black takes us back to the 1980s, by which time most S&Ls; in the US were insolvent on a market-value basis following the interest rate crisis of the 1970s. In recounting the behind-the-scenes dramas, dirty politics, and vicious battles for control of the Bank Board, Black explains why and how the Reagan administration and Congress covered up the depth of the S&Ls; insolvency, why the conventional wisdom about the S&L; crisis is fallacious and prevented people from learning lessons that might have prevented the current economic crisis, and he shows the reader why private market discipline does not prevent widespread fraud of this type. Black's account is dense and dry at times, but always revealing.In spite of the complexity of the subject, it's a story with heroes and villains. The hero is Edwin Gray, Reagan appointee and deregulation advocate until he saw the consequences in the form of Ponzi schemes, real estate bubbles, and derelict construction projects. Black believes that Gray's reregulation agenda averted a national real estate bubble and saved the taxpayer an enormous amount of money. The villain is Charles Keating, fraud, owner of the insolvent Lincoln Savings, five senators, and of House Speaker Jim Wright, who is also a villain. Credit is due Black, though, for expressing sympathy for people he doesn't like, often implying that they were well-intentioned and were simply cowed, as well as for not being afraid to say unflattering things about people he admires. Black takes us through Keating's efforts to control the Bank Board, Congressional hearings, intraagency civil war, and the fight for FSLIC recapitalization.People are either going to think that William Black has important insight on waves of fraud that politicians like to cover up for their own reasons, or they are going to find him an overzealous regulator. But Black makes an important point that arguments over regulation often miss entirely: The purpose of regulation is not to protect people from themselves or to place limits on those who may be capable of making their own judgments. In that case, one could argue how much or how little regulation is desirable ad infinitum. The purpose of regulation is to prevent or limit fraud. It is to avoid creating an environment that is conducive to fraud on a grand scale. Black points out that economists and financial professionals don't take fraud into account in their models, regulators have little training in fraud detection, and that a wave of fraud can bring down an entire economy."},{"Title":"The Best Way to Rob a Bank Is to Own One: How Corporate Executives and Politicians Looted the S&L; Industry","review":"Mr. Black is an amazing and truthful man in a time of untrufulness.I first saw him on Democracy Now! then Grit TV as a guest simplifying this mess.We are all affected by the banking debacle.

Most of the reintroductions confirmed my worst judgments about these men. (The miscreants are virtually all male, except for a woman I didn't know in a position high up in the FHLBB hierarchy.) Jim Boland, Danny Wall, Rick Hohlt, \\"Snake\\" Freeman, Dick Peterson, Curt Prins, Paul Nelson, Dick Still, George Bentson, Bert Ely and, of course, the redoubtable Fernand J. (\\"Freddie\\") St. Germain, the gravitational center of it all--the list in Black's book is discouragingly long. (Not to mention the other gravitational center of the frauds, Norman Strunk, head of the U.S. League of Savings Associations for decades.)I was not involved in the S&L; business, so I viewed things from afar. But Black fills in the blanks as to what was going on while I was preoccupied in my job with other things, even while I was perforce dealing with the same people off and on. So only Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez, (his able assistant Kelsay Meek unfortunately not mentioned), Jake Lewis, and a precious few others on Capitol Hill stand out as protectors of the Treasury, taxpayers, and depositors. What a read!Judging by Angelo Mozilo's successful Countrywide fraud, and Jon Corzine's recent $5 billion sequestration, Black's work to raise the awareness of \\"control fraud\\" in the context of the U.S. system of higher education has failed miserably, due to inertia, among other things. But I also blame the arrogance of academics, who do not cotton to a newcomer to their ranks telling them (truthfully) that they have missed the boat in a crucial area of financial regulation/supervision. And of course, don't even ask about the attitudes of the employees of the government financial regulatory agencies, who hear/see no evil as an occupational point of pride. (In the late 1980s-early 1990s there were at least prosecutions and convictions. Nowadays, due to the utter corruption of the U.S. Government, there have been precious few investigations and no prosecutions. Mozilo settled with the SEC for a relative pittance and was required to admit no wrongdoing. Corzine, former governor and Senator, has been allowed to walk away.)Good work, Mr. Black."},{"Title":"The Best Way to Rob a Bank Is to Own One: How Corporate Executives and Politicians Looted the S&L; Industry","review":"This book is fascinating in that it is an insider's account of the crony capitalism that persisted during the lead up to and aftermath of the S&L; crises of 1980s and 1990s.

Bill Black should know better than anyone, as he was one of the inside attorney's trying to coral bankers gone wild on highly speculative ventures...Mr. Black walks us down the chamber of horrors of the Savings & Loan collapse, and gives us a bird's eye view of bank corrupt.What is most interesting is that Mr. Black finds the trends within in the industry itself, that it was actually CONTROL FRAUD were bankers, accountants, appraisers, bank executives and politicians colluded together to bring an already shaky and weak industry down. Everyone who wants to understand that the Savings & Loan was the first cracks in the empire, civilizations have always been brought down by poorly run fractional reserve fiat currency bankig systems.What was the cry from people from Alan Greenspan was for more deregulation, and at the time, Greenspan, a banker who was with Morgan Stanley prior to his excellency/chairmanship/ at the Federal Reserve System, was that the Lincoln Savings & Loan, was one of the best run S&Ls; in the country...What resulted was deregulation and desupervision... Attorneys and accountants for hire, audits performed on Savings & Loans which made them look like a picture of financial health when in fact the S&L; industry had terminal cancer...Massive insolvency, virtually no reserves, coverups, and famous politicians genuflecting to the Savings & Loan industry, the Keating Five; John Glen, John McCain, Alan Cranston, Dennis DeConcini, Donald Riegle..All pressuring the Bank Board for leniency...Every American should read this book...this control fraud of the eighties in the Savings & Loan industry makes Enron look like a game of childrens marbles..We learn little, we remember little in this United States of Amnesia..The Best Way To Rob A Bank Is to Own One, by William Black is a true sign that there is a crack in the American empire's treasury..

I wanted to read about what I thought of as more current issues like the problems in the financial industry.How glad I now am to have read The Best Way to Rob a Bank is to Own One.The book does show step by step how the fraud in the S&Ls; was perpetuated. Mr. Black, who was part of the agency that was supposed to regulate the S&L; industry, gives the insider's perspective of what happened.He's also interested in detailing the factors in the environment that made it possible for the fraud to occur, be covered up, and finally collapse. Factors ideological (regulation is not needed), budgetary (under-staffed, inexperienced regulators), and political (the power of bought politicians).This makes what happened in the 1980's feel contemporary. There were patterns then that seem familiar to what is happening these days. (I am writing in April 2009.)For example, Mr. Black shows how the S&L; fraud was abetted by compliant accountants. Nowadays we've learned how compliant accounting firms falsely rated financial securities to the benefit of the bankers. And just recently political pressure was successfully brought to bear on the FASB (Financial Accounting Standards Board) to loosen up the Mark-to-Market accounting rules. To what end we will have to wait and see; after reading Best Way to Rob I am not sanguine.I can't avoid the conclusion that the environment that resulted in corruption 20 years ago is still with us. And I begin to think that Obama's economic advisors will not change things.So, this book is sobering. Parts of the story left me open-mouthed. Like the fact that Charles Keating continued to operate, and loot, for 2 years after his illegal practices were uncovered. In fact, he got the agency that was supposed to regulate S&L;'s to agree to a cease and desist order against itself: the agency agreed it would not take any action against Keating !!!The author writes in a concise, clear way.

For a lay person, the first two chapters are especially tough to get through with lots of terminology and unfamiliar banking concepts. It reads less like a story than a college textbook, but if you can plow through it, it will open your eyes about the banking industry. The fact that those morally corrupt executives could become so rich while manipulating everyone, including presidents and Congress, shows you that the white collar criminal wins more often than he loses, while the whistle blowers and the trusting public get screwed. It happened then, it's happening now. It'll happen again."},{"Title":"The Best Way to Rob a Bank Is to Own One: How Corporate Executives and Politicians Looted the S&L; Industry","review":"This is a definite must read if you a) own stock, b) use a bank, c) have any savings. I'm thinking of donating mine to my congress-woman, but I doubt that either her or the staff would read it or care.This is very well written, and a great summary of the previous financial debacle.

The Political Thieves wanted S & L's out of the way, so they looted them and thus created the threshold for the new banking horrors created by The Right and lately ignored by the Left.Black's Book thunderously reports the entire episode in great detail and sets the stage for understanding what has happened now when middle class wealth has all but disappeared. None of the happenings of the last forty years was \\"coincidence\\" it was all part of the master plan to undo what FDR did for the working and entrepreneuring class.Three cheers for Black and his book. Read and learn. The goal of the Corporate plotters has long been to strip the entrepreneuring and the working middle class of wealth by narrowing their options for savings safety, making it easy to steal, by hitting savers with heavy fees, and checking accounts with fraudulent \\"overdraft\\" charges, and now they have done so. The next Big Crash is well underway as the dollar falls and savings dwindles and Black and a few others are the only resource to understanding how and why our Treasury was over the last nine years looted of $16.3 trillion and how harmful that will become to the middle and lower classes as the years roll onward.It is important to note that in history, there has never been any event that was not conspired upon. Everything that has ever happened has been a conspiracy and those which call such realities to others who research them, \\"Conspiracy Theories,\\" Merely display their lack of observation and intelligence.

Bush,Clinton,Dole,Gore,Kerrey,George W. Bush ,McCain ,and Obama political campaigns.Both political parties are basically controlled by Wall Street.This book covers the first major speculative bubble of the 1980's.This first wave was then followed by a second bubble in the 1990's and a third bubble in the 2000's.All of these bubbles eventually end up as Ponzi schemes a la Madoff,with his 100 billion dollar Ponzi scheme succeeding for nearly 20 years right under the noses of a Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) stacked with University of Chicago type Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) economists who hear,see,and speak no evil of Wall Street speculators running amok.I want to thank Lynette K Beaver for bringing this book to my attention."},{"Title":"All the Mowgli Stories","review":"Time is too short today for me to write a review of the Jungle Books (the Mowgli stories) themselves. I have read them all my life and they are among my very favorite stories. With Tolkien and the Bible they are on my Top Ten list for sure.What I have to say about this edition is that it is the ONLY version so far where I have seen the story \\"In the Rukh,\\" which takes place when Mowgli is an adult. My copy of this book differs from that shown in the photos above in that mine does not have the illustrated cover (and I cannot find a publication date, just the copyrights of 1893, 1894 & 1895), but the inside pages are the same.Never mind the Disney version. Enjoy the catchy tunes if you like but make no mistake: Kipling's Mowgli stories are far more than silliness. Take some time to find and read them. And if you get a copy with \\"In the Rukh,\\" hold on to it."},{"Title":"All the Mowgli Stories","review":"That's because the movies mostly either Disneyfied the stories into kids' films or turned Mowgli into yet another Tarzan while the Jungle Books left out the final Mowgli story \\"In the Rukh\\", a story of Mowgli as a grown man. Interestingly, though chronologically the last Mowgli story, \\"In the Rukh\\" was the earliest written; the later written but chronologically earlier stories tell how Mowgli got to that point. The Mowgli stories in the Jungle Books end with Mowgli driving Mowgli out of the Jungle and back to Man in order to seek out his place in Man's World; \\"In the Rukh\\" tells how Mowgli finally found his place, and IMHO is absolutely vital to a true understanding of the character and the stories, since all the rest were written in order to explain how Mowgli ended up \\"In the Rukh\\".The stories are helpfully arranged by internal chronology, except that the first story has two sections set 10 or 11 years apart and the next two stories actually take place between the two parts of the first story. In addition each story has an accompanying poem following it. Thus, I would suggest the following reading order:MOWGLI'S BROTHERS, Part 1 (Mowgli's origin)KAA'S HUNTING (Contrary to movies, Mowgli makes a great friend; 2nd best story)Road-Song of the Bandar-LogHOW FEAR CAME (Arguably a prototype for the Just So stories)The Law of the JungleMOWGLI'S BROTHERS, Part 2 (Mowgli is cast out of the Seeonee wolf pack)Hunting-Song of the Seeonee Pack\\"TIGER! TIGER!\\" (Mowgli and Shere Khan finally have it out)Mowgli's SongLETTING IN THE JUNGLE (Villagers attack his adoptive human mother; Mowgli responds)Mowgli's Song Against PeopleTHE KING'S ANKUS (Jungle detective work reveals a tale of man's greed)The Song of the Little HunterRED DOG (Mowgli vows to help Seeonee Pack fight off red dogs; best story)Chil's SongTHE SPRING RUNNING (Mowgli casts himself out; unsatisfying end to Mowgli's saga)The OutsongIN THE RUKH (Mowgli finds his place; satisfying end to Mowgli's saga)The Only SonNote: Most editions include a helpful pronunciation guide at the very end.Note: A couple of modern authors have attempted to add Mowgli stories to the canon with widely diverging degrees of success: from the sublimeThe Third Jungle Bookto the ridiculousHunting Mowgli."},{"Title":"Mechanical Engineers' Handbook.","review":"This is a great book for reference.

The author's mind, that is, rather than his characters (though his main characters certainly echo his sentiments).I found \\"The Sunbird\\" to be a fairly well-written, moderately entertaining archeological adventure read, along the lines of the \\"Indiana Jones\\" movies but set in South Africa. However, like other reviewers, I had to smile (and eventually frown) at the rather ridiculous overdrawing of the caricatures...er, characters. To sum it up simply, whilst pointing out Smith's hidden agenda -White people - talented, brilliant, rich and beautiful!Blacks (Smith's term) - evil, traitorous, country-stealing terrorists.Having grown up in the deep south, but having lived in New York for the last 20 years, I began feeling a sick sense of Deja Vu within the first 40 pages of Smith's book. The deep, abiding, and often unconscious racial prejudice which permeated much of the south in the 50's and 60's (and still today to a degree) is evident all through this book. And, not only racial prejudice, but prejudices in general towards women and class structure are also in attendance.I love a good yarn, and Wilbur Smith seems certainly seems capable of spinning one. However, whenever I can detect an agenda behind the book driving its story, characters and dialogue, I tend to resist. Especially when the agenda is something as hateful as apartheid. I picked this book up on a whim in a supermarket, not knowing Smith's work or the fact that this book, while being printed in 2002, was written almost 30 years ago. Knowing his worldview and how it appears in his writing, I won't be reading another.Interesting side note - Regarding my earlier comment about \\"deep, abiding, and often unconscious racial prejudice\\" - many of my older friends and relatives still living in the south would probably comment upon reading this book, \\"What racism??\\" They were brought to mind while reading some of the other reviews of this book."},{"Title":"The Sunbird","review":"I wasn't expecting a whole lot when I started, W.

W. Smith takes his time and takes near forever to determine that you are not in London or elsewhere in England but in fact in S. Africa. I did like once you acutaly got to the &quot;historical&quot; viewpoint of the book but the rest was overly predicatable and many avenues never lead anywhere. Oh and don't get me started with how it ended (although it was inventive)You seriously need to be a devote fan of W.

So Ben along with his lovely assistant, Sally Benator, and his friend Louren, Venture out to the Bushvelt of South Africa. As the story goes along Ben and Sally find more and more little discoveries that lead to much bigger ones. Along the way Ben Kazin meets new people one of which is a small Bushman named Xhai. He also meets a few Terrorists along the way that threaten his life. In this book I learned lots of new things about Africa, mainly the Bushvelt. The author describes the landscapes of the Bushvelt in amazing ways. He describes many different animals such as the Gemsbok and the Eland. There are also descriptions of the surrounding cities and archaeological points of interest near Ben's lost city. The author also describes cities that still thrive to this day like the country of Johannesburg and the city of Cape Town which are located in South Africa.

In the second part of the book the author takes you to the citie's past and the unique civilization that lived there. Wilbur Smith incorporates some of the characters from the present into the ancient past. It is quite an imaginative plot.What fasinated me was that on the T.V.show NOVA there was a documentary about an archaeological discovery of the lost city of Ubar in southern Arabia.

I read about 8 (more than 5 not more than 10) Wilbur Smith books. I was young. They were racy, stereotypical, testosteroned, adventures. After about 8 books, they all seemed the same. But this one sticks in my mind. It was different. It is experimental. It is the only book by Wilbur that I can remember. Some of the viewers complain that it does not have a conclusion. It is open. It is a tragedy. It is even philosophical. The whites may be super intelligent and great long distance runners but they are doomed. And the book goes some way to say why. It reminds me a little of One Hundred Years of Solitude (because races condemned to one hundred years of solitude did not have a second opportunity on earth). It is a Wilbur Smith adventure. But it is the book where I feel he shared and bared his soul more than any other. It is a troubled book. And it sticks with you, with me anyway.

It simply did not have any of the political intrigue that I remember from River God (still one of my all time faves) and Warlock."},{"Title":"The Sunbird","review":"Written in a somewhat different formatt from previous Smith novels, but as always well done."},{"Title":"The Sunbird","review":"This is a vile book on several levels....P>The characters are completely implausible. They do not possess ordinary human qualities. Instead, they are extraordinary! Just top-flight people! Dr. Ben Kazin speaks 17 languages. He teaches himself ancient Punic in a week, with nothing except a scroll to instruct himself with. He gives a series of lectures at a university. A dozen people attend the first, 600 the last. Why? Because he's just such an incredible guy. Although he is depicted as being a scrawny hunchback, he nearly overpowers half a dozen terrorists single-handedly in hand-to-hand combat.Lauren Sturtevant is also a remarkable guy. Mostly he's jetting about the world, doing deals and making killings. When he isn't doing that, he's usually killing things out in the bush, or scoring with chicks....P>A big problem is that we have to take Smith's word on how great these people are. He will say that one character devastates another with a display of dazzling wit. Rarely, Smith attempts to show us what he means by including the characters' dialog. Invariably, what they say isn't dazzling or witty--just crude and stupid. And the main characters always respond with furious anger, eyes flashing, muscles tensing, etc, whenever anyone disagrees with them. What's with that?Smith believes that the way to make characters memorable is by means of magnitude. Take a trait, and just magnify it. If a little is good, a lot must be really great. An unintended effect of this method, in Smith's hands, is to make all of his main characters insufferably pompous. Smith also is a great believer in drama. The Sunbird is a series of scores of mini-dramas. Most are dead-ends, having little to do with the story--such as it is. An earlier reviewer remarked that the book cover illustration is misleading. He's right. I had to think for a couple minutes before I remembered the bit in the story with the airplanes.The worst part of reading the Sunbird is being inside the head of the narrator--Dr. Ben Kazin. A vain, disgusting, foul man. I cheered when Part One was over. Only then I was in the head of Huy Ben Amon, which may have been worse.The bit about Mandela. The book was written in 1972. Part One is about the \\"discovery\\" of an ancient city. The ANC war against apartheid is a theme. Part II is a flashback to the last days of this supposed ancient kingdom. Smith has the ancient Carthaginians, whom he inaccurately portrays as being white, setting up this huge empire in Southern Africa. They are swept into oblivion by a remorseless, tidal wave of black Africans. Get it? Just like how the '70s must have seemed to hardline Afrikaaners like Smith. In both eras, the blacks are led by another extraordinary human being--except that this one has purplish skin and yellow, smouldering eyes. Smith was definitely cheerleading for apartheid.I loved the book when I read it at 15. It looks pretty horrible to me now."},{"Title":"The Sunbird","review":"Let's first describe the book without passion or judgment. There are two tales, cutely parallel. The first tale is set in the 1960's or 70's. It concerns a South African multilingual super-talented white hunchbacked Anthropologist. This hero, together with his rich (white) friend and patron, explores an archaeological site. The third important character is a black guy, who is talented but alas feels no loyalty to the great country of South Africa. So it's a tale of bonding between two superb white guys and the treachery of a black guy.The second tale is set 2000 years in the past, at which time apparently there was a white empire in southern Africa, whose remnants were being explored as the archaeological site of the first tale. The lead character is the Sunbird who is, ahem, white hunchbacked uber-talented, and the best friend of the king/emperor who is also a great adventurer and hero. And (you guessed it) the third important character is a strong black guy, a bit short of loyalty, who organizes an uprising that destroys the great white empire that surely must have existed in southern Africa.Now I must warn that this review might contain trace amounts of sarcasm, which has been known to be occasionally harmful to straight-thinking minds.This is one great book. I read it when I was a teenager, more that 15 years ago now, but the memory of the wonderful adventures and fundamental truths still burns fresh in my mind. Remember, these were the great days of Apartheid, now sadly lost, but perhaps not for ever.Now, young as I was, I already knew that white people were gods, so the underlying bits of supremacy philosophy did not bother me too much. And, perhaps as Wilbur Smith intended, I was justly disgusted by some black people's refusal to be happy under Apartheid and slavery. And the main white characters are described so well... oh just as white people should be, the men strong and adventurous and always onto new conquests, the women beautiful and marvelous.The only complaint I had with the book was the invention (or is it the truth?) of a white empire in ancient southern Africa. I mean, why bother with this convoluted story of Whites having been in South Africa before? We already know that whites deserve African land (actually, all land) as a divine right, so no justification is needed. But it doesn't hurt of course to be comforted by the safe knowledge that white people were in South Africa already 2000 years ago, and also anywhere else their past presence might be required for the ideological purpose of the day.I hear this book is popular in the American South, you know, that wonderful place you really ought to fearlessly visit especially if you have dark skin, or even better, if you have white skin and a dark-skinned boyfriend. Oh, and I also hear Wilbur Smith didn't stop writing tales after the fall (temporary?) of Apartheid. I wonder what he's writing about now? If I were still a teenager, I'd read and find out, but alas, time passes and I am one no longer."},{"Title":"The Sunbird","review":"I love Wilbur Smith's novels, but this one must have been a high-school project that he resurrected for some immediate cashflow. The literary device for the transition from modern to ancient settings was clumsy, and much in both halves was just not plausible. The story had potential, but it was not realized."},{"Title":"The Sunbird","review":"I read The Sunbird by Wilbur Smith first when I was 14. Little did I realize the racial overtomes it has! Having read it again, (at 41) I was appalled at the blatant racial bigotry. This book is most likely what any apartheid supporter would love to see be reality. Back when Great Zimbabwe was being said to be built by Whites, Black Africans assumed to have been too ignorant and unintelligent to have built it, scientists were beginning to prove that Black Africans did indeed build Great Zimbabwe. This book, in which a White South African finds a hidden city that is proven to be as big as Great Zimbabwe is and is proven to be built by Whites, is just the sort of fantasy dream many Whites would have wished could have happened.The archaeologist, Ben Kazin, proves &quot;once and for all&quot; that Whites were the builders of the great cities of Africa. The story, finding a hidden and lost city and the fall back into time that came with it, would have been great, had there not been this not-so-hidden agenda of trying to prove that Whites are superior to Blacks. That agenda disgusted me in the extreme and makes reading this book unpalatable for me. If Wilbur Smith had written it as just an Indiana Jones type of story, of finding a hidden city and how the finders dreamed back into time and actually lived the final days, this would have been a great book as well as a great movie. Sadly, for anyone that is reasonably educated on the ancient and recent history of Africa, I would not recommend this book. It would only make you angry. Too bad Wilbur Smith allowed his own prejudices to mar what could have been a really great story!"},{"Title":"The Sunbird","review":"I've read several WS books but by the time I got to the second half of the book, I gave up. The story went nowhere.Suggest the Seventh Scroll or Birds of Prey, much better."},{"Title":"The Sunbird","review":"The Sunbird is written by the same author who wrote the highly-acclaimed The Seventh Scroll. And, as is the case with Smith's other novels, the story takes place in Africa. The first half of the novel covers the events in the lives of three people: a brilliant scholar, a wealthy businessman, and a young female understudy. The second half is an ingeniously told flashback through time and what might have been the previous or past lives that these same three have had many centuries ago.There's plenty of adventure, politics, history, and romance in this novel. And, as always with Wilbur Smith, lots of violence. In some ways, Smith reminds me of the American author, Harry Crews. They both love to write about the primitive side of human nature. Plenty of violence, cruelty, greed, and injustice. Smith is different though, in that he is also a writer willing to put great beauty and passionate romance in his novels to balance out the ugly. One cannot read a Wilbur Smith novel and not yearn to visit the African continent.In my opinion, The Sunbird is not quite as good as The Seventh Scroll. However, it is still a great reading experience and definitely better than most adventure novels out there."},{"Title":"The Sunbird","review":"By far my favorite of Wilbur Smith's books. The plot is a bit fanciful; a man who is scorned professionally as an archaeologist and who carries a chip on his hunchbacked shoulder, his beautiful assistant, his wealthy friend and patron who protects him, bankrolls him, steals his girl. The characters are not exactly innovative and fit well within Smith's genre types. However what makes this book worth repeated reading is the device of using two separated times starring the basically the same characterizations and scenes. The picture of a great ancient civilisation, its norms and culture, its history and glory and its ultimate tragedy is painted in bold confident brush strokes on the canvas of Africa. The descriptions are vivid, the imagination bold. One experiences the vignettes in the lives of Huy Ben Amon and Tanith as mush as Benjamin Kazin and Sally Benator. One rejoices as their lives take shape and love blooms, one mourns as they stumble towards the final tragedy. But moving as it is, the book is fatally flawed by Smith's overt use of it as an allegory for the battle fought by the blacks against the whites of Zimbabwe and South Africa. His sympathies with the latter are evident as he mourns the destruction of a system that though evil, is &quot;better than its proposed replacement&quot;. A book to marvel at and enjoy, but beware of his hidden agenda."},{"Title":"The Sunbird","review":"I've recently re-read &quot;The Sunbird&quot; after many years, and found it just as terrific a read as ever. Without giving away any plot points, what got me the first time still gets me, the well-executed parallel stories, modern and ancient. The charge of racism voiced by several reviewers is perhaps understandable, but one has to keep in mind that the book was written at a time (the late 1960s) when the kinds of events described in the &quot;modern&quot; section of the story (tribal Africans taking up arms against descendants of white colonists) were common. I didn't find Timothy Mageba a one-dimensional caricature, but a complex and conflicted man who finds it necessary to sacrifice personal loyalties for what he believes is a larger good. Anyway, I don't want to make the book sound like a Poli Sci text, it's a fast, entertaining read, full of intrigue and romance, and eerie enough to make your hair stand up a little at times. Worth a read."},{"Title":"The Sunbird","review":"I am a huge Wilbur Smith fan. &quot;River God&quot; is the best novel I have ever read. Be sure you read &quot;River God&quot; before you read &quot;Seventh Scroll&quot;. If you like &quot;River God&quot; and &quot;Seventh Scroll&quot; you will also love &quot;The Sunbird&quot;. It is very similar in theme and is its own sequel in the fashion of &quot;River God&quot; and &quot;Seventh Scroll&quot;. If you have read all the Wilbur Smith books like I have, you'll yearn for more, but it takes him years to come up with a new book these days. Now that many of his books are being reprinted, I am finding lots of fellow admirers of Mr. Smith. When you just can't wait for Wilbur to come up with another one, you might look at &quot;Churchill's Gold&quot; by James Follett. It is very similar in style and quality to most of the Courtney series."},{"Title":"The Sunbird","review":"This book has so much excitement and adventure packedinto it that in the hands of a lesser author it would have beenexpanded into a trilogy. The vivid writing brings Africa alive:the reader can feel the hot sun and the cool lake waters,smell the dust and grasss, and hear calls of seabirds aswell as thunderous war chants and gunfire. I have probablyread it 20 times and have four separate editions of it, so I am a fan. Please keep in mind that it does have flaws, butyou will look long and far for a more exciting book ... if you ever find one."},{"Title":"The Sunbird","review":"The SunbirdI've read other reviewers who pan this book, calling it unrealistic and saying it promotes white supremacy. I can't disagree more. I am 66 years old & first read this book when it was a Readers Digest chosen book in the mid Seventies for book of the month club. I was in my thirties then and thought it magical and telling of a story that would be written just as the attitudes of the people were in the century the story would have happened. There is nothing racist intended. I have since read it about every three years, buying newer printed versions as it has come to be such a special book in my heart. I have all of Wilbur Smiths books but this is my favorite.The Sunbird suggests an answer to the mystery \\"what happened to the defeated Carthaginians the Romans destroyed? It begins with two modern day archeologists excavating a newly discovered city in central Africa. The two are very dissimilar; one being a rich and gracious eccentric multi-millionaire who is funding the project, and his faithful henchman, a brilliant and very strong man who happens to be a hunchback.The story begins in the modern day digs and as our heroes fall prey to traps that are left for grave robbers we jump back in time to these same two heros who are the two main leaders in a hidden city that was founded by the Carthaginians after they escaped the wrath of Rome. This city is hidden at the end of a river in the center of darkest Africa and tells the magical story - a \\"what if?\\" story that is part fictional history and part ancient legend come to life. It is full of action as it might have happened in that time and the struggles this ancient city went through in trying to survive.The Sunbird lifts your spirit and excites your immagination. This was one of Wilbur Smith's first books and is more fiction than fact, whereas his writings of the past 20 some years have been based soundly on historical fact that is told in fictitious story to make it interesting. Like his current 4 books on ancient Egypt.I strongly recommend it for all ages from the teens to \\"old folk\\" like me!"},{"Title":"The Sunbird","review":"I have read this book twice only. My daughter has just reached the age where it would be appropriate for her and, while feeding her hunger for books, I remembered how good this book is. The second time I read it in a single sitting following a party where I didn't drink and I was waiting for everyone else to wake up. They woke, got on with the day and left me there reading. It is that gripping. It's a big book by the way, must be 8 hours or so of continuous reading. I loved the story device of having the same characters inhabit different bodies through the two parallel stories and hated finishing it. So now I'm going to buy another copy and read it again."},{"Title":"The Sunbird","review":"One of the reviewers here claims that 'The Sunbird' is racist in its essence and that W. Smith must have been more careful and write it 'impartially' as the 'Indiana Jones'. I will agree with the first part of this opinion and admit that somewhere I also got annoyed by the implications for the superiority of the 'whites' over the 'blacks'. However, I don't agree with the second part of this view: I prefer Smith writing according to his beliefs and not trying to be 'politically correct', even if that annoys the reader. Further, I believe that this book is so beautifully written and the above issues should only be viewed as secondary. The 'Sunbird' is a magical book that makes you want to read it again and again. Smith's writing is so natural and masterful at the same time that makes the 'Sunbird' an almost classic read. The characters (black and white) are given extremely well, especially Dr. Benjamin Kajin, and the plot always keeps the reader's attention without being predictable. I recommend the 'Sunbird' to everyone- whether you are a Smith fan or not."},{"Title":"The Sunbird","review":"I have a 1st edition of this book and have read it more than 10 times since the 70's. I wish I could articulate the impact this book has on me each time I read it - perhaps after the next reading! By the way- the cover on the current reprint, although taken from one of the events in the book, totally misrepresents the story line to any potential reader."},{"Title":"The Sunbird","review":"Edit note: The Kindle version is just appalling. Definitely the worst Kindle book I've seen. At times I couldn't figure out what was meant due to the extensive and frequent errors.====================\\"The Sunbird\\" is imaginative, robustly plotted, and has well-developed characters in exotic locales, with fast-paced action, and an interesting reworking of ancient history make this a terrific read if you can overlook the paternalistic \\"great white man\\" tone of the first half of the novel. African wildlife gets a pretty hard time of it as well what with all the great white hunters taking pot shots at them in the first half and the unlimited slaughter in the second half.The first half of the book is really an elaborate set-up for the second half of the novel which packs an authentic emotive tale of friendship, love, war, and betrayal. The second half is set in an imagined Punic colony which considers itself civilized although it is wantonly cruel. It is a civilization that should not continue, yet the author makes it sympathetic through the focus on close relationships among the protagonists, each of whom mirror the protagonists in the 1972 world of the first half of the book.The setting is somewhere in Botswana in the region of the Zambezi river in Africa of today, (1972 at time of original publication), and also as it might have been between the fall of Catharge, (146 BCE), to somewhere in the mid-5th century. There is a clever mirroring of ancient and modern characters that helps create suspense.The Kindle version seems to have been scanned without benefit of correction. The price is the same as the paperback version (which is actually more expensive than the hardback) but at least the paperback does not contain thousands of typological errors. Often you have to figure out what is meant from context because the errors can be extensive. Apparently not even a basic spell check was run on this text after it was scanned. It is a pity that Amazon does not have some kind of quality control over text that it sells for its Kindle."},{"Title":"The Sunbird","review":"It's a story about a hunchback Archaeologist, his wealthy backer friend, and his pretty assistant and a lost Carthaginian city. It's also an interesting parallel story about the fall of this city. On certain levels it's interesting story with a lot of exciting searching for an Archaeological treasure that I'm sure many Archaeologists would kill for.But it's also quite a sexist and racist story, but then it was written in the 1970's, when this attitude was common, still not right or justified, but prevalent. The attitude that the only way civilization arrived in Africa was because of the benevolent White folk is incredibly annoying and flawed.If you pretend that it's a historical story you can almost forgive the attitudes, however it's an almost, which loses this fairly good story many stars."},{"Title":"The Sunbird","review":"No exaggeration ! I have read absolutely everthing Wibur Smith has written. Sunbird was the first. I loved it from the first. It's not for the fussy ones who don't like superlatives - like the reviewer who wrote he would not read any other books of Mr. Smith's. My second favorite is &quot;Rage of the sea&quot; which I have read so many times I have lost count. Its strong, boisterous, sweeping and very easy to read. I'm glad for all you new readers that it's still in print cos' my copy is more than 20 years old, in fact 28 printed in 1972.Enjoy."},{"Title":"The Sunbird","review":"This is my favorite Wilbur Smith book, bar none. The story is enchanting, the characters wholly believable, their struggles utterly convincing, and Smith's signature gift for drama and subtle humor interlaces each page. I finished the book reluctantly, hoping that somewhere down the line Smith would provide us perhaps with the early adventures of my new friend, Huy Ben-Amon"},{"Title":"The Sunbird","review":"The one star rating is no more than a warning that the Kindle edition has hundreds of typographical, spelling, punctuation, spacing, formatting and other errors. Do not purchase the Kindle edition unless you hanker for books which read like distracting and illiterate emails, text messages and the like. Friends say the print edition is error free. In fairness to Kindle, I received the device several days ago as a holiday gift, and have read only a few books on it. The others were not butchered."},{"Title":"The Sunbird","review":"This book is about an Archeologist who discovers the remains of an ancient city in Africa and works to uncover the history of the city and people who lived in it. His dig is funded by his best friend, an incredibly wealthy and cultured man who also has an interest in history and in Africa. The first half of the book is this story and the second is the story of the people in the ancient city, it is done in a way that the characters parallel their contemporary counterparts.This book had some really good parts, what I admire is that Wilbur Smith was able to create such a vivid picture of the ancient civilization. It felt very real rather than romanticized and was very rich in details. While I thought this was good writing, it was also somewhat grotesque to read and not enjoyable to relive the suffering and brutality that the people went through. The story was also an interesting concept and kept a fast pace moving along.I agree that most of the characters were over embellished, their personalities being more grandiose than real. The central characters were described as being a certain way rather than shown through the writing. Also, in the book I was often unclear what their motivation was for what they did, or what the purpose of various scenes in the story were. I agree that the story is strongly bigoted. The archeologist gets to the site and discovers a cave that is well known by local Bushman. The area is beautiful, pristine, and prized by the Bushman as a spiritual refuge. They then find the ruins of the city and proceed to turn the whole area into a big excavation site with generators, a landing strip, security and houses. The archeologists describe having to 'pay off' the government to excavate the site and how they will move the findings to important museums--Which are obviously in Europe. There seems to be little to no respect for the indigenous people of the area. I also felt that the author did little to teach the reader about the history or the people of the area.Overall the book was interesting; but I did not feel I came out of it with something more. It was fairly one dimensional. An amazing book that I would recommend is 'The Mists of Avalon'.The Mists of Avalon"},{"Title":"The Sunbird","review":"The trick to making this book into a movie would be the casting of Huy Ben-Amon. Danny Devito might possibly play the part, if he practiced with a battle axe for an extended period of time. The real charm of this book is the duality of characters and their parallel existence in Africa's distant past and in the present-day researchers investigating that past. An interesting alternative to the white/black conflict of the book might be the casting of both sides as black. What I would hate to see lost in this novel is the wonderful characterization of Huy Ben-Amon."},{"Title":"The Sunbird","review":"I have read thousands upon thousands of books in my lifetime, but never have I read such a magnificent story as this in all of my 36 years. I first picked up this book at the age of 19, and have read it probably half a dozen more times since then. It is the only book that I have read more than once. Probably geared toward males in general, and not for the weak of heart or stomach. If you don't enjoy this book, you're probably either partially illiterate, lacking honor, courage or some other desirable personality trait. The Croatian reviewer below probably read a bad translation of the book, or has been mentally affected by the recent ethnic conflicts in his country."},{"Title":"The Sunbird","review":"This is by far the best Smith novel I have read - comparing it to the likes of &quot; The River God, Seventh Scroll etc.&quot;Right from the word go, Smith's style captivates me. Judging from the detailed sketch of the country this epic takeks place in, he knows how to do his research down to the lats grain of dust. I'm free to say this as the country he writes about is my own country(Botswana) for those of you who have not read it.This is a must read."},{"Title":"The Sunbird","review":"This book should be purchased with an eye toward Wilbur Smith's strengths as a writer and not as a literary piece. Smith's works are entertaining and adverterous, but little else. His characters are fully developed, but hardly plausible, as well the plots in his book. Think of his writing as a fun trip to an amusement park like Disneyland. The &quot;Pirates of the Caribean&quot; was not intended to be believed, but simply to entertain the imagination. Little more than an afternoon spent escaping reality. So too, this book."},{"Title":"The Sunbird","review":"A page turner from the very beginning, another fine book by Wilbur Smith.

This book moves!! After the first few chapters, it takes off with action and supsense causing you to intially try to guess whats going to happen next. The only problem with guessing what is coming next--there is always something that comes up which capsizes your ideas. I like the business environment that the book takes on (mergers, acquisitions...etc.) which gives it a Grisham touch, but the action soars literally with Jake's plane ride down south (the main character). I loved the details given about different settings such as the workings of Jake's plane's engine, sailing on expensive luxury yachts, business transactions, exotic island villas with romantic ocean breezes...etc. Little tidbit details like that add to the storyline and set the mood for the book. The story takes you to different islands and the setting is always changing which enhances the mystery as the plot builds. I must say that the main character doesnt have much luck in holding on to his female characters in the book. But I did like the one that he ended up with in the end. [...] I am eagerly looking forward to the author's next book. I find myself already guessing which characters, if any, will be carried into the next book; but then I realize that no matter what I think, the author will surprise me once again."},{"Title":"Storm Keeper","review":"This is the story of Jake Turner and his dealings with Megers and Aquisition.

Warren has penned a fast-moving page turner that will please even the most die-hard fans of Clancy, Grisham, and the like.

I was mistaken. The story is okay, but the grammar, punctuation and sentence structure is terrible. There are commas where commas shouldn't be, there are no commas where commas should be (creating hard-to-read run-on sentences), there are numerous instances where semi-colons are miserably abused or used incorrectly (some where colons should be, some where commas should be and some where nothing should be).Overall, I think the author should take a serious look at basic writing techniques. He should buy &quot;The Elements of Style&quot; by Strunk and White.I must relent, however: The story is intruiguing and DOES move quite nicely. The plotline is good and could be very engaging if the above mistakes hadn't been made. I give my full respect to the author for keeping me enthralled, despite his many grammatical errors.If this author had a really good editor, this book would be a VERY, VERY, VERY good book."},{"Title":"When Dogs Bark","review":"When dogs bark reads like a hot breeze in August in Las Vegas, truth so intense you can't help but acknowledge its presence or suffer in its rage.

The authors share their collection of photos with the tenderness of one sharing a personal photo album. This volume is 136 pages of beautiful vintage photos with information about the photos and the subjects. Literary quotes and poetry appear occationally to maintain a nostalgic childhood memory. Although this book has a great deal of value in recording dolls and clothing from different decades (before 1950), the biggest asset of this book is its emotional value. The predominantly female subjects hold their dolls tenderly and show them off proudly. It is a sentimental journey into America's past that the reader can easily indulge in."},{"Title":"Cherish Me Always: A Century of Dolls, Antique Photographs of Children with Dolls","review":"I found this book disapointing and narrow in scope. It's a book for doll collectors who don't have other interests. There are about a hundred reproductions of photos of children with dolls, from about 1880 to the 1950s, photos reproduced from postcards, greeting cards, visiting cards, etc. The photos are poorly reproduced and poorly arranged on a beige-pink background which does nothing for them and are accompanied by uninformative comments like, \\"This wistful girl in elaborate costume holds what looks like a German \\"dolly faced\\" doll.\\" Many of the photos show children who seem to be related to each other, they have these funny ears that stick out like bugles and one gets the feeling that they are from a single private collection from a region where there are problems of consanguinity. The photos are not in chronological order so you can not use it to see how doll clothing styles changed over time. There doesn't seem to be any order to them at all. There are a few schmaltzy poems and that's about it for text.

Doll restoration and preservation is my avocation, and so the book is an invaluable resource for finding real examples of how the dolls were dressed, and what the children wore. It was refreshing to see such variety, and to see that, then as now, not all dolls were \\"dressed to the nines.\\" Some were simply dressed by their owners or mothers in sturdy clothes to play with. When faced with the task of replacing a doll dress on an antique doll, I am going to use this book as a reference. For me, the book is a new and valuable resource in my personal library.

If I hadn't been stuck on a plane and had nothing to do, I would have happily left this book in the airport club or the hotel wastebasket. I would not have wasted my time reading it.It is very hard to get wrapped up in a story about the two main characters when their only interactions include meeting at a school for a few minutes and several quick visits to a skating rink. Less than 20% of the book is devoted to them. And while the story of Giselle and Garek is somewhat interesting, way too much time was devoted to them. There really was no plot. Just conversations of Giselle and Garek. Even the characters mentioned in the beginning of the book, Val, Edward, Melissa etc. melt to nothingness by the end.

Characters were mentioned at the end of the book that I didn't recognize (due to lack of character development). Ms. Stone's books were always a guaranteed buy for me in the past.

Katherine Stone spent too much time explaining and narrating. The story obviously couldn't stand on it's own. There was no development of passion. As soon as the characters Pierce/Liam meets Anastasia he is &quot;suddenly&quot; in love with just a short conversation. As soon as Giselle meets Garek she opens up and tells her whole life story. Where was the magic? Anastasia is always just &quot;cold&quot;. I liked that there were actually two romances but that just left more explaining and narrating. I like much more interaction between characters. No action here and NO steamy love scenes to be found. Save your money. This is definitely not one I will save to read again later."},{"Title":"Island of Dreams","review":"This should have been listed in the fantasy catagory. It was ridiculous. What a let down after reading so many of her other books and enjoying them so much. Any character that has their entire head of hair change color overnight all by itself &quot;twice&quot; in their lifetime is definitely unbelievable. This book seemed as though she couldn't really make up her mind about the main storyline. Either a sequel to a past book or a new story based on a new characther. The character she had. Any real story about him she didn't. Definitely wait for paperback if you're that desperate to read it."},{"Title":"Island of Dreams","review":"I've been a Katherine Stone fan from her first novel.... and have so looked forward to each new release. This book, however, was extremely disappointing. I felt as though Ms. Stone has discovered a &quot;formula&quot; and just wrote this book to fit the formula. Man meets woman - one or both have tragic pasts - they fall instantly in love - and basically the rest of the book is padding. The story was disjointed, and I felt the characters were &quot;forced&quot; on the reader, and instead of letting the reader &quot;get to know&quot; the characters and fall in like with them. This is not one of the romantic, spell-binding, touching stories Ms. Stone is known for."},{"Title":"Island of Dreams","review":"I am not a very picky reader. I like anything that is written well. This book was not. The shift from the present to the past was not done well and left the reader with guessing games to play. The summary on the back of the book makes you believe that there is a bit of magic and mysticism to the book, but that is not the case.The characters are likeable characters, but the author should have focused the story on the interesting ones, Garick and Gigi rather than Anastasia and Liam/Pierce. I was intrigued when I saw the events that led Liam to become Pierce, but it had no bearing on the actual story.Such a shame-- this book had potential but blew it. This was my first Katherine Stone book and likely will be my last."},{"Title":"Island of Dreams","review":"I was extremely disappointed with the new book. I waited patiently for Ms. Stone's book and it is as if she has thrown in information from every direction, barely tying it together. I found myself putting the book down over and over. It is almost like someone else wrote this latest novel. I was impatient with the whole mishmash of story lines."},{"Title":"Island of Dreams","review":"I usaully love Katherine Stone books. However, this one was terrible. I got to page 100 and realized I was wasting my time. I didn't think it was written well and I found it hard to believe that Pierce fell in love with Ana after one meeting. I will think twice about buying another Katherine Stone book. Her earlier works are far superior."},{"Title":"Island of Dreams","review":"Island of Dreams hooked me right away and didn't let go. I really liked Giselle and Garek (who was an intriguing secondary character in A Midnight Clear). Their story truly moved me -- it was definitely destined to be!"},{"Title":"Island of Dreams","review":"I really enjoyed Island of Dreams, especially after reading A Midnight Clear. It's a terrific sequel, but it IS a sequel. So read A Midnight Clear first."},{"Title":"Island of Dreams","review":"While I eagerly awaited the debut of this book and the conclusion of the mystery about Grace Quinn, I was disappointed with the storyline. The character development was not as thorough as I had hoped it would be, and I found the coincidences that caused the characters to meet to be very unbelievable. I did not enjoy this book as much as I enjoyed A Midnight Clear or Home at Last, the other books involving these characters, but it does tie most of the loose ends left in the previous novels"},{"Title":"Island of Dreams","review":"Ms. Stone's books are to be savored. But, as usual, on the first time through I read it quickly, wanting to find out what was going to happen. When I read it again, the beautiful writing really struck me, as did the depth and richness of the characters. Terrific book."},{"Title":"Island of Dreams","review":"Katherine Stone's Island of Dreams is meant to be the sequel to A Midnight Clear. It continues that magical story with magic of its own. I loved it. Ms. Stone touches the heart again."},{"Title":"Island of Dreams","review":"Island of Dreams was amazing. I loved it. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Island of Dreams","review":"I love Katherine Stone's books, that is until I read this one. This is a story that did nothing but bore me. Again do not get me wrong I do enjoy Ms. Stone's other works but this one is a real stinker. The was no plot or character development, she never gives you a chance to care about any of these characters. The only character in this book that I appreciated was the glass sculptures. Ms. Stone does have a way with desribing surroundings that makes you feel like you are there or want to be there. (That's why I give it 2 stars). If you want a book of Ms. Stone's that has everything a good story should have, characters to care about, a plot that drags you in, and a world around you that seems to good to be true, I recommend two of her early works- &quot;Pearl Moon&quot; or &quot;Rainbows&quot;. With either one of these you will not be wasting your time as with this book."},{"Title":"Island of Dreams","review":"Island of Dreams is one of the best books I've read. I was completely drawn in by the story and loved the way the characters lives were intertwined. Ms. Stone's style is very unique, and, given some of the comments below, it's obvious that either you love it -- or don't. I do!"},{"Title":"Island of Dreams","review":"This is such an amazing book! Soooo well written and soooo involving. Are others on this page reading the same book?"},{"Title":"Island of Dreams","review":"I just started listening to this book and found it really hard to get into. I decided to look at the reviews and all of the 5 star reviews just say A customer. Is that even legal in Amazon? Author, if you are going to falsely inflate your rating, at least get some reviews with names. This is really, really obvious and you should be embarassed!!!"},{"Title":"Island of Dreams","review":"After reading 'Thief of Hearts' and loving it, I couldn't wait to read Island of Dreams. What a let down! There are two sets of main characters whose lives bisect over a long ago mystery. There was plot but no pizazz. The characters instantly fall in love, then fight it until the last 6 pages of the book. I don't understand what the attraction is as the charcters weren't developed well.The opening chapter was so compelling that I thought it was going to be another 5 star winner but it spiralled downhill quickly. It had so much potential! It's as if Katherine wrote the first chapter and then someone else with little writing talent finished it. It was so inconsistant with other books I've read of Ms. Stone's. Pass on this one and read one of her other books."},{"Title":"Island of Dreams","review":"I began reading this a year ago, made it to about page 100, then put it away - too boring. I decided to give it another shot last week, and STILL couldn't get past page 100 or so. Pierce and his sister Val were in fact quite interesting in the beginning, but all of a sudden, the story turned very boring.And, as with nearly all KS's books, we're introduced to secondary characters (couples), but in this book, none were very interesting, none worth getting to know.Pierce was handsome enough, smart enough, and was even fairly witty, but he finds himself in love with Ana after an extremely brief acquaintance. A very typical pattern for KS's main characters; two strangers spend an hour in 'deep' conversation, and suddenly the GUY is in love with the GIRL, rarely the other way around. This tends to make her heros kind of wimpy, wearing their hearts on their sleeves. The guys in KS's books fall in love so ridiculously fast and fawn so stupidly, they practically grovel emotionally at the girls' feet. I find it foolish and not very attractive. Though not true in this case, a good story-line usually keeps these characters somewhat interesting."},{"Title":"Island of Dreams","review":"Ms. Stone is one of my favorite authors and I have read every novel she's ever written to date and have enjoyed them all immensely but I am sadden to say I was quite disappointed with Island of Dreams.I made a good decision when I decided to wait for paperback edition after reading a brief description of it in &quot;PW&quot;. There are too many missing pieces in the storyline to make it work. This story could have and should have been good one but Ms. Stone left out a lot information which would have made it an interesting read. Sorry Ms. Stone &quot;Island of Dreams&quot; just didn't do anything for me."},{"Title":"Island of Dreams","review":"I usually love this author . This book was one of the worst I have ever read. No plot what so ever , no character development. I read the entire book , and hoped it would get getter as I got into it. It didn't !!. In the first couple of chapters you can guess the entire story. I'd rather have a root canal than suffer this kind of story. Save your money &amp; don't bother with this one"},{"Title":"Island of Dreams","review":"Island of Dreams fails to live up to its promise - and is one of the silliest books I've read since Eloise James' \\"Potent Pleasures\\". An earlier reviewer touched upon one problem - it read like a 200 page intro into a longer book. It starts out well, if a bit confusing - a prolog that take place 23 years before the main action, of which, the first part of the prolog actually describes events that took place thirteen years before that (which means that the some of the driving events took place 36 years before the novel actually starts).The book then jumps too quickly to the modern day - but relies again on a long exposition of the past. We are also treated to a five page (which felt like fifty page) monologue in faux kiddie speak, to fill us in on the hero's background.The hero and heroine actually only have three scenes together in the entire book - the initial meeting, a brief scene at the \\"Island\\", and the climatic scene when the heroine's true identity is revealed.Between these meetings, we are treated to a secondary story that takes up far more time (and perhaps deserves a novel all on its own). We are brought current on the state of these pre-existing characters through the same hackneyed method that the author used earlier in the book - a long winded exposition by a minor, unnecessary character.It honestly seems that none of the characters ever really talk to each other, in all but two occassions - key information is passed along via third parties.However - readers should note that the secondary story line ties up loose ends from the aforementioned \\"Midnight Clear\\" and also \\"Home at Last\\" - and frankly - it would have been very nice if someone, somewhere in the cover synopsis, mentioned that this is part of that earlier storyline (that's the publisher's fault).Without wasting more time, and revealing the obvious - this is a story that take advantage of every cliched coincidence the author could exploit.This book, like nearly all of Katherine Stone's other novels, suffers from bad editing, and an author who doesn't understand that a linear storyline is really rather essential to the type of fiction she is trying to craft. A few words of advice:1. Start from the beginning of the tale, and work forward; avoid extended flashbacks. But if you can't avoid using flashbacks, only use them once in the book.2. Allow your main characters to drive the story, having secondary or tertiary characters give long expositions is not good storytelling.3. Stick with one set of main characters - don't shift mid-novel to focus solely on another set of characters.4. Have your main characters actually interact - three scenes together does not a romance make.5. Avoid mass use of coincidence to drive a plot. If your plot isn't strong enought to develop without multiple coincidences, you need to change your plot altogether.The first, and perhaps best Katherine Stone I read was \\"Midnight Clear\\" - which I started and finished in St. Louis - Lambert International Airport, with rivers of tears running down my face. Since then, I've read numerous K.Stone novels, and not one of them has remotely come close to displaying the same level of intensity that Midnight Clear did. After so many disappointments, that one book was clearly a fluke - Ms. Stone is not the writer she clearly wants to be."},{"Title":"Island of Dreams","review":"An emotionally powerful story of many kind of love -- father/son, father/daughter, mother/daughter, uncle/niece, friend/friend...and woman/man. Wonderful reading on many levels."},{"Title":"Island of Dreams","review":"I love Katherine Stone's novels, and this was no exception. She always delivers enthralling stories beautifully written."},{"Title":"Island of Dreams","review":"A good book, but not Katherine Stone's best work. I enjoyed it, but there wasn't the character development, and the ending was very obvious before halfway through the book.This wouldn't be a good starter book for new Stone readers; I would recommend her earlier works first. You'll appreciate this book if you enjoy her works, but I doubt it will be a favorite."},{"Title":"Island of Dreams","review":"I just go with the flow in her books, drift for the read, the ride, and the dream. Island of Dreams was one of her dreamiest, more so than some of her others. Maybe that's why the reviews are so mixed (and in opposite directions with very little in the middle). I thought it was great -- the perfect sequel to A Midnight Clear."},{"Title":"Island of Dreams","review":"Thirty-six years ago in Denver, carpenter Gabriel Rourke saved the life of ten year old Valerie Prescott from a slick, charming pediophile. Val's wealthy parents offered the world to Gabe, but he wanted nothing until thirteen years later. He called Val's dad Edward to ask for a favor. Edward never forgot and agreed to come over that night. Edward accompanied by his wife, Val, and her fianc&eacute; arrives at the Rourke home only to have Gabe commit suicide. The &quot;music&quot; had stopped for Gabe when his beloved wife was murdered. Now Gabe wanted Edward to care for his son Liam Pierce, which the entire Prescott family does.In the present, Uncle Pierce, the city's leading architect, arrives at the Hazel Traphagen School for Girls to pick up his niece, Val's youngest daughter. There he meets the new librarian, Ana Finch, who suffers from a horrible headache and is bone cold freezing. Ana explains to Pierce that she suffers the aftereffect of some children lacing her lemonade with date rape drugs. As Gabe and Ana begin to fall in love, he must overcome his aversion to that &quot;disease&quot; that killed his father and she must learn that dreams can come true.ISLAND OF DREAMS is a 100% proof contemporary romance with some elements of suspense that will entice readers to search for Katherine Stone's backlist of novels. The story line centers on two nice, popular, but emotionally scarred individuals finding and struggling to maintain love. The secondary characters, mostly the Prescott brood provides insight into the motivations of the lead couple, especially Pierce. Fans of contemporary romance will fully enjoy this enchanting tale even as they will dream of future weddings on Liam's Island.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Island of Dreams","review":"This was the first book by Katherine Stone that I have read. I have read one other since I first read this book and have read this book a second time since then. (about 6 months ago was the first time) I definately disagree with the other reviews in the fact that I didn't consider it boring. No it is not an action packed sit on the edge of you seat book. But, it is a good read in my opinion. It has kind of a calm story line, gradual and not too suspenseful (sp) It is one of those stories that you go aaahhh how sweet. Maybe a touch on the corny side but I read it twice and liked it. I don't usually read books twice either. Would I recommend it? Well if your looking for suspense and action then no. If you like just a sweet kinda fairy tale tyle story then yes."},{"Title":"Island of Dreams","review":"This was an excellent story. Ana as well as all of the key characters had their share of hardships to overcome. I love happy endings.However, the story revolving around each key player should have blended better. I found the reading a bit choppy.The story was excellent, Katherine made it easy to just love Ana and Liem, Gigi as well as Garek. You will find yourself praying things will work out for everyone. The blending of each character could have been smoother."},{"Title":"Island of Dreams","review":"I assumed the book (on tape) would be a love story from reading the back cover. The story is more about different characters lives than a romance. Mabe I found the story confusing and boring because the reader was horrible! I kept hoping that each new tape would be better and more interesting, but it only got worse. This was a real waste of my money, save yours."},{"Title":"Island of Dreams","review":"I loved this book and didn't find it confusing in the least.(I have read A Midnight Clear, which is its prequel). To me, the characters were wonderfully developed -- the men, especially, Pierce and Garek, both incredibly dreamy, honorable, strong."},{"Title":"Island of Dreams","review":"Once more Katherine Stone has written a story guaranteed to squeeze your heart. What else would we expect? There is a great deal at stake in Island of Dreams and Ms. Stone reveals the odds,and her brave and exciting characters at just the right pace. This is yet another book for Katherine Stone lovers--both those already hooked, and those yet to be hooked."},{"Title":"Transfusion Medicine","review":"This book is a clear and concise review of the major, and in some cases not so major, areas of transfusion medicine. It is well written with a very clear style. The content coverage is superb and the appropriate references are given allowing one to track concepts back to their source.Other books offer more in-depth review of the individual topics discussed but this book does the best job of evenly covering the major topics at a level appropriate for residents, fellows, and physicians interested in transfusion medicine. This book should be required introductory reading for all clinical pathology residents."},{"Title":"Transfusion Medicine","review":"This book, like the first edition, is a truly excellent review of basic concepts in Transfusion Medicine, with enough advanced concepts and details to satisfy pathology residents studying for board exams. Dr. McCullough has gone out of his way to produce a book that is as current as can be, reads easily, and is just plain stuffed full of practical and theoretical information! An added bonus is that since Dr. McCullough (a former editor of the journal TRANSFUSION) authored all but one of the chapters, the book does not suffer from the uneven writing that damages too many Blood Banking books. He is a terrific writer, and this is an outstanding book."},{"Title":"Transfusion Medicine","review":"There is an enormous amount of info packed into this relatively small and easy to read paperback!!! Now in its second edition (fortunate, because my first edition text is pretty well worn from use & study), this book gets slightly larger but still should be required reading for any path resident while on the TransMed service----you can easily get through it in a month. I also found it a fantastic resource when studying for transmed boards (although that's been a numer of years ago for me). At the time, I'm pretty sure Dr. McCullough wrote many of the boards questions!!! hint, hint Now that I am in practice as a general pathologist, I still occasionally turn to this little book! BUY IT!"},{"Title":"Burlington Northern Adventures: Railroading in the Days of the Caboose","review":"I received this book from my Parents at christmas and thought that my Parents had lost it. I called to remind them that I wasn't 10 anymore. However, I took the book with me on one of those boring flights to no where. Much to my surprise this book was an incredibly funny set of stories about growing up around the railroad as a child and subsequent stories about working late nights on the railroad in the frozen Northern reaches of the midwest.The stories had me laughing out loud. I truly felt bad for Brotherton as he was convinced to sleep in a camper in -40F weather. No matter how bad I thought some jobs I have had were, they don't compare to having to switch out rail cars in sub-zero weather in the middle of the night. In fact this should be mandatory reading for whiney teen-agers who complain about their jobs.I finished reading the book before my 3 hour flight was over and I wished I there was more.I can also see why the railroad would be upset by this book. I can imagine that they wouldn't want anyone to know how they run their business as no one would work for them. For me, I bought several more copies for my staff as this is much better than \\"Who Moved My Cheese\\" and if any of them think they have it bad, it could be worse, much worse.Great Book!!!!!"},{"Title":"Burlington Northern Adventures: Railroading in the Days of the Caboose","review":"The old saying that says--paraphrased--'the closer you are to an event the less accurate the newspaper reports and/or stories of said event is.'I hate to cut down a (presumed)railroader, but found at least one of the stories not only libelous in content, and grossly inaccurate. The chapter/episode about the MILWAUKEE QUEEN was false and very nastily exaggerated. How do I know that, you will ask...and I will tell you.I am the Milwaukee Queen (Though I was seldom called that, except as a kind of mean nickname)...I worked out of Alliance, NE for 13 years. I do not resemble the crude caricature he described. 1) I have never weighed 350 pounds in my entire life. 2)I have tattoos--but not those he describes. 3)I have never read Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy. 4)My hair was always clean, held back by a colorful bandanna to keep the ubiquitous coal dust off of it. 5)I had only three years on the Milwaukee Road, not six, and was not laid off up in St. Paul--I quit with blessings for more steady work out in Alliance. 6) I never rode on a motorcycle until 1983...and only with my husband at the time. Neither of us were what you would call 'bikers', though both of us loved tattoos for the artistry. 7)He fails to mention the fact that I was an exemplary Conductor in our West Pool...and my Delay Reports were used as examples for new guys getting promoted....etc. (((sigh)))Since he mangled THAT episode (and I sure as heck don't remember HIM at all) I wonder how screwed up the rest of the stories are. If his memories of me were that exaggerated, how exaggerated are the others? I hate to think....The episode following the one about me, he describes the wreck on Angora Hill that happened in winter of '80--most of the facts are exaggerated and distorted. I know, firsthand since I was working the yards the night of that wreck. I heard it all over the radio. I heard about the wreck details from officials at the yard office that morning--and Brotherton's reportage sucks.I loved the BN for the precious memories I have of working there. It was a great Railroad. I was lucky and honored to be a part of it.
