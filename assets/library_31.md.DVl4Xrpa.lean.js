Magical!2 thumbs up!!!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"A book about sorrow, questions, passions, very erotic and captivating. Loved it! A book about human nature and types - Louis, the analythical type, Lestat - powerfull, Armand - charismathic, sophisticated and sensual, Claudia - cold and calculated. A drama of imortal life when all you know & love changes and you can't understand. Viewed by Louis, life is so sad. I believe Louis is the first depressive vampire in all the stories, a vampire with a human soul, suffering each time he kills. Such a cold immortal heart and yet such pain. Looking for a master more than for answers he hates Lestat, not a good teacher, he loves Claudia but in spite that love he still feels miserable and alone. He thinks he finds in Armand someone to guide him, someone strong. Armand is the best vampire-character ever created. Anyhow, much, much better than the film!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This has been a truly MARVELOUS book to read. I just finished it yesterday and was engrossed with it. Spellbound. I saw the movie first and was intrigued by it, as well as intrigued by my recent interest in New Orleans and Concrete Blonde's song &quot;Bloodletting&quot;. I wasn't sure how much I'd like the book due to the fact that I'm not a typical vampire-obsessed Anne Rice fan.. I've never read her before now. But this story was so compelling that its magnitude surprised me. It saddened me how the interviewing boy treated Louis' confessions at the end.. the movie ended very differently. The entire story is tragic yet eloquently beautiful. Read it, read it, read it!!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This book starts very, very slow, but picks up quickly and finishes very well! When you read it, stick with it through the dull parts, it's worth it."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Many people reccomended this book to me, so though i had little intrest in it i read it. I finished this in a week end because it was THAT GOOD.Though the book itself is very dark, Rice threads in amazing descriptions that make the book very beautiful. Rice lets the reader not only connect with Louis, but gives then an in depth look in to the inner workings of his mind. The story is always beautiful, always dark, erotic, thought provoking, and compelling. A must read for anyone who appreciates good literature and the supernatural. Amazing book."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I started to read this book because my mun recommended it to me. It was the first book of ANNE RICE i read. At first i feel bored with it, but when i tried to get through it, i found myself addicted to it. The book is not too long(compared to other ANNE's book) but still took me one month to finish it."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I have been reading portions (one or two pages at a time) of this book in random order on three to six days per week for about three years. I thus have a vague notion about the story it tells, and the relationships of the characters, but I could not explain the narrative in chronological order. The writing is beautiful, as lulling as warm water, and I literally cannot read more than two pages without becoming drowzy, feeling compelled to turn off the light and go to sleep. That's why I read from this book almost every night -- I open it wherever it might fall open, it seems to be a great book, well written with interesting characters and incidents -- but it simply puts me right to sleep every time I read from it. It's downright hypnotic."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This book is so long; it has to go into the detail of every litte thing that happened to Louis. I loved the parts where he was talking about how miserable it was to have to live forever, but then it goes into how he hates Lestat and discusses every movement Claudia makes, and yadda-yadda-yadda! This book just goes on and on and on. Just rent the movie, it has everything the book does, and isn't 300+ pages long."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"As the title of my review states, I found the book moderately entertaining as it chronicled the undead lives of several vampires. I credit Ms. Rice because some parts of the book are quite clever indeed such as the concept of a vampire growing weary of eternal life and a blossoming frustrated woman trapped forever in the body of an undead child. Others, though, aren't that exciting."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This is most definately one of the best horror series ever written, and the first novel starts it off with a bang. The story begins in San Francisco, with the tortured vampire Louis telling a young boy his life story. Louis is made a vampire by Lestat, who offers little to no direction in Louis's new cursed life, causing him much anguish. Their adventures, including the life of their daughter, Claudia, and the eventual parting of ways are told in an elegant, sophisticated style. The novel is dark, brooding, and gothic, the perfect atmosphere for its subject matter. This is an excellent book, and better than the movie."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"When I first read this book, I couldn't put it down. I had heard some friends talking about the Vampire Chronicles and the series sounded interesting. This book begins with Malloy, a man who \\"collects lives\\". He follows Louis into an old building, where the tale of Louis' life unfolds onto several tapes. His multi-century life tale begins with the end of his mortal life, describing how he was chosen by Lestat and taken into the world of the living dead, his search for knowledge of why he was what he was. In a turn of events, he begins a new life with Claudia, their little vampire child, until the Louis and Claudia plan Lestat's death (at the time, I hated Lestat. After reading Lestat's book, I now want to scream 'NO!' every time I read Interview). The move on to Europe, where they meet with Armand and his coven of backwards vampires. It is there that Louis finds the curse of the beauty of being a vampire - he is destined to a life of solitude and loneliness."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"With Interview With the Vampire, Anne Rice completely rejuvenated the genre which I feel to be horror's most important, primal, and soul-stirring, the legend of the vampire. I have described Richard Matheson's classic I Am Legend as the second greatest vampire novel, but I must retract that statement now. Only with a second reading have I recognized the unparalleled power, beauty, eroticism, and grace of Anne Rice's contribution to the subject. Unlike Matheson, Rice luxuriates in the Victorian appeal of Stoker's masterpiece, while taking the subject to planes far beyond those Stoker could have envisioned for his Count Dracula. The modern writer does not have to hide the vampire's erotic appeal behind convention, nor does she need to classify her subject as an evil in and of itself. The vampire nature of Rice's creation is a complex, unfathomable subject that transcends good and evil.This first novel in The Vampire Chronicles centers around four very different yet almost equally fascinating vampires. The story is that of Louis, a wealthy eighteenth century Louisiana plantation owner who became a vampire in the depths of his despair over his brother's suicide. Lestat, the inscrutable force that hovers above every page of the tale, made Louis a vampire for basically economic reasons; he wanted the wealth that Louis possessed, but he also wanted a companion. Narcissistic and vain, the dapper Lestat does not teach his creation what it means to be a vampire, does not share the secrets he claims to know, does not even help Louis through the soul-shattering change that comes about when the body dies so that it may live eternally. Louis stays with Lestat only because, so far as he knows, there are no other vampires to whom he can turn for help and instruction. His distaste for Lestat grows over the years, however, and in order to keep Louis by his side, Lestat takes a young girl whom Louis had fed upon during a period of emotional turbulence and makes of her a vampire, knowing that Louis could never abandon the child. It is the story of Claudia, doomed to a most tragic life of immortality trapped inside the body of a little girl, that makes this book so powerful in my eyes. Lestat is of course fascinating, Louis is the epitome of tragedy and a fountain of knowledge by way of his questioning, eternally sad nature, but Claudia's story is an unbearably exquisite one. She accepts her vampire nature with some ease, being too young to really ever remember her human childhood, but the growth of Claudia the vampire woman inside the body of Claudia the child is a beautifully painful thing to watch. When she manages to separate Louis and herself from Lestat to go searching for other vampires in Central Europe and eventually Paris, giving dramatic voice to both her love for and hatred of Louis, the door to the dungeons of utter tragedy are thrown asunder. The introduction of the four hundred year old vampire Armand in the second half of the book gives us yet another unique vampire soul to ponder, but Armand at his most vivid pales in comparison to Claudia at her most unprepossessing.In the end, we are left with Louis and his story, which is full of unanswerable questions. Even the meaning and lesson he tries to express about his miserable existence utterly fail in their influence it has upon the boy chosen to hear his extraordinary story. Literature really provides no better character study of the emotional meaning of vampirism than Louis, however. He became a creature of the night only out of despair, and his development as a new creature on earth proceeded without any instruction whatsoever from the cold Lestat. Thus, he questions everything about his new nature, desperately longing for a mentor. He does not relish the taking of human life, and the thought of creating another creature like himself is anathema to him. He sees vampirism as a curse, eternally wondering if he is indeed a child of Satan doomed to an immortal yet cursed life. The source of his moral suffering is his inability to really give up his human nature, and this causes him a long, long life of torment and pain. Never before had the moral, spiritual, and philosophical nature of the vampire been explored in such depth as that found in this exquisitely beautiful novel, and that is one of the primary reasons why it rivals Stoker in terms of its beauty and resonates with an emotionally hypnotic power that is unmatched in the long tradition of vampire literature."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Okay, so I was one of those kids in junior high school. You know the type: the teacher gives a reading assignment, and the kid does all he can within his power to be prepared without actually reading. Yeah, Cliff Notes, relying on others who actually read, Internet, etc...I was solidly one of those. Then in eleventh grade something life-changing happened.There were several friends of mine passing around books like they were some sort of prized possessions. It was odd. Here I was avoiding reading like the plague, but their enthusiasm for reading was catching; it piqued my curiosity. I asked what they were reading, and one of my friends said, Anne Rice! Well, I folded and bought Interview with the Vampire.WOW, I could not put the book down! I devoured it. I lived it. I breathed it. I had these burning, existential questions that would keep me up at night, and here I was reading conversations between Armand and Louis that hit on life, love, being, birth, death--all those questions that I wanted to ask of someone, some authority figure.I don't want to go into plot details. I just want to share that this book affected me profoundly. One effect being that now you will rarely see me without a book in hand!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I first encounterd this book when I was 12 and in the library looking for something good to read. The title caught my eye and I checked it out and I'm glad I did! The story, as told from the point of view of the vampire Louis tells of the love/hate &quot;family&quot; relationship between Louis, his maker Lestat and their child Claudia. Louis is having a hard time dealing with the fact that he must kill in order to exsist (some call it whining, but I call it endearing). I read this book for the first time in a couple of days (it's that good) My favorite character in the entire vampire series is Louis. I know most people think that Lestat is the hero of this novel, but Interview is Louis' tale and I understand his point of view completely. He doesn't whine, Louis just wants a better understanding of what he is and how he should feel about that. I wish Ms. Rice would write novels featuring more of him because his character is so human and so beautifully written that I look for him FIRST in each new novel by her. Some have called it too homoerotic, but I happen to like this type of romance. It is obvious that Louis and Lestat both love and hate one another and it is this relationship that is the basis of the novel. If you have never read a book by Ms. Rice, let Interview With the Vampire be your first. But be warned, you'll get hooked!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Readers who are only familiar with Anne Rice's later, more self-indulgent work are likely to be pleasantly surprised by Interview With the Vampire. I certainly was. After a disappointing introduction to the legendary New Orleans author through the weak Violin, I was only interested in reading Interview because of its role in promoting the vampire revival of the 90's. I thought that reading it would be an act of research and contrition. I was wrong.This is a strong, lush, and original (at the time, though much-imitated today) piece of writing. The blend of the erotic and the horrific is true to the spirit of the original Dracula. The attention to detail that would become so over-the-top in Rice's later books is well-balanced and poetic here. The characters are at once individual and mythic (though admittedly some of them are a little given to navel-gazing.) The dilemma of the child-vampire is an excellent addition. If you are interested in horror, in vampires, or simply in a good read, you should try this book."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I love vampires. Always have, onscreen and on the published page - from Bela Lugosi's Dracula (seen countless times on the old Saturday afternoon Shock Theater) to Stephanie Rothman's hip 1970 VELVET VAMPIRE.So it was with great enthusiasm that I approached Anne Rice's work several years ago, and it was with slight disappointment that I exited it each time. I don't know why she doesn't appeal to me the way she does to so many others. &quot;Read the first one, read the first one!&quot; my friends all admonished. &quot;It's the best.&quot; So I did. I have just finished INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE, and I'm no more an Anne Rice enthusiast than when I started. Maybe it's the book's lush overwriting, its constant purple prose, its almost endless striving to be elegant. Maybe it's the violence. Some of it does go &quot;over the top&quot;, and I am usually not a prude about such things. I don't know. I'm just left as cold as one of the blood hunters Rice depicts.Oh Rice has &quot;skills&quot;, to coin a popular teenage phrase. She can create a memorable set piece that has the reader turning pages. And there are a number of memorable moments in this book. The initiation of Claudia. The &quot;death&quot; of Lestat. The fabulous Parisian Theater of Vampires. The concluding scene with the young reporter. Each is riveting, even enthralling. But in-between those scenes there is too much chatter, too much introspection, too much - huff and gruff.I appreciate the book's classic status. And I'm going to continue reading Anne Rice, hoping the magic spell she has cast on millions of readers will soon ensare me."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"i really enjoyed this book. Its a classic, you dont want to miss the chance to read this book. The characters were so real and lively for a group of undead vampires. It tells the story of the vampire Louis and the real hardship that he faces. Lifes not easy being a vampire,you feel sad for him but the adventure you feel as seeing him on his adventure with Claudia, a vampire stuck in the body of a little girl ,and the evil vampire Lestat is incredable. Many other treats and exitment await for Louis and Claudia on the quest to meet others like them but wisdom is only gained though hardships. So enjoy and dont miss the chance to read this classic novel."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"After refraining from watching the movie for four years, I finally broke down and rented it. And to my pleasant surprise found it to be visually beautiful and tragic. Next, I became extremely curious about the book. I rushed out at midnight to purchase it and found myself totally captivated. The book is Mesmerizing, Passionate, Sensual and Tragic - or in a word - Wonderful. The story unfolds on a profoundly different level than the film. I couldn't put it down. I even read it at work. I must admit that Rice can stray and get winded at times - but she always returns to the souls of the characters - drawing the reader deeper into their experience. Also, the homo-eroticism and child seduction are present but that doesn't take anything away from the story. Instead, it adds more layers and depth to multi-dimensional characters. I will never look at vampires the same again. Next is The Vampire Lestat. I MUST find out how he got that way."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Perhaps I enjoyed this book for different reasons than some other readers, because I never was much tempted to move on to the sequels. It seemed to me that sequels might be inconsistent with the point of the story, and from what I've heard, they have been.I like good horror and a read this as such. As fantasy, it is far too disturbing. If anyone finds themselves fantasizing overmuch about gaining wealth, power, sensual pleasure and eternal life, through the regular murder of other human beings, then perhaps they need to find some other way of coping with their fear of death and devouring sense of unfulfilment.At the end, there will be a fundamental disagreement between two characters about what the point of the story should be. I was firmly on the side of Character A (and assumed this was the author's position). The sequels, however, were apparently written for all those who sympathize with Character B. Once I realized this, I was unable to read further."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This book is wonderful. I am not usually a horror fan, because unless done right, horror can be lame and boring. I used to think only King could do horror, but Anne Rice really brings her vampires to life.Louis is a depressed vampire. Being over 200, he has had a lot of hardships in life. He tells his life story to a an interviewer, who is only refer to as the boy, who he first planned to be his victim. Throughout the story, you meet many interesting characters. Such as, Lestat, Claudia, and Armand. Lestat is supposed to be mean and hated, but I can't help but love him. He's so evil and charming. You wish you could do half of the things he does.The way this story unfolded is wonderful. Anne Rice is a wordful writer. The story is sad and yet beautiful. The only problem is at times she can be a bit too descritive. The story is exciting, detailed and never boring.I rarely give books five stars, but I did for this one. Why? The books was near perfect and had little errors. I was going to give it four, but I decided on five because I know I will most likly never read a vampire book by another author that is better than this.On a final note, I've also seen the movie. I saw the movie before reading the book. The book and movie are very similar, but there are many differences. The book verison will still surprise. There's a lot of juciey little tid bits the movie left out that are worth reading. The beginning, some of the middle, and the end of the book are different than the movie. In my opinion, the book verison is better. So, even if you've seen the movie give the book a read. The only problem is you may get addicted to Rice books like I am."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Interview With The Vampire is a novel that will live on through the ages, much like the myriad number of Vampires depicted in Anne Rice's compelling Vampire Chronicles.I had been aware of Interview for several years before I finally decided to give it a read... within a couple of pages it became clear to me that this was no ordinary vampire novel... this was a gateway into another world. A world so rich and complex. Expertly drawn in vivid, beautiful detail. As I fell deeper into the tale of Louis, Lestat and Claudia, I began to feel a deep yearning to be with these characters and embrace them as family. My devotion was total.It's a soulful story, filled with a longing and sorrow that has the capacity to reach deep down into the very core of our being. For as much as the surface of the story revolves around the &quot;dead&quot;, it is very much a celebration and affirmation on the glory of life itself. For when Louis is given the &quot;dark gift&quot; by Lestat, he opens his eyes to the world around him for the first time... then quickly falls into a deep despair as he laments the loss of a life he never fully embraced. To all who see Louis, including the &quot;interviewer&quot;, it's clear that he is forever punishing himself, refusing to see that he has not been cursed by vampirism, but rather he has been set free by it. It's no wonder that Lestat grows so tired and irritated by his companion's incessant complaints and depression.That's the beauty of Interview, by revolving the book around Louis as a central character with Lestat off to the side, we actually get to see Louis through Lestat's eyes. It seems that during his interview Louis reveals more than he intended. He wanted to convince the world that being a vampire is a dreadful and lonely burden... instead he presents to us all a world of indefinable beauty and magic. After reading his tale who wouldn't want to go running into the night screaming to be made one of them.Upon finishing Interview I rushed straight out and bought The Vampire Lestat, and tore through every wonderous page like a kid on christmas morning. I was in rapture. I've read every Anne Rice book since and always anxiously await the publication of the next."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Anne Rice deserves all the fame and fortune she's accumulated! Interview with the Vampire is storytelling at its finest. I'm not a huge fan of horror, but she drew me in on the very first page, making me care about Louis, the vampire struggling with his humanity. Her language is visual, beautiful and original. Rice surprises, while making you believe. And she leaves you with a satisfying twist. A very satisfying read."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Interview with the vampire, took my breath away. Anne Rice is a master storyteller; every page pulls you in just a little deeper. And we fall in love, with Lestat. And the idea of everlasting life, and the possibility that we could in turn make the journey with him, and Louis."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Anne Rice is such an amazing writer!!! This book will take you into this wonderful world she has created and make you feel like it was created JUST for you.... well that's how I felt anyways. I have read this book three times in the last 15 years or so and I can't wait to pick it up again in a couple years. Rice has a way of making you believe her. The main character in this book is Louis and you can not help but feel for him and love him. And on the other side you can't help but love to hate Lestat, the 'villain'. If you haven't already read this book, read it now. But please keep in mind this isn't like the fluff Vampire reads out there now, you probably won't be able to read this in one sitting. Her writing is very descriptive but not in a drawn out way, I felt it was needed to create this world, to make you believe it. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Length:: 3:39 MinsVideo Book Review made for class"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Book Review: Interview with the Vampire by Anne RiceA wealthy plantation owner, by the name Louis, grieves over his suicidal brother when he was changed by the vampire Lestat in the late seventeen hundreds. Lestat's, pompous and selfish being, drives him to taking Louis's human life for his money but also for a companion. Now immortal, Louis must accept his changed body and gather the knowledge of the rare vampire race. Will he be able to find other vampires like him and can teach him about their history and ways of living? More importantly, will he be able to set aside his human morals, and kill innocents for the blood needed to survive? Read the book to find out,Finally, a book that is told in the perspective of a vampire and doesn't involve teenage love! This book, by far was the best vampire book I have ever read! Published in 1973, Anne Rice gave a new perspective of the stereotypical vampire. Set in mostly Louisiana and Paris, she gives plenty of information that allows the reader to clearly visualize the wonderful sight that Paris would have been in the seventeen hundreds. The background and bits and pieces of history that she gave about Louisiana and Paris made me feel like I was actually there in that time period.Written in first person, Anne Rice, wrote the book to not only give readers a new perspective of blood sucking monsters but also to find her religious point of view. Louis, who was Catholic, struggles to find himself as a vampire in the spiritual word of God and begins to doubt if there even is a God, for he believes he has become the son of Satan and will be damned forever. This clearly shows Anne's struggle to find her religious beliefs.The overall theme of the book was marvelous! What I took from the book was to accept the person you really are no matter what others think. It also told me to love your family with all your heart and to not take them for granted. Louis, who will live forever, becomes saddened with the death of his family members and friends because their lives end and his will go on forever until he has no one.Once again this book was such a great read and truly should be kept with your other favorite books. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves Vampire Lore, and wants to read a true classical masterpiece. This book left me thirsty for more!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I forced my book club to read this book, based on my love for Anne Rice's vampire books, which I read avidly when they first came out. While I enjoyed it the second time around, I found I had less tolerance for the whining of the characters. Most of my book club gave it only 2 of 5 stars, but there were several of us who enjoy the genre and it was nice to read something other than the typical standard book club picks. I do still enjoy Anne's writing style, but stopped reading her material when she went off the deep end with the angels and devils in the late 90s. More Lestat would be nice."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This is a tale more philosophical than active. While Rice has a rich mythology to draw from, she seems rather too preoccupied with the nature of the vampire vs. the nature of humanity. Is her protagonist damned at the start, or must he earn it?While Part Three ends with a climax, and Part Four should contain a denouement, it's more a rambling about pain and loneliness than any kind of wrap-up of the book's plot. I only intend to read the rest of the series because I am quite taken with the Taltos and am aware that the series merge."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"The super nova novel by Anne Rice sang to ever fiber of my being as a fifteen year old boy attending a private Catholic school. The angst of searching for love and the meaning of both a mortal and immortal existence has continued to haunt both my perspective of the world and my writing ever since. The love between Lestat and Louis was in fact my first glimpse into the M/M world and as their relationship swept across the sliding sands of history so too has it colored my quest for an ever-lasting love."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I read this book recently and must say that it is one of the best books I have ever had the pleasure to read. Anne Rice created a materpiece with these characters."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"What an amazing novel this is! I read it first the year it came out and was immediately enthralled. I use that word deliberately; I shut the real world out and entered into the fictional world completely. Re-reading it years later (I have done so twice), the writing is still as compelling as it was the first time: disturbing, lush, erotic, hypnotic, fevered. I do not think we would be reading vampire novels today if Anne Rice had not written this book. Alas, perhaps that would be a good thing. While they vary greatly in quality, not one of them has lived up to this one. Even Rice's later vampire novels fail to live up to her first. I find them wordy, convoluted, and in the end dull. I also resented Lestat shoving aside Louis as the central focus. Louis's torments over good and evil were much more interesting that Lestat's self-indulgence. I suppose the money was just too good. Rice wrote some very interesting historical novels, namely The Feast of All Saints (based on the Free People of Color in pre-Civil War New Orleans) and Cry to Heaven (about the castrati in Italy), but neither caught the public attention the way her vampire and witch novels did.I highly recommend Interview with a Vampire, but not the sequels. And if you like historical novels with strong gothic overtones, the two I mentioned above."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"The book Interview with the Vampire is a book many said was not that good but I like books I should not read. The book was great. The charector Louis is very facinating and compasionate. Lestat is played as and evil vampire but if you read on in the Chornicals you will discover why Lestat does what he does. Claudia is so amazing many said she made them feal sad. I thought she was great and I wish what happenes to her did not, but I guess it was part of the plot. The movie is also really good. It does not really change from the book and Kristen Dunst who plays Claudia is so good at potraying Anne Rice's charectors that it makes you think it is truely Cluadia. READ THIS BOOK YOU WILL LOVE IT. ANNE RICE IS AMAZING."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Simply breath-taking and beautifully written, Anne Rice begins a new era in horror fiction with the arrival of &quot;Interview with the Vampire.&quot; Though the block-buster movie brought the character of Lestat alive with Tom Cruise's face, the character was already a vibrant figure through Rice's careful depiction. Thoroughly researched, her books are steeped in history and study, bringing a level of validity and depth to her writing that many of her contemporaries lack. Crafted in a modern, gothic-esque fashion, the story weaves through a span of some two hundred years as the character, Louis, meets Lestat and is made a vampire. His dealings and travels are remarkably relayed, drawing the reader into the story. You cannot put it down! Luckily, this is only the beginning of the Vampire Chronicles, and the seed is sown for the remaining five novels..."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"The richness of the description, the dark psiquis of Louis and the egotistic personality of Lestat will ensnare any reader in Anne Rice's supernatural world. In this novel you will travel with Anne Rice in lush settings through all Europe, and Old New Orleans.The beat of the novel is rapid slowing only to give rich details of mystic surroundings and the feeling of the exotic characters. This novel will keep you coming for more."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This book was the first book I have ever read that was on vampires and it was also my first Anne Rice encounter. It was amazingly delious to eat up each page in my head. I couldn't stop reading until the very end. I was driven to tears about Claudia! (I am very emotional, so bare with me here....and maybe I exaggerated...ok it was a couple tears) anyway..this book was very good and I recommend it as well as any other Anne Rice book you can get your hands on."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"It was ok not the greatest. Maybe because I watched the movie before I read the book. Although I did like the differences between the two. But Louis was just starting to annoy me. Got really boring and some parts. Lestat was alright but over al the coolest person was the little girl &quot;Claudia&quot;. She was just pure evil. I loved her she was the greatest. She was the only reason i read almost all of it. She was just horrible it was great. It was over all an all right book......just read the book before the movie...."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This is the most engrossing book of the celebrated Vampire Chronicles by Anne Rice. I love it mostly because of Louis, who I prefer over Lestat. Louis is a vampire who still has his humanity, and his tormented searching is something that we can all find within ourselves. Lestat is much better as the evil and mysterious vampire in this book than the sly hero he became. The child vampire Claudia is the most heart wrenching character ever brought to life. Or is it death? A mind that is old but must stay trapped in the body of an innocent child. Because of her monstrousity or lack thereof, she is destroyed by Armand and the rest who reside at the Theatre des Vampires. After all of this, Louis finally has his humanity stripped away from him, never to return. IWTV is wonderfully, poetically written, and stands tall against its successors. Long live Louis. I hope Anne Rice writes another novel about him someday. I love this book, and you will too."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"For some this book may seem inappropiate for a 14 year old girl, but I found the book intriging..It captures you in a story of love, horror, and tradgity...I couldn't put it down...I read when ever I had a chance I took every oppertunity I had. This book is amazing! It is the best book I have ever read..I am starting on the 2nd of the cronicles now..If you read Interview with the Vampire, you can't stop with just that one book...And if you still don't beleive me on how tradgicly beautiful this book is, then read it for yourself (there are a few typos in this review, please disregard them)"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Hey. This is my second review for Amazon, and I've decided to review this book. Like many people, I first read this, and the other novels that make up The Vampire Chronicles, back when the movie came out. And like many movies made from books, the book is the superior of the two. Who among us, reading this book, has not thought about what it would be like to become a vampire, living forever and stalking the night? This book does a great job of balancing the power of the vampire with the inate sadness of being cursed never to see the light of day. But you don't need me to tell you this. If you're at all like me, you browse this site to read what other people thought about books, music, or movies that you love. If, however, you're reading these reviews trying to decide what to buy, I hope you'll take my advice. This is a great novel, and you won't be disappointed if you get it. And if you enjoy this one, look for the rest of the series, as they fill in some of the questions you might have after reading this. Later."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This was the first Anne Rice novel I had read and I was so impressed with the rich writing. Sure, lots of people think Louis was kind of whiney and self-pitying but geez, can you blame him? I loved this novel. Until my dying day I will never forget the heartbeats of Lestat and Louis as Louis becomes one of the undead. Incidently, even though Tom Cruise was impressive, I still think Sting should have played Lestat in the movie."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This book was beautifully written from beginning to end. I cried when Claudia and Madeline got burned and felt Louise's longing. Lestat's anger and frustrations, this book had it all, and will forever be a favorite.Thank you Anne, for giving me a world to escape to....."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This book was gorgeous painting for the mind. The writting flows like poetry, and the characters have been deeply built. It has changed my view of the dark and twisted tales of vampires. Anne Rice is a genius. I can't put my feelings into words about how much I enjoyed reading this book."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I read the series out of order, sitting through Blood Canticle first (eeew)because I didnt know this was still available. It is still the best. If you have seen the movie, know that the book was first, and the stories do change from page to screen. First off, the lives of Louis &amp; Lestat are far more tragic than you could ever feel the depth of on screen. There is history, traditions, subtle nuances in here you just cant watch in a movie. The characters are strongly developed. They truely are the saddest group of vampires you will ever meet. These characters are the strongest, and if you dont fall in love with them in just a few pages, your'e ,ost likely made of stone ! Ms Rice has taken a creature formerly associated with sheer terror, and made it the very sourceof all human emotion, suffering, and pain. I notice that alot of people fall in love with books in what is referred to as the &quot;prime&quot; of thier lives. In reading this, one can see why. The simple allure of being &quot;perfect&quot; and &quot;preserved&quot; forever. To have a lifetime to change, grow, and perfect ones true image. Its a book you cant put down ! VIVE Lestat !"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I had watched the movie long long ago, and my best friend (a horror fanatic) was obsessed with the book series, so I decided to read the first book. I couldnt put it down, and read it in three days. Anyone that has posted 1 star for this book should not be an influence if you want to read this book--they have no thrill for reading."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"\\"Interview With the Vampire\\" is one of the most creative stories that I've ever read. The idea of the interview in the first place is cool, and the story that Louis (the vampire) tells is very gripping. It starts out in the late 18th century when he is introduced into the world of darkness by the vampire Lestat, a wicked being who gets twisted kicks out of killing mortals. The two live together, hunting for blood, Lestat from humans, Louis (who cannot quite bring himself to kill a person) from animals. Then, Louis comes across a young girl named Claudia whose mother was killed by the plague. Louis and Lestat make her into a vampire to become their immortal daughter, and the book only gets better after this. There is a good deal of suspense, and Anne Rice writes the book beautifully. If you like dark, twisted horror, then this and its sequels are the books to read."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Alright I'm not going to give you florid details about this book or any other thing I review. I'm just going to give you the lowdown.This book is what started my Anne Rice obsession. I picked it up at the library and read it start to finish in three nights. It's such a literary masterpiece that you can not put it down. Rice's writing is superb and her attention of detail is what makes this one and all her others in the Vampire Chronicles so fantastic. If you have not read an Anne Rice book, this is definitely where you should start. It is the beginning of her work.If you're thinking about picking this one up, do not hesitate. Buy it. It's awesome. That's the lowdown, short and sweet."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"At first I was a little skeptical about this book because I thought it would be kind of a 'la de da' book (e.g. &quot;Little Women&quot;). Well, I was wrong, and now Anne Rice has become my absolute favorite author.In &quot;Interview With the Vampire&quot;, the vampire, Louis, tells about his life as a vampire. He tells us about his life in New Orleans with his maker, Lestat, who is a selfish and sometimes nasty vampire, and Claudia, their vampire child.Unlike Lestat, Louis loathes taking human lives, but he must do it to survive; Lestat often gets irritated because of this. Sometimes the two argued so much, it was hard to believe they were actually able to live with each other.The book takes us through many adventures, and some surprising twists and turns. I liked the dark feel of it; it was the kind of book I liked to read sitting by a window on a rainy day. I also liked how different the vampires were than most vampires in other novels I've read. It showed them as much more human than the typical vampire, and they weren't as evil as most would think.I would have to say that so far, &quot;Interview With the Vampire&quot; is my favorite Vampire Chronicle."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This novel, &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot;, by Anne Rice, is by far one of the best book I've ever read. It started with a young boy interviewing a vampire, and the vampire related him the whole story of his life, how he became a vampire, his thrilling adventures through the centuries and his complex relationships with both the mortals and the immortals.In my opinion, Anne Rice had done the best of jobs. The writing and the detailed descriptions, the composing of this novel, had brought out every emotion of the characters like the flick of a whip. The rage, the love, the hatred, the sufferings, the darkness, the pain and the terror, were all presented so vividly as if in front of my eyes, as if I were really part of the character.I think Anne Rice had created the most successful characters. Throughout the whole book, you can really look at the conflicts between them. They are, somehow, attached or attracted by each other, the mortals and the immortals. Their love and hate and struggles go to such degrees, and yet limited by their nature, it was almost impossible to understand it at all. I believe Anne Rice had used those characters to express humanity, the whole plot was some kind of an irony. Something like a metaphor, though she exaggerated everything to make it poignant enough.Not only were the characters a success, the time and place details were incredible. The costumes, ways of manner, history and every background changes as the years passed, and she made the backgrounds so realistic that I could almost feel everything surrounding me. I think Anne Rice had done such a great job that this book should be counted as literature.After reading the last line of this novel, I was both stunned and fascinated, but somehow quite disturbed. It really took me some time and thoughts to understand the whole plot and to sort out the conflicts, especially at the ending. Thoroughly I truly enjoyed this dark, fascinating and moving tale. Even though it was a little disturbing, I really would recommend it to anybody.OKay, above there is part of the book report I wrote on this book for English class. I just *LOVE* this book so much!! READ IT!!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"In a word, Interview with the Vampire was excellent. In two words, excellent and wonderfully-written. The story centers around a vampire, Louis, as he descibes his life from the time he became a vampire. What makes this book so good is both Anne Rice's excellent and descriptive style of writing, and the reality with which she portrays Louis's character. As you progress through the book, you can see the his character and personality evolve, from a weak and sentimental vampire to a powerful and detatched killer. His emotions play an important part in the book, from his hate to Lestat, to his love of his child-companion, Claudia, to his admiration to the arch-vampire Amand, and are almost always the driving force of his actions.When I first picked this book up, I expected a gory and grotesque story. While the plot has much action, and there are many scenes of killing and dismemberment, this book didn't strike me as a horrific one.This book isn't a very easy book to read, as the language is pretty high level and it deals much with Louis's philosophic musings and the inner workings of his mind. The plot is also sometimes very complex, and you see instances where various vampires quarrel over something that happened a century prior, and that causes the plot to be very confusing at times.I'll admit that this book didn't make me want to pick it up each time, but once I started, I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Maybe I just don't get it, but this novel didn't do anything for me. The storyline was fairly interesting, but not superb. The characters were well-developed: overdeveloped, even, in that Rice repeated their flaws. Reading, I felt as if I was being continuously bludgeoened with heavy-handed grandiose drippings of love and eternity and loneliness. This context was set tens of times throughout the novel, rather than - as I would have found preferential - set once, with the plot/storyline to develop off of it.It seems as if the human population is decisively split between Rice fans, and Rice haters. Her writing can be tedious, at times, but is never difficult to read. About half-way through, one will feel inclined to seriously question as to whether any aspects of the book will change, or if the characters - at this point, Louis and Claudia - will simply continue on their well-worn path of searching for other Vampires and endless self-speculation and introspection.This book is not without its merits: It deals with a fascinating subject matter that has romanticised mythology and spawned a film and novel genre. However, in all, I found this novel lackluster and overall uninteresting. Interview with the Vampire is worth reading if only for its place in the 'horror' canon, but not for the actual quality of the work. It exists as the seminal piece of fiction within this genre, however I may disagree with that, it should be acknowledged as such."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Probably like many others I watched the movie before I read the book and although both are sequentially similar I believe the book may have been a little better, and it was a huge compliment to the movie."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"It seems inevitable that with the resurgent popularity of all things VAMPIRE that this book would start popping up again on everybody's \\"to read\\" list. But what's popular now in modern vampire mythos is completely anathema to everything this book is, and I can't help but feel a little sad on behalf of both the unwitting reader picking this book up to satisfy what they think is going to be a quick vampire fix, and for the text its self. A quick scroll through the reviews for this and you'll see a lot of reviews starting off with BORING and WHAT A DRAG and I'M NOT STUPID BUT THIS WAS AWFUL. There's something to be said about paring off the right book with the right reader.It's funny, other than Dracula, the great now and always and forever gothic classic of Victorian times, this is the only vampire book to make it onto that much coveted and discussed 1001 Books to Read Before You Die list. And despite this, I think that this book's major failing is that, despite it's content, because it uses the super natural as a vehicle for its tale, it has a heck of a time making it into the hands of the readers who would most appreciate this. Interview is not a quick, gory, slick or even a sexy read. Heck, for those of you who like vampire sex let me spell it out to you - the vampires in Anne Rice novels are physically incapable of performing the deed. Looses something right there doesn't it? Instead what this book really is, is a relatively modern look at atheism vs spirituality with more than a healthy meditation on the ability/inability of art to become a working substitute for human connections. If you suddenly woke up one day and found that you would never have to face god, or judgement, would you continue to live as a good person? Does doing something evil render you incapable of normal human emotion? What does it truly mean to live forever? These are the questions Rice grapples with in her debut novel to varying degrees of success, and if she doesn't always find the answer she is searching for, there's something to be said about at least making the journey itself.So no, this isn't like other vampire novels out there. In fact I could say that this is the unvampire novel of the ages, the supernatural book for people burned out on tawdry vampire romances that have no conception of the true passage of time from one age into the next. If you're looking for something a bit more meaningful, if you don't mind that old fashioned Victorian style of writing where it takes three pages to say what could have been said in one line, if you can juggle the eerie feeling of encountering an antiquated set of morals against your own, then give this one a chance."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Journeying through the epic tale of Louis the Vampire's horrific story in Interview with the Vampire by Ann Rice, the reader discovers many intriguing incidents, pains of sorrow, and joy. The boy interviewing the Vampire was looking for a short interview but he ended up using four tapes to hear Louis the Vampire's life story; with the main characters consisting of the boy and four vampires named Armand, Lestat, Claudia, and obviously Louis.The novel begins with Louis still as a human and he is a prosperous plantation owner with a sister, brother, and mom. The plantation and his many town houses are located in New Orleans, were the story starts and ends. Once the vampire Lestat convenes himself into Louis's life the novel suddenly becomes frightfully exciting. Claudia, a young child and Louis are made into vampires by the malicious Lestat; Lestat made Louis and Claudia into vampires in order to live with someone else of his kind. Claudia becomes Louis's love and companion through the many perilous adventures they share.As the two set off on a journey away from New Orleans they meet the unique ancient vampire named Armand. In Paris they have a whole troupe of vampires that live in a theatre were they perform interesting shows. Armand the leader of the group makes yet another of the many life-changing events occur. The setting for most of Interview with the Vampire is in Paris and New Orleans in various town houses and hotels.Interview with the Vampire, kept me turning the pages non-stop. This terrific novel is filled with excruciating details of Louis the Vampire's many life-changing experiences. Though this particular book's genre is horror, it did not inflict nightmares on me or my colleagues, that have also read this superb novel. Ann Rice's book held a secret meaning, to enjoy life and to regard life with solemn respect."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Anne Rice's &quot;Interview With the Vampire&quot; is by far the best fiction novel of vampire lore. Rice writes with incredible ease and eloquent style that it comes across as poetic. She creates Lestat, Louis, and Claudia with such realistic vividness and vitality that they're pratically frightening. Regardless of subject matter, this book really is about people, their emotions and thoughts (or lack of), and their will to survive at any cost. It is also about love, hatred, jealousy, and betrayal, and relationships. Beautifully well-written, well-paced, and well-done. This book is a definite must-read. Highly recommended. I would say the same applies to the film version with Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, and Kirsten Dunst."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This is an outstanding book with an explosive plot. Not only does the reader get drawn into the story; you BECOME the story. Each word brings you closer to learning the true vampire experience. From the small rural town near New Orleans to the cities of Eastern Europe, the setting takes you back in time to witness killings and seductions.Strong characterization also adds to the story, making it interesting to read. Louis, the main character, is a vampire struggling to come to terms with his destiny as an immortal being. You become involved in his life, and learn how friendly vampires actually can exist. I loved to read about Louis and see how he thought and acted in any given situation.Conflict also added much suspense and thrils to the book. When Loius and Lestat, an angry vampire, often fought, you wonder how they will resolve it. Will they kill one another? Will the more dominant figure rise above te other? These are just a few questions that surface while reading.To summarize my review, I recommend this book to anyone looking for an interesting, well detailed, and heartpounding read. This page turner leaves you awed as you discover the facts of the dark vampire world."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I'll admit that I didn't here about Anne Rice until I saw the two movies based on her books. I have been buying her books and this is a very good book. Its defiantly better than the movie because there is more of a story to indulge in and connect to."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I thought Interview with the Vampire was very good. A lot of emotion. I felt like I was there listening. I saw the movie several years ago and wanted to read the book. I have a thing for vampires and plan to read her other books."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I wasn't familiar with Anne Rice works since 2010 May. Then I first time saw \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" movie and fell in love with \\"blonde vampire\\". After that movie on TV, I downloaded that movie to my computer. And found who created this story and started looking for a book. I was very lucky I found that book and ordered. It was simply curiosity to read and see which is better: movie or book. Of course it was book. After reading this book, I found out that there are even 9 more books in this serie. Of course I couldn't find any of them in my country, in any language. I felt so sad... I still was not adult and couldn't order these books from other countries, I also couldn't read in English very good. But I never gave up. I started reading \\"The Vampire Lestat\\" online and saw it wasn't that hard to read in English. But I still so wanted paper books. These electronic books are unemotional...so cold... no smell of ink...I got very insulted by some fans that I didn't have any of Anne Rice books... And in autumn a miracle appeared. They translated \\"The Vampire Lestat\\" in Lithuanian. I ordered as soon as it was able to buy and when I got it, I started reading it like a zombie. But it still was not enough. So I found out way to get books from UK by one bookstore. So I bought all serie. Of course that bookstore got closed soon and I was again sad without English books. And well.. I got job, I got credit card and could order anything I wish from all over the world. And I started collecting Anne Rice books in ALL languages, in all covers. I have many editions so far. And this edition of \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" was my dream to get because of amazing cover. And here it is- I have it. It was so hard to get these all books, I felt like living in some end of the world where I couldn't get my favorite books.I still didn't finish reading all Vampires Chronicles serie, I needed rest from these books for a little. But Anne Rice created best books about vampires of all times. In Lithuania I have no fans to talk about these books, mostly all people do not like fiction books here. But I'm so happy I found this author and can call her my God, my inspiration and creator of immortal characters I will never forget."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"well done for a first novel, i consider the ''vampire novel breeding grounds''. anne rice created a new genre of classic vampire stories! the start of a new era! that will live on for centuries...........!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Read this 30 years ago, decided to re-read, given all of the vampire shows and books around now.

I read this novel after finding the movie a delicious addition to the Vampire myth. Upon reading the book, I enjoyed every twist, turn, and detail that gave the book such a lush feel. I love this book simply because it establishes a world within a world: the character's are so colorful one cannot seem to place them anywhere else but in the world of fiction but the realistic settings and the provacative emotions make one think that these characters are real and that Lestat, Louis, and the others are real beings existing in our world.This book I believe is our modern-day Dracula and a good read for anyone interested in vampires in general, but also for anyone interested in devastatingly human relationships, emotions, and struggles"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I started this book near Christmas and wizzed thew the whole sriis (inculding Pandora) and finished recently.

Sure it might be better to look at Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise but the book is the greatest. You'll find yourself caught up in Louie's words as he tells his creepy story. You will be enchanted with the damned of the night and their myterious lifestyles. The characters have depth and emotions unlike characters in other stories. You will feel Louie's hatred, sorrow and revenge as he explains everything that has made and shaped him into the vampire he is today."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I liked this book and it was well written. However it didn't capture my attention as much as I though it would. It was my 1st Anne Rice novel. I think her writing appeals to a specific type of reader. I'll probably read her other stuff, as well."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Besides Dracula, this book is probably the most recognized and purchased Vampire title, and for good reason. Rice's style was very hard to adjust to at first, as someone who read her for the first time with this book, but once you're use to it it sucks you in. This is a very beautiful and powerful story leading through the history of a Vampire named Louis. It discusses how and when he was turned into a Vampire--at the hands of the infamous Vampire Lestat. This is a book that truly belongs in the classic literature section decades and centries from now, and hopefully it will earn its place. This is a book everyone should be had to read, and it is certainly well worth the reading."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This was the first book I read by Anne Rice. I did see the movie before I read the book but the book wasn't ruined for me. It was one of the best books I've ever read! Louis was realistic and dreamlike at the same time. He felt like a human allowing me to identify with his character. Lestat, though evil and completely awful, was amazing! I loved the elements he brought to the book.. the conflicts, the unkindness, his charm, etc. But by far, my favorite character was Claudia. She was so evil and cold.. much of the time, it was her character that made me want to read on. I love all of the characters, except maybe for Armand. And that is for reasons that are brought out near the end of the book.I highly, highly reccomend it!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This is the first book of hers I've read, and it definitely won't be the last. Sure, the fact that it's entirely a story being told annoyed me at first, what with quotes-inside-quotes and stuff, but I got over it. The plot is well-drawn and not too complicated, but it's impossible to predict what will happen next. She creates solid characters with realistic weaknesses. I liked Louis's struggle to accept immortality and Claudia's eternal form as a child. If blood bothers you, you're not going to like this, but it was told so poetically that it was easy to forget that hey, Louis is killing this guy! It's told very well from a first-person perspective, making you feel like you're right there with him, morbid as that may be. Highly recommended, but not for the very faint of heart."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I loved this book... It really got a hold of me from the first page...

Lovecraft deals with the macrocosm (i.e., outside ourselves- cosmology), Anne Rice is his equal when it comes to the nature of a person.It is ironic that, when we read about these vampires and how they feel, we learn more about human nature, and ourselves.This book deals with an interview with a vampire (surprise) named Louis, and chronicles his descent into the hidden vampiric world with the one who made him a vampire, Lestat.If you read this and like it you must continue reading the other books."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"this book is about a vampire (louis) who clames to be a 200 year old vampire. so he gets a reporter to interview him, hense the name interview with the vampire. so he goes on about his first stage of manhood into his stages of becoming a vampire. and if you like this book and I know you will the second book in the series is the vampire lestat."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This is the book that started a new wave in literature.

Knowing me I probably would not have finished this book, were it not for the fact that I really wanted to read the next books, taking place in the present. I attempted to read &quot;Queen of the Damned&quot; (book III) before I got this, and let me tell you, I've never been so confused! Well, back to the topic at hand. There are many scenes that continue on for far too long, and descriptions that last up to 2 1/2 pages. Furthermore, there are no chapers, exactly, so it's fairly difficult to find a decent stopping point. The best part of the book is the addition of Claudia, a 5-year-old girl who hold a true lust for killing. Basicly, if you want to read The Vampire Chronicals, don't try reading the best first: start here."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I seriously love this book.

I had to go and buy the others."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This was definitely the best book I've ever read so far. It is captivating, beautiful, addictive; it's not as much like my favorite movie of the same title as I thought it would be, but it goes into much more detail and explains things that you can't get from just watching the movie. A very good/surprise/cliffhanger ending too. The second I finished it I wanted to read it all over again. Anne Rice's imagery is perfectly captivating, pulling you more than willingly into the world she creates, a world you'll never want to leave as soon as you pick up this book and turn the first page."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I read this book a while ago and I couldnt put it down, and when I was done I went back and read it again.

Most of the time you don't want to put it down."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This book is a great account told by Louis, the vampire. It's sad but fascinating at the same time. It's hard to put down, and the other Vampire Chronicles are good to read after this book."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Interview without a doubt re-defined the vampire genre. Before 1976, all other vamp novels had basically been very similar to Bram Stokers 1897 classic. But all of that changed with the publication of Interview. Since then many vampire writers have followed in Rice's footsteps, with sexual overtones more prevalent than before, etc.. I would certainly recommend my favorite book to anybody who is looking for a romantic/tragic/sexy story."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This book takes you to the French Quarter of New Orleans and back! Lestat the devilish Vampire tires to come to terms that he is a creature of the night, while at the same time, tormenting the frail life of his companion Louis, who detests what he has become, but is afraid to end it thinking that the hell he will enter will be more worse thant the one he is in right now.

I would recommend all vampire chronicles, for I simply love them. You can feel the emotions, see the scenery in your inner eye and every time you read it, it will look different to you. I love it in english and german, as book and as film (some scenes I like more in the film, but most times the book is better)."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Compared to the book the movie [stinks]. This is the best book that I have ever read.

It wasn't until 6 years later when 1 of my friends told me about it. I picked it up from the library &amp; I was hooked. It's a wonderful book &amp; with such creativitiy. Interesting concept.What I thought, or didn't like about the book is that if the boy (Daniel) never spoke much &amp; Louis just kept on going &amp; going &amp; going. If he's a reporter, he should be asking, reporting.Anyways, the book was addictive, page after page of new adventures &amp; curiousity. It was hard to put down &amp; luckily, I checked out book 2 &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot; so when the book was finish, I went straight to the next 1."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"We follow the quest of Louis, made a vampire in 18th century New Orleans, to understand his vampiric nature and the meaning of immortality.Interesting story, that reminds one of a 19th century horror novel, with its philosophical questions of good vs. evil, the human vs. the bestial, as opposed to modern concetration on shock and gore."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"If I could only read one book for the rest of my life, INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE would be it. I could never tire of these twists and turns and deep emotions described from a first-person POV. I LOVE this book! If you're looking for a book that really brings you to the mind of a vampire, or if you just assume all vampires are evil, or if you want to find out what kind of sadness a vampire experiences, this is the book for you. It is incredible and has such well-written description. Read it now!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This book has to be one of Rice's most captivating books. She starts the Vampire Chronicals off with a bang with this sad, yet exciting tale of Louis de Point duLac's life as a vampire. You will become captivated and form a bond with duLac as you go on throughout the book. I applaud Rice on this magnificant tale and think that everyone should read it, no matter what culture, race or area you are. Wheather you're rich or poor you must read this book!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Interview with the vampire is about a vampire named Louie who talks about his life to a boy who is an interviewer. During the interview, the boy is frightened in the beginning by the vampires appearance. But the vampire tells him not to be frightened and he begins telling his story who he was in the beginning and how his life changed when he became a vampire.To me, reading this book felt like an adventure. I almost felt that I wasthe character dealing with who I became, and watching how the world changes over the years."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This is quite possibly the best vampire book ever written. I can't even put into words how brilliantly written this novel is. Anne conveys the excitement, the pain and the conflict that the undead of this story feel. Their world is vivid, deep and never ending. One of the best in her series and I have read it 3 times. Pay no attention to the movie, the story is different and much more fullfilling in the written version. Highly recommend this to anyone looking to cut their teeth in the vampire world."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"First off-this book was great-I was hooked from page one and now I'm at the point of doing anything to \\"meet\\" one of them-if that were possible anyway. Anne Rice makes the story come alive and she does a great job in making us think that there could possibly be vampires etc. among us (\\"woo-hoo!!!\\")The book is about Louis, who at first is mortal, and he tells his tale to a mortal, who is an interviewer (i forgot his name-ahh-sorry-he is usually referred to as \\"the boy\\") and Louis tells the story of his life and how he became a vampire (he was made into a vampire by Lestat) and he tells about his love for Claudia (a doll-like 6-year-old who feels like a daughter to him) she was also made into a vampire.I think that its a great book and I recommend it to everyone (12+ tho-because there are some scenes that I wouldnt think to be appropriate for anyone younger)I even went out and borrowed the movie from a friend after I read it-AN AWESOME BOOK!! GREAT JOB ANNE RICE!!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I love this book! Anne Rice is a terrific writter, and has amazing talent. Her history is wonderful. Louis, a two hundred year old vampire, tells how his un-dead life has fared. She introduces characters who will be in her following books. I absolutly fell in love with Louis, and Lestat, and Anne Rice's writting. Read this book!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Guess again baby. There's a whole other world of vampires that you could only dream out until Anne Rice put pen to paper and Louis came out to all the world spilling secrets of vampire lore in this the first of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicals.This truely was an eye opener for me. I read it at age 18 fresh out of high school looking for something other than plan old romance novels to read. I was initially shocked that someone would write about vampires as people with feelings, emotions coupled with Anne's love of history. I found it to be exciting and romantic. But i must be truthful there is a lull in the middle of the book to watch for but give it a try you will like it. Even if you hate the movie."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Interview with a Vampire is probably the best of Rice's vampire series. We learn of Lestat an older and immortal French vampire living in French New Orleans, and newly made Louis, a young French planter. Their affair might be homosexual if vampires did anything sexual but in Rice's vampire world sex is virtually unthinkable, they're dead you know. Louis never can make up his mind to be the vampire he is, feeling guilt feelings and drinking chicken or rat blood instead of killing humans. In his misery he makes a girl into a vampire, against the vampire rules. She will forever be a child, because she's dead doncha know. Louis and the girl set off for Europe to find the history of Vampires. It's well written, believable, and entertaining."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Reading this book after seeing the movie (something I rarely do) gives me a different viewpoint than I would usually have, and it makes the book much harder to rate. On the one hand, the book fails to be as gripping because I already know what is going to happen, and then on the other the novel provides much more detail than the movie ever could (one of the reasons books are almost always better).I was surprised to find at how closely the movie actually follows the book. Scene for scene, very little is missing in the movie, and the only real difference between the two is the ending (which has more closure in the movie).One thing I will say about the book, is that Anne Rice is a talented writer. Even though not much happens in most of the book, you will be captivated by her prose. However, I feel she plays to this strength to conceal the weakness of the story itself. Her verbose style draws out the story so long that it doesn't surprise me at all that the film makers were able to easily compress it and fit it all into the movie.Readers of classic literature won't mind this as it was the predominant style of writing. Other won't mind either because as I said, she is gifted with prose. Unfortunately, those looking for an exciting, plot driven (something fine literature isn't supposed to be) story, may be disappointed. Many years ago when this book came out, I can see this being a much more fascinating look into the mind of a vampire through the character study of the main character Louis. But since Anne Rice is pretty much responsible for oversaturated vampire craze we have today, this book doesn't seem like anything new (even if it did start it all). One does have to give credit to Rice for being the original, and this book is not bad. It's just one of those books that had it's time, and were it to be released today, would not nearly make as much of an impact. It is however good enough to get me to read the next book, and that is an accomplishment."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Rice's first novel is also her best. She'll write one better, someday, when she finally nails her vampires' coffin lids shut and moves on.Gentleman plantation owner Louis wants something more out of life - like, for it to go on longer than it does. He suffers from terrible ennui, and an even greater desire to never die, even though life's pleasures aren't all that satisfying. Enter Lestat, an elusive vampire who offers Louis what he can't resist: eternal life. Too bad it wasn't really all it was cracked-up to be.This is an incredible book. That it is a horror story is merely incidental. What this novel is really about is man's search for meaning, and his desire to uncover his own origins.At her best, Rice explores the question of immortality, and all it implies. Her vampires are perfect spokespeople for the theme: being immortal, they no longer have any need to procreate, and become stagnant, decadent and mad. The more philosophical among them, like Louis, seek greater meaning - but none is to be found. The vampire's greatest curse is boredom. Some cure it through suicide; others, like Lestat, through the perversity of evil diversions.Perhaps the greatest character creation Rice ever achieved, and one of the more interesting ones in all of literature, is Claudia, Lestat's crowning masterpiece of twisted ingenuity: a pre-pubescent vampire, who psychologically matures even as her body is frozen perpetually in youth, and who becomes the most evil of creatures, in frustrated desire, as a result.This book should be a text for modern philosophy classes. It's really brilliant, in every way. As a story, it reads incredibly well, but the whole is so much more than a mere story.Don't miss this one."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Interview with The Vampire is told from the view of Louis,the brooding immortal with plenty to say.Considering 98% of the book is in quotation marks.So why only 4 stars you ask?It's a bit confusing and most of it isn't cleared up until the second book, The Vampire Lestat.Personally,I couldn't finish it at first.I read about half of it and then skipped to the very ending,and I'm usually a very patient person.However,once I read The Vampire Lestat and re-read Interview with The Vampire I fell in love with it.Such emotion in both extremes,love and hate,can only be put down on paper through Anne Rice's pen.Or typewritter,or whatever,you get the point.Louis is a lovely creature who loves the clever Claudia,trapped in the body of a child,but not without a womans rage and Lestat is a devious little devil with his own plans in store for his 'innocent' fledglings.Or perhaps they'll get the better of him.An absolute MUST read."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Interview with the Vampire is ok. It is a little too much involved with this love affair between Claudia and Louie. It still makes for a fascinating read.The real reason you want to read this book, however, is because of all the books after this. After you read this book, they just get better and better. The next book, The Vampire Lestat is excellent, as Lestat is the coolest character. After that, The Tale of the Body Thief is even more interesting and I found that it occupied much of my time until it was done. The Queen of the Damned is by far, however, the best book in the entire series. I couldn't put this one down until I was done. Memnoch the Devil is equally spellbounding, but I still prefer Queen of the Damned. That is as far as I have gotten in the series so please give it a try."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I found the whole scene or ecense of the book captivating.The whole time Louis kept us in track with Claudia(my favorite character) and Lestat. Even on the Theatre of Vampires.The way Rice describes how Louis feels pain makes us feel the same pain."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Interview with the Vampire was quite possibly the best book I have ever read. As I started to read this novel by Anne Rice (one of the greatest novelist of our time, in my oppinion.) I noticed from the very beginning that this novel was going to be different from all the past and current &quot;cheesy&quot; vampire novels you read. About killers who show no emotion. And live without a thought or care in the world. This novel is different in the way that it shows that even immortals can show emmotion. It made me think that the character's were actually real, that they were suddenly sprung into reality by each word that passed through my lips, or in my head. To be utterly honest, I barely sleept in the 4 days while reading INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE. The reason is?: I was always curious to see what Louie, Lestat, and Claudia were up to! It's that spellbounding! Louie with his deep love for Claudia, with his lingering mortal feelings and thoughs , Lestat with his ruthless intensity and longing for Louie, and Claudia with her split emotions (love/hate) towards Louie and pure hatred and despise for Lestat. It all made for an interesting, heartfelt, wonderful, facinating, enchanting, beloved, haunting, chilling, imaginative (well, you get the idea!) novel, which I will always hold close to my heart. Also which I will carry with me in my thoughts and mind ALWAYS.........Iam forever wondering what their (Lestat, Louie, Armand, and all the others) are doing while we mere MORTALS sleep. It makes you think, hmmmmm??? (I truely miss the trio of Louie, Lestat, and Claudia.)"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"\\"The world changes, we do not, therein lies the irony that kills us.\\"Louis approaches a young reporter and begins to tell the boy his tale - how he became a vampire, back in the 18th century by the hands of Lestat, his growing love for Claudia, a vampire woman stuck in a 5 year old body, and his desire to learn more about the beast he had become.This is one of those modern classic vampire tales, one that I've been meaning to read ever since I got interested in vampires back with \\"Twilight\\". But after reading the Anita Blake series and finding that I really didn't care for most of them, I was honestly afraid with this book. I tried to read a paperback version - and I just couldn't get into it. I tried to listen to an audiobook version - but I had an abridged copy. So I made one final effort to get into this series. And boy, I'm glad I made that one final effort! This book was freaking amazing! I adored it!I really liked the time and effort Rice put into her characters. Louis, Lestat, Claudia, Armand, even minor ones like Babette and Madeleine were well-developed. My favorites were Lestat and Claudia. Lestat was completely manic, the vampire who absolutely adores what he does and doesn't spend a moment considering the consequences. I just really liked how cavalier he was; he made jokes with corpses that were just disturbing - and yet I found myself laughing! (May I just add that Tom Cruise, not necessarily my favorite actor of all time, did a supreme job at playing Lestat in the movie?) And Claudia! I had seen the movie, in which Kirsten Dunst does a great job portraying a 100 year old vampire stuck in a child's body, so I kinda knew what to expect, but the book expands on that, really gives it depth. You feel sorrow, knowing that this grown woman will never have the body that she is on the inside. That she will always be seen as a child, a little girl. The complicated relationship she and Louis have - part lover (don't worry, there is no sex, but there is eroticism), part father-daughter, part creator-creation - just accents this conundrum.I'll be honest; Louis, our main character, really got to be annoying and whiny. But you know, I've always said that I don't have to like a main character to get behind him and be interested in his story, and Louis is definitely that sort of character for me. Sure, I think he's a whiner and a loser and under-motivated, but I was always interested in his story and eager to hear more.The story itself is more of a biography than your typical \\"beginning-middle-end\\". There is Louis' desire to understand what he is, his love for Claudia, his guilt for killing so many to feed his body, but mostly, the story is just watching him through time. His interactions with Lestat. His love for Claudia. His journey to Europe to discover what he is. Exploring Transylvania and finally meeting others of his kind in Armand.The writing kinda stumped me when I tried to read the paperback, but the audiobook made it easy to breeze past the rough introduction. It's a bit hard to read a book that's basically one character telling another character a story, but honestly, I've encountered worse. Rice does a good job; the audiobook made it easier for me to imagine that Louis was telling me this story - and I think that is what REALLY helped me \\"get\\" this book.There is no doubt I will be checking out \\"The Vampire Lestat\\". I absolutely have to get more of Lestat and find out more about this creative world. I can see why this is considered \\"must read\\" for lovers of vampire fiction.Brought to you by:*C.S.

The movie was better ,watch it."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"When Louis, a New Orleans vampire, is interviewed by a young journalist, he seizes the opportunity to reveal the essence of his life, and that of vampires in general. Turned into a vampire by Lestat, whom he loathes, Louis is different from the typical vampire. Filled with scruples and feelings for those who could be his victims, he prefers to feed on the blood of animals, rather than on humans. When he feeds on the blood of a five-year-old orphan, Claudia, one night, he intentionally stops feeding before she dies. Lestat, however, finishes the job, then revives her with his own blood, turning her into a five-year-old vampire, a creature who gets older but who does not change physically. In time, Claudia, furious at her fate, decides to kills another vampire, which is the only real crime in the vampire \\"ethic.\\"As Louis unveils his deathless life, the reader is exposed to the vampire culture in New Orleans, to Louis's connections at the Theatre des Vampires in Paris (where vampires put on public performances in which humans are sacrificed), to his trip to Egypt with Armand of the Theatre des Vampires, and to his return to New Orleans and attempt to set his life right. Always, Louis stops short of behaving as a completely amoral vampire when it comes to human sacrifice. Though he sometimes must drink the blood of humans, he continues to try to learn about and change the vampire culture, and even to sacrifice vampire lives in an effort remake vampire society.Creating a vampire who is at odds with his culture, author Anne Rice creates empathy for Louis, while showing \\"five-year-old\\" Claudia to be ruthless. The internecine rivalries and resentments within vampire culture parallel those in the real world of humans, though the powers of the vampire make their \\"wars\\" far more violent. Louis, lonely, guilt-ridden, and full of despair, tries to convey to the interviewer the horrors of his \\"existence,\\" such as it is, along with its lack of \\"romance\\" and excitement, but he fails completely, as he also does with the reader, who cannot help but become caught up in the excitement of Louis's adventures. An excellent introduction to Rice's vampire cycle (and great escape reading) for those who have not yet become familiar with these stories. n Mary WhippleThe Vampire Lestat (Rice, Anne, Chronicles of the Vampires, 2nd Bk.)The Queen of the Damned (Vampire Chronicles)The Tale of the Body Thief (Rice, Anne, Vampire Chronicles, Bk. 4.)Memnoch the Devil (Vampire Chronicles, No 5)The Vampire Armand (Vampire Chronicles/Anne Rice)Blood Canticle (Vampire Chronicles)"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Wonderful! I began and didn't want to put this book down. It takes off right from the start. The novel is beautiful and exciting to read.

But I can deliciously recall many details from Anne's first book in the Vampire Chronicles INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE.It's hard to think of the many reasons I would recommend this or any of her other books that tell the story of one of her many alluring vampires, but I fail in doing so even in my own mind for simply put I haven't even the vaguest words to describe how sensationally rewarding it is to be involved with any of her novels. Her portrayals of vampires and their existence in our modern world isn't vulgar nor is it entirely fantastical. I believe the reason so many fall victim to her eloquent prose is that her characters -even through immortality - are still relatable to every reader. They are beings you would want to know, ask questions, and have in your life to learn and experience life with. Maybe that was a bit much.The composure of the stories and characters are detailed and enrapturing. A time and a place you will soon want to be. It will be with all your heart that such characters did in fact exist.Another book by Anne Rice that is not part of her Vampire Chronicles that I HIGHLY recommend is THE MUMMY: RAMSES THE DAMNED. Superb."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Anne Rice's \\"Interview with a Vampire\\" is her first, and I think, best vampire tale. As such it is original, vibrant and haunting. An actual vampire is interviewed. He describes his transition from a mortal man to an immortal vampire and he describes his moral transition from a vampire who, initially, feasts only on 'undesireables' to one who will destroy literally anyone.We see a fiend with a human outlook. We wonder how we, ourselves, would behave if we had the fortune [misfortune?] to be changed into a being with the remarkably positive trait of immortality with the unbelivably negative trait of hemo-cannibalism.

Rather, it is because, simply put, I don't think it possible she could pen such an amazing masterwork again. An achievement of this caliber is the rarest commodity in the world, and never duplicated by any one individual in a lifetime of continuous endeavor.My one critique of Rice's novel would be that, without mercy, the ending severs one's sincere and all-consuming belief in the world she has created. For how could anyone, after hearing the story told by Louis, ever desire to commit to the life of a vampire? This is how Ms. Rice chooses to end her tale, and the story suffers the unfortunate blemish of skepticism for it. Nevertheless, the story itself - no less the narrator's bewitching and impassioned delivery - is a rich tapestry of language worthy of commitment to memory. Myself a connoisseur of Hugo, Dant&eacute; and Dostoevsky, with &quot;Interview with a Vampire&quot; Anne Rice has created, in my mind, a modern classic as fully vested in suffering, redemption, and, ultimately, humanity, as anything ever put to paper by these immortal greats. This tale will live within you years after you have first consumed it and stir within you a desire to revel in its pages many more times throughout your life.Bravi... Bravi...

If you enjoy this book you'll probably want to follow-up with the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I finished this book within 3 days!! I've read many books, but never one as descriptive and intruiging as this one!! I cried along with the characters, and could actually feel as if i was there with Luis and Lestat.

By the way, I'm a young teenager, and for me to finish a book in such short time is quite an accomplishment for the author!!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Interview with the vampire is a wonderful book.

After reading her cronicles, I highly doubt most people would resist the chance of vampiric immortality."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Anne Rice is at her best in this novel. The sensory images she uses are beautiful, and the images jump off of the pages. Though, at times it is a little wordy, but soon you fall in love with the beautiful Louis, and the demonic Lestat, and the young Claudia. After reading this novel, you will want to visit all the places in New Orleans. The whole novel is beyond description. For those people who do not beleive in Vampires, you will after reading this book. No words can really describe this classic. If you want chills, thrills, and excitement, read EVERY book in the Chronicals. But, I think You wil agree, Interview is the best. Anne Rice, I hope you add more books to the series after Armad."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I worship this book!

I would recommend this book to anyone who allows themselves to get caught up in a story and really believe it, no matter how strange or irrational it may seem. Anne Rice is an incredible author.

I became transfixed with the amazing story of Louis, Lestat, and the vampire-child Claudia. When I finished the book, I was in awe. Such a romantically sad story.... It completely amazes me (for I cannot think of a better word) that Rice can write a story, that ANYONE can write a story, that actually has an emotional affect on the reader.

If you like superfical tales with little meaning, inevitable happy endings,incredibley fast paced books that lack intellect this isn't the book for you. If you liked the movie this book isn't for you. This book has a lot of meaning and if you can't handle that stuff don't read it. It shows a unique point of view (even if it is discredited in the later books) that makes humanity seem precious and beauty all the more treasured. So definetly don't read it if you like mindless horror novels. -EH"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"There isn't a foul word i can speak for Anne Rice's vampire Chronicles. I was literally swept away by the her enchanting words. I tasted, felt, heard, touched and hung on every last phrase.

Anne is a goddess in her own right."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Anne Rice is a terrific writer.I've read every book in the chronicles, and people who see this book as drab,boring or otherwise,are quite simply not READING the book.Anne Rice doesn't write for the average TV worshipping joe.SHe writes her books in a manner that actually makes a reader think.People who behave in such harshly negative ways aren't seeing the romantic side of these works."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"In reading previous reviews here, I have to say that I was surprised. Before the movie came out her books were true classics, but now with the movie out all these people lost respect for her. Sure it is not a horror book in the strictest sense, but it is a work of literary art. People who consider anyone who creatively produces a work &quot; boring&quot; need to examine their souls and see how closed they are to others artistic expressions. The first time I read was BEFORE the movie, and I felt cold chills throughout every page."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Many people intensely dislike Anne Rice's work, they hate her style, her subject matter,and the fact that she doesn't write horror stories, but tales about 'monsters' who are surprisingly like us. They laugh like us, cry like us and they suffer the same insecurities and delusions that we do. Or maybe,these critics just don't like the thought that they may not be at the top of the food chain,after all! All joking aside, this is what &quot;Interview&quot; and all the other novels are really about,food for thought. What more can one ask from a novel;spellbinding imagery and a literary style that transports the reader into another century, a disturbing walk in anothers' footsteps and an insight into the soul of the damned."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Anne Rice's first vampire novel, Interview with the Vampire, is a beautifully written masterpiece. Not only does it bring a new kind of understanding and life to one of history's most horrific monsters but also teaches us how to understand our own humanity."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Interview With The Vampire is one of the best books I have ever read, I cannot say the best because The Vampire Lestat is by far the best. Do NOT watch the film it is CRAP. The book is the best testament to what a good author can do.

This book was awesome, Anne Rice is magnificent in details that do not bore me. I loved the book, but I must say that I love Lestat and he was put as the &quot;enemy&quot; in this book. But I love Louis too, and I understand it from his point of view. I think this book gave a grand intorduction to the rest of the Chronicles and it told you about Loius. I believe that is important, to know each character and how they feel about every other character. It is true that I was drawn this book because of the movie, but I believe the book was way better. I am now half way done with Memnoch the Devil and I recommend this series to everyone. The only part I didn't really like out this book was Claudia's character. I found her very picky and spoiled and she wasn't really made to be a vampire. Anna, 14."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I really enjoyed this book.The descriptions it gave of the many characters was absolutely unforgetable.I managed to read this book 3 times and every time I did it just got so much more better that I could not put it down.But I am completely crazy about vampires so if you are reading this then take my advice:Read this book first and I promise you wont want to let it go."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"In this novel, the protagonist Louis (the vampire) \\"confesses\\" his life story (spanning centuries) to a fascinated journalist during a single night in a Miami hotel room, recounting his transformation from a near-death invalid into a blood-lusting vampire, his increasing disgust at his subsequent living death, his bizarre friendships with other vampires, and his world travels to find other vampires to help him solve the riddle of what he's become. At last, in Paris, Louis met his long-sought guru, the centuries-old vampire Armand, who told Louis what *really* kills vampires is their own crushing feeling of separation from their Creator.This is a tale of love, betrayal, and serial killing spanning centuries - a tale of the psychological conflict of killing innocent human victims. Louis survives, like humanity's ancient hunting ancestors, by killing beings he considers superior to himself - ordinary people. But unlike our ancient ancestors Louis has no transcendent myth to erase his compounding-with-interest guilt.In hearing Louis's confession, we feel compassion for him and we forgive him. In doing so we forgive ourselves.This is an excellent gritty novel. Recommended."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I've been a reader of Anne Rice for years and Interview with the vampire is still my personal favorie. The story is of the newly awakened Vampire Louis, tellind a curios boy interviewing him, of the challenges he endures. Rice definatly brings the classic idea of blood draining vamps back to life. Her usage of more then one vamp travling togather left me hanging on every last word written andthe ending itself throws quite a twist. The most inspiering thing done is the constant shift from first to third person narritive. Definatly a must read for my fellow Vampires."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Having read Interview and the first half of Lestat, I have to say that Anne Rice seems to have this remarkable talent for psychologically masochistic characters. I simply couldn't sympathize with them. Louis simply refused to be happy. Whenever it started to look like he might be happy, he figured out some way to make himself miserable again. &quot;I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints,&quot; no longer has any meaning, because now all the sinners do is whine, whine, whine. I mean, if you're a vampire, you're damned for eternity, you might as well enjoy it."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I really did. I like horror, history, New Orleans, vampires, plantations, etc. I have a degree in English Literature, just so you know I'm not an idiot. This book is not good. The story is not interesting. Why create this relationship between Louis and Lestat? It doesn't work. Why is the whole thing an interview? Just for a payoff in the end? Claudia is the only good character. There were so many things that could have been done to make this a great novel. It's not compelling. A writer who makes vampires boring is not a good writer."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Gothic pretense does not a classic makenor big words a tale ;-{Forgive me for not being awed, but pretentious hyperbole has never moved me overmuch. Anne Rice did not popularize the vampire's tale, that was done by Stoker several centures ago. Compared to Stoker's Dracula, this book drags on and on wearily like some wounded animal begging to be put out of its misery. I am more than glad to oblige. The writing is ponderous and dull, almost as if the writer were looking up bigger and more obscure words in a thesaurus. Sure the darn thing is gripping, the same way a dead man's hands are in Rigor Mortis!!! Believe me, I don't say this because this is not high literature. I'm an avid reader of comic books and &quot;trash&quot; fiction as well as poetry and literature. I do however, insist that each author should aim at one objective: the writing of a coherent and enjoyable book. Anne Rice fails to do this due to over-involvement in creating her little cult of pathetic gothic-wannabes. This book has absolutely no literary merit. If any of you want to read a good vampire's tale please pick up a book by Steven Brust - Agyar highly recommended (A lot less gore but far more interesting)."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Unlike Meyer's Twilight series, Rice's first book in the Lestat cannon oozes with Vampire-lore. Examples:1. extra sensitive hearing: \\"beating of the drum\\" (referring to the man's heart)2. don't drink after their [hosts] dead or you'll be pulled into darkness and die3. vampires increase through a kind of slavery4. vampires move really fast (Lestat's outstretched arm was a blur to \\"the boy\\")"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Rice's most famous vampire chic ... set in sultry San Francisco ... chronicling the broken heart that lead Louis to become a walking dead literally through the Vampire Lestat."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Interview with the Vampire has in a way become required reading for any fan of vampires or the acult so many people stummble upon it and some get lost in its detailed-filled pages of eighteenth and ninteenth century life, while others identify with one of many of its intresting and magnetic characters. I found the book to be very intresting in both area's. Anne Rice has a fabulus talent with bringing a character to life on the page while at the same time painting a realistic canvas for that character to live around. I found that the many thought provoking ideas about God vs. Devil, Good vs. Evil, right vs. Wronge were all captured beautifully and let me look at these ideas of life in a completly and sometimes desturbing way. But by fare the biggest grabe that the book gives to the reader is its facinating characters: from the charming and villanis Lestat to the contimplative and regretful Louis and the woman within the child that we come to know as Claudia. The relationships that each character shares with the others is also fasinating. Mostly shown in a sexual way, Louis and Lestat both are attracted to Claudia and it is left up to the reader to truely discover how fare they all went with those feelings and the relationships between Lestat and Louis or Armond and Louis. Overall I found this book to be intresting and an inthrolling read that I couldn't put down. However though, I do not think that it is the world changing event that some fans make it out to be. Read for pleasure, but don't expect the world to change."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I have ever seen the film &lt;&lt;interview with the vampire&gt;&gt;.It's so good .And I think this book must be good too"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I found this book to be okay.

I was so disappointed that I didn't finish the book, which is rare for me."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I'm not sure if this book was any good or not. I haven't finished it. I couldn't. I never thought there would be a book that I couldn't finish, no matter how bad. I could never leave a book unfinished...until I read this. It bored the pants off me. It's still sitting on my bookshelf right now. Vampires are a very interesting subject...when Anne Rice isn't writing about them. Probably not worth the $0.29 my friend paid for it at Half-Price Books."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I had heard much praise for this novel, so I expected it to be a great,intriguing read. This novel turned out to be one of the worst pieces of literature I have ever read. It was slow, unappealing, and could have been wrtitten far more laconically. This is the first book that I had to force myself to read, just so I could get through it. Although there were some vibrant parts, overall it was extremely bland."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"People either love or hate Anne Rice's work. There is no in between, and it amazes me that anyone can actually read this stuff. While her concepts are genuinely interesting, reading her prose is like mucking through a Louisiana swamp. She has good ideas in some cases, but her writing is so bad, it's difficult to pinpoint just what she is trying to say."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"If I could find a worse book I would. The sentences are so long winded and boring.You can't tell where the discription ends and the story begins."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"&quot;Interview With the Vampire&quot; is a poorly written novel with a silly story as its basis. Only people who think they are vampires (or wish they were) will be be able to look past the fact that Rice has passed off one of those $2.99 romance novels as a weighty piece of fiction by simply making the characters &quot;VAMPIRES!&quot; As a native of Louisiana, I bought the book as a matter of pride. The story is set in our fairest gem, New Orleans (for at least part of the time) and so many New Orleanians gushed with praise over Rice's &quot;Vampire Chronicles&quot;. Now I wish Anne Rice had chosen Hoboken or Carson City or anywhere else but here as her home."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"To put it mildly, this book disappointed me beyond belief. It certainly isn't up to Anne Rice's normal standards, and I found that upon reading it, I became more confused about the lives of the vampires about which she was writing than I was intrigued. Being a big fan of vampire novels at the time I first bought this book, I wondered why I had picked it up in the first place.Anne Rice's style remains fabulous throughout the book, her descriptive talents beyond imagining, but the story felt cluttered to me, and the book took me an inordinarily long time to read.Thankfully, I feel that the Vampire Chronicals truly picked up with the second novel in this series, and I have been enjoying them, when in the mood, since."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Does anyone actually speak this way? I've never read a book with weaker characters or more boring (and unrealistic) dialogue. Stay away from this complete waste of time."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This book rambles on endlessly about Louis's angst, his troubled soul (or lack thereof) and yet nothing really happens in this dreary book. The narrative is painful to read. Ann Rice needs 1) psychiatric help, 2) to learn to write a good sentence and 3) to learn to develop some tension/expectation (and plot) in a book. I only finished this because I kept assuming that *it must get better!* It never did. Don't bother with this one."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I read this book several years ago. I had a hard time understanding it's concepts and story at the time. Not too long ago I went back and read it and now that I fully understand the content I can honestly say that it is one of the biggest pieces of literary garbage ever written. The characters lack anything that makes them sympathetic. Louis droned on and on and on about how he didn't like killing but he did it anyway. Maybe it's just me but I don't find it interesting when the lead character commits murder. The scene with the girl killed in Paris theatre in full view of the audience was disgusting. If you want to read a novel on vampires, read 'Salem's Lot by Stephen King. Avoid this piece of scum at all costs."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I picked up this book at a local bookstore after having been told by numerous people that it is a must read, and after having seen and loved the movie. As is usually the case, the movie just deosn't do the book justice. Though the movie stayed fairly true to the book, Anne Rice conveys so much more depth to her characters and atmosphere than any Hollywood film has yet to accomplish. After reading this first book of the Vampire Chronicles series, I have since been sucked (no pun intended) into the rest of the series, and indeed all of Anne Rice's novels.\\"Interview with the Vampire\\" is the story of Luis, Lestat, and Claudia as told by Luis. The three work themselves out to be a \\"family\\" of vampires until Luis and Claudia grow weary of living with Lestat, and mourn for answers that Lestat can't really give them. Thus, the pair set out to find more of their kind in Europe and are met with something different than what they were looking for. Rice also intertwines the philosophical debate of whether or not there is a god/devil as well as the omnipotent struggle to find ones place in the world (that all of us go through).This book is something that everyone should read, especially if you enjoy a good horror novel and/or are interested in all things occult or supernatural. This book is a modern day classic! Most of you have probably seen the movie, but if not then try to read the book first. The movie simply pales in comparison. And if you have already seen the movie and loved it, then you will certainly enjoy this book as much as I did!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I must tell you, if you wish to enjoy Interview with a Vampire,you cannot buy this audio production. F. Murray Abraham gives an execrable narration.He spends the first 15 minutes of the book giving Louis a bizarre, vaguely Eastern European accent, and then, upon reading that our vampire is from New Orleans, tries something more soft and French.The majority of the main characters are men of a youthful appearance: Lestat, Louis, Armand, the interviewer, etc. He attempts to give them different accents but does so quite inconsistenly. Their voices run together, making dialogue difficult if not impossible to follow.His voice for Claudia is bad from start to finish. First he tries a high-pitched mewling unpleasant to the ears, and then the aged voice of a 60 year-old woman, which makes it difficult to keep in mind that she always, always has the aspect of a five year-old child.After Lestat's murder, the voice given him is always unnatural, although faithful to the narration. It is bizarre and unpleasant to hear Lestat speak, although perhaps that is the one aspect that is true.However, I must admit that I liked Anne Rice's story and will be reading the novel myself soon, as I find the relationships between characters quite fascinating."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Promises, but none kept! It entices with the intresting tale of Louis, a Louisiana plantation owner in the 1800's. Louis is made into a vampire by another vampire, Lestate. Louis' struggle with killing human to live and his resistance to give up human emotions makes him a likable guide through the world of vampires. The mysteries of vampires origins creates suspense, and when Louis leaves with a child vampire, Claudia, to discover them, the book flopps. Louis only runs around in circles in his mind about death. While one long anguishing muse is acceptable, a book cannot live on confusion alone. Had Ann Rice carried on with the plot moving vibrant painting she began with, this would have been a facinating book. Unfortunatly, I only finished the book because I hoped for awnsers to the questions asked in the beginning, but none were to be found. Bottom Line: Don't start reading it, you'll be stuck reading a book that reminds you of a long, draining dream."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I first read Interview with the Vampire when I was fourteen years old. Many years later my paranormal fiction phase has driven me to reread the entire Vampire Chronicles. Interview with the Vampire is still beautiful, riveting, captivating, dark and disturbing the second time around. Again, I was enthralled with Louis's chronicles of his first years as a vampire. The horrors he went through in his struggle to accept himself as an immortal riveted me once again. From the death of his brother, to his converting into a vampire and the long, insufferable journeys with Lestat, Louis tells his story with wonderment, insight and loneliness so palpable that I felt it to the core...I still find this novel chilling, though-provoking, sinister and beautifully erotic. I still found Claudia, the child vampire, to be the most disturbing character in the book and Lestat and Armand are still my favorites. I love the language and storytelling, but, like the first time I read it, the story loses force in the middle, but gains it back toward the end. Anne Rice created one of the most memorable vampire series out there. None of the latest vampire novels and series compare to this one. I never watched the movie, but I might give it a whirl to see if it gives the novel justice. I haven't seen it because I was told that it isn't as good as the book. But for now I shall concentrate on rereading the first half of the series because I haven't read the last three installments. The Vampire Lestat is next. I shall see if it's my favorite installment the second time around as well."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"All the hype over vampires made me read this book. I knew of course that Rice was in a different league than Stephenie Meyer, but I was even more pleasently surprised. This is a classic book with more depth than Meyer could shake a stick at.

I'm of course screaming for more."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This is one of the most beautiful books I have ever read. It was fantastically descriptive and written unlike any other book. It was incredibly sensual and I couldn't put it down. The characters were perfectly flawed, dark, mysterious, and refreshingly evil yet beautiful. Anne Rice made a darkly evil and horrifying monster into a beautiful and intriguing creature. Full of inrigue, thrill, love, horror, and passion, 'Interview with the Vampire' is a wonderful read."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"As the first part of Anne Rice's \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" visually develops in my mind's eye, I can certainly say, without a doubt, that this author of vampire myth hit the bull's eye. An extremely intricate work of dark lore and mystic passion. And as I continued with Louis over the sea and into Europe, the aura and mind-grabbing book doesn't let up. Even the new addition, Armand, to the fold, wraps your imagination and world of myth completely, making this book more heartbeating than any other."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Anne Rice took the publishing world by storm in \\"Interview With the Vampire,\\" a haunting book that turned the evil-bloodsucker cliche on its ear. Her lush prose and vivid characters turn the dramatic plot and strange scenarios into a chilling look at good and evil, thankfully without melodrama.In modern times, a young man is interviewing a vampire on tape recorder. The vampire is Louis Pointe du Lac. In 1791, his ultra-religious brother died tragically after an argument, and Louis sank into remorse and despair. Enter Lestat de Lioncourt, a charming vampire who offers Louis a way out of his grief.The two vampires wander the cities of the world, with Lestat teaching his reluctant pupil the ways of vampirism. In time Louis makes a \\"daughter\\": Claudia, a vampire child with the mind of a woman. Now, depressed and unhappy, Louis explains how he and Claudia fled Lestat, only to encounter new tragedies that still haunt him to this day...Moral struggles are rarely present in vampire novels. Certainly not from the vampire's point of view. But that is exactly what Anne Rice attempts in this book. She wraps her dark story in lush prose and beautiful descriptions of Paris and her hometown of New Orleans, making this one of the best-written vampire stories since \\"Dracula.\\"No gore and grit here. Rice's writing is exceptionally beautiful, full of lush descriptions and intricate detail. Best of all, it has that rare quality of atmosphere -- no matter how enchanting the vampire, or beautiful the setting, a feeling of darkness and sorrow runs through it.Rice also dips into one of the best examples of literary vampirism ever: Louis becomes a vampire out of his grief, but once the grief fades, he is left with the soul of a human, and the bloodthirst of a vampire -- things that can't be reconciled. His longing to remain as human as possible, in defiance of his curse, is a tragic twist in a dark storyline.Louis is a bit of a whiner, but a deeper look reveals why. He struggles with morality and beliefs that -- unlike Lestat -- he never really let go of. Because he is a vampire, he is by his very nature a killer, yet the idea of murder is repulsive to him. Lestat is utterly charming and incredibly engaging, despite his amoral behavior. It's not hard to see why Louis would be drawn in by such an enchanting person, no matter how bad he is.One of the greatest shaping influences on elegant vampire lore has been Anne Rice's \\"Interview with the Vampire.\\" A beautiful and lush novel of darkness and beauty."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I have never read a single vampire novel until one day I was reading about how my fave band Savage Garden came up with their name. They had gotten it from a series by Anne Rice, The Vampire Chronicles. I'd read somewhere that Darren Hayes's(used to be the singer for Savage Garden) fave author was Anne Rice, so I decided to check out this book, and once I finished it, I immediately checked out \\"The Vampire Lestat\\" and then \\"Queen of the Damned\\".

It describes the vampires as you heard when you where a child on spooky stories. They are just cruel and start losing their humanity, they are selfish and cold. Comparing this book to the new Vampire books you can tell the drama stands on accepting themselves as a Vampire and learning to live with it, they don't involve humans. On the other hand the other books I read involve a love story, or a couple, on Interview with the Vampire I read a story based on a man finding himself. I recommend reading it because it's entertaining and, even though, I find the first quarter a little slow, the book is great."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"The CD was exactly as presented.

I would definitely purchase from this seller again."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"With the current popularity of vampire novels (which I greatly enjoy), I've decided to return back to my roots of vampire lit, and read this book for the first time in 15 years.Anne Rice's vampires are not the ones you can find in the high schools or on the football fields in today's novels...they have bite! They drink from humans on a regular basis, sleep in coffins, and feel no love for their victims.This is mainly the story of Louis, a vampire who meets a boy soliciting interviews and tells him the story of his life/death. As a young man, Louis experienced loss that left him feeling guilty and was taken advantage of by a vampire who turned him into one as well, and used Louis for his wealth.Louis struggles with his vampire nature, and the questions of good and evil. As a human, he had a Catholic upbringing and since being turned into a vampire, reconsiders God and Satan and what he himself is.Anne Rice's writing is beautiful with flowing, descriptive sentences and descriptions of scenery in New Orleans and Paris that make you feel as if you were there.I gave this book four stars instead of five, because at some points Louis' endless questioning did not hold my interest and I found my mind wandering away from the story. However, this is still an excellent novel!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I must be the last person who's seen the movie but not read the book. And since I didn't much care about the movie, why would I read the book? But I'm glad I did! It's so much better! You really get an inside glimpse into the world of vampires, and especially since Louis is so likable, you soon forget that he's actually a vampire. However, everything changes when they reach Paris, and the plot turns kind of dull. Hated to see that, because it had been so riveting up until then."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I read this book way back in my teens (more than 20 years after this book was published) and I don't know what I can say that others haven't said already. This is a fantastic, FANTASTIC debut to a phenomenal series (and by this, I mean all the Vampire Chronicles up to Blackwood Farm and Blood Canticle, which were two very disappointing books to end this series) If you like vampires, you will LOVE this. Ms. Rice's talent (the talent she had back then, anyhow) really shows here. After reading this book, you'll just want more, and thank goodness, because there's plenty more good books to this series! My personal favorite was Queen of the Damned, though the Vampire Lestst makes for a great prequel to Interview with the Vampire. Two thumbs up!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"The psychology of a vampire. No other vampire book dive as deep as Rice's. I loved Louis as the narrator. I much prefer the tortured anti-heros. Rice is very wordy and very detailed oriented. I came out of this book feeling like I knew more about Louis then some close friends. Louis is so vivid, dark, and brokenhearted the whole story, I always felt for him. I also like Louis' view of Lestat better than Lestat's view on himself."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I must say few books have made me feel hopeless and deppressed and this is one of them. Anne Rice introduces you to a vampire who hates his own nature and does not have the courage to end his pain. The book is intricately written and is amazing. The one criteria I have for all books I love is that they move me emotionally, and this one succeeded. I do not recommend for you to read this book if you are &quot;down in the dumps.&quot; It is likely to make you more depressed. Anne Rice is a truly gifted author. The reason I gave Interview With the Vampire four is because the style in which she wrote the book is a little awkward. Rice writes the book all in dialog and as the title suggest it is an interview. I found the dialog confusing at times, but other than that an excellent novel."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Take a leap into the terrible word of darness and blood, where the vampires lurk in the endless night and mortals are their prey. . .This is a deeply disturbing book, because the vampires are never made into heroes, they are never redeemed. And still we fall in love with the suffering Louis, who shares his life with us. His story is told in a rich and colourful language, full of all manner of detail that mainstream-vampire books always seem to miss.And yet it is the vampiric soul bared to us that makes this book a worthwhile companion into darkness.You will never again see a vampire in the same light . . or darkness."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"We are in a small room with the vampire, face to face, as he speaks--as he pours out the hypnotic, shocking, moving, and erotically charged confessions of his first two hundred years as one of the living dead...He speaks quietly, plainly, even gently...carrying us back to the night when he departed human existence as heir--young, romantic, cultivated--to a great Louisiana plantation, and was inducted by the radiant and sinister Lestat into the other, the \\"endless\\", life...learning first to sustain himself on the blood of cocks and rats caught in the raffish streets of New Orleans, then on the blood of human beings...to the years when, moving away form his final human ties under the tutelage of the hated yet necessary Lestat, he gradually embraces the habits, hungers, feelings of vampirism: the detachment, the hardened will, the \\"superior\\" sensual pleasures.He carries us back to the crucial moment in a dark New Orleans street when he finds the exquisite lost young child Claudia, wanting not to hurt but to comfort her, struggling against the last residue of human feeling within him...We see how Claudia in turn is made a vampire--all her passion and intelligence trapped forever in a body of a small child--and how they arrive at their passionate and dangerous alliance, their French Quarter life of opulence: delicate Grecian statues, Chinese vases, crystal chandeliers, a butler, a maid, a stone nymph in the hidden garden court...night curving into night with their vampire senses heightened to the beauty of the world, thirsting for the beauty of death--a constant stream of vulnerable strangers awaiting them below...We see them joined against the envious, dangerous Lestat, embarking on a perilous search across Europe for others like themselves, desperate to discover the world they belong to, the ways of survival, to know what they are and why, where they came from, what their future can be...We follow them across Austria and Transylvania, encountering their kind in forms beyond their wildest imaginings...to Paris, where footsteps behind them, in exact rhythm with their one, steer them to the doors of the Theatre des Vampires--the beautiful, lewd, and febrile mime theatre whose posters of penny-dreadful vampires at once mask and reveal the horror within...to their meeting with the eerily magnetic Armand, who brings them, at last, into intimacy with a whole brilliant and decadent society of vampires, an intimacy that becomes sudden terror when they are compelled to confront what they have feared and fled...In its unceasing flow of spellbinding storytelling, of danger and flight, of loyalty and treachery, Interview with the Vampire bears witness to a literary imagination of the first order"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I just now started reading \\"Blood and Gold.\\"I didn't think that I would like it because I felt Merick was a disapointment.Thinking back on the beging of the series gives me chills.I'm one of those who like Lestat better then Louis and I love Armand.This is a wonderful and thrilling book."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Anne Rice's books tend to be more like a rich, creamy cup of coffee with a decadent shot of brandy rather than a shot of espresso. This is a book for savoring, full of vivid detail, intriguing characters, and lush environments. The plot lines take time, developing slowly at times, but take quick, unexpected turns. This is not a book for the moderately literate, or for anyone looking for a quick read. Don't be surprised by violence and graphic imagery. This is a book about vampires, after all."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I must say that I usually read romance, so this was a little different adventure for me. However, I thought the book was great, the characters were extremely well developed, and to think I would actually feel sorry and sympathize with a vampire!Good stuff. However, do not bother with the movie. Read the book and rented the movie.............YUCK! Stick with the book."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"this book is definatly the best one of the series that i have read. After reading the book and seeing the movie, I personally think that the book is much better. The characters are great, especially Armand. The ending is the best, it leaves alot to think about, concerning the interviewer (who we find out alot more about later on in the series) I would definately reccomend this book to anyone that has a love of vampires, as for the others in the series they are slow at times, if you can get through the slow parts, then they are also good reads."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This is a beautifully written book, each word crafted with love. It is not so much about vampires as it is about the search for self, the battle between good and evil, and the nature of the soul. It is homo-erotic without being profane, for Louis and Lestat are indeed lovers. I have read it many times and look forward to reading it again."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Before I read this book I had no idea the entire thing would be a conversation. At first I thought it was kind of odd because I had never read a book in that form before, but I got used to it after a while.The story is about Louis, and his tale on how he became a vampire and all the horrible struggles he had to go through. He goes on to live with the one who made him a vampire: Lestat.The book has a great plot and I recomend it to someone looking for a truely great vampire tale. But don't expect anything much of extreme horror.And also, I recommend reading the book before seeing the movie."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Made me wanting more,,,and guess what there's Many, many more,,:)The characters in this book are so multidemsional you start believing that there are truely vampires in our world. Luis and Claudia are by far the better of Anne Rices characters. I'm sorry but after Vampir Lestat, I'm bored of lestat's character.In this book he's secondary to Luis and Claudia and that's a perfect situation. If you're looking for an alternative vampire novel and haven't yet discovered Anne Rice, then read this novel first ."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This book is good for a: vampire fans, or b: people who want to read Anne Rice. This book was extremely good and I liked the fact that vampires can look in mirrors and are not allergic to garlic."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This book gets a &quot;9&quot; only because I've fallen in love with Lestat &amp; in this story, he's not the hero. This book shatters Bram Stoker's vision of vampires. Anne Rice draws you into their world and shows them as &quot;people&quot; who are thrust (willingly or otherwise) into a life for which they are completely unprepared. I read this book when it first came out &amp; only relegated it to a 9 rating after reading the sequels."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"It was a wonderfull realistic stand point on ever lasting life and the dammaging affects to it.Louies life was interesting as i read it a second time i enjoyed it more.The time's he lived in the vampire's he loved.Him still trying to find some meaning to his life"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"From reading the other reviews I learned one thing and that is you either hate anne rice books or you love them.Do I think the people who gave this book bad reviews are idiots?No,I just think they read it from a different point of view.I love all different types of fiction and read this with an open mind.After reading it I believe it to be a modern day classic.Sometimes the lengthy dialogue can get a tad boring and becomes a chore to read and it could go with out some of the homoerotic scenes which I think take a bit away from the book but once you get into the book you feel as you are right there witnessing Louis's tale.This book can be easily loved or hated but it all depends on the readers interpretation of it"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Haven't we all dreamed, this way or the other, about life without an end.

But, even reading in that conditions, I LOVED, I liked very much all the criatures, especially Louis, my beautiful and melancolic vampire"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This was the first book that I have picked up since College to read for pleasure. Thanks to the writing style of Anne Rice, I am now a book hog. I read all the time. It was such a pleasure to read about relationships of Louis and Claudia, Louis and Lestat, and let's not forget the love and hate of Lestat and Claudia. This book brings to mind the era of true southern hospitality. When times were simple and things could be explained away without question. To bring the vampires to modern day and see the changes we have always taken for granted. This is truely one of the best novels I have ever read. Thanks Anne"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This is one of the worst pieces of trash I've ever read. Boring, dry, dull, slow, corny, awkward, badly-written, ridiculous, and to top it all off, a let-down. Anne Rice is a worthless hack, her novels should be banned. This is not a horror novel, it glorifies vampires and makes them anti-heroes, and not a word of it inspires fear. I find it hard to believe that Anne Rice has ever read a full-length horror novel in her life. &quot;Salem's Lot&quot;, &quot;I Am Legend&quot;,&quot;Varney the Vampire&quot;=HORROR. &quot;Interview With the Vampire&quot;=a sad, muddled attempt to create something original. Avoid it like the black plague. HP Lovecraft should be Re-Animated so he can yell at her"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I first heard about this novel when the movie was being made, and since I will read almost anything, I went out and got the book from the library. Once I opened it, I could not put it down. Ms. Rice has the wonderful talent for transporting you into the very body of her characters. She enchants and seduces her readers with every passage into her mysterious world of the undead. She makes you want to laugh, cry and rage along with Louis, Lestat, and Claudia. This is the type of storytelling power that every aspiring writer should take note of. Also, the fact that she wrote it when in the midst of grieving for her daughter, makes it all the more real to a person, even if we are not a vampire. If you decide to read her other works, you will find that she grows in talent and power with each one. Believe me, you will never be bored or dissapointed with Ann Rice"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"To me, the most significant character in this book is not Louis but Claudia. She represents (to me) innocent beings snatched into a violent environment and forced to make the best of the situation. She really is the child of Lestat: rather than having his eyes or his hair, she has his ambition and a few of his emotions. I've read many books and watched many movies in the past eighteen years of my life, but the only character that comes close to Claudia is Lolita (from Vladimir Nabokov's book). I've heard that Belinda is almost a mirror image of Lolita so I must read that book some day soon. This book is the first of Anne Rice's collection to captivate me, and it was definitely the first moment I really thought about who I am. Thank you, Anne, and I love you for this."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"The movie made from this book, was outstanding!!! When I came to read the book, I was amazed at the changes that were made for the screenplay. The book was memorable but the narrative was too long, and there wasn't enough dialouge in the story, even though he is always talking.Overall it's was excellent, and a great read!!! If you haven't seen the movie get it and watch it and love it!!!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This book was very well written. I really enjoyed it and wished that I would have read it before I saw the movie. I did not like The Vampire Lestat compared to this book at all. I wish it would have been more like this book."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Vampires exist! At least, that's what the book manages to portray. Everything about this novel is mystifying. Rice manages to blend old world charm, sexuality, and sophisticated wording to transport the reader into a realm where Blood Drinkers dwell. You can't help but feel everything that happens to the main character Louis, the vamp. cursed with a conscience. From his making, to the Theater of the Vampires, to the death and rise of the devlish Lestat, this piece envelopes you in a dark web of deciet, love, hate, and of course, the sensuality of the immortal. If you feel the need for a good chill with a hint of blood, you must read this volume! After this one, the Vampire Chronicles will practically be calling your name! ENJOY!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"However, the narrative drags on and on, with very little dialogue. The story suffers somewhat because of the endless streams of narrative."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I had seen the movie before and was hesitant to pick up the book as I was afraid I might not enjoy it after the movie. I am glad I decided to give it a try. I couldn't put it down. Ann Rice's prose flows so smoothly this vampire story has a wonderful literary tone to it."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"It was a few years ago that I first spotted this book. I was babysitting overnight (I was still in high school), when I noticed it laying on an end table. It didn't look like something I would have chosen myself, but being an avid reader, not to mention incredibly bored, I picked it up. I closed it at 5am after reading the last word.This is a very visually stunning book. Yes, I truly mean that you see the action down to the last detail. It plays like a movie in your head. I was totally submerged in the gothic beauty of the story and the characters.I have read the other two books in the series and while all were great books, I'm glad &quot;Interview&quot; is the first. In my humble opinion it is the best.Even if &quot;Interview&quot; does not sound like a book you might enjoy, my advice would be to give it a try. I'm sure you'll be pleasantly surprised."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This was the one of the best books Ann Rice has written. Having just finished the book I immediatly bought the rest of the chronicles. One by one you become more involved in the world of Lestat. I am now on the last of series. I can't believe this is the end. It can't be."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Interview With a Vampire, The Vampire Lestat, and Queen of the damned were definately (in my opinion) the best 3 books of Anne Rice's that I've read this far.I wish I knew the girl's name who recommended that book to me one faithful day when I was looking for another Stephen King book!I never thought that a book about vampires could be that intriguing or exciting to read but I was wrong!When I finished Interview, I went right out the door to buy The Vampire Lestat and when I finished reading Lestat, I went right out the door to buy Queen of the Damned.If I were to recommend just one book of Anne's for anybody to read it would be the first 3 of the vampire cronicles. Interview With a Vampire, The Vampire Lestat, and Queen of the damned. Definately!I liked those 3 books so much that I have thus far read them cover to cover through 3 times! I've never done that with any other fiction work before. Absolutely fascinating! More fascinating than I could have possibly imagined!Thanks Anne!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"From the moment I picked up this book, I could not put it down. Some ways distrubing other ways sad, but still music on paper. It takes you through the vampire life of Louis, from New Orleans where he runs with his vampire child Claudia from their creator Lesat, to Paris where the Vampires see them as outcasts. Fantastic, and worthy of anyones time, it introduces you to Lesat, and after you finish Louis's tale you can start Lesat's in The Vampire Lesat, it's so good they even made it into a movie."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I have read this book around four times in the past year. That's good for a high school student. I love to read about vampires, wether true or not. This story is about a love for life,an almost hate for a leader, and has a weird feeling about it when you read it. I love it , and it only gets better the second time around. Or the third of fourth."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This book is the first of a masterfull series. Rice shows true promise into the development of further titles. As a reader of the rest of the series, I am perhaps at an advantage to say that the book is one of the best reads this century, and that yes, there is more of it out there. She leaves her readers demanding more and more of the same quality which is given plentifully in the rest of the books. This is not to be missed by any vampire fanatic or just a curious reader of the sensuous, the poetic and reality found in so little other authors!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This book was pure artwork. One of the few vampire storylines I've been able to find in a long time. Beautifully written. The whole reason I got into Anne Rice's novels. Much better than the movie. Beautiful."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Always in search of a good read, I picked up this book for a second time. While there is nothing like the magic of reading this book for the first time, it still held me spellbound.Revisiting lovely, emotional Louis (stuck in his own eternal hell), beautiful, selfish Lestat and tragic Claudia was like coming home.The struggle with their brutal existance and their need to survive is just as enthralling as the first time! I could taste the spice in the air of the French Quarter as well as the blood of their victims!Thank you Anne Rice!!!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Interview with the vampirewas wonderful book, This is the kind of book I could read again and again.Although Lastat was Anne Rice fav.

Thank you Anne Rice"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Rice delievers a great heart pumping story line. This book never has a dull moment. I absolutly fell in love with all of the characters, from Louis to Lestat(The Dark Angel) You can't put this book down without wondering what was going to happen next. Rice's delievery of this book is full blown and strangely exotic."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"the book has a great new feeling to it. it is a great start to the vampire chronicles."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I just finished reading Interview, and let me say that it was by far one of the best book I've ever read. Rice has a way of taking over your thoughts and sucking you into the characters. I first read Tale of the Body Thief and became so in thrawlled by her writing that I've set out to read all of her works. The next to fall will have to be number two of the chronicles The Vampire Lestat. I reccomend Rice's books to anybody who enjoys reading. I also reccomend her works for those of us that usually don't have the attention span to finish a novel."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"In reading Interview with the vampire by Anne Rice I felt completely drawn to her profound sense of writing and her knowledge of the vampiric psyche, Her passion for our lifestyle and her in depth reaserch into our mannerisims was daunting for one who is still Mortal Her book gave me a sense of pity for Armand and Louis, two lost souls who still have not found what they were looking for, As for my Claudia (who I named my daughter after the doll like child)She is as the same as me,doomed because we broke the rules.This book is a worthwhile cause because you can learn to appriciate alternitaves to living and you can enjoy the fun filled ride and have twisted warped dreams until you can no longer resist becoming a Vampire!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I love this book, and Anne Rice describes Louis' feelings as if this were a diary. I hated Lestat's character...he's just somebdy you'd love to hate. Another great novel by Anne Rice."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"As the first part of Anne Rice's \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" visually develops in my mind's eye, I can certainly say, without a doubt, that this author of vampire myth hit the bull's eye. An extremely intricate work of dark lore and mystic passion. And as I continued with Louis over the sea and into Europe, the aura and mind-grabbing book doesn't let up. Even the new addition, Armand, to the fold, wraps your imagination and world of myth completely, making this book more heartbeating than any other."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"\\"Interview with the Vampire\\" is the first novel from \\"The Vampire Chronicles\\" in the style of Louis de Pointe du Lac dictating to a human male recording the entire conversation. The writing style is well done but can be difficult to appreciate, especially during moments when another individual's point of view would have helped develop the storyline.Louis of an 18th century New Orleans, Louisiana, narrates a tale from his pre-vampirism plantation owner days to the twentieth century. Other primary characters during his reflection are the creator of his existence Lestat and another fellow fledgling to complete the small group. Taking life to exist while trying to maintain his former humanity dominates his emotional struggles.The author forgoes some of the traditional limitations found in the vampire genre such as the crucifix, holy water, and garlic, creating her own world where images on reflective surfaces are allowed and being welcomed into the household leaves no leverage for the residents. I believe having these restrictions on the undead brings balance for the victims yet the novel isn't as much about the conflict between vampires and humans as it is about internal turmoil and the lifestyle of a vampire.As with about every film-based novel, I would suggest at least not watching the movie prior to reading the book if not forgoing the movies thereby leaving the series entirely to the imagination.I recommend this book in the series to any fan of the romantic vampire genre.Thank you."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This of course is the first book in Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles. In this dark tale of treachery, Lestat makes immortal vampires of Louis and a little girl who will never grow up, only to be destroyed by them when they decide he's a bad dude who's gotta die... but is he really killed? Not a chance. You can't keep Lestat down for long. He and a bunch of other vamps eventually find Louis and Claudia, and Lestat has the chance to take out his revenge. But that is hardly the end of the story :)David Rehakauthor of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Anne Rice tells an appealing and scary tale as Louie, a vampire from New Orleans, tells his story to a youth in modern day New Orleans. I was surprised at the \\"belivability\\" of this tale as I was puzzling out how some events happened --when they did not happen!Louie is made a vampire by the vampire, Lestat and struggles to understand both the vampire nature and how he can live with the evil side--the need to feast on blood every evening--and its implications. When Lestat turns a 5 year old girl into a vampire, Louie finds a focus for his life, the care of this precious \\"child\\". Without giving any spoilers, they travel to Paris where they find the Theatre des Vampires and a lot of their kind. Louie finds Armand, who he learns to love and other developments tear apart Louie's world.A fascinating and scary work, this story is enhanced by its dramatization by F. Murray Abraham who gives each character's voice special interpretation. I particularly liked his vocalization of the elderly vampire, Lestat.Save this for a medium range car trip or a daily commute without children."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"While I find Anne Rice to be one of the least talented authors I know of, when she begins a series of books I have found she does so with the best of intentions. &quot;Interview&quot; was at best an introduction into the series, and something I recomend to people only because it opens the door to &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot;. The next book in the series is really the crowning jewel of the vampire books and is where Rice originally intended to stop.&quot;Interview&quot; begins in lyric prose, but soon falls victim to poorly thought out character concepts and angsty mellodrama. There is a great deal of sighing over lost humanity and an enormous amount of uninteresting soul searching on the part of the main character. Fortunately I found it a quick read and I was able to move on rather quickly. Read it, but don't expect too much."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"two and a half stars...first of all, i'm not bashing the book for its subject matter. i'm not a bible-thumping blowhard. as a writer/reader, i keep an open mind to all types of literature, so my review is about the story, not the subject.i admit i don't care much for vampire/goth literature, i rarely watch horror movies, because most horror films are so badly made; same with horror novels. rice is an ok writer, but i never really felt like i was connecting with the story. lestat was actually a fascinating character, in spite of his arrogance.there were actually a few times i wanted to retch, but i finished the book. it just didn't move me. i did love the way rice wrote about louisiana, especially new orleans. i would much rather read &quot; feast of all saints."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I started this book near Christmas and wizzed thew the whole sriis (inculding Pandora) and finished recently. But this one is the first and one of the best! I seen the movie first but as alot of people will agaree the book was much better. Louis niative is endreing and his story is spell binding! Lestat is unkind and crass but that's what get's you interested I love the carecter of Claudia, her silence in the first part of her vampiric life sets you up for an emtioal blow out that you feel coming even if you didn't see the movie first. I found Armand facinating the young angel with aburn curls.One of my vary favorite sences shows Louis anger, Lestat's feeling, and Armands hatered for Lestat better the any other, the part after Louis finds out Claudia had been sent into the sun, that part alone can get you hooked."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"While I know that this book is considered by many to be a great classic, when I read it I literally had to force myself to finish this book over the course of a month, when normally it would have taken me a matter of days. The writing dragged on and on and on with little details and events I could have cared less about. The characters did not appeal to me, except for Claudia and \\"\\"SOILER\\"\\" she was killed off rather quickly, compared to the rest of the book. The only thing that attracted me to her was her determination and more ruthless personality than Lestat and Louis, who were, in my honest opinion, too effeminite for me to greatly like. I suppose the overall story is interesting, but it is so lost in a web of mind-numbing writing and weak characters that it was impossible for me to enjoy in any way."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"_Interview with the Vampire_ is a train wreck of a novel. I'm told that some later Rice books are better, but based on this, I don't think I want to try them. The book's main problem is simply that Rice is not a very good writer. The storyline has a lot of promise, but it never pays off. The &quot;interview&quot; format of the book is irrating and unnecessary. It simply pulls us out of the story into an uninteresting situation where we know nothing of consequence is going to happen. Then, during the story itself, Rice's prose is so flowery and unsubstantial that it is difficult to gain any understanding of what characters are supposed to be feeling. Often the prose actually obscures the action with it's insistent long-windedness. The reason I'm giving two stars instead of one, is because Rice does manage a few really nice images, and occasionally is able to draw a scene for a page or two that genuinely incites empathy in the reader. For example, the way Louis first attacks Claudia, and then struggles with what to do with her later, is very well done. These kind of moments are the exception, not the rule though. Utlimately, Louis is a big whiner, while Lestat, Claudia, and Armand are never more than cardboard characters that I could basically not care less about. Don't bother with this book."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Anne Rice has a way with words. There are scenes in this book which are incredibly vivid and stand out in your memory (whether you like it or not). Many people will tell you about the homoerotic undertone in this book; the only reason they might count as &quot;undertones&quot; is because people are pretty blind unless there is a direct, lurid sex scene. We are dealing with one of the worst-matched couples of all time. Lestat is one of the most fascinating anti-heroes I have read about in a long time. Louis, conversely, is a whiner. Hey, catch a clue, Lou! If you don't want to be a vampire anymore, just leave off the sunblock on the beach! Stop agonizing and get over it! Of course, as we see in this book, it is a lot more difficult than that. It's next to impossible to kill a vampire. Just ask Lestat. For imagery I give this book good marks; for Lestat, also good; for Louis, nothing. For plot, well... I guess there was one..."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I didn't like Anne's usage of words. I felt like I was being bombarded by feelings rather than the story. I'm a fan of Stephen King and Michael Chirchton. Now those two guys make you see the book, not just read it. I like seeing my books. She just didn't cut it, well.....at least not for me. I'm not going to have the slightest problem staying away from the rest of the chronicles, or any of Anne Rice's work for that matter."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I am a real fan of horror books and went into this book looking for a good read. I kept reading and reading and the story plodded on and on. I don't know if was Rice's style, the story, or what. I would keep going back to read it, to give the book a chance, but finally I just stopped reading and never finished it. I found the book boring and dull. I eventually wanted to put a stake in this book to put it out of its misery!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I had heard much praise for this novel, so I expected it to be a great, intriguing read. This novel turned out to be one of the worst pieces of literature I have ever read. It was slow, unappealing, and could have been wrtitten far more laconically. This is the first book that I had to force myself to read, just so I could get through it. Although there were some vibrant parts, overall it was extremely bland."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"The Amazon article entitled &quot;kicking the horror habit&quot; by one Patty Cambell lists this garbage as an introduction to more &quot;serious&quot; literature. How foolish of us to think that Edgar Allan Poe &amp; Bram Stoker &amp; Stephen King were not serious compared to this womans choices, who has not the vaguest about what literature is or what it does, joining the other dieticians, psychologists, and technicians who make up Amazon's &quot;critics&quot;.Patty Campbell is the young adult columnist for Horn Book magazine and the editor of Twayne's Young Adult Author Series and Scarecrow's Studies in YA Lit."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"It's unconceivable that a novel this painstakingly dull and anemic could become so successful. Rice's plodding, unbearable exposition signals that she's spent one too many nights in the crypt. This isn't gothic at all; it reads like a Dickens Halloween Carol, with cartoon vampires acting silly and pretentious. I think maybe Anne Rice missed her calling--she should have written travel brochures. Interview With a Vampire is one of the most plastic, contrived pieces of bloodsucking ilk ever written, and Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt did an outstanding job in accentuating its cardboard dullness in the film version"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Interview with the Vampire is a bit hard to review. On the one hand, the book is important in the development of the modern urban fantasy genre. On the other hand, Ms. Rice is not the most effective writer in terms of exposition and character development. It's safe to assume that she has improved in her later works, but this preliminary work reads like a second-rate high school drama piece. And for those who love their vampires extra viscous, might be put off on her modern take of vampires as existential philosophers. And there lies the rub of her vampire lore.Rice's vampires are a bit too effeminate to be effective as creatures of the night. Louis comes across as whiny, and emotionally sterile. Armand does not seem to have the foresight one would expect from a 500 year old creature. Lestat, is underdeveloped, and pretty much absent the last half of the novel.But Claudia, oh she's a feisty little devil! There's something delightfully dark about a child vampire being stuck forever in a pre-pubescent body. She's the most Machiavellian of the vampires and far more unique than the little developed mess that Louis became in the end. And speaking of Louis...Louis is the interviewee in the aforementioned title. The unique take in this tale is that he is being interviewed by a brave, but foolish, human journalist for an unnamed publication. This is where the suspension of disbelief becomes a bit unbearable. Louis tells his story in such a way that is unbelievable. How on earth can a vampire remember every single conversation, every piece of clothes, every snatch of metaphor, and every remembrance of the weather? Is perfect memory retention a here-till-now unrevealed vampire trait? Or is Ms. Rice too giddy about writing that she forgets that this is an interview and not a dramatic monologue. And while this is Louis' story, I sympathize more with Daniel (the poor man's journalist) who has to spend the night with this whiny creature of the night. The poor man will have a devil of a time transcribing the purple prose into something the average US Today reader can understand.As for the plot, well there isn't much of one. Louis becomes a vampire by Lestat. Together they become a foster parent to Claudia. Claudia kills Lestat (or she thinks she does, as she doesn't have any clue that a sequel will be written with her enemy's name as the title); they go to Transylvania and meet some uncouth vampires that do not have the Western sensibility of manners, and they arrive in Paris where they get into a lot of trouble with the Theatre du Vampires (like Circus de Soleil but a lot more annoying). Louis finds love. Claudia finds love. But being a Rice novel, everything falls apart quicker than you can say Chinua Achebe.In conclusion, I would only recommend this curious pop-culture item for its historical value as the predecessor to the Twilight series, the Sookie books, and everything in between. It's not Dracula, but Ms. Rice, to her credit, gives us a vampire of a different color. And regardless of its literary method, that's a pretty darn important thing."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Eh....This was a pretty bad letdown for me when I finally got around to reading it.Touted as the definitive work on the Vampire subject, it is more of a long somtimes winding - sometimes quite gripping in fairness - whine fest about how its hard to be a vampire people dont understand them.Okay, I get it. I dont need over detailed descriptions of the minutia.Just tell me a story, and make it interesting....Oh yeah, and it seemed more than a little gay. I dont have anything against homesexuality, I just dont feel like reading a several hundred page often boring tale featuring men in love with other men.I will try the next volume - the vampire lestat - just to make a fair go of this series, but if it isnt better, it will most likely be my last stab at Anne Rice's \\"Vampire Chronicles\\""},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Interview with a Vampire was a great book, proberly the best book of the Vampire Chronicle.

I have always liked her view of \\"vampires\\". If they really walked among us, this is what I imagine how they would be. My favorites are Armand and Marius.Everyone with a great imagination would love all of her books. Enjoy them with each new character and every page."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I can't in good concious give this book 5 stars for the simple fact that some of the aspects in the book are reitterated more times than necessary. The sensuality and eroticism involved with the vampires' feeding gets old after the first dozen times it's explained. It's not hard to grasp the concept, so why is it repeated over and over? The only other problem I had was the seemingly inconsistant characteristics of the child vampire, Claudia. I know the reasons for her \\"adult\\" perspective on being forever trapped in a child's body, but Anne Rice seemed to hide characteristics of her for long periods in the book, only to throw them at you to create the effect she wanted. In my personal opinion it's sloppy writing, but like the title suggests: This is one of the best fantasy books ever written.I love the knowledge and research that went into New Orleans and the old daily life. There is so much detail in the characters and their relationships with each other. The vampire lore is slowly and smartly revealed to the reader.The book is obviously more detailed than the movie (which I adore) but it leaves me wondering why Anne Rice decided to leave certain thing out of her screenplay. For instance, Lestat is the one who sends the vampires from the theater to capture Louis and Claudia, and their newly made vampire companion Madeline.Another part that was left out was when Louis found Lestat later towards the end of the book in New Orleans, Lestat had two underling vampires with him. In this scene Lestat refuses to feed on humans and feeds only on rats. I thought this scene was brilliant and gave a deeper understanding of where Lestat was left off.My favorite aspect about the book (as opposed to the movie) is the relationship between Louis and Babbette, the woman who lived near him in New Orleans. It's a great series of events that is well thought out in the long run. As it's references several times later on and has many links to the mental state of Louis as an immortal killer.In any event, if you enjoyed the movie, you should read the book. You will not be sorry, it's an easy read and it will enhance your next viewing of the movie.A great all around book."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I read this book years ago( pre- movie) and I remember loving it, so when I heard a friend did not read it and enjoyed \\"Lestat\\",I bought for him.

I found the idea of a vampire with \\"human\\" feelings\\" appealing. Somehow though I just wasn't satisfied with the book... it was missing something I thought. Anyways it might be a book to rent from the library if you want to read it, I wouldn't suggest spending money on it. I wouldn't read it again."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This is the first Anne Rice novel I have read, and I must say, Rice is a very good writer and this novel is exquisite. I love the way the story is told: in first person by Louis yet not entirely first person. The detail of the story is almost surreal, kind of in a dreaming, horror and despair kind of way. In fact, this is the first Fantasy book that actually turned my stomach, the feeling of every feelings in the novel is so well written that it certainly gave me plenty of ideas on how to write feelings, since writing feelings I think is one of the hardest thing to do. And also, I loved the ending.However, the reason I did not give this novel a five is because that it is not one of the most enjoyable book I've read. It took me a week and a half to finish this book whereas I should be done with this book in three days if it's one of those I couldn't put down. As much as I love the deep meaning and theme of this novel, lots of time the novel is a little bit too draggy. Such as the turning of Louis and the turning of Claudia, I mean, I get the brilliancy behind this draggy story line but it's just kind of a pain to wait for it to happen and then it didn't until 30 pages after. Also, lots of time I feel this novel is beyond my comprehension, but then in the end it's not. But the detail can be very confusing at times that it's misleading. The novel also has a whiny feeling towards it, which is actually the least thing but still can be annoying.But overall, this novel is definitely worth reading and experiencing, Kudos to Anne Rice!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Never have I read a book so enchantly beautiful that it had to be described as reading a painting. Everywhere you search in this book, there is another thread, with thousands upon thousands of more threads that create the most beautiful tapestry you just can't stop looking at it.Every character in this book is so deep and profound the author must clearly be genius. Claudia, a woman trapped in the body of a 5 year old forevermore is particularly entrancing. Her quiet nature and the evil within her is so well written you are quite frightened and any woman can understand this poor thing.All of the themes and all the tragedy and all the suffering of the characters make you feel things you may not always want to, mark of one of the most gifted authors i've ever seen."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This is a must read for anyone interested in vampires, the macabre, or great pieces of fiction. It is the starting place for anyone wanting to read the vampire chronicles. It is a very easy read even though it is long. The characters are well developed and easy to relate to even though they are vampires. Anne Rice creates a spectacular feeling and world for the reader. The movie(featuring Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise, Kirsten Dunst, Antonio Banderas)is good, however it can not match up to the spectacle that is the book. The book tells the story of a vampire and his long life and the events that took place in that life."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Vampires with emotion, is it truly hard to believe, life is life, a vampire would still have the basic inhibitions of humans, they just don't have the soul, their death reincarnated, not exactly monsters. I think the new out look in the world of Vampires is refreshing from, what used to be, 'He stalked her, nightly, she could feel his prescence but never saw who--or what it was. She was on a date now, and the awkward feeling that she had all the times in the past, were back again. Her boyfriend kissed her, and then the taste of blood filled her mouth. She looked up to see a tall diviner male sucking the blood from her boyfriend. Then before she could speak she was next.' Cut to weeks later. 'The hunter examined the bodies at the morgue, and just as the eyes burst opened he stabbed them in the heart. Just another job for the hunter.' That's ridiculous, over done, and over used.Anne Rice brought a refreshing new outlook, and the good part was, it only got better from here."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Rice's works are very self-indulgent and borderline unreadable, but this book is an interesting take on the modern gothic and the vampire legend. Worthwhile for those interested in the gothic form and its evolution, but this is no Dracula."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Read IWTV as a plane read, and am happy to be done with Anne Rice. Her prose is overburdened with metaphors, such that nearly every paragraph has multiple usages of 'as if'.So I wrote this parody/tribute. If you like it, you'll probably like the book as well.Armand stared at me, his grey eyes boring through me, as if he were examining each of my vampire cells with a microscope fashioned from the finest Venetian glass and porcelain. His stare drove me nearly into a swoon, while meanwhile the index finger of my right hand nervously traced the knuckles of my left as if neither were a part of me at all, as if my finger were a tiny mountain climber tracing the ridge of a tiny mountain range, trying to determine which of the five peaks offered the best view. Meanwhile, Claudia stared at us both. Immobile. Immobile as a rock on Io, as it circled Saturn indifferently, and equally distant to me now. But still, her face bewitched me. Her lovely eyes so large, albeit filled with loathing, as if they had been painted on her by a Japanese manga artist, so that she looked like a child Japanese pop star who had sold her soul for a brief dance with that most fleeting and appealing of mortal gods,fame. But I digress...."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I choose this book because it is on the 1001 Books to Read Before You Die list. I have friends who loved this book.

I was pleasantly surprised to meet vampires that didn't make me want to bang my head against the wall. And the idea of a child vampire, Claudia was just too cool to me. We see where the original brooding vampire was invented in Louis who tells his tale to a journalist and we get to meet what vampires, to me, are supposed to be, Lestat.The only problem I had with this book was that Anne Rice drowns the reader with very long monologue of detail that really kill the reader. I can only read how beautiful Claudia was a few times, but other than that I enjoyed the book. I would, however, stop at this book."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I have always been a huge fan of Anne Rice's work. This book, the beginning of the story of Lestat is rearkable.

It arrived ahead of the promised date and in the condition promised."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"It is so interesting to think that here we are in 2011, vampires are a gigantic trend and here is this book from 1973 that is stiff competition (and likely inspiration) for any of todays vampire stories. I saw the movie in the 90's and loved it, but did not read the book until now; I picked it up on the recommendation of a big fan of the series. Generally I don't like to pick up books when i've already seen the movie because it makes for a boring read knowing what is going to happen. In this case I made an exception because my niece swears by the series and is excited to have someone else to talk to about it.The story starts out slow, no question about that. However, over the course, the story delves into some really interesting aspects of the idea of vampyrism and immortality. What truly matters when you are to live forever, what happens when your physical form does not reflect the age, wisdom and maturity of your mind, how can you take lives to feed your hunger when it goes against everything you know and believe from your mortal life?Louis definitely comes across as whiny, as many people have pointed out. There are times in the book where it is really difficult to believe that he is so at odds with himself, given everything he knows, and it can grate on you as you read. However, know that by the end Louis is a fully developed, well-rounded, strong, intersting character. That \\"whininess\\" and his reluctance to give in to the evil that he believes vampires represent is all just part of his transformation. For how can you remember all of your human life and not carry any of the emotion that goes with it into a life of killing?"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I am not a fan of Anne Rice usually but Interview with the Vampire is a beautiful book. Louis is so tortured throughout the novel that you cant help but feel sorry for him and want things to get better for him. My favorite character however was Claudia. The thought of a little girl with an old soul gave me the creeps and it added a surreal element to the story. If you enjoy gothic novels and (of course) vampires then give this book a try. Anne Rice has a tendency to get wordy but overall this book is beautiful and dark and an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This book was good although Lestat comes across as a villian and Louis as odd to me.

That they, even when having to feed on humans, deal with these situations as an immortal passing through time. That they are indeed human themselves. Showing limitations, bias, hatred, and all emotions that are common in all human beings. A must read"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"&quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; is the powerful, disturbing story of the experiences of a vampire, Louis, as he evolves from a young man to a fledgling vampire to a mature member of the undead. Its characters are interesting and its plotline is complex and well-measured. The story is beautiful and sad and highly compelling.But the book is not beautiful or compelling, and its primary sadness is the waste it makes of such a wonderful story. Rice's prose is heavy and flowery, sometimes lush but very often simply too much. Often her descriptions are incomprehensible or interfere with the action. The book's language enjoys a few moments of beauty, but these are smothered by the sheer density of words.Worse, Rice sells out her own story. The convention of the book is that it is an interview: a character who is referred to only as a &quot;young man&quot; or &quot;boy&quot; is taping his one-sided conversation with Louis. The interviewer serves no discernible purpose and the interview destroys the story's end: instead of ending Louis's story with the powerful, well-written conclusion it deserves, she neglects it entirely (failing to exploit the opportunities for insight and emotion her well-crafted story offers), instead ending the book with several dull pages about the interviewer himself.Poor writing aside, &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; is not an unpleasant read. It's long, and it has many slow points, but it's worthwhile for serious science fiction fans."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"\\"Interview With the Vampire\\" is the book that started it all, the first instalment in Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles. Having seen the movie first, I wasn't sure how much I would get out of this book. I decided to give it a try and found that it was indeed worth my while. The story is compelling and the characters are well drawn, so that Rice's lengthy descriptions and occasional slow passages are worth the work it takes to get through them in order to enjoy this darkly seductive tale.Louis became a vampire in the year 1791. His early years were spent on his family's plantation in New Orleans, until he met the vampire Lestat and underwent his metamorphosis. Louis' first years as a vampire were filled with anguish and torment as he tried to fight his very nature, which insisted that he must kill to survive. Louis quickly grew to resent his maker, Lestat, who seemed cold and utterly heartless in Louis' eyes. Louis struggled terribly with questions about the why and the how of what he had become, with no one to guide him or give him answers.And as Louis' contempt for Lestat grew, Lestat created a child vampire named Claudia to keep Louis from leaving him. Claudia quickly captured Louis' heart and the two of them became inseparable. But as the years passed, Claudia began to see her tiny body as a prison from which she would never escape. Her discontent continued to increase, and she yearned to be free of Lestat to discover the world with Louis. Claudia is a fabulous character, and Rice does an amazing job of portraying this woman trapped in the body of a child. In my opinion, Claudia is one of the best characters in this book.I don't want to give the rest of the story away to those who are not familiar with it, but Louis continues to search for answers about why vampires exist and his quest takes him far from New Orleans to search for other vampires in the Old World. Louis' tale is filled with heart-pounding danger, sensuous encounters, exotic new vampires, and heart-rending sorrow. We as readers become completely caught up in Louis' triumphs and failures, and are swept into the dark and seductive world of these remarkable vampires.I found \\"Interview With the Vampire\\" highly entertaining and full of wonderful surprises that weren't even hinted at in the movie. As I stated before, some of Rice's passages can become a little tough to wade through, but on the whole this book will capture your imagination and leave you looking at vampires in a whole new light. I imagine Anne Rice's style just isn't for everyone, but \\"Interview With the Vampire\\" is a great book in which to sample Rice's writing. So give this book a try, you may find it's just what you've been looking for."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"&quot;Interview With the Vampire&quot; is without doubt one the greatest books I have read in my life. It fascinated me, horrified me, drew me in and dazzled me. Anne Rice is in my opinion the best English-language author writing today. She weaves a spell with every turned page as she builds one of the most haunting and captivating stories you'll ever read. Louis, Lestat, and Claudia will stay in your mind long after you have finished this book. And DON'T listen to any nonsense about the movie being crap. It was a very faithful retelling of the story. READ this book and THEN watch the movie. It will only augment your experience."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Ok for starters I didn't expect to enjoy this book, and also I did what many very bad people do and I watched the film before I read the book. I thought the film was great until I read the book and then I realised that the raw sexuality of the text could ony come through in novel form. I adore the way Anne Rice decribes the taking of blood she does it without shame in the way that every other... book I've ever read describes a passionate... encounter. Claudia made me cry, she was so mixed up, without the experience of being treated as an adult, she had to stay a precosious child with a wise old woman's mind and somehow a woman's sex drive, her lust poured through the pages in the same way as Lestats like a thumping pulse. Louis, sweet innocent Louis who should never have been a vampire appreciated evey emotion he felt much ,more deeply than the other characters in the book, and analysed every thing said to him, I fell in love with him. If I met him I'd without hesitation agree to be his eternal partner. Never have I fallen in love with a book so deeply since Flowers in the attic. Pease read this book!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I was completely absorbed by this enthrallingly thought and provoking tale of the travels of Louis Pointe du Lac and the vampire Lestat. The way the story is told by Louis is so different. The 18th-century setting is vividly described, so that pictures are intricately painted in your mind. The story line is such a classical original which delves into deeply emotional and morale aspects of life and death. This story for me brings to mind a saying I once hear which I believe to be true. This saying goes along the lines of 'You had better really want what you want, because you might just get it!'All of the characters are intense, especially the tortured Louis who is refreshingly feeling and regretfully of immortal lot. As you read the story and learn more about Louis, you come to discover a passionate killer who is desparately trying to resist his cold blooded instincts. You can visualise Louis's eternal pain in his struggle to save the small piece of his soul that remains. In the character Louis, you can sense a feeling of total and utter isolation and frustration, because of his display of emotions to those who cannot comprehend them.Lestat is the perfect contrasting character to Louis. He is cold, calculating, oblivious self-obsessed and evil to the core. Claudia is a fascinating character as you roll through the story, and see her maturing from the innocent child victim who is chillingly preyed upon by Lestat, to the cunning and rebellious young woman who comes to the shocking realisation of her fate. Claudia's growing rage and discontent builds deliciously to fever pitch. These characters are all thrust into a 'red hot cauldron'of fascinting travels and murderous conquests throughout the years."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I was appalled by some of the ghastly reviews made on this dazzling piece of art. It is an epic in the heartbroken world of the vampire, with such delicious description, you could absorb it in your skin, and feel it in your veins. Lestat is the most peculiar character I have ever encountered, and had fun figuring out his attitude. he adds comic relief at just the right (and often wrong) moments which makes him all the more endearing. I love this."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"'Interview' was a book that honestly shocked me. The first time i read it i knew nothing of Rice's work, nor did i know a thing about the book itself; this is probably why i was so taken aback by the characters and the plot, i suppose. Louis is the main character, a suffering man whose humanity was taken by what was to become his long time counterpart, the vampire Lestat. But this book is far more then a book about vampires, trite as that sounds. Very elegant and lyrical, Rice demonstrates her uncanny knack for poetic writing in Interview. No doubt you will read the sequels which follow, for once you read this book, you too will become a shameless Rice junkie."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This book is absolutely wonderful. I can't begin to sing its praises. For those people out there who simply cannot take Louis' whining, I say that his constant belittling about immortality is what I love about him. Seriously, for those of you who thinks that he should just kill himself, you should realize that he doesn't want to kill himself. Don't warn people against Louis' character--he's the only character in Interview that has the little bit of humanity that makes you love him to death.For those of you who disagree with me... just ponder the question, How will YOU live with yourself knowing that you will have to kill someone for every day of your life?I won't blame those who don't believe me. However, Louis is my favorite character of all time. Also... read Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This is definitely one of the best books I've ever read. It goes far past the archetypal myth of the vampire, and deals with issues of morality and the nature of evil."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"How would the gift of immortality change you?As can be seen in this book, the answer to that question would depend on learning more about just who you were when you were given that gift and just what price that gift came at.In this book, we receive a thorough introduction to not just one but four characters who've been granted the gift of immortality:Lestat the Vampire. Is he mysterious or just shallow? Is he callous or just hiding his own fears by his dismissive treatment of others?Louis Ponte du Lac. Is he contemplative or just whiney? Is he principled or just anal and unwilling to invest himself fully in his new life?Madeleine. For the first time we see a child vampire. It's perhaps in this character that author Ann Rice best teases out some of the hoarier implications of immortality.And Armand. What does immortality mean if you don't spend caring about anything?Wisely Ann Rice spends little time on the mechanics of becoming and being a vampire and more on its human implications. In nearly two centuries of travel, Louis recounts his experiences with Lestat, Madeleine and Armand in an extended monologue reported a to modern day journalist. This is done by means of a framing story where Louis' past exploits are being reported in the present day so that the journalist can, from time to time, ask questions as needed to bring readers up to speed with Rice's new vampire universe.Part of this book's rightful appeal of course comes from Rice's ability to reach into vampire lore and extract such a novel interpretation on such an oft told tale. The rest of course, as does all good art, is in so adeptly connecting that tale with the human condition itself.So much like us, these characters ask and answer our questions and in doing so take us to a world we'll of course never really see ourselves. It is in this way the characters truly become immortal."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"..there was Interview with a Vampire.. When vampire angst was real. If you're looking for quality Urban Fantasy (before it was its own genre), go back to this classic.Vampires. Angst. Blood. Lust. Love. A plantation. A little girl. A coven. A writer. An interview. Some stuff in between. A really excellent book."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Although I find the writing cumbersome, I love this work. Original and in the tradition of true horror. I feel I could have used less adjectives and allowed me to use more of my imagination. Well worth reading, even if you have seen the movie!!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This was the book that started my love affair with all things vampire. Anne Rice has such a talent for story telling. She spins a tale of sadness and desperation like no one else. Thank you for opening my eyes to all things paranormal."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Stunningly portrayed, Interview with the Vampire tells us the birth and existance of a most intriguing character by the name of Louis. Louis is a vampire that begins the long amazing tale of the vampire Lestat de Loincourt. Lestat is the main character of the series and the other books except for Interview With the Vampire. Louis was the vampire created by Lestat. In this story, Louis explains his reluctance to accept the fact that he is a vampire and has to take lives forcefully. He explains his loathing toward Lestat for making him this and what happens since his death(rebirth) to the last time he leaves Lestat and searches for himself."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Whether or not you like vampire books (and who can, after the glut of books dealing with that subject, ending, one can only hope, with the Twilight Saga?), Anne Rice's vampire books (especially the first two) are wonderful, erotic romances that shed light on desire, longing, fear, hope, death and what it means to be human. Highly charged (more simmering under the surface than explicit) with homo-eroticism and eroticism in general. Even as a heterosexual male I was seduced by the atmosphere of the stories and especially the relationship between Lestat and Louis. At her best, Rice writes with an incredible passion and poetry to her prose that truly captures but updates the style of 19th Century Gothic Romanticism."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"As a matter of practice, I try and read a book *before* I watch the movie. 'Interview with the Vampire' is no exception, it's merely taken me longer than I would have liked to accomplish everything. With that said. my best friend in high school *loved* Anne Rice's works and tried on many occasions to get me to enjoy them as well. Back then, I never could.Now, as an adult, I don't know if my tastes have changed that drastically or if her style has merely grown on me...but I found that once I started 'Interview with the Vampire', I had a nearly impossible time putting it down.It wasn't just her characters that had sucked me in either. (Sorry for the bad pun. lol) It was the story as a whole - her description of place and time. The way she made me *feel* as if I were there, beside Lestat, Louis or Claudia. It was nothing short of amazing for me. I found that as soon as I finished 'Interview with the Vampire' I couldn't wait to begin the next book in the series (\\"The Vampire Lestat\\") not because I wanted to know 'what happened before' (\\"The Vampire Lestat\\" is actually a prequal of sorts). I wanted to keep going because I had become invested in the characters lives and needed to know more about them. I wanted to continue with her on the ride she had began for us, to see where we would both end up and where it all began. I needed to know more about the characters I had grown to both love and hate because of their actions and very nature.In short, I found 'Interview with the Vampire' to be very well written and thought out - from all angles. It is a timeless vampire \\"classic\\", and unfortunately, as so often happens, they took a good book and turned it into a movie. While the movie was good in its own right; it failed to simply do the book justice.Overall, I highly recommend this book - as well as the rest of 'The Vampire Chronicles' series - to anyone with more than a passing or glorified interest in vampires. This isn't 'Twilight' by a long shot so don't expect a story anywhere along those lines. 'Interview with the Vampire' shows a much darker side to the life of a vampire. A life that draws you in and keeps you close until the very end."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"When I was eight or nine, my aunt sat me down and handed me this book, proudly telling me, \\"You know, this is far better than those Goosebumps you burn through.\\" At the time, Louie's narration was a bit too wistful and slow for me. (Or maybe Daniel just couldn't keep up with him) So, lucky me, they made a movie version. After watching it, I fell in love with the Vampire Chronicles wholly and utterly.Years later, I picked up Interview again (this was after reading the rest of the chronicles mind you), determined to try and dissect Louie's state of being and Claudia's Master and Servant dynamic she shared with him.What I found in lieu of my query, was actually this:I was missing the point altogether. Yes, the book follows Louis, Lestat, Claudia, Armand, Santiago, etc. But really, it follows the changes they are observing in the world itself.The vampires themselves are just part of a subplot.And honestly, the big picture is a lot better than a thumbnail, don't you think?"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I have not read this book for quite a few years, but I decided to read it again recently. I had forgotten what a fantastic novel this was. I will admit to only having seen the movie one time, years ago, and I don't really remember it. So I don't have that to compare to, which is probably good. The characters in the book are so well developed. You really feel for all of them. The descriptions are fantastic -- I can completely see the places that Rice describes in this book. The descriptions of the appearance of the characters are just enough - it lets you create them in your own mind. I would definitely recommend this book if you are interested at all in vampires, or quite simply a page turning, good read."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Anne rice is a Master of her style. It's a slower reading style of writing that delves into and develops the characters more thoroughly than most writers. You know her characters like you grew up with them.This book was awesome!I have read all of Ann Rice's books, except the Jesus Christ series, and planning to get around to that. Just have to see what a Master can do with that."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This is the first of the vampire chronicles that started it all. I found Louis, a dark, brooding and reluctant vampire. Always giving excuses and remorseful, but he continued killing nevertheless. Lestat through Louis' eyes was a sychophant who depended on Louis for wealth management and later companionship. A weakling and inferior character to Louis.This is a good introduction to Vampire Chronicles. However, it was so much out of jive with the subsequent titles of the chronicles.Looks to me that Anne didn't plan the Interview to have a sequel. When she did have a sequel, she played down the inconsistencies as lies coming from Louis.Refreshing on its own."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Interview with the vampire by Anne Rice for me was a great book. I always wanted to read carefully to learn more and more about a vampire's life; how it became something like the living dead, surviving off animals and people, living an eternal life when never ageing or changing while the whole world around you changes, and having different kinds of powers than other vampires like moving at the blink of an eye. It was maily about the day in the immortal life of a vampire suffering. This book is simply genius and thats why i give it a perfect 5 stars."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I thought that this book was vivid with rich detail and figurative language. However, I thought that the &quot;resurection&quot; of Lestat could have been explained a little beter. But the author's beautiful descriptions of the areas that Louis and Claudia visit throughout Europe and of the vampire nightclub made up for this slight flaw. This book is a definite must- read for horror lovers like myself. And once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down! The Interview with the Vampire was most certainly worth my money, and I was well satisfied."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"first and foremost,id like to state that i've read this wonderful novel three times and every time i read it i only unterstand it all the more. for those who are interested in a dark, gothic tale of love, lost, and despair, I highly recomend this novel. the protagnost, Louis tells the story of his life and his transformation to eternal darkness. its very dark and as you are drawn into the despair of Louis's unlife. this is not a typical tale of a vampire, for your are seeing through the eyes of the vampire himself, not a mortal.anne rice as an excellant ability to invoke dark moods and creating lush sceens filled with detail.the novel is strangely poetic, which all the more makes it unique."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Anne Rice's IWTV offers a different view on vampires. Instead of them being the antagonist characters, they are the protagonists. You feel sympathy for the main charater, Louis dePointe-Du-Lac. You feel his constant suffering and agony reach the core of your being. Louis is a very simple charater. Then enters Lestat, the maker of Louis. His is a selfish,complex character, full of pride for himself. Lestat motivates readers to go deeper into the story to understand why he does the things that he does, and why he thinks the way that he thinks. Claudia, another very important character in IWTV, is the young five year-old vampire beauty. Hers is a disturbing, yet unforgettable tale. IWTV is simply mesmerizing, letting readers go where they have never gone before."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"this book is very good, i really suggest u read it..An interviewer following what he hopes is a good story, but Louie holding untold secrets is actually following his prey, the interviewer. Louie a normal human being lost in the depths of depression and accepts Lestats offer of an easy death, instead of no more pain not only his heart but also his soul is opened to everlasting torture. Revenge is taken for all his pain, although the price death for those who hear Louie's hidden screams of anger. He tells the reporter everything from when he was born, not born into the world, but reborn into an unknown world of eternal darkness. When Louie was reborn the world seemed as if it were suddenly uncovered. The statue moved, but yet it didn't, it stayed the same. When Claudia kills or at least thinks she's killed Lestat she did it for revenge because of him her crying soul was stuck in the body of a porcelain child forever. Hatred and pain is brought about again when Louie is locked in a bolted coffin, and Claudia with her vampiress of a stepmother burn to cinders and tears fall as dust once the burning sun takes it's rise. Armand saves Louie, but he does not won't to live without his darling Claudia at his side for eternity, but she is dead and the her last piece of being falling in his hands covering his cold skin with ash. Throughout this book events of pain events of horror all affect this sadden vampires soul, a vampire cries ever hundred years or so, but when he tells his story the tears come and fall with emotion."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I liked this book very much, because I like vampire - stories very much. The relationship between Louis and Lestat is interesting. You may think that they have a sexual relationship. The book itself is written in a wonderful way. You can imagine haw Louis feels. He is so sad. He doesn't want to drink the blood of human beings but he has to. I feel a little bit sorry for him. In my opinion this book is great. For me Anne Rice is one of the most interesting writers."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"That's shocking to even imagine as possible. One would never associate adjectives such as love, passsion, caring, nuturing and feeling with the evil-inspiring vampire. But this author does it with talent, making it seem as ordinary and everyday as Hanzel and Gretel. I was not intending to read this book, I usually don't like such blockbuster novels, but this surprised me. I thought it started out a little slow and progression at first was almost painful, it ended up tremendously. The abusridity and ironicness of this tale of Vampire love and despair makes it intriguing and interesting.Anne Rice does a marvelous job of character development and takes us through the birth and maturity of a young Vampire. Loius finds that thogh it takes only seconds to lose one's life; it takes half of an eternity to lose one's soul. I will probably read her other novels in this series."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Anne Rice began the Vampire Chronicles with this stunning opening novel. Far more than the vampire tales we were all accustomed to Anne Rice created characters with the essenc of humanity trapped inside an inhuman frame. hile some might say this novel is just another Gothic story told for sheer amusement &quot;Interview With The Vampire&quot; goes beyond this and touches the hearts of many people with a tale of searching for one's self and of lost love. You will adore this novel when you read it, and be simply touched by it."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I enjoyed this book as the first of the Vampire Chronicles. By narrating to a young reporter, Louis explains and clarifies information which gives the reader a deeper understanding of this existence of a world within our world. I came to know all the characters - there are heroes, victims, those with internal struggles, those with strong relationships; there are masters, fledglings, makers. The characters are very real - nothing like the hollywood ghouls. The information gained from Interview made reading the next three Chronicles enjoyable because of the information base it provided. The Chronicles have provided a fascinating, enjoyable, involved read. I'm looking forward to #5."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"When Twilight hit the scene a few years back, the youth of our country plunged head-long into weeks of reading about Bella and Edward (and Jacob) and their super-natural, angst plagued love story. I did, too. While I admit I don't always love the style of Ms. Meyer's writing, I believe she did write well for a YA audience and captivated an entire generation of young readers. If they are reading, I am happy (except Manga and Japaname - that is NOT A BOOK! and I hate that our library even keeps them in there with real literature, but I digress).However, when I mentioned to the youth that a previous author wrote a much more captivating and scarier version of vampires, they were baffled and I was stunned. Had they never even heard of Anne Rice and The Vampire Chronicles? Turns out - no they hadn't. This book was published in 1976, the year I was born, long before this generation of vampire crazed teens was even a twinkle in their pre-pubescent parent's eyes.I remember watching this quite intense and macabre portrayal of vampirism on the big screen in 1994 staring Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas, Christian Slater, and Kirsten Dunst - a very all-star cast. I was a senior in high school and while not prone to reading back then, I did know it was based on the book series by Anne Rice. So, as the Twilight phenomenon took place, I decided it was time to head back to my teen years of vampire stories and read Interview with the Vampire. I was not disappointed.The story, set in South as most vampire stories seem to be, follows the life of Louis de Point du Lac and his transformation from average plantation owner to vampire with a guilty conscience. He is guided into his new life by Lestat de Lioncourt, a blood-sucking and vicious fang-bearer that has little regard for human life. Much of the tension in the novel is based on the differences in opinion between Louis and Lestat of how to feed and on what to feed. There are times when Louis is keeping himself alive via rats and rodents (a concept I think Ms. Meyers borrowed for her \\"vegetarian\\" vampires with a conscience). And we learn all of this through a tense and graphic interview with a very young journalist, the said \\"interviewer\\" of Louis in a small room with very little light. Louis talks a lot.Louis tells his story in grave detail starting with his first moments as a vampire, in which Lestat assumes he is doing Louis a favor by changing him as Louis is going mad over the death of his brother. There is graphic tension, blood, and gore littered throughout the pages and in truth, it is a scary tale. Because Louis can't cope with his new life and continues to find a love for humans, Lestat, once again comes to his \\"rescue\\" by providing him with a vampire child - Claudia. She is one of the most intriguing and beguiling characters in the book. Trapped in the body of a child for eternity, but with the mind of a grown woman; and Louis loves her in a paternal and protective way. Their relationship is endearing and nurturing, and tragic.They travel and attempt to be better than the average savage beasts they are, but in the end - we all are what we are and we see Louis's rage explode.The novel reads at a brisk pace and while it's quite long, it's intense throughout. The stories Louis tells send shivers down your spine and makes you often consider the notion of real vampires, lurking in dark shadows somewhere, not sparkling when the sun comes out. I would recommend this book series to anyone that wants to delve into the life of a real vampire, with all it's torture and somewhat, triumph over human frailty. Anne Rice is still Queen of the vampires - that title could never be replaced.My only regret? I saw the movie long before I read the book and I think that tainted the intensity for me because I knew what was going to happen in general. The book is far better than the film, but in all honesty, the movie version is still one of my favorite vampire stories. I just keep seeing Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt in my mind while I was reading and that took away from the horror of my own imagination. I've vowed to not make this mistake again - always read the book first! And then, by all means see the movie :-)Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I'm a big fan of vampire movies and books - but it took me a long time to get around to reading \\"Interview with the Vampire.\\" For many years, I was put off by the popular image of the book as decadent and depressing (perhaps I was thinking more of the movie?), and by weird stuff I'd heard about how Anne Rice went on to write erotica and controversial biographies of Jesus. So Rice, and this book, seemed to hold little appeal for me; and besides, I've always felt weirdly loyal to more traditional vampire fare like Stoker's \\"Dracula\\" and King's \\"Salem's Lot.\\"Well, all along I was dead wrong about Rice and her work, because I recently picked up this book on a whim and ended up loving it. Far from being just decadent and depressing, \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" delves deep into philosophical territory, daring to use the pop culture figure of the vampire to tackle big questions about humanity's place in the world, violence, the existence (or lack thereof) of God, and the nature of time. Does this all sound a little pretentious? I suppose it is, and I can perfectly understand readers who are put off by Rice's self-conscious philosophizing and sometimes-purple prose.But I happen to feel a connection with the book, perhaps because I have a similar thought process to Louis, the introspective vampire whose perspective dominates the story. I appreciated many of the other characters as well; Claudia, a vampire girl, is both impressive and creepy, and Lestat is a quite fascinating and witty guy. Unlike Louis, Lestat is reluctant to question the nature of his vampire existence (or existence in general), and he simply has fun with being undead. This doesn't make Lestat stupid at all, just a different sort of intelligent from Louis; so they make a well-matched odd couple.I suppose the book drags a bit at times, especially when Lestat disappears for a while. But overall, I was impressed with its richness and power. Indeed, I think Rice's work stacks up well against contemporary fiction of all types; it's more literate than the Harry Potter books, and infinitely better-written than what little I managed to choke down of \\"Twilight.\\" It's also a lot more intelligent than so-called literary fiction of today, like \\"Super Sad True Love Story.\\" I'm half-tempted to give the book a perfect five-star rating for this reason, but I can't because it's not quite perfect. Still, it is awesome stuff - and it easily ranks among the best of horror literature."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I love this book it is so interesting and the characters seem so powerful and somewhat sexy. I couldn't put this book down, I read it all in one sitting. Everyone who loves vampires should read this and all the rest of The Vampire Chronicles. If you like this book you will also enjoy Love Returns Through The Portal of Time"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I bought this book, because like many people, I am very partial to vampire novels. As soon as I had the book in my hands, I plopped down on my bed to read it. I was soon caught in Louis's world. The eccentric, sensual, and absolutely heartwrenching story of a vampire, whose long existence brings up all the human emotions he never had. The hurt, love and desperate desire to his prey and his profound kindness and sympathy. It is a tragedy because it does not have a happy ending, but neverthelss, it is beautiful as it is. I devoured the book in one day, then waking up the next morning with it in my hands yet again, reading some parts I didn't understand. The book is very descriptive, but you really feel like you undestand the protagonist, and his agony. I thought the ending to be a great close, but again overshadows the beginning of a new story. The story of the boy who interview him in the first place! I thought it was ironic, and very foolish that the boy wanted to become a vampire after all that Louis told him. Like Louis says: \\"This... after all I told you... is what you ask for?\\"I feel what Louis felt then, the desperation and the anger that even after all the wrongs of his life he told him, after all the death and all the sadness his existence had brought upon him, that he still wanted it. It is ironic because the boy will search for Lestat, and the story will most likely repeat itslef. Obviously not in the same way, but he will somewhat experience what Louis went through.All in all, a beautiful book to read. Anne Rice is trully a remarkable author. I greatly recommend it."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I couldn't put it down. This is a very engaging book, just when I thought I'd read everything there was to read about vampires or the undead. Rice creates new rules for her creatures and her descriptive powers are immense. She travelled back and forth in time with ease as you followed her lead character's story. Dark, scary, but also sumptuous and romantic."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Interview with the Vampire is a exceptional book for people who are just getting accquainted with Anne Rice. I believe the Vampire Chronicles are her best works and this book starts it out.I have read this book at least 7 times and each time I love it more. The writing is in depth but not lengthy. Interview is the story of Louis and his troubles with being a vampire and the inner conflict it entails. I give this book 5 stars because I absolutely love it and suggest it to anyone who is interested in reading a vampire novel."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Interview with the vampire - An absolut amazing piece of literary work by Anne Rice! I loved every minute of this book. It was one of those books that are explained as being more experienced and felt than merely read. Rice's writing style is sooo beautiful and rich. The characters - their psychology and physiology couldn't have been detailed better. You can't help but get caught in a whirlpool of emotions as u delve into the mind of these vampires. You're trapped in a love/hate/wonder relationship, as are the characters. I loved her characterization and portrayal! So sensual, so captivating! I never read a book like this before...and now I'm determined to read any and all of Rice's work I can get my hands on.This book had me holding my breath, heart pounding, eyes glazed and totally absorbed. A must read!!!!! Worth the 5 stars and more."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This, the first book of the Vampire Chronicles, is the best example of Anne Rice's literary talent. Her words flow like no other author's I've ever read, and her story is brilliant in its creativity. Definitley worth the read."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I've probably read this book about 8 times and could probably tell you the story word-for-word just as well as Anne Rice does. Why would I read the same book so many times? Because it kicks ass!! This is a well-written book that tells a phenomenal, epic story; it is the kind of story that will, much like its characters, live on forever.Anne Rice is a talented writer who some may dismiss as a &quot;paperback writer&quot; and think of her stories as sort of trash. Although her books may appear, in their cover design and at a quick glance, to be like the sort of paperbacks you find in a neighborhood pharmacy, they are many, many tiers above in quality and content. If you haven't read this, give it a shot. It's reasonably easy to read and will keep you interested from the first page to the last."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"As a vampire lover myself, i found this particular book intriguing. it is more focused on one Vampire's life and his pain is felt through his own voice. The main character, Louis's uniqueness somehow grabs me. To anyone craving an absolutely wonderful book that will keep you on your toes and thinking, I highly recommend this book. To anyone who has not read one of Anne Rice's books, please do not hesitate, you will not be dissatisfied."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"The book is a delight to listen to. The tale is touching and gratifying. I would say this is one of the better books I've listened for quite some time. The book is well written, and brings you into the characters.

I first rented the movie from Hastings and loved it. After that I read the book. It was wonderful! It explained things much more than the movie ever could, because it told what he was thinking, and it was from his point of view. I love Louis, but pity Claudia. I suggest you read the book then watch the movie.

You could really experience the pain the characters went through, though I feel that the last few parts could have been handled better, and the part with Lestat was not explained in sufficient detail. However, the part about Claudia wanting to be a woman and screaming at Louis was very intense and exciting. Thmbs up to Mrs Rice for a great reading experience!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Perfectly beautiful, a work of art. Beats every other book I've read by afar. Louis is an extaudinary character who is angry at the fact of being a vampire. Claudia scares me, her anger at life for never growing older... Lestat is not the best vampire in the world, either. I think Anne has outdone herself (again) and she better keep those books coming."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This book is very imaginative and gripping"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I am fourteen years old, and an advanced reader. My best friend recomended this novel for me to read. She is huge fan of Anne Rice and thought that I would enjoy the lyrical syle of this novel. She was right. This would have to be the best novel I have ever read. The sentence structure gave the book a slow moving, eerie, erotic, and thrilling feeling. Unlike Bran Stroker's &quot;Draculia&quot;, &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; gave the vampires a voice. There was none of that focus around the victims and how they reacted to a vampires bite. I hope the rest of the cronicles are just as good."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I love this book so much I have not been able to put it down....I'm glad there are more books in the series."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I have to agree with Lestat-- Louis does whine. However he whines in a truly fascinating way. The language and the confessional tone draws you quickly into a dark and morally ambiguous world. Perhaps most fascinating is Louis' inability to truly grasp his own culpability. In the end I consider The Vampire Lestat the more exciting book, but this novel of addiction, love, and hate puts you under its spell and keeps you there as Louis is seduced by Lestat, Claudia, guilt, and Armand."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Well,I remember when I first picked this novel up.After that,i couldn't put it down!I loved Louis for all his mourning,Lestat for his cruelness and mischievious nature,and Claudia for being just her.This unruly family captivated me for hours, then i read the book again!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This book pulled me right in as soon as I started it. I couldn't put the book down but at the same time I really wanted to pace myself and take in every word and I didn't want it to end. After reading it though I was shocked. It wasn't what I had expected. I don't know what I expected but shocked is the one of the best words to describe how I felt. Louis is a character that I think almost everyone can relate to. And Anne Rice makes you love all the characters and then she can make you hate them but there is always that connection to Louis, the sadness, and the loss that I think makes you love him or at least understand him through his whole story."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This is simply a confession of not just a vampire it seems but how people actually feel. Louis relates his mourning and the end is saddening because he loses all his emotion and becomes a truely depressed vampire. Claudia responds to everyone because of her hatred to the &quot;monsters&quot; that made her. Lestat takes on every offense he has but that isn't much.Over all the book really shows society on it's edge."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I personally think this is one of the greatest books ever written, much less a great vampire story. This is probably my second favorite of the Vampire Chronicles so far (The Vampire Lestat &amp; Queen Of The Damned tied in first, &amp; Body Thief third), but I haven't read all of the books yet. I love Rice's writing, and I look forward to reading more of her books (I just started reading Memnoch The Devil)."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I had no idea that one book could open my eyes to a whole new world. It, along with the movie, were great.But granted very different from each other. Interveiw , athough not my favourite Chronicle, holds a very special place with me because of all the doors it has opened. Firstly of course it introduced me to the character of Lestat,to the writings of the wonderful Miss Rice and to the entire culture that the Chronicles possess. Interveiw ,I hope, will become a classic in later years because it really is a book of high quality. Its sad to see Anne in the slump shes in now, but Im hoping it wont last much longer.We must remember that this woman gave us Lestat and Armand and Marius and all the other wonders in her books. For that I guess its up to us to stay loyal.Please read my other reveiws on the Chronicles and other books by clicking my name on the reveiw."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Does living forever sound like a wonderful thing? Sertainly it does, but if one thinks about it, they would know that it couldn't be.

But Rice pulls this thrilling story off wonderfully!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"If I knew for sure that vampires like Louis roamed the darknights, I'd gladly welcome the chance to be in his world.

It has incredibly realistic characters, and the plot is great. It had no boring parts and I could barely put it down. I think everyone should read this book. Once you finish the book you can't wait to read the second book in the Vampire Chronicles. Everyone I know that read this book loved it. Its about a vampire that gets interviewed and tells his life story. It's a thrilling, magical, and a disturbing book. its great. Anne Rice is a wonderful author. So far she has written seven books of the Vampire Chronicles. They're all really good and this is just the first one. Have fun reading!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Bram Stoker can't compare to the unique talents of Anne Rice. This book is a non-stop read of chills, thrills, and drama.

Interview with the Vampire humanizes these creatures of lore with an iteresting point of view."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I have only recently gotten into anne rice's books, and I find them both spellbinding and enthralling. I don't know any author quite like her for gothic atmosphere, and her carectars are generally interesting and believable (with the execptions of certain mayfair witches.).I really liked interview with a vampire for a wide variety of reasons. Firstly, it had a good gimmick; it was able to take the old, overused vampire genre, and not only make it seem fresh and new, but actually add elements to it. I thought that the charectars were undeniably interesting. And lastly, I loved the gloomy atmosphere. It made me want to go to New Orl&eacute;ans.Over all, it was a goods read."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This is a masterpiece that stands alone in the book world. I'm sure anyone who picks this book will agree. I couldn't find the time to put it down. Anne Rice paints a perfect picture for the reader through her percise detail and literary perfection. You can almost feel the hot damp breath dancing down your neck as you read along the story. I enjoyed how Anne Rice used the perfect characters to bring life to a twisting story. Interview With the Vampire sets the standard for modern day gothic literature.If your looking for an enchanting story that will leave you terrified don't hesistate, pick this book up. Anne Rice defines perfection with this one."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Realistic yet surreal at the same time, this book is a milestone in Vampire/horror fiction, it breaks old barriers and enchants you as it drags you into a whole new world. This book is about the world of the Vampires Louis and Lestat and their adventures through the ages, through different time periods and extravagent settings. This book sets a whole new standard in realism, the entire idea of telling the story through an interviewers point of view is brilliant, one can't help but think &quot;Could this have really happened?&quot; the characters sure seem real enough and so does everything else. You won't find any cardboard cutouts here. This book overflows with brilliance and originality, a must read for any fan of Vampire fiction."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Those that are captivated by Vampyre-lore; after reading this, you may leave your windows open at night! New to vampire novels-you'll be be captivated! A legend that has been told and re-told time and time again, is reinvented once more and you may just like these creatures just a bit too much!First off let me start by saying; It is a novel that is truly a masterpiece! Why a masterpiece? The reasons are many. First, if you open the book with a mind that is broad and open to anything you will be amazed as to what you will find within those pages as well as this lady's gift as a writer.Above all, what you may discover within yourself. If you truly pay attention to what you are reading, some of what is within those pages is extrememly dark and gruesome! And yet,the awe-inspiring way she has with description... Her way of romanticizing these scenes, the reader may not even realize how dark it is. The truly frightening part is whether one realizes it or not, it opens a dark side within the reader, that cannot be denied. The one thing that has stuck in my mind is that whomever I have spoken with after reading this novel, each person has said; &quot;While reading the book, I couldn't help but ask... could they be out there?&quot; I found that extremely fascinating. To hear that from several people, points out once more, the gift Anne Rice has with telling a story. It will make you wonder, could ... 'they'... be out there? Even though we all know they are not out there. She crosses lines that so many would not dare do. A scene she did with Armand and Louise in regard to God, sent chills down my spine, made me drop my jaw, and caused me to re-read that scene a second time. Her writing is masterpiece literature, beautiful, and daring beyond compare. (Yes, I am an Anne Rice fan. Could you tell?)"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"OK, since I've read all of the Vampire Cronicles, I can say that I consider this a good book, but not a great book. I found Louis a little whinney and therefore sort of annoying. However, I did truly love the relationship that Louis had with Lestat and I also loved that this book is Louis' side of the story. It makes The Vampire Lestat more interesting because of it. So read this book first, if only to give yourself the best possible set up for the next book. You will not be sorry."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Teen's and adult's for generation's will appreciate Interview With The Vampire, Anne Rice has such a gift with character development, Louis,Lestat,Claudia,Armand are truly authentic. Anne Rice's description's of New Orleans are breathtaking, there so descriptive and charming I'm planning a trip there this fall. Interview is not a tale about bloodsucking monster's that terrorize New Orleans as much as it is a tale about Human Emotion, you really feel for some of the Vampire's in this book and that's what make's Interview so real and intense. If you want a Terrifying,Breathtaking and Charming reading experience I highly recommend Interview With The Vampire."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Interview With The Vampire is one the greatest books I have ever read. Its second only behind The Shining. Her incredible detail and shades of gray with Lestat, Armand and Claudia makes the book a slow one that you can't put down. Read this book if you have anytime."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This book was really good; it had a lot of action (blood and guts!), romance (not 2 mushy), lovable characters, and deep thoughts. I like the was Rice did not dumb down any of the language, most horror books today don't contain words with more than one syllable. It was full of Louis's thoughts and feelings but they didn't make the story boring, they added to the tension of the action scenes. I would recomend this book to everyone!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Rich, Lush, Wonderful! They say Louis is too weak to put people in a trance but he sure did with his story. This is Anne's best book ever. I couldn't put it down. This book belongs up there as one of the best Vampire novels ever written. I saw the movie first before buying the book. I fell in love with Louis in the movie and when I read this book I got a whole different verison of Louis and fell in love with him all over again. I highly recommend this book for anyone, whether you love Vampires or not."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"The book is very slow moving. Not as exciting as other vampire books I have read. But I am finishing it."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Anne Rice does a remarkable job of describing the characters. We are able to see the complex nature of each person, their own struggles and of course the fight or embracing of taking in the liquid that allows them to live.I would rate this particular book in along with the classic tale of Dracula and as a must read for any vampire fiction fan."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Anne Rice is the master of horror and love rolled into one product waiting to be unfolded. Interview with the Vampire is non-stop wonder and amazement from start to finish. Louis, a sympathetic and thoughtful vampire tells his life's tale with all of its wonder and terror together in one riveting account of life after death. From his beginnings in New Orleans with the fiendish imp Lestat, the creation of the lovely yet deadly young Claudia, to meeting the shrewd ancient vampire Armond in France, Louie tells the story of his dreadful existence and all the hardship that follows the only vampire with a conscience who feels pity for those he must kill in order to survive. Interview with the Vampire is stands out as best vampire novel since Dracula, and leads into an entire world of fantastic dark drama!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I wore out two copies of this audiobook on cassette, and was only too happy to see that it was available on CD. Not only is it a skillful abridgement of the novel, but the vocal performance by F. Murray Abraham is exceptional. Recommended."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"A beautiful, heartbreaking book. Not scary so much as romantic, metaphysic, even operatic. Completely reinvented the vampire mythology -- Rice introduces monsters that are more than sympathetic; they're human. They're the dead whose humanity did not die -- and so they continue to live, love, and suffer. They don't just haunt the nights vapidly like Bram Stoker's undead. And of course this book in particular is the one to read, because it was written for different, more artistically pure, reasons than the others. I like Lestat better, but this is the heartrending book, the really authentic, emotional one, the genesis of all the others.Anne Rice has an unusual style for the type of stories she writes, which often creates some confusion. Think more Faulkner than Hemingway. Long, lush paragraphs laden with minute descriptions of seemingly ordinary objects and events. Not really popular fiction, though it is popular. Fiction that always aspires to be called by somebody at sometime not fiction, but \\"literature.\\"Wasn't a horror story as a potentially serious, dramatic, theatrical event invented here? I think it was."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I went through a bad phase of only writing negative reviews back in 2009 and at the time things were so black I forgot to post about the things I actually love. I don't know how I missed out on this.Interview with the vampire, for me, was a gateway drug. I read it for the first time in 19995 when I was fourteen-years-old. It opened the door for me into a world of alternate perspectives and histories of characters and places I had never known. It fanned a flame within me which was a love of Gothic horror, particularly, in regard to my tastes in vampire fiction.This is one of my favorite vampire novels. Louis is a very descriptive storyteller and his style of talking is so distinctly different from that of Lestat (who narrates most of the books after this) that you would swear they were real. There is a strange sort of love between all the characters despite the resentments. And you can just feel that it is the only the beginning of a long and intricate journey. This is a book series I will always cherish.Side note: Pay close attention to Lestat. If you do you will notice hints to his own perspective on things that become important later."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This may very well be the most popular and well known vampire novel since Dracula. Anne Rice weaves a dark tale with all the perfect elements and leaves nothing lacking.It starts in modern day setting where an interview takes place. The interviewer is human. He leads an every day life and lives happily. But the interviewee is quite the opposite. Right away we learn that he is a vampire. Forget about your sparkly romantic vamps-he is the real deal. The book begins with the vampire summarizing his life since the day he became a vampire.Again-the author does not skimp. She puts in every detail. The dark and broody detail is amazing in almost lyrical sense. It's a true vampire story-it's a classic.If you love classic horror stories, then you need to read this. It's not worth missing."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"It seems inevitable that with the resurgent popularity of all things VAMPIRE that this book would start popping up again on everybody's \\"to read\\" list. But what's popular now in modern vampire mythos is completely anathema to everything this book is, and I can't help but feel a little sad on behalf of both the unwitting reader picking this book up to satisfy what they think is going to be a quick vampire fix, and for the text its self. A quick scroll through the reviews for this and you'll see a lot of reviews starting off with BORING and WHAT A DRAG and I'M NOT STUPID BUT THIS WAS AWFUL. There's something to be said about paring off the right book with the right reader.It's funny, other than Dracula, the great now and always and forever gothic classic of Victorian times, this is the only vampire book to make it onto that much coveted and discussed 1001 Books to Read Before You Die list. And despite this, I think that this book's major failing is that, despite it's content, because it uses the super natural as a vehicle for its tale, it has a heck of a time making it into the hands of the readers who would most appreciate this. Interview is not a quick, gory, slick or even a sexy read. Heck, for those of you who like vampire sex let me spell it out to you - the vampires in Anne Rice novels are physically incapable of performing the deed. Looses something right there doesn't it? Instead what this book really is, is a relatively modern look at atheism vs spirituality with more than a healthy meditation on the ability/inability of art to become a working substitute for human connections. If you suddenly woke up one day and found that you would never have to face god, or judgement, would you continue to live as a good person? Does doing something evil render you incapable of normal human emotion? What does it truly mean to live forever? These are the questions Rice grapples with in her debut novel to varying degrees of success, and if she doesn't always find the answer she is searching for, there's something to be said about at least making the journey itself.So no, this isn't like other vampire novels out there. In fact I could say that this is the unvampire novel of the ages, the supernatural book for people burned out on tawdry vampire romances that have no conception of the true passage of time from one age into the next. If you're looking for something a bit more meaningful, if you don't mind that old fashioned Victorian style of writing where it takes three pages to say what could have been said in one line, if you can juggle the eerie feeling of encountering an antiquated set of morals against your own, then give this one a chance."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I read these when I was in highschool and I hate what has happened to the genre. Not all of Anne rice's vampire novels are great but I loved this one."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"It's been a few years since I read this book, and I decided to read it again recently. I had forgotten what a fantastic novel this was. I will admit to only having see the movie one time, years ago, and I don't really remember it. So I don't have that to compare to, which is probably good. The characters in the book are so well developed. You really feel for all of them. The descriptions are fantastic -- I can completely see the places that Rice describes in this book. The descriptions of the appearance of the characters are just enough - it lets you create them in your own mind. I would definitely recommend this book if you are interested at all in vampires, or quite simply a page turning, good read."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"this is a book about a vampires life. it was anne rices first attempt at a novel and it dosent get any better than this. you meet up with the vampire in the 1990's being interviewed(hence the name) by a young man. the vampire, Louis tells his tale to the boy."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"When Louis, a New Orleans vampire, is interviewed by a young journalist, he seizes the opportunity to reveal the essence of his life, and that of vampires in general. Turned into a vampire by Lestat, whom he loathes, Louis is different from the typical vampire. Filled with scruples and feelings for those who could be his victims, he prefers to feed on the blood of animals, rather than on humans. When he feeds on the blood of a five-year-old orphan, Claudia, one night, he intentionally stops feeding before she dies. Lestat, however, finishes the job, then revives her with his own blood, turning her into a five-year-old vampire, a creature who gets older but who does not change physically. In time, Claudia, furious at her fate, decides to kills Lestat, the crime of killing another vampire being the only real crime in the vampire \\"ethic.\\"As Louis unveils his deathless life, the reader is exposed to the vampire culture in New Orleans, to Louis's connections at the Theatre des Vampires in Paris (where vampires put on public performances in which humans are sacrificed), to his trip to Egypt with Armand of the Theatre des Vampires, and to his return to New Orleans and attempt to set his life right. Always, Louis stops short of behaving as a completely amoral vampire when it comes to human sacrifice. Though he sometimes must drink the blood of humans, he continues to try to learn about and change the vampire culture, and even to sacrifice vampire lives in an effort remake vampire society.Creating a vampire who is at odds with his culture, author Anne Rice creates empathy for Louis, while showing \\"five-year-old\\" Claudia to be ruthless. The internecine rivalries and resentments within vampire culture parallel those in the real world of humans, though the powers of the vampire make their \\"wars\\" far more violent. Louis, lonely, guilt-ridden, and full of despair, tries to convey to the interviewer the horrors of his \\"existence,\\" such as it is, along with its lack of \\"romance\\" and excitement, but he fails completely, as he also does with the reader, who cannot help but become caught up in the excitement of Louis's adventures. An excellent introduction to Rice's vampire cycle (and great escape reading) for those who have not yet become familiar with these stories. n Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Honestly, every other book by Anne Rice I've ever picked up has seemed just plain silly, but \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" is as good a piece of gothic fiction as I've ever read. There's a lot of talk on this page about Rice's lush prose and over-the-top descriptions, but compared to the rest of her vampire books, \\"Interview\\" is quite understated. There isn't a trace of her later po-mo self-consiousness, and the pretentious kiddie philosophy is present, but not overwhelming. Also, some of the prose is quite circumspect, and the eroticism is powerful, but relatively subtle.For me, the most compelling passages of this book were the scenes between Louis and the unnamed interviewer. You can just imagine yourself in the \\"boy's\\" place, and feel what it would be like to sit across the table from such an extraordinary creature, and to begin to believe things that you would have thought unbelievable. Also, the vibe that flows between those two is delicious. The reader knows, without exactly having to be told, that the boy remains terrified of the vampire throughout the interview, and that he is at the same time powerfully, and perhaps erotically, attracted to him. For me the biggest dissapointment in the highly dissapointing film adaptation was the way in which these scenes were played: Christian Slater was perfectly relaxed, chatting with Brad Pitt as if he were Leno interviewing some TV celebrity.It's too bad Anne Rice never managed to write anything else as good as this. It seems that all the fame went to her head, and she got too big for her britches. She began to fancy herself a philosopher, and forgot that she started out as something just as good-- an excellent gothic novelist."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Anne Rice, is a master vampire who brings you in as one of her own. Teaching, taunting and creating a desire of beyond-human emotion. With each passing chapter, she creates a hunger that can only be quenched through her words. Before you are aware you are one of her own, and can comprehend the desires of the vampires she understands all to well. ...Not a connoisseur of Vampire books, I was very pleased with the book, and longed for more. The book seemed to call to me, for it had been many months since I had seen the failed movie Queen of the Damned. The movie, good in parts was not all that great due to overacting and nonrealistic sequences. However, I wanted to read and learn more about it, her through the book... Yet, I felt I should start at the beginning. And here I am... After reading the book, I look forward to reading about Lestat and about how he came to be.But I have a few gripes about the book.The time traveled in this book goes over centuries. And yet, the language of the vampires is sometimes too modern? For Example, Louis uses the word stupid in one tangent. Another example is Louis is talking about housewives. Well, like I said I am not sure about the year(s), but from what I understand the term housewife is rather modern. (post 1920?) I say this because, women did not work outside the home, therefore there is no need for the terminology of a housewife? I am not a linguist but these and other instances stuck out to me like a sore thumb.* I have been corrected- Charles M. Robinson III wrote me and said: \\"Read your review of Interview with the Vampire. I agree on the problem of words. For example, in The Wonder Years, they used Yuppie terms that we never used in the '60s. In House of Wax, taking place about 1907, they said \\"normalcy,\\" a non-word coined by Warren Harding in 1920.In Interview, however, most word usage is appropriate. \\"Housewife,\\" for example, is a very ancient term that, in fact, was made obsolete by women entering the workforce, and by modern times in general. It is used to distinguish from midwife, or the various other types of wives of the past. It translates directly, i.e. German, Hausfrau. In fact the Swedish word for \\"wife\\" (spouse) is \\"hustru\\" (housewife).Also, \\"stupid\\" is very ancient, indicating dull-witted, confused, or intellectually slow: stupid (French), estupido (Spanish), stupido (Italian). I have seen it in Civil War memoirs to describe men who suffered from combat fatigue.\\"The book is worthy of a read. Since this is my first introduction to Ms. Rice I look forward to more.On a final note, there was one reviewer who said it better to read about Lestat before the \\"interview\\" this may be true for those who have not seen the movie, but if you have seen the film you will know and understand the characters so I would say stick with the order for which she writes.* Thanks to Charles M.

The narrator, Louis, is a reluctant vampire who understands that he must kill to survive, but is racked with guilt with each and every victim he slays. The inner struggles with which he deals make him one of the most conflicted and gripping characters that I have ever encountered. I have long been told of the rich, voluptuous world of Anne Rice's vampires, but, for some reason, had never delved into it. Now that I have, I cannot get enough! I recently went on a week-long vacation during which I read \\"Interview\\", \\"The Vampire Lestat\\" and \\"The Queen of the Damned\\"; I couldn't put them down. In the first two installments of the Vampire Chronicles, Rice tells the stories of the vampires (Louis and Lestat, respectively) from their points of view. This bit of writing genius allows you to really feel the torment of these creatures and feel deep sorrow for them, but at the same time feel excitement and raw, sensual pleasure as they hunt for their victims. It's interesting to see how Rice creates such soul and depth in creatures who are soulless. Rice's descriptions of everything from the clothing that the vampires wear to their hair and the signs of the times wash over you with a velvety luster that makes you hunger for more.

Claudia is enchanting, and her words towards Louis are suspenful, and quite chilling and mature for such an extraordinary little girl.

It captures you into the essence of the time and place that the charaters are in.This book is absolutely mind-trapping, in which readers are interested in ofcourse, because when this book had that effet on you, you feel what Lestat feels, you feel what Louis, and Claudia feels, and the other characters too. This book is wonderful, exciting, erotic, chilling, and it gives you this thrill...into the world of Anne Rice's vampires."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I'll make this short and sweet (unlike the book I'm reviewing!). Ann Rice, no matter how apparently popular she is, is NOT a good writer. Her books are so bogged down with rediculous, tedious, POINTLESS detail that it destroys any chance at a good read.She has some good ideas as far as dealing with the sides of the vampire we don't normally see: How they think and what they do on a daily basis. But again, it's completely lost in the monotony of the rest of the book. Skip her (and Stephen King while you're at it!)."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I consider myself well-read, with wide-ranging tastes in books. There have only been two books in my life that I absolutely could not finish, no matter how hard I tried. This is one of them. It is, by turns: insipid, long-winded and breathtakingly boring. I'm not a good enough critic to come up with phrases to describe just how excruciatingly bad this book is. I'm not sure that I've come across a worse writer than Anne Rice. Please do yourself a favor -- pass this one by."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This is the worst book I ever read. I haven't seen the movie because it's probably just like the book. It's fine if you're into blood and gore. I'm not. Ms. Rice, in my opinion, is a no-account, hackneyed, and cliched writer. Don't waste your money on this book or its sequels. If you want to spend it on Dracula or The Space Vampires. I wouldn't read them. I'm not into vampires."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I found it dull and dry, and practically had to force myself to finish it for an assignment. Also, it was too homoerotic. Blech!!! Besides, she plodded along at a cow's pace"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Being a Vampyre myself I can assure you that this is nothing at all like it really is. Anne Rice knows nothing of the world of darkness!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I thought the book, though just about 350 pages long, felt more like 3000 pages. Like a vampire's life the story went on and on without ever going anywhere. So here's the recipe for a lame book:* characters without clear motifs - check!* pointless and verbose monologues - check!* pseudo-intellectual investigations into the moral life of vampires - check!* zero plot - check!* poor research into historical background - check!* increasing boredom as reader drags herself from page to page - check!I kept reading because I was hoping it would eventually get better - it didn't! Save your time and money."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I know this book is about the undead but I didn't expect the carcasses would be in the book.....found several desicated dead bugs inside as well as a unusual photo I won't describe here.

Guess I'll just watch the DVD"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"i have to say i was honestly disappointed; being an avid reader of vampire novels and a lver of vampire-lore, i was expecting the \\"great anne rice\\" to be well, better. i dont know, i guess i just found the book rather boring and much of what was written didnt stick to true vampire-lore. not a fan of dracula either. guess i'm not into the famous ones. it too into the details of louisiana."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"In a word: AWFUL! Ann Rice has taken her love for penning overblown sexual fetishes (both hetero and homo-erotic) and single-handedly ruined the vampire as myth originally described the foul demon. Lestat's character was so lavishly overblown as to verge on the comical. Each scene in the book was more or less a wishful description of an orgiastic costum party. The film characters portrayed by Pitt and Cruise cemented the laughable image. Hissing clowns, rouged, guy-shadow, and puffy shirt wearing caricatures, floating and flying around, catch the books atmosphere remarkably well. It's not a vampire novel. It's thinly disguised, (if at all) poorly written porn. True vampire fiction this is not. Awful."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Louis felt attachments to Lestat then Claudia, even though he knew Claudia did not truly love him and had evil about her. After Claudia's death, he never felt for anyone again. I did not like the author's use of the words \\"You see\\" and \\"For you see\\". To me, it sounded feminine and did not sound natural coming from the male, Louis.Sexual content: not evaluated. Setting: U.S. and Europe. Copyright: 1976. Genre: paranormal fiction."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Now while I can't say that this is my favorite book in the whole vampire chronicles series, I will have to give credit where its due. This book definitely is the mother of all fictional vampire books. I have reqd quite a few and none of them were as good as Anne Rice's popular vampire chronicles series. I also confess that the first book I read in the series was &quot;Queen of the Damned&quot;. I loved the title of the book. What sets apart Anne's books from other fictional vampire books is the amount of effort she puts in (like researching about the legend of Osiris and Isis for &quot;Queen of the Damned&quot;). Plus her style of writing isn't dumbed down like a lot of books that I have read. The other vampire books that I have read should have been written in comic book format, not in a novel format. They were horribly cheesy IMO. Although not my favorite book in the series, &quot;Interview With the Vampire&quot; is still a classic. I will agree to a certain extent with a reviewer that Louis is a bit of a whiner but the same can be said about Lestat. The film version of the book was exceptional. The cinematography was just excellent but it had its flaws like the miscasting of Armand and that the events in the beginning and end of the book did not happen. At least the film version of &quot;Interview With the Vampire&quot; is more entertaining and stays true to form than that wretched &quot;Queen of the Damned&quot; (a horrid idea to combine the 2nd and 3rd books in the series into one novel). Back to the book, I loved Anne's tribute to her dearly departed daughter and writing her as the child vampire Claudia. What a fitting yet haunting tribute. As I have said before, &quot;Interview With the Vampire&quot; may not be my very favorite book in the vampire chronicles series but had it not existed there would not be Lestat, Armand, Louis, Marius, and the other familiar vampire characters. &quot;Interview With the Vampire&quot; will go down in vampire lore as one of the most beloved books ever written, alongside Bram Stoker's &quot;Dracula&quot;."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"the book deserves 5 stars, and more. it's the best out of the vampire chronicles series. dark, tortuous, depressing, sensuous. FRESH. the first time i read it moved me to tears. the second time i cried again. maybe again the third time, and the time after that. it's a rare, great read. kind of sad that the author has been going downhills ever since this first brilliant start. if only her other books would measure up to IWTV, Anne Rice might truly be immortal as a literary figure."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"A wonderful first step in the Vampire chronicals! Louis is beautiful, Lestat is addicting and the young Claudia is a complement to the rest of the books. And to those who think that it was dissapionting, boring, unuseful and a waste of time all I have to say is that I think thats your way of saying that you were to STUPID to see the beauty and cultured art of this novel. I am still in high school and I found this book particularly interisting and it encouraged me to read the reset and I hope that we will see much more of these liberating books."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I starting reading Anne's Vampire Chronicles in 1987. I instantly fell in love with the way she brought each vampire to life. She can make it seem so possible to see a true vamp and not even realize it. I own and have read 4 of her books and intend to get the entire collection as I can afford them."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This book was incredable! It absolutly took my breath away. The relationship between Claudia and Louis was truely unique. I was amazed by the way Louis is able to express his feelings openly. Lestat was a vitial character in this story although you didn't hear about him much. I am ecstatic about reading the entire series. There is one bit of advise I would give to sombody; skip the movie and read the book instead."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"While I tend to prefer sci-fi to gothic horror, I received such an enthusiastic endorsement of this book that I went out and bought it. From the very start, when Louis demonstirates his inhumaness by lighting a cigarette too quickly to be seen, I was utterly enthralled by Rice's characters, lumanescent prose, and long view on history. It is as if you entered 19C New Orleans and then Europe with curious, anguished inhuman observers.This book is so good that it should be considered literature rather than potboiler gothic horror. If you get into it, the book can turn you inward, to question your human life, from the neurotic and existential agonies of these inhumans.Warmly recommended."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This book is a classic! It sets the stage for the gothic night inhabited by Louis, Lestat, Armand and a host of others. The main character is a vampire by page 12, the rest of the book is how a moral man can cope with the price of his immortality. he is accompanied by Lestat, a rouge of a vampire, who has no moral qualms with his condition and cant understand why Louis hates his existance so. This sets the stage, embrace new found immortality or reclaim lost humanity..."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This is one of my favorite Anne Rice books. It is an entrance into the dark, mysterious world of the vampires that inhabit her imagination. My friend loaned me this book, and i am glad he did. i could not put it down until i got to the end. If you liked the movie, buy the book, it is even better. Queen of the Damned and Memnoch are better, but this is the place you want to start in Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles ;)"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"When I first saw the movie Interview With the Vampire when I was five years-old, I did not know how much the story would impact my reading selections years later. Over this past summer, I have read Christopher Rice's &quot;A Density of Souls.&quot; Having thoroughly enjoyed this novel, I went to the bookstore to see what Christopher Rice's infamous mother, Anne Rice, had to offer. I found &quot;Interview With the Vampire&quot; on the bookshelf, and bought it. I was immediately drawn into the story of a 200 year-old vampire, Louis, telling his immortal life story to a reporter. I sympathized with the suffering Louis, and, found myself mysteriously drawn to the ever-present Lestat. I'd be lying if I said this book was an easy read. It used vocabulary uncomprehendable to my 16 year-old self, and there was more description then needed. But the twisted and compelling plot got me hooked. After reading 2 more of Rice's books, I have to say &quot;Interview With the Vampire&quot; is my favorite."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"A story of a vampire's lifeI found this book to be very interesting. It is about the life of a vampire named Lestat. Most of the story takes place in New Orleans where Lestat first becomes a vampire and then starts his new lifestyle. He starts to do the things other vampires do like sleeping in a coffin and staying up all night but one thing he does that other vampires don't in that he feels for things. This is something that really effects him and the other vampires he associates with throughout the book. I would say that one theme in the book could be Love. Lestat falls in love with another vampire that he created named claudia who is a small orphan child. Overall I felt this was a great book and I highly recomend it."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This book could have been five stars, but I got bored of hearing Louis consistantly wine about his vampire nature once he became one.At the same time, if Louis would have just accepted his vampire nature as that of a killer (which is all that vampires are according to the book), then I don't suppose there would have been much of a story to read.At any rate, Louis was a complete sniveling wimp.

A number of years ago(how many years..??), I ordered &quot;Interview&quot; from the bargain section of a book club because 1)at that time, I was really into vampires (S King's &quot;Salem's Lot&quot; among others) 2)it sounded like it might be a good read, and 3)it was really cheap! From that humble beginning, I have become a true Ann Rice fan, reading all her books - at least those written under AR. My sister also shared my enthusiasm for &quot;Interview&quot; but we had no idea at the time we had stumbled onto a book which would eventually be read and loved by so many...or that it was to become the first of a series. When did it all take off? We still have the copy ordered so long ago, along with copies of all those which have followed. However, &quot;Interview&quot; will always hold a special place, not only because it truly was/is a good read, but also because we happened upon it...what a pleasant surprise!

Stripping off the so-much-used myth of vampires as we all know it, or at least thought to know, Rice recreates and redraws the behavior and image of these creatures of the night adding veracity to their existence. Vampires who suffer, or feel, or long for the origin of their existence mark the beginning of a never-before-told story.

It gets better"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Try as I might, I really fail to see what all the hype was about this book. I've seen the movie although it's been quite a while until I recently caught about three quarters of it on cable. I've been reading many vampire novels as of late (the twilight saga, The Diaries of the Family Dracul trilogy and the magnificent The Historian). Being that this is such a highly praised book and claimed to be a 'vampire classic' I felt I owed it to myself to finally read it after all this time.I was utterly let down. I will say that the movie was as close an adaptation of any novel as I've ever read. Very little in the book was left out of the movie.The premise is interesting and I'm sure everyone knows exactly what it's about so I won't go into too much detail summing up what happens in the book.First off, it's a very VERY slow book. Basically we have Louis, who's a rich landowner in New Orleans. He gets bit by a vampire. They kill to live and sometimes make more vampires. All of this is revealed as Louis is telling his story to a 'young boy' with a tape recorder.Anyway, not much really happens in this book other than Louis lamenting his existence as a vampire. ALOT. As in, every paragraph of every page has some self loathing diatribe by Louis about how much his life 'sucks' (pun intended).While the premise was rather interesting (a vampire giving a chronicle of his creation and life to a journalist of sorts), it's just a laborious read. I found myself liking the movie. It wasn't my favorite, but it wasn't painful to watch, but the book was something completely opposite. I'm not sure if it was what did (or didn't) happen in the book as much as the overly verbose language used by Rice to explain every feeling, every sight, every movement in painstaking detail. It was almost like reading dickens. There's very little dialogue between characters in the book as well, which for me made it all the more difficult to get into. A character giving a long speach isn't good reading to me. I read for character interaction. I don't mind if it's in the form of a story told by a main character or a retrospective as this is, but it's about 340 pages of primarily Louis speaking of himself and very little dialogue is revealed in his tale.Also, there's very little vampire 'lore' in this book. I understand that Lestat kept all of this from Louis in order to keep him as close to himself as possible, but even after centuries of living and all the exposition of Louis's life and experiences, there's still next to no lore. Every author tells the tale of vampires' myths and legends a little differently. This book features next to none of that other than the fact that it seems in Ann Rice's universe, they're more human than what we're used to.Maybe in 1976 when this was the first type of book of its kind it was groundbreaking. I understand that and take it for what it's worth and give her credit. But I've found several other books featuring vampires that were more enjoyable by far.I'm curious to see how Vampire Lestat is different than Interview. I will say that if it's as slow and uneventful as Interview, I won't be reading another Ann Rice novel."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This book is what started all.This is the initial step that lead us into a world that is still being questioned.The world of vampires that has been modified since bram stoker!It is definitely worth the read and the money.But be warned,that once you get into the world of Ann Rice,there is no escape...ha ha haHere is the plot:Interview.The book is markedly different from the movie. In the movie, Louis was married and lost his wife in child birth, giving the reason for his depression. In the book it was his brother's death that threw him into depression and cursed him to long for death. The movie makes Lestat seem older than he really is, but in the book Louis can tell Lestat isn't that old because Lestat moves his blind mortal father into Pointe du Lac.In the book, Louis does feed on mortals early in his life as a vampire. When Lestat first takes him hunting, he feeds on a slave. Later Lestat shows Louis the glass trick, in which he bites into a rat and squeezes the blood into a glass and takes a sip. This is when Louis decides to feed on animals. But during this four years of feeding only on animals (rats, chicken, and cattle) Louis also bleeds Lestat's father, who is dying, when the slaves are rising up against Louis and Lestat because they suspect them of being 'creatures'. When Louis finally does go back to feeding on mortals it is only on strangers; he prefers not to know anything about them, refusing to stalk his prey or toy with them like Lestat does.In the book, Louis falls in love with Babette Freniere (one of his neighbors), whose plantation was close to Pointe du Lac. After Louis burns down Pointe du Lac, he and Lestat go to the Freniere Plantation and ask her for a room. She shows them to the wine cellar, but locks them in from the outside (in the movie they go to a graveyard). She comes to them after hearing all the rumors the slaves are passing around and questions them. Eventually they end up outside the house and Louis is talking to Babette, who has hate in her eyes and is disgusted, while Lestat goes to get their horses and carriage. Babette throws her lantern on Louis and he goes up in flames. Lestat puts the fire out and feeds on Babette for setting Louis on fire, but Louis stops Lestat killing Babette and they flee to New Orleans. Babette became insane and eventually dies.Claudia is put forth as being only five years old at the time she was made a vampire in the book; in the movie she appeared to be closer to ten years old. Her younger age in the book makes the fact that she could never grow up even more dramatic. In the movie Claudia goes into a rage and cuts off her hair only to have it grow back again. This does not happen in the book at all. In fact it happens to Gabrielle, Lestat's mother, in the next book The Vampire Lestat, and it only grows back during the day, while she is sleeping.In the movie Claudia kills an immigrant woman and buries her under dolls in her bed. When questioned why she did it, she states that she wanted her body or wanted to be her. In the book this did not happen. Claudia killed two female servants, mother and daughter, and hid them in the kitchen, which was never used. When their family came looking for them, Lestat ended up killing them. Louis burned the two servants bodies in the kitchen stove. When Louis and Lestat finally get a chance to question Claudia, she does her \\"Which one of you did it? Which one of you made me the way I am?\\" performance.In the book, Louis signs over some of the rental properties to Lestat as a way to buy their freedom.Claudia tells Louis of her plan to kill Lestat in the book, but doesn't in the movie. When Claudia attempts to kill Lestat she \\"rapes\\" him, by feeding on him while he is bleeding to death from multiple wounds she inflicted. Afterward she shows signs of the mind gift.In the movie Lestat mentions that he found a person who would make a better vampire than Claudia, but that person is never seen. In the book, Lestat befriends a musician and often questions Louis as to whether he did or did not kill him. After the attempted murder of Lestat, the musician comes around the house asking questions about Lestat and isn't satisfied with any of Louis' answers. Louis notices the puncture marks on the musician's neck and thinks back to Lestat telling Claudia that he found someone who would make a better vampire than both of them. The next night, the night of their departure for Europe, Claudia comes running home crying that someone's been following her and it is the musician, who is now a vampire. Then they hear Lestat banging on the back door. Lestat finally forces his way into the house and Louis sets him on fire and then Lestat and Louis start fighting. The musician climbs up over the balcony and fights Claudia. Claudia easily escapes the musician, who can't seem to get his hands on her. She comes to Louis' aid and beats Lestat with the poker to get him off Louis and they run out of the burning house into the night.In the book Louis and Claudia traveled through several parts of Europe (Varna, Carpathians, Piraeus, Germany, Transylvania, Hungary, and Bulgaria) looking for vampires before they arrived in France. They also met several vampiric creatures that were quite unlike most of the vampires seen in the Vampire Chronicles. In the movie this part is only narrated by Louis while Claudia browses charcoal drawings she has made throughout their travels.The movie immediately cuts from Madeleine's transformation into a vampire to her and Claudia's apprehension by the Theater vampires, while in the book she lives with Claudia and Louis for one week before she dies.In the book Armand is described as a young man aged seventeen, while in the movie he appears to be in his late twenties.In the movie the Theater vampires lead by Santiago suspect that Louis and Claudia killed Lestat, while in the book Lestat comes to Paris in person (the reasons are told in The Vampire Lestat) and informs on Claudia. Lestat makes a deal with the vampires that they would kill Claudia, but allow him to have Louis.In both book and movie, Armand approves of Claudia's death and arranges for Louis to be buried alive. Immediately after Claudia's death he rescues the buried Louis, because he wants him to have Louis to himself. Louis avenges Claudia's death by destroying the Paris Coven but spares Armand. In the movie Louis refuses Armand's offer to become his companian and abandons him in Paris, while in the book Louis and Armand, united in a love/hate relationship, travel the world together. Eventually Louis becomes almost devoid of feeling (of the sort that Armand yearns for in his companion), and Armand leaves Louis.Another small difference is the fact that vampires cry tears of blood in the books; in the film Louis cries regular tears of water.The endings of the book and movie also differ. In the book, Louis feeds on Daniel Molloy, and when Daniel wakes the next day he sets off for New Orleans to track down Lestat, while in the movie he is attacked by Lestat while driving over the Golden Gate Bridge and it is implied that Lestat is going to turn Daniel into a vampire. In Queen of the Damned, Armand turns Daniel into a vampire.Here are some of the characters you would meet:Louis de Pointe du Lac was born in New Orleans in 1766, and was made into a vampire by Lestat in 1791. Anne Rice wrote this book after the death of her daughter, and Louis becomes melancholic and depressive as a projection of Rice's feelings. He displays emotion that is uncommonly human for a vampire, and feels moral remorse in killing humans. Louis, faithful and displaying weakness, strongly contrasts against Lestat.Daniel Molloy is a reporter who records Louis' life story. After the interview, he wants to become a vampire, feeling that Louis wastes his \\"gift.\\"Lestat de Lioncourt was born in 1760. In 1779, he flees to Paris with his friend Nicholas to become an actor. There, an old vampire named Magnus ambushes him and makes him into a vampire against his will. Then, after teaching Lestat nothing, Magnus hurls himself into a huge bonfire telling Lestat to scatter the ashes else he will rise again and destroy Lestat. He is the narrator of five of the books in the Chronicles, in which he portrays himself as the hero. His fledglings are Gabrielle, Nicholas, Louis, Claudia, the musician, David, and Mona Mayfair.Claudia is a very young girl turned into a vampire in 1795 by Louis and Lestat. Although she remains eternally in the body of a small child, she mentally grows into a woman. Louis is horribly attached to Claudia, feeling guilt for his part in her creation, and thus is distraught when she dies.Santiago is the classical vampire and member of the Th&eacute;tre des Vampires. At first he seems to be a joker, but then turns out to be a cruel murderer. He kills Claudia and Madeleine. Louis avenges Claudia's death by decapitating him.Armand was created in the 15th century by Marius. Armand is the leader of a group of vampires and manages the Th&eacute;tre des Vampires in Paris. His character is embossed by a lot of shocking experiences. He is very intelligent and swore never to make a vampire, until he made the dying Daniel Molloy a vampire in Queen of the Damned.Madeleine is a Parisian woman who lost her daughter and thereupon begins to love Claudia as if she were her own flesh. She and Claudia are killed together.enjoy...Nigel."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I don't know if I can express how much this novel enchanted me. When reading it, I feel like I am in a beautiful dream. I have read the entire series and I must say that I enjoyed the first three books the most. Memnoch the Devil was the most ambitious but a little hard to get through IMO. Although Lestat is always the main character in the books, it is Louis that speaks to me the most and I have always wished that the series continued more with him in it. A man with such strong morals is always worth reading about. I believe him to be the most decent vampire of the lot of them and therefor the most real. But I understand Anne Rice's reluctance to revisit him because he represents the weakness in her and Lestat is her strong alter-ego.People often think that this book will be very scary but the truth is that this is more a book about humans than it is about vampires."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Interview with the Vampire was the first of the Anne Rice series of vampire books and is my favorite. The book is fresh and pure. it is a mini-epic that is reads from the little I know of the author's life as semi-autobiography.Here we have th story a Louis stricken with grief who is made a vampire by the vampire Lestat.The story begins in New Orleans but takes us from there to the Balkans and then to France where Louis meets others of his kind.Lestat and Lois read like two demons or philosophical points of view with which the author wrestles and explores. Louis is a well intentioned deeply religious figure where as Lestat is a bit of a hedonist, fop and trouble maker.Before Lestat was elevated as a type of vampire super hero in the author's other books Interview with the Vampire had them as a pair of buddies (or blood brothers as it were). Quicky skillfully and with ease Rice developes these two characters and makes their interaction fascinating.In essence it is quite a human story of two non-humans.Rice re-invented the Vampire genre in this series but I think this book (as opposed to the others that followed) will appeal to the general reader of fiction and not just the fan of horror novels."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Anne Rice took the publishing world by storm in \\"Interview With the Vampire,\\" a haunting book that turned the evil-bloodsucker cliche on its ear. Her lush prose and vivid characters turn the dramatic plot and strange scenarios into a chilling look at good and evil, thankfully without melodrama.In modern times, a young man is interviewing a vampire on tape recorder. The vampire is Louis Pointe du Lac. In 1791, his ultra-religious brother died tragically after an argument, and Louis sank into remorse and despair. Enter Lestat de Lioncourt, a charming vampire who offers Louis a way out of his grief.The two vampires wander the cities of the world, with Lestat teaching his reluctant pupil the ways of vampirism. In time Louis makes a \\"daughter\\": Claudia, a vampire child with the mind of a woman. Now, depressed and unhappy, Louis explains how he and Claudia fled Lestat, only to encounter new tragedies that still haunt him to this day...Moral struggles are rarely present in vampire novels. Certainly not from the vampire's point of view. But that is exactly what Anne Rice attempts in this book. She wraps her dark story in lush prose and beautiful descriptions of Paris and her hometown of New Orleans, making this one of the best-written vampire stories since \\"Dracula.\\"No gore and grit here. Rice's writing is exceptionally beautiful, full of lush descriptions and intricate detail. Best of all, it has that rare quality of atmosphere -- no matter how enchanting the vampire, or beautiful the setting, a feeling of darkness and sorrow runs through it.Rice also dips into one of the best examples of literary vampirism ever: Louis becomes a vampire out of his grief, but once the grief fades, he is left with the soul of a human, and the bloodthirst of a vampire -- things that can't be reconciled. His longing to remain as human as possible, in defiance of his curse, is a tragic twist in a dark storyline.Louis is a bit of a whiner, but a deeper look reveals why. He struggles with morality and beliefs that -- unlike Lestat -- he never really let go of. Because he is a vampire, he is by his very nature a killer, yet the idea of murder is repulsive to him. Lestat is utterly charming and incredibly engaging, despite his amoral behavior. It's not hard to see why Louis would be drawn in by such an enchanting person, no matter how bad he is.One of the greatest shaping influences on elegant vampire lore has been Anne Rice's \\"Interview with the Vampire.\\" A beautiful and lush novel of darkness and beauty."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Anne Rice is my favorite author. She makes characters come alive like no one else. However, this book is one of her worst works. Do not use this book to judge the talent of this woman. I am glad I read this book last in the Vampire Chronicals, because if I had read it first, I would not have continued reading and discovering her works. This is one of the only times I can honestly say, the movie is better than the book. Please, don't read this book and drop Anne Rice from your reading list. The rest of her books are incredible and more than worthy of your time."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"If Anne Rice had stopped here, if she had never written another word about the vampires or the witches, I think this book would be discussed as the ultimate 20th century vampire tale. Unfortunately, many people now look down on Rice as a &quot;preternatural&quot; (Rice sure does love that word)Danielle Steele. This is due, no doubt, to the fact that Rice's output since then has been rather rushed.(one or two books a year... and usually the same narrative structure of somebody recounting their tale to another). Perhaps Rice's work has been marred by her prolificness (is that even a word). Rice lost me with Taltos and Memnoch the Devil when it didn't even seem like she gave much thought to her stories anymore. But this first book is a tremendous achievement on a par with (yes, I am going there) Bram Stokers Count. It's wonderful, exciting, and engrossing. If all her books go out of print, this and 1990's &quot;The Witching Hour&quot; deserve to be sold forever. I would also recommend the first two sequels to this novel: The Vampire Lestat (which is far and away the favorite of the series)and The queen of the Damned (another place that Rice could have stopped her series). But not one of her novels has touched me as emotionally as her first. I can rememeber waiting to come home and read it every night (and yes, i *do* have a life too..) Written in a beautiful style, &quot;Interview&quot; only proves that Anne Rice herself is the true queen of the damned. Now if only she'd write another great one..it's been long overdue."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I fell in love with the writing of Anne Rice bcause of this book. If you have never read any of her works, this is a good one to start out with. Her writing draws you into the story until you feel like you are a third person watching the events happening. It's wonderful."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I loved it, but having seen the film first I expected more. Without the book the film is worth 5 stars and without the film the book is, but each is missing a part of the magic of the other. Still, you should see and read both! You'll be happy you did.Most people like the characters of Louis or Lestat the best, but I liked Armand most. You see, in the film Louis seemes human, but in the book he turns into a monster. He thinks that Armand feels nothing, but I think that he is only diffrent. Wouldn't you be diffrent after 400 years? Louis feels like a human being before he meets Armand, but in the end HE is the one who feels nothing. Well, that's my opinion, maybe I got the whole thng wrong:P"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This Interview with the Vampire has to be one of my favorite books I have ever read. Anne Rice makes the vampires of this book seem otherworldly yet human. She kept many old myths about the vampires, such as them sleeping in coffins, and also added some new ones, such as them being immune to crosses and garlic.This book is an absolute masterpiece. I have never before seen a book written the way Anne Rice wrote it. Its a wonderful mixture of first person and third person.I must admit that this book was quite a page turner. The excitement wasn't as intense as in other books, but the mysticism kept me coming back for more. I suggest this book with anyone who takes a liking to vampires and such. It really is worth the read."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This is my favorite book. The way rice uses vampires to tell a sensual and sensational tale about the human search for answers and meaning in existance through a vampire is brilliant. Louis is one of the most endearing characters i have ever read. This is by far her best work, and the reast book i have ever read."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"The book that started it all. When I first read it, it enraptured me and I could not stop reading it! It focuses on the vampire Louis, a native of New Orleans(like the author)who originally came from Paris. After his religious brother's death, he is in deep pain and anguish. The ruthless vampire, Lestat, turns him into a vampire, opens his eyes to an all new world. Louis at first feeds upon animals such as rats, because of his fear of human death. His first &quot;real&quot; human taking was a young girl who's mother had just died of the plague named Claudia. Claudia at first seems to follow Lestat's ruthlessness, but soon becomes very emotionally attached to Louis. When Claudia becomes overwhelmed with love and need for her and Louis to be together, she kills Lestat(or so she thought...) They then retreat to Paris in search of other vampires. They find a theatre called the &quot;Theatre des Vampires&quot;. Then they meet with a vampire named Armand. He is the leader of the other vampires there and he wants Louis, but not Claudia. Claudia all but forces Louis to make the woman Madeleine a vampire to watch after her because she knows that Armand wants her dead. And sure enough Claudia and Madeleine died. Louis then kills all of the vampires at the theater excluding Armand. Armand and he then travel all across the world after art. Then Louis' dispair harms yet again another loved one as Armand leaves him, forever. And that brings him to where he is now. BEWARE! I have not yet read the other Vampire Chronicle books but I VERY much intend to do so(I might just order 'em off this fine site!)and when I do read them be prepared because another review will be waiting...=)"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I read this book before I saw the movie.I like the movie alot more it was much more fun. I thought that for the book was slow it did not keep me up at night.I love a book that can do that. There are other Anne Rice books that alot better like Queen of the Damned which is alot of fun."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"It's like a Soap Opera starring Vampires. I hoped for so much more after the rave reviews I've heard. Unless you are interested in television/Hollywood style predictable drama, I would highly recommend you to spend you time on some other literature... yawn."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I have read this book and several other of Anne Rice's, she shows the characters feelings and the depth they will go to attain their goal. Not just victims. Listat is an unusual person not just a vampire with feelings that didn't care about anything but his craving for blood. I first read the Vampire Chronicles and they were fabulous I could not put them down. I may not be an expert or a writer but I am good with books and reading and have a collection of over 10,000 books in mint condition many bought on the auction and many favorite authors. Anne Rice is a very favorite one. I am looking forward to Ms. Rice's comic's coming out so I can collect them all. I have been watching for them. I understand people who don't like a book for one reason or another but when they leave a negative feedback like the first one I saw it really isn't fair to the author or even giving her a chance because many people buy a book based solely on the synopsis. I believe it is unfair to the author and publsher."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This is a very good book! I recommend it to anyone who likes horror books. You definitely need to read the book before you whatch the movie."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Anne Rice is a spellbinding novelist. This book is *magnificent*! :-"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"To be honest I couldn't finish this book but I didn't think it was extraordinarily bad. I just had other books that I wanted to read and didn't think I should waste time on this one. I am an Anne Rice fan, but this is just not one of her best in my opinion. Long, drawn out scenes such as the one at Theatre de Vampires just weren't written well enough to hold my summer vacation influenced attention."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This book was stunning! It was written so lyrically. Anne Rice makes the life of a vampire seem incredibly interesting. Everyone should read the entire Vampire Chronicles. I've read them twice; they keep getting better! By the end of Interview you'll feel as if you know these vampires personally. Even if you're not a fan of horror this book will mesmerize you!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This is the best book . One of Anne Rices best work. She truly captures the nights of the vampire in this wonderful book Interview with the Vampire. I would recommend this book to any teen or Adult. Not to the little kids because of the graphic content. Lestat the cold hearted vampire. Louis the almost human vampire . And Claudia the little girl vampire that menepulates her vicktoms. They make ineterview with the vampire the most imaginative , realistic , and captivating vampire book ever. You will not be able to put this book down. I can not wait to read book 2 The Vampire Lestat if it is as good as Interview with the Vampire I will not be able to put it down. I give this book 5 great big stars."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This is a good book. The book starts off kind of slow, the quiete life then all of the sudden, bam! Louis's life is transformed. The book seems to pick up and drop speed at various times, but the last one hundred pages in the book are excellent! the characters change, and It leaves me hungry for more! it is not the best book I have ever read, but it is pretty high up there. Oh and I am rating this book by itself, I am not some vampire goth waiting down the street, I read all kinds of stuff. Please email me your comments"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Louis adventures into the 20th century amazed me. I've always hungered for vampire books, and this one is the best!

I liked this book so much I HAD to go out and get the next one in the series and all there after.

Get it and read it and fall in love with it NOW!!!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Despite the overly dense descriptions and some irritating lead characters, this book is worth reading just to see how much it has influenced vampire stories and movies since it was written.Of Rice's Vampire Chronicles, this is the only decent book."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"There are negatives to this book, as in anything. At first I was a little put off by the writing. It seemed a tad sloppy in the beginning (but it's very forgivable--a few overused words, some stylistic concerns, probably can be attributed to the copyright date, maybe I'm just not used to the trends of yesterday).As the book really winds to a climax, these characters come to life, almost heart-rendingly so, because they do not carry about as you'd have your beloved empathized carry about.Through the eyes of the vampire Louis, we see the fire of humanity burning so strong that centuries of torment cannot quench it. Or do they? Thus the ending is not how most of us would have it, there were eventually no characters I could sympathize with, probably very true to the subject, but I'm hoping the rest of the Vampire Chronicles satisfy (and am thinking they will).Highly recommended. This should be a required (open-minded) read for anyone who calls him or herself a Christian (God is neither denied or supported, but viewing the choices of the characters leads you to make some valuable choices of your own).I'm excited to see how the rest of the series open up, as well as Rice's other books. I fear she has sunk her teeth into me."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Interview is a very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Ok i first watched the movie i loved it even though it was more along the lines of a drama then a horror movie but ohwell.

Lestat made his life miserably, when Lestat wants Louis to be a cruel person with no feelings. Louis never lost his human soul and still believes in love and having hope by meeting Cloudia. &quot;Interview with Vampire&quot; may be very different book for every person. I think that author used a lot of details that some times could be missed. And what I liked very much is how the author gave a contrast between the characters, the difference between their personalities. The author does a great job in her writing when she describes feelings, emotions, and actions motivated by those feelings. I would like to recommend this book to people who like fiction and stories about mysteries life of people or creatures,which interested in the life of the Vampires."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I loved this book and give it a perfict 5, I loved the way the author describes the feeling, and emotion that the main chairicter Louis feels, the canning lust filled vampire named Lestat, and the inocence of the killings of the dollfaced Claudia.

If you have read it, read it again!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Probably the best vampire book ever written, including the original Dracula, Interview is mesmerizing. Treating the undead as angst ridden homosexuals was brilliant. Surprising, thoughtful and amusing, this is a book that I would recommend to anyone; it's way up near the top in the horror genre."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Interview with the Vampire, and the rest of the Vampire Chronicles by Anne Rice, have the ability to capture the reader and pull him or her into a dark world of vampires and eroticism. For those people who aren't a big fan of vampires, I would say that this novel is definitely still worth reading. I didn't like vampires much either, but I read the book anyways because I'd heard so many good things about it. I found Anne's take on vampires to be exciting and different. She breathed new life into an old and dying myth. Anne's writing is full of beautiful detail and the descriptions and provoking thoughts of the book's main character, Louis. Be prepared if you do decide to read this book to be taken on a journey, carried away from the world in which you live. Louis' life is filled with passion and haunted with his desire to kill -- to drink the blood of a living being, to feel the beating of their heart and experience their thoughts and feelings and very existance as they are drained of their life source and left empty to die. This experience overtakes Louis and the reader, and is often accompanied with feelings of ecstasy and passion, both erotic and homoerotic. If the small sections of erotic writing in the Vampire books leaves you wanting more, Anne Rice has written an intense collection of books called the Sleeping Beauty Trilogy. I highly recommend them, along with this book and the 5 others in the Vampire Chronicles."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"The first time I approached _Interview with the vampire_, it was in London, in 1981. I bought it because it was a bargain book and the cover was attractive. But as I began to read this novel, I found it charming and original, expecially because of the language. I cannot forget the description of Louis' smile.At that time, my English was not adequate and I had to stop the reading. I forgot this book nearly completely. Seme years after, in 1994, I saw rhe movie. I was totally fascinated and a little confused by it. Yes, because my favourite character was Lestat, spite of Brad Pitt's beauty and enchanting smile.I read the book again. In the meanwhile, I had improved my English and it was a page turner for me. Fascinating, capturing from the beginning to the end. I am a writer, and I became a little envious of Miss Rice's style!But there is something in the characters which sounds to me not completely convincing. If you see the movie, you very easily find grief and anguish on Tom Cruise's face. But you can also find the same feelings in the book, if your reading is not superficial.Lestat loves Louis so deeply that he gets to Paris just for bringing him back to New Orleans. He is very angry with Claudia, but in the final reel he cries for her. That's terrible. Lestat is ill and weak, but Louis refuses to help him.Louis' misunderstandings are unbearable. So, reading _The Vampire Lestat_ was a strong relief for me.And seeing the two heroes reconciliating was a true joy.Of course, al of this would not have happened to me if Miss Rice's were not a splendid writer, as she definitely is."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I have read this book many times as well as the movie. And everytime I finish it, I look back and love every sentence of it. Many times my friends criticize me for reading something &quot;so blatently homoerotic.&quot; But to all those people out there who are afraid of two men hugging, that's what vampires are about. Killing, sensuality, and sexuality. Without these things, a vampire is just an immortal statue. Get over your hangups if you decide to read this book, but if you do, it's very worth the time. One day, this book will be required reading in high school english classes. A true work of literature."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Not to sound cliche or trite, but from the first beautifully descriptive page to the last, this book left me breathless, this book had me transfixed. I found myself beginning to care about these characters and as the days went by I saw more and more parallels that could be drawn from this work and applied to 'mortal' life. I liked Louis, in that he was so beautiful, but so tormented. All of the characters around him represented other facets of human personality that often clash with the brooding passive nature that Louis represented. Lestat, the cocky arrogant killer, Claudia, with her petulant childish demands, and Armand, with his detached, wise, and cold affecture. Since reading this book, I have been searching for another that equals its tone and morbid dark beauty, but have not found one to equal the feelings this invoked. This one seemed to embody a perfect balance between historical fiction, horror, and aestetics. I am only sorry I waited so long to read it."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Louie whines too much. Accept it, deal with it! Although Anne Rice is saying something about our moral ethics and all that... Louie just got on my nerves. It's Survival of the Fittest, guy, so either suck the blood or starve to death!Anyways, Claudia... sometimes she pissed me off. If she was really so unhappy about her childish form then she can commit suicide...Lestat... I love Lestat. I love his mischieviousness, his playfulness... I just love his whole character!! That is why I read the series... even Memnoch the Damned (&lt;---steer clear of this one, guys.)And to the comment from the guy who says he's a Vampire... UH.. OOOOOOKAY. Can you tell us how it REALLY is?"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Anne Rice's Interview is a well written but long winded tell of gothic vampires. The pace of the book is generally slow and the central character Louis is almost unbearably whiny and self-absorbed. His &quot;creator&quot; Lestat is much more interesting and embraces his vampire nature with gusto. This is emphasized even more in the follow-up novel by Anne Rice. Although the book can be quite pretentious at times it is still worth the time to read and I would recommend it, especially to those that enjoy classical, literary style writing."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I can only think of one word to describe this book : WORDY. I kinda liked the story; the suffering of Louis, Lestat's evilness, but the way the story just drags on in places totally ruined it all. If you are really thinking of reading this book i suggest you dont tire yourself and just watch the movie instead ."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I read this book a couple of months ago and it became my favorite. This book is not for everyone, especially if you're looking for a typical &quot;horror&quot; novel. I admit, I was bored when I first strated reading it, but then I really got into it. I have read all the Vampire chronicles and this is the absolute best. Louis is the most realistic character because of his human emotions and feelings. It seems like he is the only vampire who thought it was morally wrong to kill, at least for the first four years. All of the vampires in the rest of the Vampire Chronicles killed right away without a trace of guilt. This novel made me fall in love with Louis, it made me cry, it's amazing. It's sad that Anne Rice chose to focus only on Lestat (aka The Brat Prince) in her other vampire novels. True, this book can be depressing at times, it's not a &quot;Chicken Soup for the Vampire's Soul.&quot; If you want a novel that truly develops the characters and makes you think, read this."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This book was emotional in a sense that you would become attached Claudia the young Vampire. Its wordiness gives this book a good rating. It helps to make the imagination roam and one could become indulged in this book. Although Louis wines a lot an Lestat is actually telling him the truth on not knowing anything you run into incidents where you question the validity of the two. Never had I read a book of Vampires that seems so real. This is a well written book and well worth your time."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I think this is the best book I have ever read. I read this book 5 times. Yes it is true. Because I live in Turkey. And the Turkish reader have got only this book's Turkish edition.:((( If you want to think about your life and your relations you must read this book. (and other Anne Rice's Vampire books) When I read this book my life is changed. Thanks to Anne Rice for this book."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"The prevailing plot line of almost every single horror story that has ever been told has revolved around the idea that the heros are the ones who are the victims of some terrible monster.'Interview with the Vampire' changed the traditional idea of the &quot;monster&quot; by letting the creature of the tale be the hero for a change. There are hundreds of stories told from the point of view of frightened victims trying to kill a monster, but Rice's story is told from the point of view of the killer, the monster...the vampire.But don't let yourself be fooled by the title. Although the book's hero is a vampire, the THEME of the book is not what one would expect. Although Rice makes the vampire into a seductive, beautiful, almost glamourous creature, she also shows the darker side of immortality. Before she began to delve more deeply into the &quot;Vampire lifestyle&quot; in her subsequent sequels, Rice examined the more troubling aspects of being a fledgling vampire...guilt, despair, and lonliness.Rice shows that even death itself does not present one with all the answers of life, and that the problems of mere mortals still plague the minds of the supernatural. The narrator of the story, the 200 year old vampire Louis, who had come to dread life as a mortal, found something that he thought even more horrible than death itself...eternal life.If you find yourself walking down the streets of New Orleans, and feel yourself being followed, but hear no footsteps, you may just be pursued by Louis or by the even more menancing Lestat. But armed with Anne Rice's new vision of the undead, rather than running away in fear, you might just find yourself slowing down to introduce yourself."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Anne Rice takes us, through the darkness, into the depths of the human soul to find out the inmost desire of every human being: Immortality"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I read the book with the sad idead that it would be similiar to the film. i was wrong.The film is a LOT different than the book, which doesnt say that the film is bad - or the book- but it says that they made a good film out of a brilliant book,and changed it a lot.Having said that, of course the book will resemble the film in parts, but not a hell of a lot. I thought that Louis would start off by narrating, and then we would be in the present timemjust reading the story. But again, i was wrong. He narrates the whole way through, and believe me it's very enjoyable.The only problem i have, is i seen the film first. Everyone knows a book is better than the film, and a lot of the time you can enjoy the book after the film because it makes little of the film. The thing that bothers me is the characters. When i read this book i saw only Brad Pitt, Kirsten Dunst, Tom Cruise, Antonio Banderas etc and its annoying more than anything.I like the way i can make the character in my own, mind. but after the film, the character is as you know him or her. and i saw the cast of the movie.Despite that, its a brilliant read, and you wont want to put it down when you get to the last page. A book you can read again and again and enjoy more each time....... ;-)"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"My first encounter with Anne Rice's Interview With The Vampire was in the early 1990s when a grade school girl friend had purchased a paperback copy at a yard sale for fifty cents. I remember her clutching it to her chest and kicking her feet in the air while lying on her bed as she exclaimed, \\"I am in love with this book!\\"I did not follow her advice and read it for myself. But in 1994, much to the hype of its two leading actors, I was fascinated by the film adaptation which was released while I was working my first job in a movie theater.Six years later I was working in a bookstore and regularly listening to the hype of other vampire fans who lusted after every new book in the Chronicles series. I finally picked up The Witching Hour after being encouraged by a close friend but I put it down before finishing it because I just didn't feel like I was a mature enough reader at the time to enjoy it the way it was intended.But I was turned on to Anne's son and his writing that year after I attended a book signing for his first book, Density of Souls. Now, another 12 years later, I finally decided to read his mother.After reading Anne's latest, The Wolf Gift, just a few weeks ago and being well pleased with it, I decided it was finally time to give her vampires a try. I'd been collecting her books in hardcover with intention to read them at some point and my copy of Interview is a 1976 hardcover 1st edition.It's hard to believe this book came out the year I was born. It definitely reads like a timeless classic and holds its appeal still today. As long as readers are fascinated by vampires, I'm sure Interview will be in print and continue to sell. I was also surprised by how well the book was adapted to film, but that is to be expected since, to my knowledge, Anne did work on the script.My main problem was that it's almost impossible not to picture Tom Cruise as Lestat or Brad Pitt as Louis while reading it. Surprisingly, Kirsten Dunst did not pop into my head as much for Claudia. And I tried desperately to keep Antonio out of my head as Armand since he was my least favorite actor in the movie.I also enjoyed the minor plot lines that were in the book, but not in the movie - the biggest being the presence of Lestat's human father in the beginning of the book.Even though it's one of the shortest books in the Vampire Chronicles, it is definitely not a light read. At 309 pages, it took me just over 2 weeks to read it. Rice is extremely poetic and does tend to over romanticize descriptions. Heavy descriptions of ornate clothing, furnishings, and New Orleans settings really dragged the narrative for me at times, though Rice definitely knows how to paint a picture for her readers.That being said, you do get a definite sense of Louis's struggle (both physical and emotional) with being a vampire. You are in his head 100% even though he's telling the story; his emotional turmoil with who he is and the debate of good and evil is prevalent. But it is often Lestat's pride and acceptance of what he is that drives the book, despite how much Louis despises him. I'm definitely looking forward to the next book in the series which focuses entirely on Lestat.Though this book wasn't completely my forte, I do have an appreciation and admiration for it just because it really did define the genre that we know today. While vampires have become more monstrous and much more accepting of what and who they are, perhaps in a way they all stemmed from the beautiful lost Louie or boastful Lestat."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I barely ever read. So if I am telling you I loved this book, you know it has to be good! I enjoyed \\"Queen of the Damned\\" the movie and, as a result, decided to read the Vampire Chronicles, starting from the beginning. I haven't been disappointed by my decision!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I read this book at 16 when it first came out. It left me dazed- fascinated with black clothes, the deep philosophical mysteries of graveyards and with the cafeteria's red fruit punch. I've since heard INTERVIEW dismissed as trashy pulp, perhaps because it's part of a series but, also, frankly, because of the uneven quality of Rice's later writing. At first, critics seemed unsure of what to make of INTERVIEW. Here was an unknown writer's first novel- a horror novel which not only entertained in an intelligent, deeply evocative way but which also asked to be taken seriously as literature.It's the first person story of Louis, a wealthy, young Louisiana creole who allowed himself to be made a vampire in a weak moment. He then spends 175 years trying to understand what he's become. It involves Lestat, (the vampire who created him and, left him ignorant of the rest of vampiric society), Claudia, (the doll-like 6-year-old Lestat made a vampire- in the book, Louis is very aware of Claudia's adult mind and his romantic attachment to her) and Armand (the powerful vampire from whom Louis seeks answers and with whom he falls in love). It explores questions about evil, freedom and God. (You can play \\"name the philosopher\\" with the premises examined.) It visits 19th century New Orleans, Transylvania (a story in itself) and Paris where Armand's subterranean vampire community runs a macabre theater.The book inhabits a dimension beyond any movie in sensual power. Rice hadn't yet discovered overt eroticism (there's only one brief, although powerful, example of that) but you feel you can actually touch the book's nocturnal world as its sinister beauty seeps in. The point, however, is that evil, even when profoundly alluring, is ultimately empty and unsatisfying.In later readings, I was struck by how bleak the conclusion is. Remember, apparently, THERE WAS NO SEQUEL INTENDED. Rice spent about 10 years after this as a historical novelist (FEAST OF ALL SAINTS, CRY TO HEAVEN) and experimenting with pseudonymous erotic fiction (SLEEPING BEAUTY, EXIT TO EDEN) before writing THE VAMPIRE LESTAT. Originally, Louis' tragic situation at the end of this book was it.All great books take risks. You may hate Rice's idiosyncrasies. It's still a great book."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"With so many reviews out there let me keep this short and sweet - Anne Rice loves her characters, she loves New Orleans and she loves her craft. Her book is full of delightful details, not just about the people and the places, but she writes about their very clothes, right down to the pattern on their cloaks, and she dives into their deepest thoughts - no matter how dark and bloody they might be. She loves every tiny piece of history that she can pour into Louis, Lestat and Claudia. She pours in her knowledge, her own emotions and her pains to make real people to live and love and die within the yellowed pages of the book - my copy is from 1989 and VERY well used. I took it to college and when I had to move it stayed with me, part of the core of books I refuse to sell, give away or toss out. The book is as sexy, honest and terrible as the vampires within it."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"The first time I approached _Interview with the vampire_, it was in London, in 1981. I bought it because it was a bargain book and the cover was attractive. But as I began to read this novel, I found it charming and original, expecially because of the language. I cannot forget the description of Louis' smile.At that time, my English was not adequate and I had to stop the reading. I forgot this book nearly completely. Seme years after, in 1994, I saw rhe movie. I was totally fascinated and a little confused by it. Yes, because my favourite character was Lestat, spite of Brad Pitt's beauty and charming smile.I read the book again. In the meanwhile, I had improved my English and it was a page turner for me. Fascinating, capturing from the beginning to the end. I am a writer, and I became a little envious of Miss Rice's style!But there is something in the characters which sounds to me not completely convincing. If you see the movie, you very easily find grief and anguish on Tom Cruise's face. But you can also find the same feelings in the book, if your reading is not superficial.Lestat loves Louis so deeply that he gets to Paris just for bringing him back to New Orleans. He is very angry with Claudia, but in the final reel he cries for her. That's terrible. Lestat is ill and weak, but Louis refuses to help him.Louis' misunderstandings are unbearable. So, reading _The Vampire Lestat_ was a strong relief for me.And seeing the two heroes reconciliating was a true joy.Of course, al of this wuold not have happened to me if Miss Rice's were not a splendid writer, as she definitely is."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This is a facinating book because it takes what you know about vampires and greatly expands on it because the story is told from the point of view of a vampire that wishes he wasn't a vampire!What makes the story facinating is that vampires make mortals into vampires so that they will have companionship down through the centuries. The vampires no longer have sex - although the act of drinking blood gives them intense hallucinogenic images from the victims life, which is as intimate and exciting as sex.BASIC STORY LINE: It has been 200 years since Louis was made into a vampire in New Orleans by Lestat. Louis was a rich plantation owner in New Orleans when it was under control of the French. Louis is stalked by Lestat and given the &quot;dark gift&quot;. After becoming a vampire Louis goes on a intense philosopical quest trying to find meaning in the universe. He wants to know when Satan is going to show up, since it is obvious to him that they are evil creatures. Lestat has a party mentality and tells Louis that he has been a vampire for over 500 years and he has never seen God or the devil and he could care less - he is having a great time. Fearing that Louis will leave him, Lestat makes a 12 year old girl that Louis was facinated with into a vampire. The kicker is this - you never age physically anymore once you are made into a vampire. Claudia doesn't really understand what has happened to her since she has the mind of a child. But as the years pass and she goes through puberty emotionally without any outlet and comes to realize that she is permanently trapped in a child's body she is filled with rage.This is the background for one of the most facinating love triangles you will ever read. This book is a very complex and engrossing story. Try it!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This is a very difficult review for me to write. I had minimal experience with Anne Rice before reading this novel. I had read \\"The Mummy\\" a long time ago, and it didn't do much for me at the time. My tastes have changed, however, so I decided to reacquaint myself with Rice's work.On the back cover of the paperback, there is a quote from the Boston Globe which reads \\"If you surrender and go with her, you have surrendered to enchantment, as in a voluptuous dream\\". I couldn't agree more, since the writing style here demands that you surrender logic and suspend disbelief in order to gain any enjoyment at all out of this story.Before you jump to the conclusion that this is a negative review, please note that I have given this work 4 stars out of 5.Briefly, this story is exactly what the title suggests: it's a first-person tale told through the eyes of a vampire. The interviewer (identified only as \\"boy\\") sits with Louis the vampire and documents his life story.There are many things with these pages which, frankly, require that you abandon logic and \\"go with the flow\\". For example, we are told that, as vampires, Louis and his mentor, Lestat, must venture nightly in search of fresh, living blood in order to sustain themselves. Louis is resistant to his vampire nature, and therefore does not kill humans for their blood often, preferring animals for sustenance. Lestat, however, kills nightly in and around New Orleans, and frequently takes more than one victim a night. That is 365 + dead bodies, every night, in 18th century New Orleans. Add the bloodthirsty Claudia (an interesting character, but I won't spoil it here), and you can easily double the body count. No explanation is given from the author regarding how the vampires get away with so much mass carnage.Very little explanation is given regarding Louis' wealth either, or how he managed to maintain it through the 200 years or so of our story. He is always depicted as being wealthy and it never seems to run out, even after traveling the world with Claudia. Also, at one point we are told that the vampire trio lived together on the same property in New Orleans for 65+ years. Again, no explanation is given for how they are able to conceal their lack of aging, which becomes quite important when speaking of Claudia in particular.Normally, such anti-logic would really bother me, and prevent me from enjoying a novel. This time, it's different. Anne Rice has immense gifts when it comes to writing prose that I found myself ignoring the nonsensical aspects of the novel in favor of relishing in the language she uses. Ms. Rice's writing has a very unique, spellbinding quality which more than made up for any lapses in logic. I even found myself comparing the writing to H.P. Lovecraft, which is high praise indeed coming from a Lovecraft fan like me. In fact, I love the writing style so much that I am willing to explain away the items listed above, and save Ms. Rice the trouble. You see, Louis the vampire is telling this story from his perspective, and the trivial details of concealing their true vampire nature were deemed irrelevant to Louis. Take that.In any case, I would recommend this book, and I plan on reading the other books in this series as well. \\"Interview\\" was a pleasant surprise for me and I hope the other novels will be too."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This is an elegant and sensitve work about our need to have something to live for, about our all-consuming task to find meaning to our quotidian existance. We are like Louis, our doomed vampire, stalkng the alley ways of our life trying to enrich and enoble it with passion. Louis cannot enjoy his existence because he is 'undead', neither a mortal being nor a spirit freed from the physical limitations of the body. He can only satisfy his blood lust. But something within him, some leftover of his humanity, demands companionship, love, an appreciation of beauty. And this need becomes his true compulsion, it becomes the thing that keeps him going rather than his blood fixes. But no matter how much he yearns for deeper meaning, he can never have it as a vampire. However, the paradox is that this yearning itself is a passion that gives his being depth, character and that nullifies in a strange way his 'undead' state. In the end, Louis is more alive than those of us who move day to day getting our 'fixes' so that we can rise to yet another meaningless day. We have an advantage over Louis, Claudia, Lestat and the other vampires -- we're alive. We need to emulate Louis' search for love, companionship, and spiritual beauty while we have the means."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"A great many people are as loyal to 'Interview With The Vampire' as a man is loyal to the memory of his first love. And, like love, to criticize this book, no matter how well thought out, no matter how well intended, will not sway. Therefore I may be wasting my time in writing this short review, but I insist that 'Interview With the Vampire,' though it evokes the mood, has nothing to say. I mean nothing. For hundreds of pages the hero murders people, is in anguish about it, and continues to murder people. He does not murder people for any reason, other than to continue his miserable existence, so that he can murder more people. And yet, Ms. Rice asks us to believe that he is not a monster, not even a villain, but simply an everyman in a non-judgmental universe. But surely we find conviction, and the strength of our conviction from within. We expect this from ourselves and from others; and no one has any sympathy for a monster who fails to live up to that standard. And yet, this book is praised to the skies, has sold in the millions, and was made into an expensive - albeit a mediocre - movie. Go figure."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Excellent book and well written! I love the lurid details and the exploration of the characters morality. Very romantic twist on an otherwise dark depth of the human psyche."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This was quite the page turner for me. I started reading it for a class on vampire lore and I couldn't stop. It's not something as timeless as Dracula and I took issue with how the story was told at times (it's told in interview style, which isn't my favorite), but the story was engaging and I'd most definitely recommend it to others."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Interview with a Vampire has been one of my favorite books since I read it as a teenager shortly after it was first published. It is, in my opinion, the perfect vampire book. Rice introduces us to a world, part of our own, but separate and to amazing characters, especially in Louis, Lestat and Claudia. I've read analyses of the book that equates vampirism to AIDS, which is an apt comparison. But just reading this book, for the story alone, is well worth your time. Rice's other Vampire and Witch books are interesting, and continue the stories of her creations, but this is the first and the best. Read it. You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Anne Rice is my favorite author. My love of her writing started when I experienced Interview with the Vampire, and has continued as I have enjoyed many of her other books. The world she has created is rich, satisfying, exciting and beautiful."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Anne's books aren't for everyone, but it absolutely deserves a great rating.Anne's Interview With The Vampire has depth, intelligence, romance as it truly is and not sugar coated nonsense, and a unique depiction of vampires. Her vampires become otherworldly but keep a somewhat grip on their humanity (as much as a blood thirsty immortal can). Her books cover the stories of very unique and interesting characters that are not stereotypical or predictable.I was 17 when I picked up this book and over the last 6 years it inspired me to go on reading the rest of the Chronicles up into the Mayfair books. Her writing style is intelligent and by no means boring.If you're looking for a sugar coated teeny bopper \\"vampire romance\\", check the kiddy section and leave this to the adults."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I've read this book (as well as many others Rice has written) several times. I love it every time. I think you'd have to be a little brain dead to not like it but that's just my opinion."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Interview with the vampire was one of the most fun books to read. It shows that however much a monster someone is, that they still feel the human need for companionship and belonging."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Preferring classical novels, I rarely read modern authors. Anne Rice, however, was a delight. I was swept into a story which spanned centuries and into the heart of a man searching for redemption. Wonderful, engaging read.

I'm older, wiser, and more developed as a reader, editor, and closet writer. I also wanted to explore some personal theories I developed after reading all the Twilight novels. I found &#34;Interview&#34; to be even more powerful and impressive then when I read it at a much younger age! Ms. Rice is an incredible writer and I hope her writing style and technique can influence my own writing."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I love this book because I love to read about horrorI would recommend this book to people 13 and older"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Interview with the Vampire is the story of Louis, a vampire whose life has spanned centuries. The story starts in New Orleans and tells of how Louis met Lestat, his maker, and then follows Louis through Europe and back to America.This book starts off quite slow in my opinion. The first time I tried to read it years ago, I didn't make it very far. It just couldn't keep my interest. This time, I vowed not to give up. It took me a long time to finish it; much longer than a book this size normally would. Once I got about halfway though, when Louis leaves New Orleans, the story got more interesting and the book started moving faster. The second half of the story was a five star read for me. Unfortunately, the first half brought the rating down. I will try the next book in the series. If it's anything like the second half of this book, I see me continuing the series. If not, I can say I gave it a fair shot."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"With this, the first book of the Vampire Chronicles, 'Interview with the Vampire' author Anne Rice set the bar high for future vampire genre writers. The world she instinctively created from her unyielding personal pain was set in her hometown of New Orleans, as seen through the soon-to-be preternaturally seeing eyes of Louis de Pointe du Lac who has suffered similarly to his creator. Throughout the book Louis fills tape after audiotape for an unsuspecting young stranger who collects 'interesting' memoirs. In telling his lengthy tale Louis introduces us to Lestat, the vampire that promises to end his pain. Instead with the dark gift of immortality Lestat brings Louis an everlasting un-life of strife and seeking. As Louis begins to stray from the grasp of loneliness Lestat has upon him, to seek knowledge of their 'kind' Lestat revives unto vampirism Louis' first guilt-ridden human kill. A young orphan girl named Claudia who becomes their forever child, incapable of physically growing to adulthood.From there, Rice offers up a dark feast of intelligent, frothy emotion spread in languid velvet waves over a rich, globe encompassing night-scape. Embroiled in this passion play of grief and hunger, Rice shines with an eager charm, her pages not bereft of the dark humour befitting an immortal's immortal."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I enjoyed this more than I expected and I love the movie. In fact, that was part of it - I felt like watching the movie and picked up the book instead. I am very glad that I did. Of course, now I want to watch the movie even more, to spot the differences.Still, it was beautifully written and surprisingly well constructed throughout, keeping the formula of the interview with all the words (almost) in dialogue. I definitely can see why Rice is so popular."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"The book is a classic yes, but the movie is just better and more enjoyable overall.The story of Louis is dark and depressing and.....brilliant.Lestat is just an evil *&^%&.Claudia isn't much better, I'm surprised Louis even survied a few days with these two depressing characters.Neither of them have any idea of right or wrong, neither has any conscience about thier killings.I guess that's why I liked Louis at first, at least he had some sence of right and wrong.All in all, a masterpiece and the best and most logical place to start if you're new to the Vampire books.Recommended!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"If you like vampire stories, this is the vampire story of the stories! I love Anne Rice's writing and would sugest all her books in a heart beat!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"The \\"Interview with the Vampire\\", is a title that literally goes with this epic life story of a vampire named Louis. Anne Rice re-writes her own version of vampire tale. Filled with love, betrayal, loneliness, and a never before felt hunger, a young plantation owner named Louis is turned into a vampire who is distraught after losing his brother and giving up on life himself. The vampire Lestat who gives him the choice to die being nearly drained of all his blood or as he states \\"drink from me and live forever\\", takes Louis under his wing, teaching him of what he knows when Louis makes the choice to drink.This whole book is about one man interviewing Louis as he has grown to be a vampire that is 200 years old. Louis tells of all that was changed when his rebirth took place and how his new broadened senses brought him to see the world as he had never seen or experienced it before. As Louis is taught by Lestat, he is to feed off of living creatures and their blood in order to have strength and survive. Louis chooses to stick with feeding off animals for a while, and is later bended by Lestat to accepting his \\"Killer\\" nature and begins to get used to feeding off humans.Louis later in the story makes the mistake of feeding of a young child and then Lestat turns her into their vampire \\"daughter\\". Her real name is never revealed but Lestat decides to name her Claudia. Louis at first does not agree with this act, but begins to love and care for her as if they were family. Claudia becomes a fast expert at her new life and is just the cute and innocent looking little girl for the job. This is a great book to take a bite out of, and I myself did not want to put it down and the ending was definitely worth the wait."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Ann Rice takes us into a world as few authors can do with her most magnificent novel. I was so taken with her characters that I could not resist finishing the entire saga. I would say that this is certainly her finest work. The story is dark and beautiful. After reading this I understand how one could know that a choice may be most evil and also completely irresistable."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Who hasn't heard of this book? Who hasnt heard of its utter perfection? I implore anyone who hasn't actually read it, to give it a try. It will not dissapoint. Louis is a sad soul. He is the speaker of this book and his sorrowfull words will stay with you until the end of the novel. His journey is one of heartache and that mood resonates throughout the entire novel. The mood is often gloomy, dark and depressing, but it is NOT, I repeat, no your typical Vampire novel. It is unlike any thing you've probably ever read about vampires. It is unique and beautifully written by the brilliant Anne Rice. She is the reason I love reading now. Her descriptive writing is brillianty realised on each page. I can read this book over and over again. I actually own a signed first edition, and I will treasure it forever."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Interview with the Vampire is the first and best of Anne Rice's vampire chronicles. In it, a two hundred year old vampire recounts his early years after the light, and through his voice, the reader rides a wave of nightmarish delights, a soul-tempting excursion into evil. There's a quality about the dream Rice weaves; we can't tell if it's a good dream or a bad one, and whether we feel anger, pity,revulsion, dread, or envy towards the undead.Rice does not conjure the absolute, linear horror of Stoker's Dracula, and she doesn't try to. She makes the reader complicit in the sin of the vampire by making it a thing of terrible beauty. Nor is it especially \\"hip\\" to be a vampire, at least not in the sense of \\"The Lost Boys\\" movie--her vampires are sophisticates, not prom kings, high society, not rock stars (at least not in this volume). \\"Interview\\" gives a whole new literal (and literary) meaning to the phrase \\"Eat the rich.\\" Or perhaps we should say ... drink?New vampire authors like myself owe Anne Rice for resurrecting a virtually dead subgenre. Vampire pop culture is everywhere today, the promise of the eternal night to tempt the darkened fantasies of guilty readers worldwide.(This review has been posted by Marcus Damanda, author of the vampire book, \\"Teeth: a Horror Fantasy\\"."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"As much as I enjoyed the movie, the book is much better. You wouldnt necessarily realize this however, until you read the book.

Well unless you feel being a murdering sneaky bastard is the epitome of heroism. Anne Rice took the view of the vampire and turned it in it's grave, taking them from the earth filled crypts of the Carpathian Mountains and dropping them into New Orleans Louisiana at the turn of the century. \\"Interview With The Vampire\\" Is told from the Point of View of Louis de Pointe du Lac, who was 24 when he was \\"Born to Darkness.\\" As he calls it. Death surrounded him, leaving him with a taste for oblivion, it is his sadness and beauty, \\"Black hair, and stunning green eyes which draws the attention of Lestat de Lioncourt, who eventually reveals himself offering something more than the banality of human life.The Allure is overwhelming, but Lestat is not the tutor for which Louis hopped, he is selfish and demanding, and prone to fits of rage. Lestat comes with the baggage of an ailing father, and the mentality of the pampered Aristocrat, taking advantage of Louis and his plantation home. Louis' melancholy and \\"respect for human life\\" often puts the pair at odds, and eventually Louis decides he is going to leave Lestat.Not one to be \\"left\\" Lestat brings a new \\"life\\" into their home, the child vampire Claudia, thus \\"binding Louis\\" to him. It is their time together in The Rue Royal which stands out. Anne Rice's descriptive flourishes of imagery as New Orleans becomes a part of the United States and springs up around the Immortal Trio are not to be missed. For the better part of a century they thrive, but Claudia matures, in mind, although she is forever the image of a six year old child. She is their \\"doll\\" Forever beautiful, cunning and above all dangerous.It is she who sets the stage for Louis' escape from Lestat, but freedom has its consequences as well. \\"Interview With The Vampire\\" is a must read for anyone who has ever wondered what eternity may be and what it truly means to be a vampire."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This book is outstanding. It should not be judged by the movie, and it should not be compared to other books or popular series. It, alone and with the rest of the Vampire Chronicles, is a work of art. It does move a little slower than the rest of the series but sets up and helps build so much of the rest of the series. It will read alone, but you can't help but read the rest of the books once you finish. Some people recommend to read \\"The Vampire Lestat\\" first...(which I might have done, I don't really remember at this point) Either way, once you've invested in the charecters, you're hooked."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"With good atmosphere, tension that grows stronger as the plot advances and very interesting and colorful characters.However, some things were left unclear, making me a little uneasy while I read the book. For instance, what exactly were the powers of the vampires? Were they able to read minds? Were they really connected with the supernatural or was there another explanation to them?I've read some of the later books in the series and there some of these questions were answered by for me, leaving the reader in the dark in this book, made me uneasy, feeling there was some vital piece missing."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I had the opportunity to read through all three of the Vampire Chronicles recently in the Kindle Format. I had seen the movies, but had not read the books before this. I was overall very pleased with the Kindle series and it proved to be entertaining and enjoyable.To her credit, Anne Rice deserves the praise she has received for her writing style. She is descriptive, she does her research and she knows, for the most part, the locations and histories she writes about. She gives just enough fact to tie the reader to the story, but injects some very imaginable fiction that puts her out in front of the pack of vampire writers.Interview with the Vampire is a masterpiece. The characters of Lestat, Louis and Claudia are classics! Tormented Louis, daring Lestat and precious but tragic Claudia are so well worked that they tear at you and they keep you turning the pages to see what happens next. The historical period of the late 1700's is realistic enough to be believable. New Orleans is the young city that shows promise and holds some of the beauty and mystery that it will become known for. The story, told by Louis, covers the making of Louis by Lestat in the last 1700's in old Louisiana and their adventures through some 60 plus years. Along the way, Lestat also makes Claudia, a 6 year old child dying from the plague. He uses Claudia to keep Louis as his companion, as he knows that Louis, who is a sentimental fool for humanity, will never leave her even if he wants to leave Lestat. Their story also takes them to Paris, Lestat's home, and they encounter traditional Vampires and Armand, their leader. To make a child so young is a sacrilege. And the story becomes a tragic opera, as all operas are destined to become. I was genuinely fascinated with this work.OK, a side note - the Kindle edition appears to have minor editing issues. I found about half a dozen spelling errors and a couple of he's that should have been she's. As this book was written in 1976, chances are it was done pre-word processor and had to be re-typed, which always ends up giving the Kindle version some issues. But overlooking this, it is clearly a classic Vampire fiction novel.I love the characters. Their stories were wonderfully told. You will love Lestat, Louis, Armand, and Claudia and will remember them for a very long time."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Anne Rice took the publishing world by storm in \\"Interview With the Vampire,\\" a haunting book that turned the evil-bloodsucker cliche on its ear. Her lush prose and vivid characters turn the dramatic plot and strange scenarios into a chilling look at good and evil, thankfully without melodrama.In modern times, a young man is interviewing a vampire on tape recorder. The vampire is Louis Pointe du Lac. In 1791, his ultra-religious brother died tragically after an argument, and Louis sank into remorse and despair. Enter Lestat de Lioncourt, a charming vampire who offers Louis a way out of his grief.The two vampires wander the cities of the world, with Lestat teaching his reluctant pupil the ways of vampirism. In time Louis makes a \\"daughter\\": Claudia, a vampire child with the mind of a woman. Now, depressed and unhappy, Louis explains how he and Claudia fled Lestat, only to encounter new tragedies that still haunt him to this day...Moral struggles are rarely present in vampire novels. Certainly not from the vampire's point of view. But that is exactly what Anne Rice attempts in this book. She wraps her dark story in lush prose and beautiful descriptions of Paris and her hometown of New Orleans, making this one of the best-written vampire stories since \\"Dracula.\\"No gore and grit here. Rice's writing is exceptionally beautiful, full of lush descriptions and intricate detail. Best of all, it has that rare quality of atmosphere -- no matter how enchanting the vampire, or beautiful the setting, a feeling of darkness and sorrow runs through it.Rice also dips into one of the best examples of literary vampirism ever: Louis becomes a vampire out of his grief, but once the grief fades, he is left with the soul of a human, and the bloodthirst of a vampire -- things that can't be reconciled. They just can't fit together. His longing to remain as human as possible, in defiance of his curse, is a tragic twist in a dark storyline.Louis is a bit of a whiner, but a deeper look reveals why. He struggles with morality and beliefs that -- unlike Lestat -- he never really let go of. Because he is a vampire, he is by his very nature a killer, yet the idea of murder is repulsive to him. Lestat is utterly charming and incredibly engaging, despite his amoral behavior. It's not hard to see why Louis would be drawn in by such an enchanting person, no matter how bad he is.One of the greatest shaping influences on elegant vampire lore has been Anne Rice's \\"Interview with the Vampire.\\" A beautiful and lush novel of darkness and beauty."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Every single vampire book, movie, and TV series created since 1976 has been directly influenced by this book. If you watch \\"True Blood\\", or if you have watched any other vampire movie/TV Series developed since 1976, then you should thank Anne Rice, because they all have been based upon her original idea: vampire stories told from the viewpoint of the vampire and based on the idea that vampires can have human feelings and emotions. Bottom line: Rice invented the modern vampire genre. Why isn't she given due credit for this???? True, her later books do not measure up. But, in \\"Interview With The Vampire\\", Rice did something equal to what William Blatty did in his novel and screenplay \\"The Exorcist\\". She revolutionized the genre."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Before posting my review, I read a few of the others, and realize that the very things I love about this book are the things the unhappy readers hate about it. Namely, the long, lush descriptions of the locations and the pages-long inner monologue of the POV character.Personally, Rice put me into the scene with her descriptive method and into the hearts and minds of her characters with their inner monologue. Many newbie authors have streamlined their own voices to emulate hers because they see the merit of it. Speaking as an author of vampire fiction, I cannot do this because Mrs. Rice in infinitely more intelligent than most people I know. But she writes on a level we can understand and in such a way that a movie forms in our minds as we walk down the lanes of 1700's New Orleans... I want to go back. I have ordered a new copy; my former copy died years ago from being read over and over.This book entertains.And that is the bottom line for me as a reader.signed Ellen C Maze, authorThe Vampire Lestat (The Vampire Chronicles, Book 2)(also I recommend this one)"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I enjoyed reading Anne Rice's INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE (20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION) book.Even though I'm a big fan of the movie adaptation--Interview with the Vampire--of the book, it still left me with new things to discover that weren't covered in the film.The story is told in first person by Louis, a man who is telling his story to a young writer about what it's like being a vampire. He also describes his struggle with the \\"dark gift\\" and how empty he feels living day-to-day, with questions that he will never find the answers to. Beneath the surface the story is about self-discovery and the questioning of faith. And the homoerotic scenes aren't sexual but more about love and yearning than anything else. The book really does challenge the notions of right and wrong, moral and immoral, and all through the eyes of a vampire who would have never questioned these things had he remained human.I readThe Vampire Lestat (Rice, Anne, Chronicles of the Vampires, 2nd Bk.)book first, which gives the back-story of Lestat the vampire who made Louis, and both books were enjoyable.INTERVIEW... the book does stray a little from the movie version, but it's still engrossing, so if you've seen the film you'll more than likely enjoy the book.This 20th Anniversary Edition is in an over-sized paperback edition with large print so it's easy to read."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This is the beginning of the Vampire Chronicles. What a wonderful series - not hokey, not based on teenage angst, not unrequited. This book is dark, it's sexy, it's exciting and sometimes violent. I hung on every word. No wonder they made a movie out of this (even if the choice of actors was a bit odd). This book made Anne Rice a genuine best selling author, and she followed this book with many more, following the lives of old and new vampires in the 'family'. Love the characters, love the personalities, love the interplay. Don't think you like the idea of vampires, or afraid of the potential for violence? OK. You're a wuss. Read 'Twilight'. Lame."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Anne Rice is the acknowledged queen of goth horror.Louis and Lestat are the quintessential eternal lovers. Their story is one of tragic heartache.If you are one of the five people in the world who hasn't yet read this poignant love story, one that rivals Romeo and Juliet, then you best get your act together.There's a reason they tapped Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise to star in the leading roles. No one else could possibly do justice to these characters. (and they only barely pulled it off)Eternal love, drama and centuries long angst to a degree never before put to paper.

I had no religious convictions at the time of reading but still felt that it was inspired by evil and it still leaves me with a sick feeling in my stomach. I will read no more of Anne Rice's novels as result and recommend against reading her work."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Interview With the Vampire is just outright HORRIBLE! This was my first shot at Anne Rice, and it was my last. A friend told me about Anne Rice, and I did finish Interview With The Vampire (which took me six months because I was so lost and disquisted with the story), it left a bad taste in my mouth just finishing it. The story goes around Louis; an aristocrat during the 19th century. He then runs into Lestat; a vampire who has live for a long time. So Lestat bite's him and turns him into a vampire because this was something he really wanted. So now as they spend time together, Louis then goes through the years as a vampire feeding and eventually converting a little girl named Claudia which they raise has their own. Eventually Louis and Lestat go their seperate as Louis tries to kill him for reasons I dont understand and I clearly dont give a s*it about. Now we are in present San Francisco, the interview is over, and the reporter leaves the building with the tapes in hand. Over.So why did I give this novel 1 star? Because Anne Rice babbles on and on about emotions, and about living the vampire life. I dont care if they had a bad day or what, vampires are supposed to be scary and hideous blood suckers, not these former humans to be soft or anything. Trust me people, there are sooooo many great novels out there than this crap. Read Salems' Lot or The Stake by Richard Laymon."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This 368 page book took me four years to finish. How in the hell it gets 4.5 stars is beyond me.I've read some pretty dull \\"when will it end\\" books in my life but this one tops them all. The concept behind this could have made for interesting, gripping reading.But no. This book was like swimming through hardened concrete. After ten pages I couldn't bring myself to read anymore. I'd look down every few pages or so and think \\"Really? Have I only read three pages since I last looked at the page number?\\"The partnership of a slow plot with a not-easy-to-read style of writing was the culprit for taking four years to read this. I managed to pick it up again a couple of weeks ago, 187 pages through it and I knew I HAD to finish the bene in my life otherwise I will NEVER be able to forget it. But I had to force every word of it. It wasn't voluntary reading that's for sure. I wanted this book DONE. I was very proud of myself the day I managed to climb that mountain. How sad: that finishing a novel that is supposed to be one of the greats after four years of forcing myself to should inspire such a reaction in me.I can say with all honestly I will NEVER read another of her books. The 4.5 stars is complete misrepresentation in my opinion. If I see a book of hers even with 5 stars, I'll know all of the people that voted 5 stars for this one undoubtedly voted 5 stars for that one, therefore: I will never ever trust another favourable Anne Rice review.How this is such a \\"must read\\" famous book is beyond me. I do not understand the cult following and the obsession with this series after reading this one, single book.I do not recommend it."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I was told to read this series by someone who thinks it's a travesty that I am an enthusiastic Twilight fan (when it comes to the books). He told me that this book was about \\"real\\" vampires. That this book didn't \\"slander the genre\\" like Twilight did with its glittering \\"vegetarian\\" vamps.I have to say, after slogging through all 300-some pages of it, I still choose Twilight.Here's some problems I had with this particular book in the series (I hear the others really pick up and are quite good)...1. The hero, Louis, is just pathetic. It's exhausting to follow his constant battles with himself. Every little thing that happens to him gets about five pages worth of angsty monologue to accompany it. Louis is constantly wrestling with the concepts of good and evil, which would be interesting, but he seems to be paralyzed by his struggle. Unlike Edward Cullen, who eventually grows enough as a character to come to the conclusion that his nature doesn't define him, Louis has no redemption. He goes from feeling too much to feeling almost nothing at all in the end. He is too weak to conquer his demons. This makes him a poor lead, and very ineffective. I felt little sympathy for him, even with what happened to Claudia.2. Rice's writing style is dreadful. The descriptions of every little object and landscape are exhaustive and bombastic. Gothic novels are always full of bold, vivid imagery, but Rice's florid descriptions only bog the scene down, and it's seen through Louis' eyes, so the descriptions are always tied in to his reeling emotions. Again, it's exhausting, and it drags on forever. I get that Meyer's doesn't have the most advanced syntax in the world, but Forks, WA still comes alive for me when I read her series, and my imagination has room to breathe. They are vivid, yet stark and lucid. Rice's settings just got mashed into the wandering plot.3. It's very hard, at least from this novel, to get a grasp of Rice's world and its rules. I think the rules in Twilight are pretty straight-forward, and the world in which they inhabit is both alive and graspable. However, Rice's world is all over the place, and the vampires are weak compared to the Twilight crew. The relationships, for me, were the most difficult to grasp. Does Louis love Lestat, or Claudia? Or perhaps Armand? What IS love when you apply it to vampires? Do they have sexual relationships? She describes the kill as the height of passion, but the vampires clearly also have physical and mental relationships as well. Louis and Claudia have some kind of physical love, and eroticism is rampant. Are they detached, or are they creatures roiling with emotion, constantly on the brink of suicide. Hopefully these things clear up as the series progresses.In the end, I do actually want to read the second one. Despite it's flaws, IWTV left me wanting to at least know Lestat's side of the story, which is what the next one is about. If you are in to vampires, I recommend that you at least try this book. Obviously, some people just love it. I was not one of them, but I have hope still for the sequels, and I think that Rice does bring up many good point and questions. Not a book for the undetermined."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Why does good seem so dull and boring in this book? Why does evil seem sympathetic?I think that all of this went beyond Miss Rice's intents. Perhaps she really thought that Louis was the good boy and Lestat the villain.Have you ever seen a villain weeping for his own kuller? Or desperately crying for his creatures' love?Louis is an unbearable, unpleasant character. Claudia is a real monster (remember the way she kills the poor vampire-musician). Armand is an hypocrite. So, who can you save...Lestat!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Ok, so first off I'm going to admit that I absolutely loved the movie \\"Interview with the Vampire\\". And not just because it had some wonderful actors in it. The story gripped me and I felt for the characters. So now I've finally read the book, and I have to say I'm a little disappointed. It wasn't nearly as enchanting as the movie and while it was still decent writing, I could take it or leave it. And this is the first book in a series, even though it could be read as a stand-alone quite easily.We are introduced to Louis very early in the book, he is after all the main character. And he is telling his story to a reporter. You see, Louis has had an eventful life. Sort of. Louis is a vampire and he tells his tale from when he was first changed to the years after with Lestat,the vampire who changed him, and with Claudia, the child vampire he inadvertently creates. When Claudia and Louis leave for Paris they are hoping to find out more about vampires in general, but find out that ignorance could be very dangerous for them.Louis is our main character. And he is very deeply described and all his motivations shown to us. Despite this though I couldn't connect with him in the book like I could the movie. In fact, he was downright whiny in the book. Lestat on the other hand we were supposed to not like but I actually rather enjoyed his character. He was shallow, manipulative, and deeply flawed, but there was something about him that grabbed your attention. Claudia too was a bit of an enigma. She is a young vampire, and her mind ages while her body doesn't and that makes her situation very unique. They really were the main characters of the novel, and there were some other much-described characters in this book, but they were only there to support Louis' story.There is a lot of description in this book. So much so that it becomes bogged down and boring some times. There's only so much you can listen to Louis complain before you start feeling melancholy yourself. And that's really not a good state of mind to have when you're supposed to be reading a book for enjoyment. But when Louis isn't moaning and groaning the book is rich with detail and the plot-line very interesting. Rice really did the vampire world a favor compared to the books of late and made them real but relatable at the same time. You could picture Louis out roaming the streets in real life, the story just seems plausible in that fantasy-like way. And some of that detail does involve violence, this probably isn't the best choice of a novel for a young child, but I wouldn't hesitate to give it to a mature teenager. They could probably handle it.An ok book, the movie will be nearer and dearer to my heart, but it did spark an interest to read the rest of the series. Now I just have to get my hands on the next book.Interview with the VampireCopyright 1976342 pagesReview by M. Reynard 2012"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I love the story. It's so detailed and beautiful! The only down side to it is that Anne Rice goes into so much detail that when you flip the page you say to yourself \\"she's still on this?\\" but overall the story is amazing! I love it and I will read the Vampire Chronicles!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This is my LEAST favorite of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles. I know many people love it, but as much as I love the other books, this one remains a chore for me to read. I gave it 3 stars because the plot is interesting and I like Anne Rice's prose. However, the main character, Louis, is just pathetic in this book. The entire book is Louis bitching and moaning and whining. Lestat did this. Lestat did that. Lestat didn't know anything. Boofreakinhoo already.My favorite of The Vampire Chronicles is the sequel, The Vampire Lestat. Lestat is an infinitely more complex, charismatic, interesting, and optimistic character than Louis, and his story is much more entertaining. Lestat left me wanting more. Louis made me want to shoot myself. Although, to be fair to Louis' character, he became much more tolerable by the end of The Vampire Lestat."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Anne Rice exhibits a sure hand on the tiller and a clarity of voice that is classic indeed. A must read for those just getting into the Vampire legend."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"There is little that hasn't already been said about Anne Rice's wonderful \\"Interview With The Vampire.\\" For this review, I think I'll provide just a brief summary of the plot and then go deeper into what I enjoyed most about this book.It is essentially the life story of a highly emotional, highly sensitive vampire named Louis. He is interviewed by \\"the boy\\" in San Francisco. He explains how he came to be a vampire, his many years in New Orleans, Europe and eventually back to New Orleans, and key relationships along the way. The bulk of the tale takes place with Louis being in the company of the wicked-yet-likeable Lestat and the lovely demon-child, Claudia.Louis also explains to the interviewer how his internal struggles with right and wrong, good and evil and exactly what his existence meant tore at him at all times. This, to me, is what makes \\"Interview With The Vampire\\" stand out from the pack of seemingly endless vampire stories.As far as I know, no one really took the time to let the reader know about the vampire as a person. Rice dives deep into the life of Louis and reveals to the reader an immortal with huge emotional problems. He hungers for blood but struggles with the killing of humans. He doesn't particularly care for Lestat but fears being alone in his new, immortal world.When Claudia enters the picture, we see yet another pitiful being granted immortality only to hate the one who gave it to her. We get a peek at Santiago who, in my opinion, is one of the most vile creatures to ever grace the page. One other vampire who captured me in this tale is Armand, who is much more mysterious to me than Lestat and I look forward to reading his story later on in \\"The Vampire Armand.\\"I also enjoyed the wonderful descriptions of New Orleans and Europe througout time. Having a brother that has lived in the Big Easy for almost twenty years and having visited many times, it's fun to think that Louis, Lestat or even little Claudia might have crossed my path at some time.This is the second time that I've read \\"Interview With The Vampire.\\" I've also read \\"The Vampire Lestat.\\" Of the two, \\"Interview\\" is a much more engaging tale. I know that I'm in the minority when I say this since Lestat steals almost every page of the book that he appears on, but I really enjoyed the originality and uniqueness that made \\"Interview\\" such a standout when it was first printed and as it remains today.There is a bit of eroticism to this tale that parents might not want their children and teens to read about just yet. There's also quite a bit of violence. This is definitely a novel for adults and older teens to tackle. It's a great story and one of the few vampire tales that actually deserves to sit on the bookshelf with Bram Stoker's classic.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Still the very best Vampire story written.

Loui, who didnt care whether he died or not, when suddenly turned into a vampire, realizes the value of human life. this tension leads to an excellent story. He gives into his vampire needs and that is when Claudia comes in. This is an excellent book filled with all kinds of emotional tension.\\\\Check out the movie too, it's excellent...although I hated it until I read the book"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"When I first read Interview with a Vampire I was instantly hook. I love the characters you meet. Lestat with his twisted mind, Louis with his eagerness to find more people like him (makes you like his character the most), Danny the young reporter, Claudia who is so young and innocent she makes the perfect vampire, and Armond who is dark and mysterious.I like how Anne Rice had the vampires going to Europe to find more people like themselves and throws some twists in. This book is very detailed and the movie leaves some of the best parts out (so don't compare them) . It's amazing to see the bond between Louis and Claudia, which in a way makes Lestat jealous.I would recommend this book and the whole vampire chronicles to anyone who likes vampires. This book is written so it is easy to read plus it is filled with some surprises along the way."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"The movie is probably better than the book in this case, because Rice's writing style is very flat - almost like reading a screenplay. Her storytelling ability is good but she doesn't really have a writing style to go along with it.

Anne Rice does a good job of invoking the mood, making you feel like you're one with the characters.

It wasn't worth my two bucks.Interview with the Vampire was painfully slow with too many unnecessary details. I found Claudia to be interesting, but there is so little about her in the book that she wasn't enough to save the story for me. Louis (the main character) was whiney and would go on and on (and on!) for pages at a clip about how there was no reason to exist, how he loved Armand, how he missed Claudia. There was little to no plot in the entire story.And it's not just this story. While The Vampire Lestat is a huge improvement over Interview with the Vampire, it still is far too drawn out and slow.So why the two-star rating?? Because I actually liked Queen of the Damned (Well, most of it. It, too, tends to have too many details and too much talking/not enough action) and to really enjoy that story you have to read Interview and the Vampire Lestat.Honestly, though, it's not worth it. If you want real vampire horror literature read Bram Stoker's Dracula. And my clearence set of three Anne Rice novels? I resold it."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I had high expectations of this book, as it is touted by many to be a 'classic'. Certainly not your everyday, garden-variety read, but I was disappointed with the experience. The bottom line is that the book isn't very scary, and that's what I was looking for. Rice simply didn't do a good job of creating tension in the plot, which for the most part, just plodded on and on and on....Unlike other reviewers, I did come to like Louis at the end as he seemed to have grown past the incessant desire to whine about virtually everything. I'm not sure why Claudia was inserted into the book but her character really didn't add much depth. Not as much as it could have, for sure.In short, this is an interesting book but not a classic in my opinion."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"After reading this book you will be hooked on Rice's vampire books.A real page turner. Her descriptions are excellent. You will really enjoy it. It's not like those horror books that are like car accidents where you don't want to know what is going to happen next but can't put the book down. This is very tastefully done. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This book is such a classic and never gets old. It seems such a shame that she is moving on from the vampire series we all devoured as soon as they hit the shelves. But luckily for us all, there are new authors ready to take the reins and keep us enthralled, aroused and sweetly sickened simeltaneously. I want to share a new find. \\"Thirst\\" by newcomer Deschamps has an enthralling mixture of evil, sexuality, and witch like power in the setting of a devil/madman's bloodlusting killing spree. My only warning is not to start this book until you have time to read it uninterrupted, as it draws you in from page one."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I'd never read an Anne Rice novel and this was amazing. Sucked me in right from the start. Her literary talent is something to study as well as enjoy. She knows New Orleans so well, I could feel the moist air, smell the smells. I felt like I was there.And the world of the vampires she created was so detailed, I kept marveling that anyone could have all of that in their brain much less put it on paper so beautifully. Thanks for sharing it with us, is all I can say about talented authors like Ann."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"&quot;Dracula&quot; - the classic that has always reigned as king of the vamp genre, gets left in the dust with this stylish, haunting tale from one of the undead as told to a young reporter. This fictional work will leave you chilled, wondering if, just maybe, perhaps it was real. Rice is indeed the Queen of Horror."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"The cassette-recorded version of Anne Rice's novel is read wonderfully by F. Murray Abraham. He won the Oscar for &quot;Amadeus&quot; and has appeared in many films. His voice has excellent resonance and is greatly expressive. He tells this tale compellingly. As Louis the Vampire tells his story to the young journalist, we are drawn into the psyche of his once human existence, his Catholic roots in Louisiana, and his difficulty in leaving his humanity behind. Rice universalizes the vampire horror yarn as an intense psychological profile, giving it a depth of reality. As we learn about Louis' relationship with Lestat, we are fascinated and repelled. As Claudia becomes part of their vampire family, Abraham does a great job of conveying the ice running in the child's veins compared to the sensitivity and caring in Louis. The tale really becomes riveting as it moves to Paris and the Theatre Vampire comes in contact with Louis &amp; Claudia. Sucking blood never sounded like a particularly erotic activity to me; but as Abraham milks Rice's dialogue, it becomes intensely erotic. Claudia's demise and Louis' teaming with Armand makes the climax rush to a fever pitch. I enjoy listening to tape versions of books during driving times. Abraham's version of this Anne Rice tale is excellent. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"A great story and a new style of vampire. A little slow but picks up in the end. Ingenius to start the chronicles with Louis and then switch to Lestat. It introduces our hero, Lestat, from someone else's point of view then we learn what he is really like later on."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I use reading as my escape. I don't have the resources at this point in my life to do all the incredible things I plan to do. This book introduced me to a world where I can do it all. Now I have been to New Orleans, I have been to Paris, I have seen history unfold. I believe that even though I have true friends and a family who loves me that the only person I can truly depend on is myself. In a way Louis feels the same way. This book took me away, to a place where I do not have to do anything but enjoy, and feel, and see, and touch, and hear. I remember I finished this book New Year's Eve 1995. I think it's time to take another holiday and reread what I think is one of the finest novels ever written. Thank you Anne for not being afraid to take the reader places that few have the courage or talent to accomplish."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I don't read every day. I don't read everything. Though, when I read something, I demand to read something new, original, from a brand new point of view. I didn't like Bram Stoker's Dracula because is from a human point of view. I know what a man feels when is scared by the unknown. I don't know what &quot;the unknown&quot; can feel before killing a man. Anne Rice created this feelings with vivid intensity and realism. &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; -to me- is some kind of a prototype, a new branch of description from the predator's point of view. Through the eyes of the &quot;monster&quot;. I loved this book and the rest to come. Thank you Anne ! GO ON, SHOCK ME ! PLEASE"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I don't believe I have ever read a better book. You will be pulled into the world of Louis and his life after being born into Darkness. Lestat, as always, is Anne Rice's unlikely hero and is brought to life like no other character within the pages. Louis is a dark-angel, everyone he meets falling in love with him. It is not only a peek into the world of a vampire, but a glimpse at human nature. I could not recommend a book more hightly. I simply suggest that you continue to read the &quot;Vampire Chronicles,&quot; they will tear down the walls of reality."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"It is simply the best book I've read in a long time. It is brilliant, and makes the other books I've loved pale in comparison. Anne Rice has a great imagination and a great talent for writing. I love the philosophy she adds to give dept to what being a vampire must mean. All the characters come alive, the atmoshpere of Paris, New Orleans, the emotions - they are all very real. I can go on forever about what I like about this novel... Truly a great read!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"A truly engaging and sympathetic psychological vampire story. I don't think I'll read any of the other post-success books that she pops out as quickly as Stephen King, makes me wary, but I definitely recommend this one for a good time and yes, even (gasp!) some thought."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I never had the desire to read vampire books, but at the urging of a good friend, I ended up spending a evening at home with Louis, Lestat and Claudia. What a beautiful, yet tragic tale of the undead wishing they were dead. The regret Louis delt with night in and night out could very well be felt by humans everyday. We all regret something sooner or later, but fortunately, we dont have to live with it for eternity. And Lestat was what a vampire should be, strong and without regret. But little Claudia....kind of disturbing to think of a little girl drinking blood. But thats the purpose of books like this. I must say though, it was a good evening at home with those three vampires and I do recommend this book."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This book unlike other vampire books, makes sence. Just think about living forever, wouldn't it simply get boring? Wouldn't you get sick of the killing? This book doesn't tell any great, incredible, story, it's just a realistic story of a vampire and his life, his experiences, his feelings. It's nothing special. But after reading it you understand why the author made it. To tell everyone, that maybe being a vampire isn't so wonderfull and fun after all. Neither is living forever. But you have to wonder, that maybe, if there were vampires today, wouldn't it be easier to live as a vampire today."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This book is truly wonderful. The characterisation is spot on, and the dialogue entirely convincing. And in response to the reviewer who called Steven King &quot;serious&quot;, he is an ammateur compared to the author of this book. Not just horror- genius literature"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"The novel was just okay. Nothing spectacular about it but then again nothing horrible about the novel either. It was very original and I gave her extra points for that, overall, give it a try, you might be dissapointed but I believe you will enter a new world of vampires, one that is fun to visit. So give it a try!!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I had to read the book a second time to figure out why I loved it, and the answer was not so simple. First, we have to admit that there's not much of a plot, but it's a page turner. It's not clear what the main character wants, but we are drawn to him. He commits many reprehensible acts, yet we root for him. The book works because Rice is a seductress with a pen. We must read on because she has made our worst nightmares, the undead, sympathetic. She humanized them. They are not monsters. They're just regular guys (not really) who are trying to tell their stories."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"The idea of being a vampire is a seductive one i.e. being young and living forever. What Anne Rice's classic novel does though is go beyond the superficial idea and shows the reality of what it would really be like to be a vampire. It tells the story of Louis who after his brother's death is turned in to a vampire. He soon grows to hate the vampire Lestat who made him what he is. In the story he moves from New Orleans to the old world in his search for others like him. He searches along with the girl vampire which he has created. His search takes him to Paris Rice in the story creates some of the most memorable characters in vampire fiction in the tortured Louis and the girl vampire Claudia. The most disturbing part of her is her age: she is six. In the movie it is doubled to twelve, but she is better in the book than the film (despite Kristen Dunst's excellent portrayal of her in the film). Rice manages to show with her writting that although her body may remain a child's her eyes show her real age. There are undertones of homeo eroticism in the relations of Lestat, Louis and Armand, but the central theme running through the book seems to sadness. The feeling saturates the whole book. Anne Rice should be commended for making a true classic of the genre and making her vampires much more than mere killing machines. She makes her vampires all too human and that is her masterstroke"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This book is a beautifully written tale of the vampire named Louis. It talks about how he became a vampire and how he dealt with the issues of killing, serviving, love and loss, and looking for other vampires so that he can learn about what he has become. He has other conflicts because of his resentment of Lestat, the vampire that made him. There are other interesting vampire characters as well. It is a great story with some romantic settings in places like New Orleans and Paris."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I did not think this book would appeal to me, But then on a cold dreary march day I picked it up and could not put it down!!! What a great book!!! Beautifully written and that is what grabs you and does not let you go."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I just finished reading this phenomenal book for the third time, and it still haunts me like the first time. The story has a way of staying with you, of making you think, of altering your world view. It is right at the top of my all time favorite books, and was the beginning of my love affair with dark novels. Intelligent, gothic, lush, and involving. In a word, Unforgettable."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"i thought this book was great! Reading R.L. Stine's books, i wasnt scared at all but only felt sad because Louis, in a way, can't really die as he wishes to do so because of his brother's death and him blaming on himself for not listening to his younger brother Paul. It just shows you that sometimes when you wish for something, like maybe clothes, someone may give you something opposite of clothes. Just like Louis wished for death but instead he got immortality. I did not really like Lestat because he seemed a little vain."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"i thought this book was great! Reading R.L.

Rice is able to balance intrigueing characters with rich description and history all the while maintaining suspense and interest which I find few authors can do well. Some may find the beginning slow and be tempted to give up. Don't. By the end of the vampire series you will know the characters as well as you know yourself and will not be disapointed."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I really liked the movie so this was pretty much everything i expected. If you are familar with the movie, I would suggest reading through this quickly to get to the second book called The Vampire Lestat because this book is just an introduction to the world of Rice's vampires.Positives: Story moves quickly, All main characters are developed to near perfection, interesting to read about bad guys from the bad guys perspective.Negatives: Very gory, lots of one or two page long paragraphs describing scenery,had a rather contrived ending that was never mentioned again in the next book."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Very interesting and action packed. Ms. Rice did an excellent job of description, not a thing is left to question. A very riveting book that I would definitely read again, and recommend to any vampire lovers out there."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I do not generally read vampire novels. In fact, this is only the third I have read. The first surprise was that I liked it at all. The second surprise was that I liked it as much as I did. And the third surprise was that I liked it more and more as it progressed. After a while it was hard to put down. I have not read any of the current crop of front-shelf vampire fiction, but I have a feeling their vampires are quite different from these. (I'll never know for sure, since they have a target audience that does not include me.) Rice's book takes the form suggested by its title. It is the story of the vampire Louis de Pointe du Lac, as he relates it to a young reporter of some kind (referred to only as \\"the boy\\"). Neither the boy's nor the vampire's reasons for the interview are clear, though it doesn't really matter. The main thing is that the vampire's story gets told. To summarize the plot would not really capture what the story is about, or at best it would capture it only on one level. At that level, it is about how Louis became a vampire, about his relationship with the vampires Lestat (who made him a vampire), Claudia, and Armand, about his search for others of his kind, and about the consequences of that search. But that's only a story line to allow Rice, primarily through Louis, to explore vampire nature, the meaning of art and passion (and the degree to which they are tied to mortality), the meaning of immortality in a mortal world, and the question of whether or not such a state can be survived without madness, despair, or both. Louis is a deeply conflicted character, heeding his vampire urgings in order to survive, but retaining enough of his former humanity--or perhaps it is more accurate to say that he continually longs for certain aspects, principally emotional and aesthetic, of his former state--to sink into despair and loneliness even when he is not alone. Rice skillfully juxtaposes the seeming attractiveness of the state of immortality against the realities of what that really means for a creature who cannot truly move on, and must live eternally in a world in which the patterns are set by beings the vampire is inclined to think inferior and transitory (not to mention sustenance). Even the art that Louis loves so much is a human creation. Rice is a very good writer, at times achieving great power in her descriptions of characters and events. I found the description of Louis in the cathedral to be especially powerful. In the end, three themes emerge most strongly. First, the longing for love and companionship, which seems to transcend the human condition. Second, the inability even of art, literature, and other examples of human creativity to connect you with humanity when you are yourself, in a way, a work of artifice and, as Louis ponders, equally reducible to ashes. And third, the pain of loss. In a way, the book is mostly about loss, and about how much more painful loss can be when it is felt by an immortal creature. Louis is ultimately unable to reconcile his incomplete embrace of his vampire nature with his equally incomplete relinquishing of his human nature. \\"You cannot have love and goodness,\\" he tells Armand, \\"when you do what you know to be evil, what you know to be wrong. You can only have the desperate confusion and longing and the chasing of phantom goodness in its human form.\\" OK, so it's not great literature, but it is a very interesting, well-written book, with much more depth than I expected. If it's the last vampire novel I ever read (a real possibility), I won't feel I've done too badly."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"i really enjoyed this book. Its a classic, you dont want to miss the chance to read this book. The characters were so real and lively for a group of undead vampires. It tells the story of the vampire Louis and the real hardship that he faces. Lifes not easy being a vampire,you feel sad for him but the adventure you feel as seeing him on his adventure with Claudia, a vmpire stuck in the body of a little girl ,and the evil vampire Lestat is incredable. Many other treats and exitment await for Louis and Claudia on the quest to meet others like them but wisdom is only gained though hardships. So enjoy and dont miss the chance to read this classic novel."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"A friend recommended this book to me and I quickly ran to the book store to pick it up. Happily I was not dissappointed.The basic plot is a vampire name Louis is telling his story to a young journalist. He tells of how he wished to die as a mortal, but instead is turned into a vampire by a vampire named Lestat. Louis tells of his psychological struggles with what he is and his search for exactly what the vampires' origins are. Lestat is not very helpful in this area, leading Louis to believe that Lestat knows nothing; soon Louis goes to leave Lestat forever. However, Lestat changes a young girl named Claudia into a vampire, knowing Louis would never leave her, and thus would never leave him. The story continues with much more action and excitement, often making the story hard to put down.Anne Rice is amazingly good at detail and describing how the mind thinks and acts. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a stirring new vampire novel."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I dunno what 'big' people think of this book but for me its my favourite it actually makes yoy think what it would be like to live for ever, I had seen this book many times on top of my dad's desk but never felt interest in picking it up to read but then a friend from school was reading it to write a book report and talked so much about it i had to read it and OMFG it is GREAT the best book I have ever read no book, even Harry Potter is at its heightSince this anne rice is my favourite author something I would also recomend is Isabel Allende and her book 'City of the beasts' that is also a very good novel even if it translated from spanish and it is not in its original languageREAD THIS BOOK"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This is the book that began Anne Rice's world famous Vampire chronicles. It is an autobiography of a young Frenchman, Louis, who is changed into a Vampire during a very troubled time in his life by his mentor Lestat (who's own story is in Anne Rice's sequel &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot;) and has to live 200 years of a life he loathes.Louis is different from all the other Vampires in that he is quite human. He refuses to kill humans (though the urge to do so overpowers him a few times) and decided to feed on the blood of animals. He has sympathies and loyalties to his original race though they fear him, loathe him, condemn him and do not understand him.Some of the most interesting parts of the novel are his moral battles with his vampire self and with his mentor Lestat. The two of them give this &quot;gift&quot; of immortality to a young child Claudia who spends the rest of her existence under the guardianship of Louis. She is torn by the moral influences of Louis and the immoral one of Lestat.Eventually, together Louis and Claudia break free from Louis's web by attempting to take his life. They then voyage through Europe together in search of the rest of their kind and eventually succeed in doing so.The descriptions of the vampire's routine: wake up, roam the streets in search of a victim, ravish them and please yourself, go out in search of more and then rush back to your resting place before the Sun rises and burns you to a crisp! These are all beautiful yet ugly and loathsome. The deeds are ugly and loathsome yet the way Anne Rice describes them makes one sit up immediately and want to re-read them. I usually found myself re-reading passages big and small for the sheer beauty of Miss Rice's descriptions.This book does not have one single scene of erotic nature yet it is quite possibly one of the most erotic books I have ever read. Miss Rice knew of the sexual attraction of vampires and has exploited it to its fullest potential. How startingly well Miss Rice writes!! So much so that I classify this book as a piece of Literature.Eerie and unsettling are just a few words I can use to describe this book. Sensual, beautiful, original, scary, atmospheric, brilliant are understatements but are the only words that can begin to describe this novel.It is possibly the most gothic book I have ever read. How Anne Rice can manage to create such an atmosphere while living in a age for removed from that described is a riddle I have yet to solve. Well done Miss Rice, keep them coming!!The character of Louis is splendid, the use of language: eloquent, the ability to convey emotions: vivid. All these combine to give one of the best books ever written!! Highly recommended! This novel is what I would call the height of brilliance!! Thank you Anne!!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I never thought I would actually enjoy a novel which was based on supernatural and certainly evil creatures such as vampires, but this book was incredible! I have never before read anything so descriptive and so full of passion in my life. I found myself taking breaks from reading this book, just to absorb and reflect on what was taking place amongst the characters in this book. They were so dimensional and relationships were so complex that I felt totally wrapped up in their lives as if I've met these people. The movie was good, but I recommend the book even after viewing the movie. Anne Rice is most definitely a talented storyteller."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"The very fact that Anne Rice could make a very unlovable character, such as a vampire, quite lovable, is an astonishing feat in itself. In beautiful, straightforward prose, Rice explores the inner life of a vampire and manages to make him sympathetic. Louis, Lestat and Claudia are fascinating characters we come to know and identify with. On a larger scale, this talented author very deftly explores deep philosophical questions concerning the mystery and meaning of life and death and immortality through the eyes of those who have actually experienced it. Philosophical treatise or fascinating story--this book truly has it all. Rich in metaphor and imagery, I think it is the very best of Rice's Vampire Chronicles, the most atmospheric and, by far, the most cleanly plotted."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"\\"Interview with the vampire\\" was my first Anne Rice's book and I've been enchanted with her dark universes and eloquent poetic-prose ever since.In fact, when I first started reading this book I couldn't put it down and I carried it with me everywhere I went. I wanted to finish it quickly and discover its end but at the same time I wanted to savor every word and when I did finish reading it, I turned it back and read it again.I believe that Anne Rice has created this universe of vampires with all their extra-senses and exaggerated feelings to depict humanity so charmingly and realistically. Her vampires are just close-up pictures of us, humans. In her book, she proves her magical ability to make you, so easily, fall in love with her creations and I've fallen so hopelessly in love with Louis with the very first few lines he spoke. He is the most human in her books. He is even at times more human than humans themselves. I've loved his sensitivity, his guilt, his melancholy, his hatred to himself, his torture by the hatred and the love he feels towards Lestat, his absolute love for Claudia despite all that she is, his confusion, his questions and I've loved him most of all for all what he is. But Louis is not the only reason for me to love this book.I love it for all its depth, all the questions it seems to raise and the silent quest for the truth behind all its confusion and dark world.\\"Interview with the vampire\\" is a book of the heart. It is a book not to be simply read but reread again then again and again and savored with every reading."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I read this book for the first time last year after watching the movie. I must say, as the first Anne Rice I had ever read, I was utterly impressed. Her style of writing is so intricate and beautiful that I often lose myself in her books. Her characters in this one touched me in a way that I hadn't expected. Louis with his misery and utter meloncholia, the tragic Claudia, doomed forever to live as a child, the arrogant and seductively evil Lestat, and the chillingly enigmatic and beautiful Armand. I really fell in love with all of them. The descriptive quality of language that Anne uses is nothing short of astounding and it kept me hooked to the bitter end. Since then, I have read all of the Vampire novels including Pandora (I am eagerly anticipating the release of Armand), All of the Mayfair Witches, Violin, and The Mummy and she still never ceases to amaze me. Kudos to you Anne Rice. You've given me a new respect for this &quot;savage garden&quot; in which we live."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"The first book of the Vampire Chronicals was the finest of the series. Anne Rice's words are spellbinding, and almost force you to feel Louis's pain, horror, and despair at killing, which he must do to live, as well as the ecstacy of the killing, the taking of blood. His love for Claudia is a palpable thing, you can almost touch it, as well as his hatred of Lestat. The writing is lyrical, almost musical. Some find the homoerotic imagery disturbing (Although as Rice's vampires have no sex, I really don't know why). I am of the opinion that Louis is her finest character, far subtler and richer than the over-the-top Lestat. I read this book in one ten-hour sitting, I became so engrossed so quickly. Anne Rice has written many wonderful (and a few laughable) books, but this is her jewel"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I don't care what anyone thinks, this was a groundbreaking novel that blew the lid off what people imagined horror, and especially vampires, to be. Deeply charged with introspection, a thing virtually unheard of in the horror of the day, this was a game changer. It's not Anne Rice's fault that people like the maker's of Twilight went on to sully the genre. I read this back in the early nights, staying up way to late when I had to be at my boring 9-5 job, losing myself in the fascination of characters that for once were supernatural flights of fancy, but felt incredibly real"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This was the first Anne Rice book I read, and the first vampire book I remember reading. I remember being completely absorbed in the story. Rice is remarkable at creating atmosphere, and this book, along with her Mayfair Witch books, are some of the best I've read for that. The characters are well developed, likeable, and three dimensional, making this a very rich read."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I went through a bad phase of only writing negative reviews back in 2009 and at the time things were so black I forgot to post about the things I actually love. I don't know how I missed out on this.Interview with the vampire, for me, was a gateway drug. I read it for the first time in 1995 when I was fourteen-years-old. It opened the door for me into a world of alternate perspectives and histories of characters and places I had never known. It fanned a flame within me which was a love of Gothic horror, particularly, in regard to my tastes in vampire fiction.This is one of my favorite vampire novels. Louis is a very descriptive storyteller and his style of talking is so distinctly different from that of Lestat (who narrates most of the books after this) that you would swear they were real. There is a strange sort of love between all the characters despite the resentments. And you can just feel that it is the only the beginning of a long and intricate journey. This is a book series I will always cherish.Side note: Pay close attention to Lestat. If you do you will notice hints to his own perspective on things that become important later."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This is a very good book. It hasto be Anne Rices Best piece of work yet. This is a very erotic book and starts with a very good begining till a tear jerking end. A must have for any vampire fan."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Admittedly I am not a fan of the vampire genre. I especially don't like what has become of it thanks to things like Twilight. It makes me shudder. This however is a classic telling of the vampire and the life that seems to fascinate so many people. Louis's story is absolutely heartbreaking and one feels for him deeply. I would say more but this is one of those books that you have to experience for yourself. Immortality can be a very lonely and depressing concept. Take the journey with Louis to find out what I'm talking about."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I grew up with Anne Rice's works at a young age, because of my cousin. We would watch the movie adaptation of this incredible book, and I would find myself liking it more and more as I watched it.I remember renting this book from my local public library when I was in high school, and I read it day and night. I took it to school, and even skipped a day of school just to read the last bit of it.I purchased this book again, just this year, right before a convention called C2E2 came along. I wanted to purchase the book for a long time, but when I finally read on C2E2's website that Anne Rice was going to be a guest at the convention... You could not imagine my joy. She seemed very happy to see all of her fans and even hosted a panel with another gentleman. I honestly could not stay for long, because I was too excited that I found myself running down stairs. This was of course to start standing in line to make the autograph session. To no surprise, I found myself at the end of quite a long line. I did not care. I could not wait to meet the author. When I finally did, I was completely starstruck. We had only exchanged a few words like \\"Hi. How are you?\\" \\"Good, and you?\\" and I found myself on my way to hang out with some of my friends again.As I've said, I basically grew up with this series of books... More importantly, I grew up with 'Interview with the Vampire' and 'The Vampire Lestat (Vampire Chronicles)'.I love Anne Rice's writing style. Every time I read the books in this series, I cannot put them down without picking them back up, not even for a moment. I like that the writer does this. She really grabs the attention of her readers, especially ones that have been vampire fans for what seems to have been centuries.I've read every vampire novel worth reading, and this series IS the best of them all. Do read them. You will not be able to put them down for a moment!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I'm more into Science Fiction and Fantasy than the Supernatural. This book really surprised me. I've seen the movie and liked it so I figured I would give the book a shot. They're very similar except for Paris. The book and the movie have some major differences that setup future novels. The changes were sound and made for a more entertaining movie but added so much more to the book. I'm on the second one now and it's just as entertaining and vivid. I highly recommend this book if you're interested and if you're reading this review then you must be. Drop a couple of bucks and enjoy yourself."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I read this book when it was first published, and I've re-read it frequently over the years. I still marvel at Rice's writing talent, her sublime skill at creating characters that you can see so vividly from the page. It takes considerable talent to provide the detail that she does and still excel at moving a story at such a brisk pace. Interview remains one of my favorite modern novels and my favorite novel about vampires. Yes, it surpasses Bram Stoker's Dracula and Stephenie Meyer's Twilight, both which I liked very much.This is a novel that just absorbs you, separates you from real space and real time and inserts you as a witness of an enthralling story. Every time I read it, I still mourn Armand and hope things are resolved differently.The movie, by comparison, was simply atrocious. I can't believe that anyone who read this book could envision Tom Cruise as Lestat and Brad Pitt as Louis. I think David Fincher would be a good candidate to direct a better film version of this novel."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I read this way back sometime nearly twenty years after it came out. I'm literary so I didn't figure to like a vampire story but my then partner read it and recommended it big time. Well, she was right. This is the book that brought the vampire world into the post WW2 twentieth century. A sprawling Gothic saga, it is portentous, overheated, downright annoying, long-winded and all-absorbing.If you don't like historical classics, don't even bother. You'll likely find it slow and turgid. If you regularly take to more than comic books, be they print novels or cartoons, you'll be fine and you'll relish the careful building of a complex world of emotional inter-relations not unlike some of the great nineteenth century writers - except with vampires.Rice broke the mould with this one and I had to go on."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I hated reading during my younger years, but Anne Rice's Interview with a Vampire hooked me from the beginning and opened my eyes to the wonderful world of books. Rice paints her characters so vividly that you love them despite their many faults. The novel follows Louis, the passive idealist, and Claudia, the feisty child, as the opportunistic Lestat rears them from vampire infancy to adulthood from the eighteenth century to the present time, although not all the characters make it that far. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys paranormal novels that have a historically accurate feel. As an author, I feel that all novelists should study Rice's books in order to enhance their abilities in character development for she is master at this.Written by Andrea Cefalo, Author of The Fairytale Keeper:Avenging the Queen"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Wonderfully written, blending our love for vampires with a spiritual side that is to be highly commended, Anne has written a timeless peice. This is far from your dime store vampire story, but a beauiful masterpiece. A fan forever :)"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I read this book when it first came out in paperback and have since read most of the others. The reason for my recent purchase of the book was for a friend who enjoyed reading it and has since purchased Book 2. All the Vampire Chronicle books I have read I have enjoyed and would recommend them to anyone interested in reading these types of books."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Interview with a Vampire was one of the best books I have read so far in my history of reading books... Ann Rice was wonderful at discribing the scenes in the book. I loved the charcaters and well thought out the were, how she foreshadowed many things and kept me guessing surprising me in many ways. Her view on vampires and mortals are great, exactly how I think them to be. She kept me interested all the way threw... I was excited to know what would happen to Lestat (my favorite character) I loved how sinical and froceful he was. I also loved the fact that you saw many sides and feelings of him. I can not wait to read the next books in the Vampire Chronicals."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"awsome book! anne rice has created a whole other world of vampires that's so believable and real. she has defyed old myths about vampries, which, by defying them in her story, give them almost human like qualites. in INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE, you can feel for Louis, the vampire telling his story to a reporter about immortality and the life of a vampire. its a very powerful book full of saddness, sorrow, and yet happiness and joy at times. a very powerful and moving book, INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE is well worth the read!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I think this book is amazing.While vampires have been written about before, I don't think anyone ever did it quite as well as Anne rice did in her very first novel &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot;. She planned out all of their powers and limitations and put her star character, Louis, in loads of interesting situations.This book is very romanticized, and the style of writing makes you feel like you are actually living in the time period that Louis talks about.This type of book is great for people who fall in love with characters. However, if you don't care for long winded books, Anne Rice really isn't the writer for you.But I think she's brilliant."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This was the first vampire book I've ever read, and it wasn't really what I expected at all. It was better. The story, presented as an interview (naturally) traces the life and after-life of the vampire Louis from suicidal young man to cold, calm, veteran killer. Rice dispels many cliches with the *shocking* revelation that vampires are not repeled by crucifixes or garlic, and can see their reflections in mirrors. Louis himself is a most sensitive vampire who learns to both appreciate and fear the heightened senses of his kind. He also has a difficult time adjusting to killing, and hates his own innate cruelty as much as he craves blood. Louis has many thoughtful reflections on the concepts of death and evil that even mortals may find revealing (and which never sacrifice the pace of the unraveling drama). His introspective personality clashes with his irrepressible and often reckless master/creator, the vampire Lestat. Lestat uses the addition of the child vampire Claudia to their &quot;family&quot; as a means of keeping Louis subordinate. Through her immortal vampires, Rice actually addresses the theme of human nature: sensual, paradoxical, and often cruel."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Someone may think that's a horror type story, but to be honest it's something different. It's a new style, probably deeper that horrors, which are suppose to cause fear. This book has the special climate, and after reading it, you'll probably: a) want more, b) won't touch another book in weeks, because you don't want to lose the atmosphere, c) you'll read the book 100 times... (don't ask where i know that from...) It causes many kinds of feelings, unlike other book i've recently read. I will never forget it... (and i'll probably read it for the 101st time ;) )"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Though admitidly over twenty years old, 'Interview with the Vampire' is without a doubt one of the most well written (and famous) vampire novels ever to to be published.Now considered an essential in terms of vampire drama reading, Rice's novel is the autobiographical story of Louis Pointe du Lac, and 18th century plantation owner who's sudden and tragic loss of his younger brother sends the young man spiraling into an almost suicidal depression. It is here that Lestat, the foppish, charistmatic and deliciously wicked hero of the Vampire Chronicles makes his appearance as a kind of undead savoir for the man. Making Louis a vampire, Louis immediately rejects his new life but attempts to make the best of it. The rest of the story follows Louis's exploits as he travels with Lestat around the world, becomes the inadvertant guardian and eventual paritial lover of Claudia, the youngest ever made vampire. It spirals to their dramatic escape from Lestat and Louis's eventual loss and short reunion with his maker, in one achingly poetic and strikingly human portrayl of vampires and their life.Though a bit hard to swallow at times, Rices overwhelmingly descriptive first-person narrative is easily ignored as the story in the backdrop does an excellent job of distracting the read from the sometimes heavy prose. Though now criticed as heavy and annoyingly meloncholy, here we see Rice's now familar formula telling of one's life story as it was meant to be seen. A wondeful, in-depth preview into the private thoughts and reactions of a character telling of the events of their life. Every scene Rice tells is painted a vivid and beautiful picture as she gives new life to the often shadowy and frightening world of the night.Some of the less patient readers may be turned off by her, at-times overly long descriptions and sluggish pace. But those readers who treasure details and vivid pictures will undoubtedly fall for this now classic vampire story. Even those readers who simply value a good plot and well created characters should enjoy this novel and find the trudge through heavy and poetic prose well worth the trip.A must read for all Vampire fans.Koyla Dae"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"An exciting opener to an indomitable series of vampire stories, Interview with the Vampire establishes a human connection between the reader and the characters of the series. Louis, a suffering human spirit trapped in an immortal body striving to reconcile his new identity as a bloodsucker and a murderer with his human morals and principles. Lestat, the antithesis of Louis in some respects, is an ancient vampire devoid of the simplest and most innate traits of goodness. Claudia, Lestat's and Louis' daughter, is an evil and manipulative vampire child that would stop at nothing to avenge her eternal predicament. Armand, a vampire that falls in love with Louis, is the oldest vampire alive.The story, told in first person, is entertaining and gives the reader a window on the lives of people in New Orleans and Europe during the late 1800's and early 1900's. Anne Rice does a great job in adding a human semblance to her vampire characters. The reader might get to relate, and subsequently, empathize with the actions and logic of those characters. This is not a page tuner, but definitely a fast read.This is one of the contemporary American classics. Read it if you enjoy vampire tales, supernatural tales, Anne Rice's writing or intriguing period stories."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"this book gives a very poetic, cynical view to the lives of vampires.it's about a man named Loius in the late eighteenth century who is made into a vampire by a very vain and gluttonous vampire named Lestat and their adventures until about the end of the nineteenth century. Loius has a lot of regrets about letting himself become a vampire and Lestat doesn't provide any consolation with his gluttonous ways of living off of humans without regret.this is a very beautifully detailed horror with lots of mystery and intrigue. it's not a good stand-alone story for the faint-of-heart because Loius is so miserable throughout the book. however, if one reads this book and then reads its sequal, THE VAMPIRE LESTAT, one will be extrememly happy of the outcome of these two characters after reading both and they will love this book even more.p.s. THE VAMPIRE LESTAT is a much more light-hearted book full of fun adventures. it has a lot of mysteries revealed that were left unsolved in INTERVIEW. so don't stop after INTERVIEW, read on and be amazed!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I will keep my review of INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE short, since I have very little to add to the many other fine reviews that have been posted already.I really enjoyed INTERVIEW, but I will say that it's not a traditional \\"scary\\" horror novel. This is also not a fast-paced book with a lot of action and adventure. Instead, Rice concentrates much more energy on the psychological state of Louis, the central vampire character. She does a truly brilliant job of conveying to the reader a sense of Louis's moral anguish, as he is forced to deal with his immortality and the violent day-to-day reality of a vampire's lifestyle.More than any other novel I've read, INTERVIEW explains what a vampire's life might really be like. It's a work of great psychological and emotional depth. Louis is not an easy character to spend time with, but I really felt a great deal of empathy for him.Rice writes in a rather florid style, but she's very skilled in re-creating 18th and 19th century New Orleans. If you like books that create a vivid sense of place and time, INTERVIEW is a fine choice for that also.Overall, I really loved INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE, although I will admit that it's not for everyone. But I think anyone interested in the Vampire mythos should definitely give this novel a try, since it is a classic of the genre."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I'll be honest, I saw the movie long before I was able to get my hands on the novel. Since then, both have become all-time favorites in my mind and nothing has topped them.I have always been a fan of a good novel from time to time, but nothing prepared me for the journey that I took upon reading the first installment of The Vampire Chronicles! Instead of comparing the similarities or differences between the novel and the movie, I found myself completely immersed in the novel for what it truly is, an epic work of craftsmanship that will leave you spellbound.The story itself is told from the point of view of Louie, who throughout the chronicles, remains the most human of all the vampires. The interview, is his story. How he became a lost soul with \\"The Dark Gift\\" and how he still feels remorse for those he kills. Louie (instead of embracing the gift) still suffers from lonliness and unanswered questions of who and what he has become! His only companion is the man who made him, Lestat!Enter, the character of Claudia. Perhaps the most compelling and saddening chracter of the novel. Claudia is just a child when she is made into a vampire, and outgrows her memories of her \\"real\\" childhood! She is the true sufferer, as her innocense is lost, but her life, never ends!I could go on, but I think you should purchase this novel instead. Anne Rice has a way of writing that will have you hooked from the very beginning. It all starts with this novel, and there are many others that follow! You will find yourself part of this world, and not want to get out!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I give this book five stars because it learned me English (and how to use a dictionary), let me read something else then kid's books (I was 13, maybe 14 when I read it), mad eme a pseuda-gothic for about a year which made me a happier and stronger person with more confidence (and who, after that year, could do without the black clothes and still have confidence anyway), has brought me back to at least considering 'culteral' things like classical music, musea, history, etc. (which made educational school trips a lot more fun), gave me some new friends (because they read it too), and altered my whole vision on life.This book isn't all that well written, in the sense of too many descriptions and all, but I think it's still a good book in the sense that it changed my life, and there are quite a lot of books that are better written but failed to that.Also, this book came to life for me while I read it; I actually could believe in vampires, at least for as long as the book lasted (and actually a few years longer, until I read Memnoch the Devil, but I hate to admit that)."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Well, I'm going to keep this short; I don't see any reason of boring you. I had high expectations for this book. I heard that it was one the best vampire books ever written, that it was scary, and so on and so forth. Anyway, this isn't scary at all, nor was it meant to be. Instead, this is a sympathetic view of vampires and shows how they live their lives. I have no problem with this, and applaud Rice for doing something original. I love the detail she puts into the scenery and makes the New Orleans of the past come to life with ease. Also, the character development of Louis is great, and the detail in other character (though coming from Louis's view point) is good. Unfortunately, the story suffers from Louis's narrative. He complains too much, continually debates if God and Devil are real or not, complains that he always wants to die but then admits every time he doesn't have the guts to do it. Really, if I wanted to listen to whining and complaining, I would listen to emo. Fortunately, this is a relatively short story; only about three-hundred and fifty pages or so. Another thing I like about this book is that it is a fast read. One could be done with it within a day to five days (just depends on how fast you read). All in all, this is a pretty good story. Not perfect, but definitely worth its price."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This book stands alone as one of the truest crossovers between sexuality, horror, darkness and literature. I remember as a child discovering the strange ways Anne Rice was able to excite me with simply what was printed on the page. At the age of 11, her work became the dirty little secret I hid from everyone. Although the book was one my mother owned, I purloined it and read it cover to cover until I got up the nerve to ask my mom if there were anymore books by this talented woman.In my later years I discovered the truly adult writings she had done with the wonderful Beauty series and East of Eden, but it was this book that first showed me that the written word could be seductive, could be exciting and could fire the imagination like nothing else.My own writings, far from her level, could be said to have been brought to the fore simply because she gave me an appreciation I hadn't yet been able to develop.Strange how these books have crossed over in genres that, although not far removed, are removed from the general readership she enjoys. I have seen her and her books mentioned in comics, movies and stories, always given as the basis for why some whelpling wishes to be a vampire. I sometimes get the feeling that her readers don't get the fact that she portrays them (vampires) romantically, but there is always this sense of loneliness, of unease. She loves what they represent but I get the feeling that somehow she has the real sense of the sadness that would accompany hiding in the shadows for hundred and hundreds of years.Anne Rice is an amazing writer, this an amazing book from a fantastic series, it should be read again and again."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"During the 70's and 80's when millions were reading Anne Rice's books, I had no interest in vampire ventures. Little did I know that in May of 2006, I would be in the audience with my daughter watching LESTAT, the musical, on Broadway, and enjoying it. Followers of the Vampire Chronicles, familiar with Lestat's story, questioned whether the Broadway musical, a composite of the early books, was true to the written works or perhaps changed in subtle ways. The questions piqued my interest. I now have the first 3 books of the chronicles and have read INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE.\\"The Interview\\" probes the heart and \\"soul\\" of the vampire, Louis. Louis questions the basis of his existence as a vampire. His struggle to choose good over evil is thwarted by the knowledge that as a human, good may be inherent, but as a vampire, evil triumphs. After all, killing is evil and killing humans is vital to vampire life. A vampire can survive physically on the blood of animals, but it is the human blood that fulfills his desires and needs.What choice does the reader have but to agonize along with Louis - taking human life, sucking the life-blood out of humans, lurching through the night, sleeping in coffins during day light hours, and though deploring the evil state of his immortality, acknowledging that the will to sustain it is greater than the desire to destroy it.Though exciting and fascinating, I found the pace of the story sometimes plodding and tedious. I wondered, can I possibly read another volume of the series?But \\"Interview\\" is only the beginning - Louis, the human, is \\"taken by Lestat; Louis, the vampire, is \\"created\\" by Lestat. Louis's story reveals his desires, loves, fears, hates, and his inner turmoil wrought by the forces of vampiric evil . Lestat's story, however, remains a question. So there's my answer! To compare the musical with the written chronicles, I must read the second of the series, THE VAMPIRE LESTAT. 550 pages of fine print should tell me all I need to know about Lestat."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This was the first novel I read by Anne Rice, and it definately made me addicted to her writing. For fans of the movie that haven't yet read the book, I urge you to read the book. I agree the movie was excellent, but the book is so much more. This book really has a special place in my heart, because it was the first of her novels, and it introduced me (and countless others) to her writing.We follow Louis-the tortured soul that he is- throughout the decades of his existence. Everybody has heard of Lestat-the fiend, and of Claudia-the child vampire, so beautiful, yet so tragic. They come together in this book, and if you haven't seen the movie-WAIT! Until after you finish this novel, it's breathtaking in all it's bittersweet beauty."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I loved this book. Well I read it more then three times so I love it. This is a really amazing book and it gets you thinking of what COULD have happened. It's also great for discussions among human life. I'd recommend it to everyone really. Yes even if you think Anne Rice's books are evil (so my mother says). But really it is an awesome book."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I found the book to be a great piece of work, almost poetic writing and pilosophy/psychology inlaid within the pages.But if you are looking for a very fast paced, horrifying, Salem's Lot type novel, then slowly back away from the computer. The book is very slow in pace, very emotional and dramatic about EVERYTHING ( which I personally love, but which others could find terribly boring). If you are looking for a Vampire novel with a more...tangible (for lack of better word) plot, then I suggest checking out Laurell K Hamilton or Christopher Pike, and some of the YA authors like Amelia Atwater-rhodes or Vivian Vande Velde. And if your looking for a vampire novel to just scare the hell outta ya, then it's always nice to go with Stephen Kings &quot;Salem's Lot.&quot;"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This was a great novel. I wish I would have read this first, before I saw the film, that didn't even come close to doing the novel justice. Although I think Brad Pitt does make a great Louis. Interview is told from the perspective of Louis, a lone vampire who tells the story of his life to Daniel, a reporter (though you don't know the name of the 'boy' until the next book). He speaks of his relationship with Lestat, his maker, and Claudia, their 'daughter.' The tale is a great one, and much more complicated than shown in the film. Also, the ending of this book is very good, again, different from the film. The book held my interest from start to finish, which I hoped it would. I'm not a fast reader and I finished the first three Vampire Chronicles novels in 4 months. They're that good. This one is an excellent start. The only bad thing about this book is that sometimes it can get confusing because it's told in third person, but Louis is telling the story to someone else in first person. Other than that it is wonderful!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"A vampire's thoughts on his life, his death and rebirth, andhis dark immortality thereafter. His experiences may horrify you, may enchant you,will probably do both, but will not bore you.This is the only one of Anne Rice's vampire novels told fromLouis' point of view and is thus very different in tone fromthe other books, told (mostly) by Lestat. Personally, Iwould read &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot; and &quot;Queen of the Damned&quot;before &quot;Interview,&quot; but that may be because, while&quot;Interview&quot; ranks high among vampire novels, I think thesecond and third books rank even higher."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"It hardly seems possible that it's been 30 years now since the publication of Interview With The Vampire. While certainly a modern classic, this remarkable novel is a book that has always transcended any boundaries, including the era it was published. In 1976 literature had shrunk, was holding its head in the sand, afraid to show much courage. The renowned writers of the day wrote on navel contemplating, self-obsessed issues like mid-life crises, divorce, nervous breakdowns, adultery, etc. Some of these authors are still around and continue producing, but have largely faded. Rice brought back the big, important, compelling, sweeping themes in life that had preoccupied the great 19th century writers and haunt us all: loss, love, identity, and bravely asked questions about redemption and the meaning of life.I discovered the book at 18, about six months after it was first published. I had graduated high school and was knocking around, trying to decide what to do with my life, struggling to deal with the usual 18 year old's questions on survival and obsessed with my own creative urges and quests. I had heard of Interview, very good word of mouth. I had read a couple of glowing reviews. It was at once both a best seller and a sort of undergroundy, cultish book. It was indeed a \\"cool vampire book,\\" but read like it was written by the child of Hawthorne and one of the Bronte sisters. A totally enthralling, mesmerizing dark journey through loss, death, revenge. Lestat, Louis and the child vampire Claudia, all three who've lost everything during mortal life, form an \\"alternative family\\" (an expression I've always despised) and attempt to find their place together in the world, albeit as blood drinking, ruthless vampires. Their ultimate combustion is the stuff of great tragedy in art. As heartbreaking as it is unforgettable.Upon completing reading the novel, I sat spellbound. Reading Interview had been a sort of emotional and spiritual frisson for me, one that resonates to this day. Instantly I had experienced the shock of recognition and wondered how this great author knew so much about me.... Then I, as have millions of Rice readers across the world, became interested in the woman who created this masterpiece and of course eagerly awaited each new book during the next 30 years.I credit Rice with single-handedly changing literature for the better. During the past 30 years since Interview was born, literature and the movies have gradually once again begun to tackle the big themes. We acknowlege that the films of Lord Of The Rings are large, thought provoking metaphors, we accept that The Lovely Bones has a ghost narrator and is considered a great book, not just a \\"scary novel,\\" or a thriller. Once again our art not just accepts, but lovingly and enthusiastically embraces both heroes and villians who struggle with mighty and dark forces and even with the possibilities of redemption and resurrection.All this has evolved since Interview was published 30 years ago. Quite an accomplishment and one deserving of great praise."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"INTERVIEW should not be confused with its so-called \\"sequels\\". IF read as a standalone (as originally intended) this is a superb novel and a horror classic. It is not PRIMARILY \\"scary\\" horror -- though it certainly has its moments - so much as creeping, psychological horror. It's also a mesmerizing page-turner with lush descriptions and some truly unforgettable characters and relationships, and it imprints the mind with images both beautiful and horrific.As you can imagine, a vampire novel from the vampire's point of view is often both painful and disturbing. When I first read this in my early twenties, certain parts made me consider not finishing it, but I did, and was glad that I had persevered. Reading it again, I find Louis' harrowing story even more compelling, not to mention eerily true-to-life. The way that vampirism illuminates real human evil and psychology is this book's great strength, and makes it rewarding even for those who cannot stand Rice's later books, wherein self-indulgent sado-eroticism appears to be an end in itself.I disagree with reviewers who say this story takes us \\"beyond good and evil\\". It is ABOUT evil, and what evil does to us. Evil, murder, and selfish possessiveness erode our capacity for love, and hence for happiness, thus condemning us to a hell of our own creation. You don't have to become a vampire or go around murdering people to find this out for yourself. (Although it helps.)If you read this book and love it, then avoid the sequels. The sequels only exist because Rice completely retconned her original story, mangled her best characters beyond recognition, and completely ignored the moral and spiritual POINT of the ending. (Which makes the ending even more ironic than originally intended).But if you hate this book, then give the sequels a try."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This story is a sensual and incredibly disturbing fantasy expressed with powerful emotional eroticism, beauty, and eloquence. Rice transforms vampires into sympathetic, seductive, and human figures ... in search of others like themselves. Rice explores humanity's deepest philosophical concerns, including the nature of good and evil, death, the conflict between reality and idealism, and how do we know that we know, and all that from the fascinating perspective of an immortal narrator.Louis is a classic tragic character whose source of suffering results from his inability to release his lingering humanity. Lestat is twisted, cold, and a deviate. But it is the story of the little girl, Claudia, that I find the most intriguing. She becomes a vampire at an age too young to remember her human nature and transforms into a vampire woman inside the body of child. It is this doomed tragedy of Claudia, with all of its problematic complications that lends a classic power to this book.Rice makes no effort to hide the vampire's erotic appeal behind any doors of moral convention. Moreover, her subjects are far from evil incarnate. The characters are complex in a human way that transcends good and evil. Rice conveys great depth to her characters that live in the abject where there is no good or evil but lots of disturbing possibilities."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This wondrous work holds meaning for so many people, it is almost too dangerous to attempt to review it. So I won't. Instead, without challenging anyone else's opinions, I'll share my feelings on it, and tell something of the events of the novel, in case I may humbly aid anyone that might stray by who is unfamiliar with its details. (In which case I urge you to read Interview With The Vampire.)Anne Rice's undying masterpiece tells of the revelations in one long night in 1970's San Francisco, of a 200-year-old vampire named Louis, who lived, died, and was reborn as an undead being in 18th century New Orleans at the hands of the antiheroic Vampire Lestat. Louis is no mere vampire, but a keen observer of the worlds of man and the preternatural entities who share the earth with him. Louis is a sufferer, a soul in pain. In the last years of his mortal life, he lost his bride and sought death for himself. What he received in death's place was the Dark Gift, a condition of death within life/life within death, that makes him shun sunlight and thirst for the blood necessary to sustain himself in his new existence. Yet the Dark Gift also grants Louis and his kind immortality of sorts, and bestows them with abilities far surpassing those possessed by those living in the sunlight world of mankind.In Interview, there are other vampires sharing this life with Louis. There is the noble Lestat, Louis' flamboyant, deadly, creator. There is Claudia, a child vampire whose mind aged even while imprisoned forever in the body of a cherubic child. And later in the work there are the old covens of Europe, who fit the role of the vampires of legend: the dark, cruel beings of crypt and moonlight.This novel is, as I said at the start, a drug that transports its reader into another dimension. Be prepared to surrender days or weeks to its spell. It is a story that will open your mind, heart, and soul, and stay within you till the end of your days, if not beyond...."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I first became Rice obsessed in the 10th grade when I first read this novel. I specifically remember finishing it one week before the movie was released. I read it a few more times throughout the years and had to read it again this past spring for a class I took on vampire mythology and was reminded of just why I love this novel.This novel isn't really about vampires, but about humans. The philosophical aspects regarding life/death/heaven/hell/good/evil/G-d/mortality brought up with this novel are amazing and I still find it hard to believe that I can still recite a particular passage Armand tells Louis about &quot;how many vampires do you think have the stamina for immortality?&quot;I would like to re-read all of the Vampire Chronicles to gauge my reactions to it now compared to when I first read them. Still, this is Rice's masterpiece. I'm very interested in the vampire subculture from an anthropological perspective, so if the story seems appealing, I'll probably give it a read. I wasn't too impressed with Stoker's Dracula (I can feel the stakes being sharpened already) and didn't feel the pull to continue on with the Anita Blake series I started as a book report for the same vampire mythology class. I'm not saying all of Rice's novels are excellent, but this one is, in my opinion, the best of her collection."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"...because after reading this book, all I could think was- Man! I want to be a Vampire!I am just a novice when it comes to vampire tales or the horror genre, but even so, Interview is right at the top of my list of all-time favorite books.Louis is an ancient vampire who is tired of living in secrecy. When a young journalist offers to interview him- we are given a tale we will never forget! Beginning in colonial New Orleans, Louis tells of his days as a plantation owner, how he met Lestat, and how his life was forever changed.Without a doubt, this is a monumental classic. It's immense popularity is well deserved! But although it is labeled \`horror', I would recommend it highly to any fan of fantasy as well, for it is truly one of the finest books you may ever get your hands on.-There are several other books in this series as well, but from what I hear, they fail to hold a candle. I only tried The Vampire Lestat (2nd book), which didn't hold my interest for very long. But like Dune or Ender's Game- the first book of this series, at least, is a must read!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"_Interview with the vampire_ is a discovery and a challenge. It has very little to do with other vampire stories. Vampires are usually only hypostasies of evil, creatures with no soul or feeling -until some brave man encounters them amd, after a hard fight, destroys vampires and evil together. Even Rodriguez and Tarantino recently followed such old-fashioned clich&eacute;! The same old stuff, since Murnau's _Nosferatu_.Anne Rice's book is different. Vampires are human beings, who try to separate themselves from their human feelings and sufferings. That's absolutely original and charming.But Miss Rice made a mistake: her favourite character in origin, that is to say Claudia, becomes unexpectedly cruel. And at the same time the cruel Lestat becomes a victim.When Lestat appears, in the _Theatre of the Vampires_, he claims for Claudia's death. That's cruel, but right He coluld also ask for Louis' death, but he doesn't.And &quot;after the event, he wept&quot; (Eliot).Who is the real monster? Lestat or Louis? Or Armand, who kills Claudia only for jealousy?The movie (very beautiful, I think) is a partial re-invention of the novel. In the final scene, we are allowed to suppose that Lestat will become a rockstar. Just whar happens in the second book of _The Vampire Chronicles_. But this is another story!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Personally, I don't like vampire tales much; I'd rather read witch stories. But when I started reading this one, I had to admit: Interview With the Vampire is really a very original book, something that readers of the genre were really in need since Bram Stoker's Dracula.But there's a huge problem: Anne Rice hasn't done a single original vampire book since that one. They are only copies and copies of this one. In other words, a shame. Though, if you like vampire tales, that one is just wonderful well-written and a very enjoyable reading. Something you don't find anymore. This book is really a must-read. But don't go any further on Rice books. At least, don't expect to find the rest as interesting as that one. Because they are not. The witch books and the rest are as good, but the other vampire tales are not. So, in order not to hate Rice, read that one, love that one. And stop with that one.Marco Aurelio."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"When I first read this novel I was absolutely blown away by Anne Rice's amazing writing talent and her sheer artistry with words. Before Interview With the Vampire I hadn't had much experience with vampire literature but this novel turned me on to it in a big way; to this day I still hunt through the shelves looking for Rice's equal in vampire fiction and with the exception of Poppy Z. Brite I have yet to find it. Louis and Lestat are two of my favorite characters of all time. I loved every aspect of this story but as always with Rice, I think I fell most in love with her lyric and vivid prose. Interview With the Vampire is a very dark gothic novel and though the story has become somewhat clich&eacute; Anne Rice pulls it off with her own flare and brilliance. (By the way the Tom Cruise/Brad Pitt movie doesn't do this book justice!!)"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I have always avoided the Anne Rice Vampire novels, though now I can't recall why. Probably because there is so much poorly written vampire fiction out there already (coughtwilightcough). While bedridden I happened to catch the movie on tv and loved it. A week later I picked up the book and loved it even more. This book was well written with an engrossing storyline and fascinating characters. I can't wait to start The Vampire Lestat next (I'm told its even better!)."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Being as I'm a huge vampire fan, and I am planning to visit New Orleans for the first time next month, I decided to read this. I have to say, it was a bit of a hard read, mostly because of the way Louis speaks in his old-world mannerisms, and the third person point of view. I find it easier to read books from a first person point of view. Anyway, I made the mistake of renting the movie after reading the book (I saw the movie years and years ago when it came out) and the movie sucked - no pun intended! Left out so many details. Anne Rice is a great author and I'm going to read The Vampire Lestat next. 4 Stars on this one for the details and the writing."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I know this is a very very popular vampire book and I deliberately didn't want to read it for that purpose, however eventually I gave in to reading it.I decided I wanted to read vampire fiction to find out the different takes authors have on the mythology and this one definitely holds onto some of the old traditions. I did enjoy the way it was written but it definitely is no Dracula and the characters are interesting to say the least but sometimes quite annoying.My favorite part of the book has to be the stage scene at \\" Theatres des vampires\\" I really enjoyed that and I actually quite liked those characters despite the things they try to do to our main trio.It's a good read, not boring but not exactly amazing either. I will at some point read the following novels."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Ann Rice has established herself as one of the quintessential authors of vampire fiction because she has given attention to some literary style and academic details that encompass aspects of historical fiction, she seemed to have done her homework about the culture of Louisiana and the Creole traditions that created an atmosphere of mysterious cults, voodoo, strange religion, and the idea that there might be something buried deep in the bloodline and heritage of the deep south that could be an alternate doorway or alcove to eternal life. In popular culture Rice is an American author that has contributed to the popularity of English novels, with American culture and heritage infused into the plot.Interview utilized a sort of academic and journalistic approach to the investigation of vampires in the contemporary world then it used a sort of historic research to delve into the past and uncover the graves of men in lace and velvet whose lips were as ruby red as the blood that they suckled from their unsuspecting victims."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I read this, at the request of my goth little sister, in 1995. I nearly put it down after a chapter or two, but her writing gripped me, took me somewhere else, somewhere i wanted to be. I fell in love with Claudia, loved Louis and Lestat, and Armand was my favorite. I saw the movie a year later, and yes it was good, but not as wonderful as the book. The next two in the series match this one in ambiance and flavor, but this is the original."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"this book was my first experience w/vampires in literature. of course i've grown up w/vampires in the movies & on tv, but this was my first experience reading in depth about them as an adult. i love ann rice's historical & documanted \\"truths\\" within this story. she makes it real! i love this book, & i recommend it to everyone that hasn't read it & to those who have. it's a must read especially w/all the media hype surrounding this subject today!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I found what I liked most about this book is Anne Rice's use of description and setting. She uses both to set the atmosphere and tone of this novel. The dark atmosphere and the ominous tone create a deep, underlying desperation within the characters. I've watched the movie and now read the book. I've enjoyed both."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This book was perfect exept it didn't come with a dust jacket like It said it woul other than that great book loved it"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I love this book, it is dark and scary and highly addictive! The only problem was that even though I knew the vampire had a French/Louisiana accent, in my head he had a Transylvanian one. I plan on reading the rest of Ann Rice's novels now and wish it hadn't taken me so long to try one."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This book is brand new and looks as if it was just written even though it was written in the 70s. Definitely a must have for the hardback cover!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Anne Rice is now one of the most popular novelists alive. With &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; it is clear why; it's mesmerizing, haunting, and intriguing - one of the best novels I've ever read. It's a dramatic, horrifying and even sad tale of a vampire surviving through the ages while tormented by unanswered questions, love, and his hunger for blood. &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; is a triumph of modern fiction."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This book is brilliant.I am not much of a reader but when I find something of interest like vampires, I am hooked.This is the very first vampire book I've ever read and it's great.The characters,storyline,and detailed scary destriptions make it hard NOT to turn pages.Definietly read it if you like fantasty creatures like vampires,it'll keep you on for long."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I found that Interview With the Vampire was a very unique and interesting book. Anne Rice has an absolutely amazing way with words, the whole text is poetic and deep. Which can sometimes make things a little difficult to read, but absorbing none the less.I fell in love with the characters as usual, and even cried during one part. I absorbed every word and by the end of the book I was frustrated because I was not part of the romantic immortal world that Louis, Claudia and Lestat shared. This book sets the stage for many more to come."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This was the work of a genius. Anne Rice was near the tope of her game with this (non-fiction) work. (I like to think that vampires exsist, so leave me alone.) Rice's in depth with character and the mystery of it all will of course lead to Louis appearence again. Of course I am speaking (or rather typing) of Rice's other novel Merrick, which lets Louis do some things I will not type here. Just remember to READ THE VAMPIRE CHRONICLES IN ORDER! It hurts if you don't. Overall, this book was fantastic, and I can't wait till Louis writes again!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I really liked this book, it was just so fasinating the whole story was great, it made you feel like you were right there with them while they were experincing everything."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"while I have not read this book by hand (yet) I got the audio tape of it from my local librarey. and found the story intreuging and quite modern yet not as modern as our own time period. I have always been fasnated by the myths and stories of vampiers. and found that this book hit very firmly on the life of the importal un-dead. the story is a very good one and althoug it does take a bit of pactience eventully you find your self wanting to know more about the charcter Lue and his teacher Lastat and other charcters that fall into place with this time less classic. I enjoyed this story very much and look forward to reading The Vampire Lastat the next book in the vampire chorincles. this book is a good classic vampire story to read if you are like me and can't get enough of vampire stories but. if you look for somthing with the modern world view and vampires that exisit in it. I would diffently say that would have to beThe Vampire Lastat but I would highly recommend not skiping the lines and read this book before you leap to the second book. and as you should with all the books in the vampire chroncles seeing is how this book ties into most of the books that come into place afterward. but diffently a good read do pick it up highly recommend to those with a taste for gothic leterture."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Interview with the Vampire was a fun book it had me on edge wondering what was going to happen next. I was very foucused on Louis because even though he was supposed to be evil and had evil ability and power he chose not to use it like Lastat. Lastat scared me because he was capable of anything and he acted as if he cared of nothing. Claudia was a very powerful little girl and I never really trusted her because she reminded me alot of Lastat. The plot was was kind of confusing but at the end i understood what was missing and every thing come together in the end. The characters all had their own image they were non the same. I recommend this book to anyone who likes fiction and want a little suspence."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Although Anne Rice has written scores of Vampire books, this first novel remains my favorite. The idea of an interview in a dark room with a real vampire is enough to get most people's attention. But the way the plot melts into the story of the vampire is a work of art.The screen version emphasized the spectacular, the gory and the sensational. Missing were the sensualness, the mystery and the darkness that permeated the saga. The author's powers of invention (her latter works tend toward repetition - a common problem) were never greater than what follows. The life and times of the vampires themselves capture the imagination and she manages to instill a sense of sorrow and empathy for these soulless creatures - even as they do their mayhem.For a flight of adventure and fantasy, put on some Bach (or better, Vierne or Widor), pour a glass of red wine, grab some blue cheese and an apple and prepare to enter the mists."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Interview with the Vampire by Ann Rice is a book that, even if you don't like reading, it will keep you interested in finishing it. I'm not the kind of person who likes reading a lot and before this book I never read an entire book. But there was something about this story that kept me attached to it. Something that I really like about this book is the passion and love of the characters. Vampires are supposed to be characters without sentiment, but in this story Ann Rice gave her characters (vampires) a heart worth of millions. Like the main character, Louis, who loved his &quot; daughter&quot;(Claudia, a little girl Louis and Lestat turn into a vampire) for centuries and did everything to protect her. Another character that shows a lot of love and passion is Claudia. She wanted to spend all eternity as Louis' companion and help him in the search for other vampires. In the end, Interview With The Vampire is a book worth reading. It would make your imagination fly and your heart thrill."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Even though Interview With The Vampire was not my favorite creepy story, I still encourage people who like emotional drama books to read it. I was dissapointed about Louis and I actually felt sorry for him. It gets boring when you read about people like Louis. The one thing that I liked about the book was how well the author describes New Orleans a couple of centuries ago."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I had to knock off one star becuse Louis wines alot! This book has fantasic carteters and wonderful settings. But it seems more like a vampire sob story more then anything else. I like The Vampire Lastat alot better but this was a fantastic way to start a sries."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I personally think that this book is Anne Rice's greatest work ever. It sets the premise for the rest of the vampire chronicles.She truly is a genius and I look forward to more of her great work."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"A very interesting redefinition of the vampire lore. The book that began the Anne Rice craze. By far the best in the series (sequels never live up to the original). I for one found this to be a complete tale that had no need for any follow-up. However, the power of the dollar and a legion of fans caused Ms. Rice to try to invent some sort of follow-up tales.The character of Louis is so interesting as is the mysterious LeStat. We also have a fascinating cast of characters inhabiting the Theater of the Vampires.The narration is fascinating as the interviewer observes all types of eerie body movements from his vampire subject during the interview."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I've always thought reading was an interminable drudgery...until I picked up this book. Interview with the Vampire is a beatiful gothic tale. Rice pull you into this imagionary realm, leaving reality and everything behind. The story and the characters are so realitic that you can actually sense the atmosphere of where the story take place and feel the same intensity as the characters. This book is erotic, sensual, and the perfect object to indulge in. As you travel through time and space with Louis, you start to fall in love with their magical kingdom of New Orlean and Paris. The way Rice narrated the whole scenary gives you this elegant sense of atmosphere. As you read on, you will also discover your love for the characters. You can feel the love and hate that exists between them and seem to become the vampires yourself. This book is a giant step to an amazing journey. I should say it has changed my life. It's not some phony vampire book, it's something real and beautiful that you'd never want to let go. P.S.Rice is a lot better than Steven King."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Interview With the Vampire wasn't spellbinding, but it was enjoyable. Anne Rice is the first novelist I ever read something by, that wrote of vampires in good and evil ways. When the book first opens up, you have a heartbroken vampire, Louis, and a male reporter, (later known as Daniel, in the Vampire Chronicles) who needs a story. It attracted my attention from the very beginning-there wasn't any vulgar vampires, or right away, blood-sucking gore, just an intriguing way of starting a cunning tale. It captured my fancy, as the story reached it's peak with Claudia. Lestat who seemed like a fiend from hell, isn't like that in the least, of the remaining four novels. I was very much interested in the progressing relationship, between Claudia and Louis, as well as Lestat, who had a tremendous effect, on the two. I liked the little things, that made her book different from others I have read-vampires aren't allergic to garlic, they have a reflection in the mirror,(so they can see how captivating they look), crosses, holy water, the bible, and onions have no effect on them whatsoever. The only really fatal hazard was, the killer rays from the sun. I hated the fact that they couldn't have sex. To me, vampires who can have sex are more sexy and enticing, in my opinion. I disliked the way it ended-what happens to the reporter, where is Louis? Had this been the only book Anne wrote on her characters, those would be the questions still dangling in the open, but luckly those questions are answered in the latter part of the series. Overall, this was a good book to read, and I didn't have to force myself to read it."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"If you're looking for elegant writing, look elsewhere, but if what you want is a bizarre romance story, go ahead and give it a try. The writing is too flowery for my taste and the story somewhat slow, but it is a pop-culture phenomenon which is worth at least being familiar with."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This was the first vampire book I'd ever heard of where the vampire was the one telling the story. That was interesting enough to get me to read it. But that's not what I loved about the book. The entire story was filled with rich and vivid description, incorporating every sense, immersing the reader in the life, or unlife, of the vampire Louis.The story starts out in New Orleans slightly before Louis is made into a vampire by the complex and fiendish vampire Lestat. Louis then recounts his time in New Orleans as a vampire, and his travels after leaving Lestat. Throughout all, we begin to understand what drives a vampire to stay alive, what needs he seeks to fill in his eternity of undeath.The story of Louis is steeped in a romanticization of New Orleans and Paris, told in a prose that allows the reader to experience it as if firsthand. The description is so rich one can almost taste the hot humid air of pre-industrial New Orleans, see and smell the decay of the overcrowded Paris and its underworld.It is a vibrant tale of longing and a quest for meaning in a seemingly empty existence. It is also a very rewarding reading experience."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I liked how the vampires in this book differ from the traditional vampires (enhanced visual and auditory perception, do have reflections, can subsist on animals).The story was drawn out, and I did not enjoy the amount of pages devoted to Louis's (the main character) depression. I was disappointed with the ending, it just didnt strike me as all that great a story.I will try the original by Bram Stoker."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Fairly similiar to the movie if you're not into reading, though there are some differences that make the book worthwhile. If you like the book, i recommend the series as it gets better."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This will be the first and last time we see the Dark Life from Louis point of view. The last time we hear his inner monologue. His love with Claudia is very taboo, but genuine. His hatred and resentment for Lestat is very real and understandable.The Hollywood verison of this book was flawed, but it did not stray ~too~ far from the mark. Not unlike the complete failure of \\"Queen of the Damned\\". =0PThis is a quick read, but it has a great depth to it. Grow fond of Louis, but bid him a fond farewell after this novel, for he will only be glimpsed in shadows from now on....."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I read the others before this and frankly was disappointed while i love lestat and armand i found this book a let down. Louis is a whiney annoyin weak character who has no guts. Claudia unfortunately had her life ruined due to a stupid act by lestat. So her character has turned into a spoiled brat."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Upon skimming through this book, I am reminded of a friend's favourite saying: &quot;The people of the night are not just the people of the day dressed up in black and hanging around in graveyards because they think it makes them cool.&quot; The story was written beautifully and I enjoyed the imagery immensely. But the content was insipid, the events of the plot repetitive, and the attempts at describing sheer misery laughable. A deeper understanding of depression would have helped Anne Rice to write a truly stirring book. But as it was, she neither created a convincing sense of oppressive sorrow nor maintained the hint of it she managed to achieve. The complaints about the pointlessness of vampiric existence seemed petty, especially in places where more thought-provoking comments could easily have been made.This is not great literature. The lyrics of any Diary of Dreams song could create a more gothic mood. If you like books of the genre that Interview with the Vampire pretends to be, then by all means pick up Dracula. Better yet, read Shelley's Frankenstein or something by the Bronte sisters. Interview with the Vampire is written more skillfully than most thrillers and will keep you awake if you ever find yourself on night watch. But it is a pale shadow of the Gothic Novel, a few sticks in the mud masquerading as a great cathedral."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Anne Rice has done it again! A particularly interesting piece of literature!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"The first time I read this book, it was the first serious work I had seen devoted to vampires and their culture. I found it to be amazing and compelling. The care that Anne Rice gave to this study of vampires intrigued me.I am now reading it years later for the second time, having since become a fan of the Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter series from Laurell K. Hamilton. On this second reading, I find the book to be plodding. There are no formal chapters, merely brief suspensions in the story. This makes it difficult for me to read for a while and then put it down. When I go back, I have noticed that I have difficulty remembering what had been happening.This book also contains what I now feel to be inaccuracies in vampire \\"life.\\" For example, in this book, vampires are not afraid of holy objects. Other writers have convinced me that this simply cannot be true. There have to be protections against vampires or they would be overrunning the worlds they inhabit.I do recommend this as an introductory book to vampire lore. Just don't expect it to be the \\"be all and end all.\\""},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"i think that the book is the most wanderfol bookilike this kind of book cos it mekmy live in anather worldthis book discribe evry ting very good"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Firstly, I'll comment on the negative - the angst from Louis. What a moaner, whinger, whiner. Complain and the &quot;oh, woe is me&quot;, just got too much. Lestat - couldn't you have picked someone else to spend eternity with?? I just hated that Louis character.Didn't like the writing... blah, blah, blah. I guess since this was my first romantic horror goth type book, I didn't know what to expect. I found it hard yakker getting through this novel, but did it as I was halfway through when the hype hit about a movie being made, based on the story.The positive - Lestat, how a vampire should be. Beautiful and flawed. So selfish, and so he should be. So manipulative, and should be after spending years roaming the world.Conclusion - not in a huge hurry to read another Rice book. If I found one in my bookshelf and I had nothing else to read, I may consider it."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Okay- I see why people can like this book. It has a good premise- the portrayal of a sympathetic vampire which goes beyond its shallow horror genre and makes some really thought-provoking insights into the vampire experience. It has a clever set-up (an interview with a mortal that allows Louis to tell his story) and a delightfully ironic ending (the interviewer not getting the entire point of Louis' story). But that's where the goodness ends, because the execution is terrible.The book is not that long- I've read far longer that are incredibly better- but it feels like 2,000 pages because it is SOOOOOO drawn-out, boring, and filled with insipid detail. If you like the movie, there's a reason why- all the \\"bridges\\" between scenes are removed to get to the essential parts. Louis, or Anne Rice through him, rambles on and on. Sometimes he has great moments in his mental wandering, but most of the time he sounds whiny and disgusting. There's some okay characterization, but not as great as people make it sound. Believe me, it was a struggle to finish this thing. There are much better other vampire tales."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"&quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; reads like Shakespeare on acid. The language and structure of the writing is reminiscent of some of the great Gothic horror novels but falls far short of capturing their intensity. The plot moves along like a two legged turtle, however even a faster pace would hardly make up for the lackluster story and rather tedious detail to which the reader is subjected. Particularly frustrating was the continued use and reuse of pseudo biblical language. This book failed to capture either my imagination or even my attention. If you plan to read this book, make certain to allow for frequent breaks"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"If you need a good nights sleep and are tired of counting sheep, try a few paragraphs of this book. Anne Rice's run on sentences and meaningless fluff will bore you to death if you are not careful. I think she was trying to expand what could easily be a short story into a novel. I forced myself to finish at least half the book which took me well over a week to do because I couldn't stand reading much of the book at one time. Don't waste your good money, go to the library and check it out if you are curious."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"It still mystifies me why so many people have so high an opinion of this book. I personally found it unbearable. To call this a vampire novel would be the same as calling Casper a ghost story. Nothing more than pretentious, pseudo intellectual pink novel."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Let it be known that I like some of Anne Rice's other works: I did like The Witching Hour. However, Interview with a Vampire is written with poor, boring prose. It is certainly not a page turner, and I would assign it as punishment for high school students who did not come to class on time. The story seems to be random, without any clear organization or purpose. Often while reading the book I will start to daydream about to other ideas and topics that are unrelated to the book. The truth is, the book is boring. The character development is particularly poor. None of the characters is brought to light in an interesting manner or explained why they exist. I would certainly never recommend this book."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I'm not sure where to start, really. A close friend of mine was desperately hooked on Twilight, and so I decided to pick this up in an attempt to show her what a \\"real\\" vampire book was like. Anne Rice is such a hero in the Genre, I thought I couldn't lose. Boy, was I wrong.The entire book had a theme, I get that. Louis battles internally with the idea of being human vs being supernatural. But, his oversensitivity to every little detail is nothing short of ridiculous. For a vampire, Louis is, well... a wuss. He doesn't WANT to feed, but he does. He doesn't like his nature, but he revels in it. The tennis match going on in his head is exhausting, and it sets the tone for the entire piece.Thankfully, this book is short of 350 pages. However, this book feels like War and Peace! I found myself reading this book in stages. 25 pages here, 10 pages there... it was a complete chore! The word boring doesn't do any justice to my true feelings for this book.Lastly, the worst thing about this book is that it insists upon itself. The gothic style lends itself nicely to the dark nature of this book, which is a legitimate writing device, sure.. but that's all it is. Massive buildups that yield nothing fruitful in the way of action or any substantial turn of events.I popped a cork after finishing this one!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"'Interview With The Vampire' by Anne Rice, I found this novel as something I wish that I did not read, but I decided to read it, and personally she is a master of the vampire, but this novel was my only Anne Rice novel, and was my last. I found the story to be slow, there was a lot of human emotion in this book, but I am used to being scared by vampires (Salems Lot for example) and vampires are just supposed to kill, there are some scenes where they do feed, but vampires are not supposed to have emotion, they are supposed to be blood suckers who haunt at night, and terrorize the town like in Salem's Lot.I guess that I just have a different seeing on vampires. Anyway, the story follows around Lewis, a rich man in the 17 or 18 century, I cant remember, then he meets this vampire, and he turns into one, and he lives his life. The story takes place in two places in two different times: San Francisco, present, and New Orleans 17 or 18 century.Lewis lives his life like he was still human, but I found this book to be too full of nothing, there is nothing exciting in this book, it is just him talking, and talking, and talking. It gets real boring, REAL FAST! I dont know what people see in this novel, but then I am not a big fan of Anne Rice, and I never will be. I just think that I rather just stick to Stephen King's Salems Lot if I want a real good vampire novel."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"The story \\"Interview With a Vampire\\" was really good but the quality of the book was poor.

I should have bought a new one."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I read this book once. It was allright but too dark and racy for me. I like reading about vampires but this one was hard to follow in some parts and some parts I liked some but I liked Merrick better.

The author just ranbles on and on and on about even the most trivial things in the book. Besides, the characters are all Mary Sues. If you don't know what a Mary Sue is, look it up.NOT reccomended. Check it out from the library first if you feel you really must read this drivel for yourself."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Reading reviews online, I was under the impression that this was a fantasy classic and a very worthwhile read. So as I progressed through the book, thinking very little of every single character and not much caring what happened to them, I didn't put it down, but kept going, thinking that something better must be on the next page.Not so. The characters are not sympathetic in the least and the plot is uneventful. I don't know anyone that I could recommend this book to in good conscience - so in my opinion, don't waste your time or money. There are plenty of good books out there, but this isn't one of them."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"NOT!!! OK - it was just boring. There was too much about the tedious vampires like Louis, who is just pathetic, and all the others, who are sad. Don't read it, and don't end up like some kind of schizo who falls in love with Lestat. See the movie, if you want to, or if you fancy Brad Pitt or Tom Cruise (warning - they both look like drowned rats in this film, and consequently pretty rough), or Christian Slater. OK - that's it.Adios amigos (I'm not Spanish, by the way)"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"After everyone's review I thought, wow this must be a great book. Boy was I wrong what a WASTE OF MONEY. This was the first book that I picked up written by Anne Rice and it is my last."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"With Interview with the Vampire, Anne Rice begins a powerful series with the life (or death if you will) of Louis Pointe du Lac. As you probably infer from the title, Louis is a Vampire. Now I am sure all of the reviews you have read about this book have sung nothing but praise for this extraordinary book. Now don't get me wrong, this is a beautifuly written book with exquisite detail and dialog more sensual than any man in the world. But I warn you reader, this beauty is hidden by the long and boring nature of this book. Now I may only be 17 but I have been an avid reader since the age of 3 and I know a good book when I see one, I love all of Anne Rice's books that I have had the pleasure of reading so far...except this one. My reccomendation reader, is that you skip this book all together and rent the movie from Blockbuster. I know that sounds horrid but it's true. You will get the gist of the book without the boring fluff. Then you may proceed to the more exciting books such as \\"The Tale of The Body Thief\\" \\"written\\" by the the one and only Lestat de Lioncourt!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I thought this book was very well written. I takes you to a place in time that we can only dream of. Currently I am reading The Vampire Lestat. It is very good to. I only rated Inteveiw 4 stars because Icould put it down. I only rate books 5 stars if I could not put it down. But I should rate it 4.5. I don't like the new rating system though. I don't have enough stars! I wanted to read this book after I saw the movie. I loved the movie soooo much.After I saw it I begged my mom to take me to the book store. She did and my friend (J.Z.) and I read it at the same time. (Of course she finished before me.) But when you read this book you find yourself in a totally different world. You find your self saying: I don't this were in Virginia anymore, Toto! But you welcome this world just the same as if it wer home. But of course you have to take extra procautions about covering the neck areas but I am willing to do that. Well I will do one for The Vamp Lestat when I finish.- thank you!- BB"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I can't believe that I waited so long before I finally read this book. I have since bought the rest of the chronicles and now have my summer reading set before me. I also have bought the Mayfair Witches chronicles also. Read this book. It fills in where the movie could not fully go."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I finished reading &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; a few minutes ago. I loved it. I read the last word, turned the last page, and sat there for a while; then I picked the book up and shook it, whispering, &quot;More! I want more!&quot; Thank God there's a whole series.&quot;Interview&quot; is getting a great deal of hype because of the movie, but it deserves every bit of publicity it receives because it's simply the most gripping page-turner I've ever read. It doesn't really fit into a particular category, which is why many reviewers were disappointed with it. I think I enjoyed it so much because it was the first vampire book I've ever read (soon to be one of many), and when I picked it up, I didn't really know what to expect. &quot;Interview&quot; isn't straight horror, romance, or fantasy... It's all these and much more. Louis is beautiful and often surprising; it's not every day that one discovers a sweet, sensitive vampire. Sometimes his intense emotions reminded me of John Lang from &quot;Islandia&quot; ...but that's another story.Several readers complained about the &quot;needless homoerotic imagery&quot; in this tale. This is the first time I've ever encountered the term, but I'm pretty sure I know what it means. Being a big fan of the homosexual arch-villians Kunzite and Zoisite in &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; (an anime cartoon, in case you're wondering), I don't have a problem with that sort of thing, but I can understand how other readers would find it disturbing. My advice: don't worry about it. Sit back, read, and enjoy the rest of the story.Now you all know why, in art class, I made little clay statues of Claudia, Louis, and Lestat, and why, while hanging around at the Fish Market, I drew &quot;Vampire Comics&quot; on the back of the menu. &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; is right up on my shelf with all the other great classics like &quot;Islandia,&quot; &quot;Divine Comedy,&quot; and &quot;The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy.&quot; Quick... somebody ! find me a copy of &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot;! Hurry, I'm desperate! ^_^"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Interview With The Vampire is an incredibly fascinating story written from the vampire's point of view. Anne Rice's complexity in her description of the world through the vampire's eyes is complex, sensitve, and tantalizing. The reader is drawn into the dark and vulnerable world of Louis and his struggle with his vampire nature as his human nature creates a push and pull tension on his emotions. Lestat and Claudia, the other characters, are also given a uniqueness all their own as Anne Rice paints the picture of the vampire nature as incredibly complex and sensitive as the human nature is."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"On the first time I read this book, I allmost dropped my eyes off! How can someone write something so beautiful, interesting, and wonderful like &quot;Interview&quot;? The book is a perfect way of telling about something that doesn't excist, or does it..? You can feel the excitement, hate, and love between the persons just like you would of been there yourself! I could almost see the Vampires, Louis, Claudia, Lestat, and the others in my mind! Louis\`s sarcasm does really bite! After reading this book, the way I watched the world just changed totally! It was the first time I really felt like a part of the food chain!!! (I\`m sorry about the mistakes in my English grammar...)"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This original tale of death, and more so, life, is a unforgetable. Truly, in all that is that word. This book is my favourite, and will remain so, always, though I have read many others written by Anne Rice. The characters in this novel are glorious, beautiful, stunning creatures. There exist not enough adjectives to display a portion of their glory. Louie de Pointe du Lac, the narrator of the book, is a tender, gentle thing, more human than those I know, aside from his sharp teeth and immortal body. Lestat is not as heroic in this first book as the next, hence the name The Vampire Lestat, and Mrs. Rice's many others. Though he is not portrayed as the dazzling thing he is, one can still recongnise his importance. Read any other book by Mrs. Rice, and you will see the great being he is. And together these two characters make another, my ultamite amour, Claudia. She is given the &quot;dark gift&quot; when she is five, and as vampires do not age, she never grows up, no matter how many years she spends on earth. She is the model of Anne's deceased daughter, and a gorgeous being. The other characters, such as Santiage &amp; Armand, are dear but not as central. To learn more of Armand, you can purchase the new vampire chronicles novel Anne has coming out soon, but is not yet released, The Vampire Armand. *s* But as I should not carry on, I will leave you with the suggestion that, if this book does not have it's place in your home, you are empty and alone. Purchase it as fast as you can and, you will have little difficulty devouring it as I always do.Ms. Lauren Smith"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Interview with the Vampire is a captivating, dark tale that entertains to the end. It was the first book in the Vampire Chronicles series. Much of what makes the book great is Anne Rice's writing. Her use of historically accurate settings, such as nineteenth century Paris, bring the story to life. Her colorful descriptions lit up the pages, bringing visions of night-killers to mind. The dynamic characters dramatically enhanced the novel, as Louis' constant struggle with his mortal conscience personalized the plot. Interview with the Vampire by Anne Rice is the vivid account of a vampire's first confession to motals of his existence. Its complexities keep readers spellbound, and the plot leaves little to be desired."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"&quot;Interview&quot; will put you through serious mental acrobatics if you let it. What is morality? Is there a fixed moral code? Were the vampires human enough to be subject to humanity and therefore certain standards? What makes us human? Also, it's a damn good read, although Anne Rice does tend to run on. There is some seriously beautiful/repulsive imagery. I loved this novel for the way it presented such great &quot;life on the other side&quot; questions about being human in such a user-friendly package."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Say goodbye to mindless terror. Now hear the vampire's side of the story! &quot;Interview...&quot; is genius! Rice's descriptions of New Orleans and Europe are, as always, beautiful! You will fall in love with Louis, and his story will break your heart. This book is definitely not for the weak of spirit. And even if you're the least bit emotional, you may find yourself wiping away tears."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Ok, so much has been said already that I can't really add to it. Only so much: I loved it, was drawn into it right away. But at the same time I understand those who don't like. It is not a traditional vampire story, but why should it be? I have read enough of those! And to the people who said the characters are too complicated and not &quot;real&quot;, I totally disagree.... That is the thing that I love best about...I wish AR would have Louis speak to us again, even though Lestat's adventures were awesome, but still Louis is my favorite! Bring him back!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"As a one time resident of the Rue Royale in the French Quarter of New Orleans, I was taken aback at how I felt transported back to a New Orleans that is both timeless and everchanging....just like Lestat. For those who do not truly know what it is to live in the French Quarter can only imagine it is the perfect setting. The characters of today are not much different than those explored in Ms. Rice's book. As I read the book I could smell the quarter ( you must have visited to understand this.) Each event captivated me. I knew that it could actually happen any night in New Orleans...after dark...and if you know where to look... If not, pick up this book and take a trip back in time, and just around the corner."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This book is okay. The thing that redeems it is that Anne Rice thought of a topic that hadn't really been explored as of the writing of this book. The dialogue and banal philosophizing are boring and insipid, but Claudia was entertaining... The book should really be about Claudia.. Let's dump Louie and his constant whining."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Interview with the Vampire is an modern classic. It incorporates the vital elements for a well written fiction novel: suspense, action, unusual love triangles, and most importantly, a wonderfully thought out and written plot. Anne Rice makes even the immortal seem lovable and the reader develops a bond with the characters, from the mortal loving Louis, his ill-fated &quot;blood&quot; daughter Claudia, to the unpredictable character of Lestalt. This book leads the reader through a page turning tale that leaves them wanting more. The setting, the highly mysterious, passionate, and voodoo infested 1700 New Orleans, wets the readers hungery appitite for the story of Louis, his mortal death and early ecounters with his &quot;blood&quot; relatives of the undead."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I am not a vampire nor do I claim to be one. This book makes you feel like louis is your friend. You feel drawn toward Claudia as louis was. When you put the book down you can't help but think about your friends and their great dilemas. This is a book for anyone who has ever wished to feel trully alive."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"This book forces one to realize the profundity of existence and the awesome power of love -- or some facsimile thereof -- in the face of death -- constant death. In addition to being darkly and beautifully descriptive, Interview is a great read that will challenge some to question vampires' existence along with their own."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I read Interview about 13 years ago when almost no one had heard of Anne. The idea was unique, the story development compelling, and character development brillant. If you can ignore the build-up around the vampire series and especially the movie, and imagine the characters and settings independent of the hype than this book is simply brillant."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"What can I say? Anne Rice captures your heart. She makes everything seem realistic and altogether too human that you feel like this could really be happening in the world we live in today. Everything about the characters have a sort of... well, complicated inner soul going for them. But I guess if you are THAT old, you must be complicated by then. While going through my mother's bookshelf, I ventured across this book, and I saw the title. I had heard of the movie, so I decided to check out the book. So I read it, and I loved it! So, I continued and read all of the series. Trust me, if you like drama and intense scenes and a touch of romance, this book has it all!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I thought the book was very good, not to mention interesting. I have read many vampire books in my life and find this one of the best. Who else but Anne Rice would have come up with a book with a book like this. The whole series has vampires as something other than bloodthirsty animals."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I loved this book. It is so well written, Anne Rice is exceptional when it comes to painting pictures in the reader's minds. The characters are so real, you feel you've known them all your life. Must read!!!"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Anne Rice introduces a whole new way to look at the vampires. She makes you love them, feel sorry for them, and surrunder your soul to them. It is by far the best book ever written about vampires. Her errotic writting makes you want to give your blood to Luis or Lestat so you would feel the extacy."},{"Title":"Bartleby of the Mighty Mississippi","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book because it was funny and had lots of rhymes. The characters were interesting and it was amazing to see a turtle survive when he had been living as a pet and travels with an alligator. The descriptions of the places Bartleby sees is very imaginative . I especially enjoyed the part when he was trying to save the duck eggs and when they hatched they thought Bartleby was a duck also. I was glad that it ended happy but it leaves you wondering about the rest of the journey. Perhaps there can be a sequel here?"},{"Title":"Bartleby of the Mighty Mississippi","review":"Bartleby of the Mighty Mississippi was a great book. The characters such as Mother Wak and Bartleby were perfect for the mood of the story and were well described. It was exciting from start to finish and is a great story for anyone of any age. The characters ranges from extremly funny (like the peeper Zip who alway speaks in ryhme) to really creapy (like the alagator Seezer), and at times and Bartleby's wit and quick thinking save him or his friends. I loved it! I have read almost all of Phyllis Shalant's books and this one by far is the best. For those who have read the other books by her this one is a must anf for those who are new to the author will love to start with the one. The suspense can almost kill you sometimes and force you to keep on turing page after page. You'll never want to put this book down!

Ademas, el descenlace de sus novelas es excepcional, y El Sastre de Panama no es la excepcion.Esta novela se basa en hechos historicos de un pais atropellado por la oligarquia, politicas foraneas y los militares. Le Carre se vale de estas realidades para que su caracter principal parezca que tiene mucha influencia en el medio, la sociedad y las influencias extranjeras, como los USA.El Sastre de Panama es una novela muy bien escrita, en una nueva linea de espionaje post-guerra fria, donde los intereses y politica de las potencias son totalmente diferentes.

Porritt is aware that conventional environmental activists, greens and political academics favor socialism more than capitalism. However, he takes them to task for ignoring the power and potential of such capitalist mechanisms as markets and property rights and for their navet&eacute; in expecting voters or political leaders to embrace their dismal vision of environmental responsibility as asceticism. We find his book more suggestive than programmatic. It meanders like a river and is sometimes directionless. The author makes his passions apparent, including anti-Americanism and scathing criticism of certain forms of Christianity. Though Porritt does not offer a detailed description of his vision or the practical steps needed to realize it, he does suggest a path toward a utopian ideal; for that hope, he deserves appropriate attention."},{"Title":"Capitalism As If the World Matters","review":"Jonathan Porritt's CAPITALISM AS IF THE WORLD MATTERS provides college-level readers with a fine survey of how capitalism at its foundations may be a part of the environmental problem as a whole. Many time commercial activities themselves lend to eroding environments: it's up to both business and government to work hand in hand to build a form of capitalism and free market solutions which lend towards sustainability rather than away from it - and to consider the chapters in CAPITALISM AS IF THE WORLD MATTERS, which offers commentary and guideposts for building different capital resources."},{"Title":"Capitalism As If the World Matters","review":"The spirit is there along with a sound message and an abundance of info.

KISS = Keep It Short and Simple!!"},{"Title":"Capitalism As If the World Matters","review":"The author goes to great lengths to demonstrate that, when natural capital is included in the calculation, capitalism can be made docile. Capitalists are disinclined to follow this more ethical course without guns pressed to their temples, however. Corporations are mandated by Supreme Court decisions to put return on investment before any other consideration, meaning they are prohibited from acting ethically if profits might be compromised. This sociopathic perspective means corporations must \\"externalize\\" whatever costs they can, environmental costs being the easiest. \\"Free market democracy\\" (as used by neocons) means we must eat the soot and drink the effluent of industry."},{"Title":"Commander Toad and the Planet of the Grapes","review":"Looking for a new planet to picnic on, Commander Toad and the crew of STAR WARTS descend to the planet and immediately discover that everywhere they step giant purple grapes sprout up. In no time at all, Commander Toad, Doc Peeper, Lieutenant Lily, and Mr. Hop are swallowed up by the giant purple grapes and are telling some of the worst grape jokes in the universe! And it looks like there's no way out!Jane Yolen is an award-winning children's book author as well as a writer of adult science fiction and fantasy. She's earned the Caldecott-given for the most distinguished picture book, the Nebula-given to the most distinguished writing in the field of science fiction and fantasy, the Golden Kite-given by the Society of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators, and the World Fantasy Award. She's written seven Commander Toad Adventures, including COMMANDER TOAD AND THE LONG VOYAGE HOME, COMMANDER TOAD AND THE PLANET OF THE GRAPES, COMMANDER TOAD AND THE SPACE PIRATES, and COMMANDER TOAD AND THE BIG BLACK HOLE. With dozens of books written in many genres, Jane Yolen is a great author to introduce to young readers.COMMANDER TOAD AND THE PLANET OF THE GRAPES is an absolute blast to read out loud to young readers or pre-readers. The short, descriptive sentences push the story along at a frantic and fun pace, and the color and black and white illustrations are great fun for a young audience.With all the interest young kids today have in space-based programs on Cartoon Network, books like the Commander Toad series will bridge the gap between movies, video games, and the written word. Jane Yolen is an exemplary entertainer for young readers and parents willing to endorse the habit of reading."},{"Title":"Commander Toad and the Planet of the Grapes","review":"This is another silly outer-space book in the Commander Toad series, which my sons, ages 4 and 8, thoroughly ENJOY.

It is Lieutenant Lily's sneezes which give him the clue. He was about to inject her with antihistamine, which is the reason for the syringe.Complicated plot, lots of funny stuff. These books are enjoyable to both kids and adults."},{"Title":"Programming on Purpose: Essays on Software Design","review":"Few books I review get 5 stars. This is one of them. Programming on Purpose is a collection of essays originally written for Computer Language magazine. Although the original publication of this collection was in 1993, the materials in the book date back considerably further. Are Plauger's observations and nuggets of advice still relevant? Absolutely.When you read modern classics like Design Patterns (Gamma, et. al.) you might mistakenly think that such works are revolutionary instead of evolutionary. Going back and reviewing books like this should correct any such misconception. Here's an example:In his discussion &quot;order out of chaos&quot;, Plauger writes &quot;When you encounter a situation where data is presented in chaotic order, but must be processed in some definable order, you have a sorting problem. Forget about data structures or structured programming for the time being. Instead, cast the problem in a form that can be handled by known sorting technology, then apply it.&quot;In short, Plauger urges you to &quot;see the patterns&quot; in the problem. If books that purport to teach design patterns were so pragmatic and clear they might be more successful! Plauger has many such clear, lucid thoughts, elegantly expressed. Here's another:&quot;My major concern here is the Principle of One Right Place--there should be One Right Place to look for any nontrivial piece of code, and One Right Place to make a likely maintenance change.&quot; Of course. Good OO design, indeed any good system design, should support this notion. Yet, how many systems and their designers do not?UML design tools and other wizard-like code generators may produce the superstructure of our programs (under our design and direction, of course), but what goes between those curly braces often, if not always, dictates the final quality of our work. Plauger provides powerful insight into our craft that shouldn't be missed by anyone who codes for quality."},{"Title":"Programming on Purpose: Essays on Software Design","review":"Definitely a must have. One thing to keep in mind while reading this book is that it is a collection of essays taken from Plauger's column in Computer Language. Mr. (or should I say Dr since he has his PhD) has an easy and enjoyable reading style. The book's main thrust is collection of design methods each with a specific purpose. These design methods are used at various stages of developement on specific type of problems typically faced by programmers. Thankfully, P.J. also provides an overview chapter of when these various design methods must be used as well as their strengths and weaknesses.This is not an OO methods book. Although P.J. does mention OOP, he is not focused on this subject. However, he does remind us that abstraction, encapsulation, and inheritance existed long before OOT. While this is rather obvious, it is something many of us need reminding. This book convinced me that understanding pre-OOT design methods (i.e. structured analysis, data-structured design) would enable me to better apply OOT.Although Plauger mentions near the end of the book that he is not a text book writer, I sure wish he would reconsider turning this material into a textbook. The essays are really good, but some lack enough detail to be applied strictly from the knowledge imparted in the essay. Plauger also cheerfully reminds us that there is no one-size-fits-all method to solving a problem and that sometimes experience might lead us to do things we previously thought we shouldn't. In the end, software development is still as much an art as it is anything else. Thanks Mr. Plauger for an excellent read."},{"Title":"Programming on Purpose: Essays on Software Design","review":"Maybe because, unlike Plauger, most authors tend to advocate for their particular methodologies and do not really teach how to make the best use of the available design techniques. (Well, maybe it is just that way and it will never become easier. That's part of its charm.)There are no silver bullets (that is, no \\"one-size-fits-all\\" method) and \\"we often cannot articulate why we do what we do when we do it.\\" Plauger tries to address this problem not by proposing yet another silver bullet, but discussing useful design principles.Despite some dated examples, Plauger's observations and advice are still relevant. You will find interesting essays on stepwise refinement, the use of grammars to parse input data, and structured design techniques.If you think these are not \\"hot topics\\" today, pick this book just to enjoy yourself reading about \\"software design heresies\\" (apparently counterintuitive ideas), the authors' curious approach to teaching, or his peculiar comments trying to demystify [and even debunk the hype behind] object-oriented programming (written at a time when object-orientation was something completely new for the standard software developer.)I'm sure you will not regret the time you spend reading this book."},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Stored Procedures, XML, and HTML","review":"This book is simply fantastic. The writing is tight, but engaging -- lean, but mean. From the first page to the last, Henderson doesn't waste a word, yet I found myself not able to put the book down. That's really rare for a technical book. Henderson has a direct, friendly style that is, unfortunately, rare in computer books. He's a writer's writer -- I think he would be successful in any genre. I can definitely see why the book is selling so well (it was the #1 bestselling \\"SQL Server\\" book here on Amazon when I searched a few minutes ago).My favorite parts are:* The database design chapter. This was a hidden gem that I didn't expect to find in a programming book. It encapsulates all one needs to know to design robust databases on SQL Server.* The version control (Visual SourceSafe) integration chapter. Goes along nicely with the theme of treating T-SQL like a real language.* The Design Patterns chapter. As far as I know, this is the first published discussion of formal Design Patterns for the T-SQL language. Again, it goes nicely with Henderson's point that T-SQL is a real programming language.* The UDF chapter. Many of these are so unique and such high quality that I'd bet they have commercial value apart from the book. Take the Median() function, for example. Henderson shows how to write your own aggregate functions and provides Median() as a very useful example.* The SQLXML section. This set of chapters is by far the best expository reference on the SQLXML technologies I've seen. From the introduction to XML itself to advanced features such as SQLXMLBulkLoad, I found this section extremely compelling and useful.* The .NET introduction. If you didn't have a good reason to dive into this technology, you certainly will after you read this.* The Xprocs chapter. I always wondered how to write these. Now I know. The chapter takes you from ground zero through building several very useful xprocs of your own. Xp_setpriority is a real gem.* The programming philosophy essay chapters. These give weight to the book and finish off the book's overriding theme -- that T-SQL is a real language that you must approach professionally just like any other language if you want to be truly skilled in it -- very nicely. This is the first \\"cerebral\\" treatment of software engineering I've seen in a SQL Server book.By my count, Henderson converses in at least 7 difference programming languages in this book (VB Script, C/C++, T-SQL, C#, VB.NET, XML, and Delphi) which, frankly, is amazing. That anyone could know this many languages at this level is simply mind-blowing. It certainly reinforces his status as a guru. If you want to learn from the master himself, get this book and study from cover to cover."},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Stored Procedures, XML, and HTML","review":"The XML information is out of date and disappointingly brief, so I returned this item. For example, I'd like to see more in-depth coverage and examples of XML mapping files, updategrams, and the XML bulk loader.The information about stored procedures, however, is more detailed than any other book I have read. If you want an in-depth stored procedure book, this is the one.Ken's writing is very easy to understand."},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Stored Procedures, XML, and HTML","review":"This book took me from being someone who couldn't even spell XML to a guy who has just finished his third major SQLXML application. I'm not an expert yet, but the author of this book is, and if you work with SQLXML, you owe it to yourself to read this book.Ironically I was originally recommended this book based on it's stored proc content. That was also excellent, but the real prize here are the chapters on SQLXML.The first chapter, the XML introduction chapter, is simply genius. The example start off easy and build on each other. By the time I finished this chapter, I was creating complex documents and using style sheets and schemas to manipulate them.The SQLXML chapters take each of the Sql Server SQLXML topics and explore them in depth. The templates coverage is particularly excellent. I loved the discussion of how templates make use of RPC - something I'd never have guessed but that makes a huge performance difference in one of my systems.The section on working around SQLXML limitations is also excellent. sp_run_xml_proc is literally worth the price of the book all by itself. I was really disappointed when I found that I couldn't insert the results of a FOR XML query directly into a variable or table. With this proc, I can."},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Stored Procedures, XML, and HTML","review":"After reading the first book (The Guru's Guide to Transact-SQL), I was anxious to pick up a copy of this book. Realizing that the first book was a masterpiece, I picked up this book expecting a good book, but nothing that special. In all honesty I didn't believe this book would be able to compare to the first one. After all, how could one follow up a book like that. I was wrong! This book was just as good as the first one, and made me realize that there are writers out there who are as passionate about writing tech books as I am about software engineering. After reading this book I contacted the author via e-mail, not about a programming issue, but about a work environment issue. He was gracious enough to take the time to respond. I will be purchasing the next book that Ken writes. If you wish to improve your knowledge I would recommend this book as well as the first one."},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Stored Procedures, XML, and HTML","review":"I liked the book because it is so well-written and so comprehensive. It is rare that you find a book that is a good read and still loaded with technical How-To. How do I know the book is well-written... I know because I find myself having trouble putting it down. I enjoy just reading it.The forward says it all. I too wish this book had existed about ten years ago. I could have really used it. I too think it reads like an experienced developer sharing his experiences. These are words of wisdom from someone who has been there.This is a great book. If you work with Sql Server you will learn something useful from this book. You will probably also find some scripts or procedures that you can use in your own work."},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Stored Procedures, XML, and HTML","review":"It was an ill-portent when the book opened with a quote on Occam's Razor - and it was misspelled. The author properly posits that good documentation is a requisite for good code yet populates the text with code samples that are repetitious and frequently too lengthy but seldom is suitably documented.The foreward indicates that this book is not for the novice. It expects an audience familiar with SQL, SQL Server, Transact-SQL, and the basics of HTML, whom it will then guide in the proper implementation of these concepts as Stored Procedures within queries as well as calls from within HTML and XML. However, it is inconsistent in it's treatment of SQL; sometimes it explains what should be obvious (to the professional) and at other times it plops in code that is non-standard or obscure without properly referencing it in the text. This defficiency of depth renders it of little use as a reference book.The natural progression from one concept to the next is scarce. Topics seem to arrive in quanta rather than through evolution. This leaves gaps that need filling as well as information accreted in unnatural blocks. It may be an inorganic subject but the objects - aspiring programmers - are organic. As for the code, much of it seems to be the product of a struggle with the concepts of logic and economicy of code. This indiscriminate seeding of the text combined with code that lacks proper documentation as well as good structure (within the context of the paradigm) makes it difficult to properly classify as a programming guide.So, it does not function well as a guidebook or as reference material. It does not appear to stem from a lack of understanding of the subject by Mr. Henderson. It seems that his capabilities with the code exceed his ability to communicate the concepts. A good argument could be made that the book suffers from editorial absence; some other editor may have been a better guide for the guru. Or, perhaps Mr. Henderson could use the help of a ghost writer, as so many tecnical professionals often lack the skill of vivid description. Either way, he seems much more suited to 'Guru' (existentially) than 'Guide' (expository)."},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Stored Procedures, XML, and HTML","review":"The Guru Guide books are the best books available for SQL SERVER.

There is always more there than you glean the first time. I am still reading the first one nearly four years after I originally bought it. I never cease to find some new nuggest when I research a solution to my latest SQL SERVER challenge.I also like the non-technical writing in each book. The personal anecdotes, the essays, the quotes at the head of each chapter: they all give you the impression that you are being taught by, as Ron Soukup says, a veteran developer who knows what he is talking about because he has lived it"},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Stored Procedures, XML, and HTML","review":"A better title for this book would be &quot;Stored Procedures for Experts.&quot; It is that good. If you are already an expert and want to take your game to the next level or want to become a stored proc expert, you need this book.Each chapter gets progressively more complex and in-depth. Henderson starts off with a primer on stored proc development, then gradually raises the bar until you are up in the clouds.The best chapters are the xprocs chapter and the design patterns chapter. Each of these is with the price of the book alone.I also loved the essays at the end of the book, especially the one on the necessity of testing. Henderson writes in a fluid, even style that I think most will find quite engaging."},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Stored Procedures, XML, and HTML","review":"I have purchased every major Sql Server book over the last seven years. I have them all. I have read about Sql Server voraciously since getting out of school, and there can be only one word to describe Henderson's Guru's Guide books: indespensible. They are head and shoulders above all of the other books out there.The reasons for this are many. I will list but a few:- Extremely well-written. Henderson has a penchant for explaining subjects in ways that no one else seems to be able to. Passages sometimes require more than one read because they are so deep, but the time is always well spent.- Loaded, absolutely loaded, with code. If you manage Sql Server machines for a living you will find that you can drop much of the code into place on your production machines without modificaton. Sp_find_root_blocker, sp_diffdb, sp_generate_script... these are all wonderful pieces of code that make the books worth the price for the code alone.- Extremely deep. One subject after another is covered in excruciating detail. Henderson's books are deeper and more extensive than any other class of technical books I have read.- Wide-ranging. Henderson doesn't stick to just a narrow part of the product, but covers subjects that real DBA's and developers would need: Full-text search, DTS, replication, query performance optimation, XML, etc. If you get and read all three of the Guru's Guide books, you will have as good of coverage of the entire product as exists.There are few authors who are as passionate about great technical writing as we DBA's and developers are about building and maintaining software systems. Ken Henderson is obviously one of them."},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Stored Procedures, XML, and HTML","review":"I bought Ken Henderson's Guru's Guide to T-SQL a few years back and was extremely impressed with it. It was a \\"How-to-do-it\\" book with a 1001 good practical ideas that the hard-working database programmer could use immediately.I bought this book because I am now working more with the topics that are supposed to be covered by this book, Stored Procedures, XLM, and HTML. I was impressed with how his first book had quickly and easily improved my skills and was interested in seeing what he could do for me in the new arena. Unfortunately it didn't work out.In spite of the titles, the two books are barely related to each other. This book is a \\"why-you-do-it-this-way\\" book with a lot of philosophy and best-practice stuff and relatively few of the tips and tricks that I valued so highly in the first book. Unfortunately this information isn't that valuable now because the state of the art has kept changing and much of what he discusses either isn't relevant anymore or is now blindingly obvious.But the problem with the book goes deeper than that. The extraordinary value of the first book was that it hit to Ken Henderson's strengths; very clear writing about very small topics with obvious and immediate payback for the reader. This book unfortunately tends to emphasize his weaknesses; poor organization, wandering off topic, and frequently saying too much that adds very little.That's not to say that there aren't good reasons to buy this book, he's still a good clear author and there aren't enough of them in the technical writing field today. I particularly valued the essays at the end of the book and there are lots of valuable little nuggets that can be found throughout the entire book, just don't buy this book with the expectation that it will be the motherlode that his first book was."},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Stored Procedures, XML, and HTML","review":"The CD is loaded with over 600 samples of well-written, well-documented code.Innovative approaches and advanced techniques are everywhere. You combine this with the thorough explanations of the code in the text itself, and you have everything you need to master stored proc programming.I've been building Sql Svr stored procs for over 5 years now and I still learned lots of things I didn't know. Great code and clear explanations makes for one heckuva book"},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Stored Procedures, XML, and HTML","review":"This book is just what a programmer would want. No fluff, just the deep technical stuff. I loved the coverage of design patterns, the chapter on version control and source code management with tsql and query analyzer. The essays at the end of the book are the best I've seen in a technical book. Henderson should look into doing a novel. Bottom line - great technical info and great writing = a book that's hard to beat."},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Stored Procedures, XML, and HTML","review":"I have several of Henderson's other books but this is by far the best. He has finally found his voice. Instead of the stilted, techno-babble most technical books serve up, Henderson's prose flows like a country river. It educates and inspires without putting you to sleep. This book shows that Henderson is a great writer in his own right and that he knows now to tell a story.The thing that's truly amazing about the book is that Henderson manages to stretch a bit as a writer while still delivering a motherloade of technical content. There are over 700 code samples on the CD! That's the most I've ever seen in a technical book, even the boring cookbooks!Henderson began writing for himself more with the first Guru's Guide book and this one continues in that fine tradition. I thought the first GG book was witty and well-written, but this one is even better. Thank you, Ken, for writing such a masterpiece. You are an inspiration to us all.Char Baxter"},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Stored Procedures, XML, and HTML","review":"I was a total beginner when I started with this book. Now I feel very comfortable with SQL Server and stored procedure programming. The expert advise and gobs of code are very much appreciated. This book is like no other that I've found."},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Stored Procedures, XML, and HTML","review":"Henderson is a modern-day polymath -- a person who's mastered many subjects. When you run into someone who purports to know something about a lot of different topics, usually they don't have much depth, the classic &quot;jack of all trades and master of none.&quot; That's obviously not the case with this author. This book covers one topic after another in astonishing detail. The version control chapter is a must-read even for non-SQL Server people. Programmers in general should read it. Ditto for the design patterns chapter -- it's great stuff. The xprocs chapter, the database design chapter -- each of these is a distinctly different area within SQL Server and database technology. Not just any author could have pulled this off with such depth.My favorite example of this is the coverage of .NET. No one but a programmer who'd been there and back could have explained all the reasons we need the .NET Framework. No one except a programmer who'd built complex applications the &quot;hard&quot; way would be able to set the stage for the .NET Framework being embedded in SQL Server the way Henderson has. You get the sense that you're talking to THE MAN insofar as what the Framework will do for software deveopment. It's unusual to find this kind of insight anywhere, let alone in a database book.Henderson is my new all-time favorite technical author. I have his other T-SQL book and one of his C++ books. He's the best of the best."},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Stored Procedures, XML, and HTML","review":"What I like the most about this book is that it goes beyond the cookbook genre and gets into the &quot;why&quot; behind tsql programming. Sure, there's still reams of code as in Henderson's first book (The Guru's Guide to Transact-SQL), but there's more emphasis on the philosophy behind the language and overall design considerations. The 700+ samples don't keep Henderson from sharing some of his hard-won experience with the language as an expert developer, and I find that quite valuable."},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Stored Procedures, XML, and HTML","review":"This book takes a refreshing look at SQLXML and how to use it to build technology solutions. It treats it like the component of SQL Server that it is. Instead of getting someone who knows XML but only kind of knows SQL Server (like most SQLXML books), you get a SQL Server expert who also knows XML at an expert level with this book. You get someone who's used the stuff in production and knows what works, what doesn't work, and where the bodies are buried. If you want sage advice, instruction, and technical details on how to deploy this exciting technology in enterprise-class solutions, look no further."},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Stored Procedures, XML, and HTML","review":"I have carried the first &quot;Guru's Guide&quot; with me in my backpack for over two years to numerous DBA assignments, and this one is right there with it. This is a great book - simply fantastic.Aside from the great technical information, Ken included several chapters on his philosophy of the art of programming, opinions and viewpoints on .NET, XML, suitable environments in which to work, and great stories of life as a programmer/writer/thinker. Very thought provoking, Ken has become one of those that I look up to and have great admiration for. I was lucky enough to hear him speak at a local SQL Server group in Dallas last year - if you get a chance to see him, go. Mr Henderson, I promise not to send you too many emails going forward. Thanks."},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Stored Procedures, XML, and HTML","review":"An awesome book. Well written and easy to understand. If yuu only buy one book for SQL Server stored procedures, this should be the one!"},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Stored Procedures, XML, and HTML","review":"What is really great about this book is how it tackles SQLXML wholistically--it does not assume that you already know XML and starts from ground-zero. So there is a chapter on just XML itself--nothing Sql-specific. After that it gets into each of the SQLXML pieces one-by-one--you learn them by example and by writing XML docs and code--the very best way. The book also covers many other Sql bases such as writing stored procs and all that involves--so you get the full picture. I highly recommend you read this book if--like me--you create software for Sql 2000 for a living."},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Stored Procedures, XML, and HTML","review":"This is much awaited book for the ones who want to excel in xml, stored procedure. Ken describes excellently and has your total attention."},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Stored Procedures, XML, and HTML","review":"This book was all I could have asked for. I have been wanting to learn about XML in SQL Server for a long time. I read the Books Online, but just couldn't really get it. I mean I could write the code and I could play with OPENXML, but I didn't really *understand* what I was doing. This book changed all that. Now it all makes sense. Unlike a lot of other books, it doesn't repeat the online docs. It starts where the Books Online ends. And the sample code is really useful. The book says there are over 700 example files and I don't doubt it! The sheer number and the quality of the samples makes the book worth the price all by itself."},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Stored Procedures, XML, and HTML","review":"There are very few computer books that will change you life like this one. If you program in Transact-SQL (and probably even if you don't) this book will change the way you think about creating software. Written by a guru who's obviously spent many years in the trenches, this book is a must-have for anyone serious about mastering SQL Server stored procedure programming, SQLXML, and HTML as it's implemented by SQL Server.There is no stone left unturned here. The book covers everything from stored procedure basics, to the nitty-gritty details of building extended procedures, to COM, .NET, and XML. I can't say enough about what a great book it is. It's my new favorite computer tome."},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Stored Procedures, XML, and HTML","review":"When I ordered this one, I didn't know what to expect in terms of SQLXML coverage. I mean, for all I knew there might just be enough about SQLXML in the book to help sell the book. Fortunately, that wasn't the case. This is the best, most thorough coverage of SQLXML I've seen. It even covers Web Release 1 (which was apparently still being beta tested when it was written).The SQLXML chapters start with an intro to XML itself and a tour through all its basic syntax. I've never seen a better, more concise, easier to read &quot;getting started&quot; tutorial on XML. It's better than that found in many books dedicated to XML. I felt right at home in the language in just a few minutes.Next, the book tours OPENXML(), URL queries, updategrams, XML bulk load, FOR XML, and the various other elements of SQLXML separately. The examples are thorough and well thought out. If you can read, you can follow this material. And when you get done, you'll know a heck of a lot more about SQLXML than when you started.I was concerned that a book that also covered stored procedures and HTML might slight on the XML coverage, but the opposite is true. The coverage of the other topics in the book provides a solid foundation for the SQLXML. It all inter-relates.This is one fine piece of work. Henderson has done it again. Buy this book if you want to know SQLXML like the gurus do."},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Stored Procedures, XML, and HTML","review":"I found a kindred spirit when I read this book. It approached T-SQL as a professional developer would, just as I always have. The book steers people away from amateurish practices like dropping in the latest coding trick you've read about in a magazine and instead teaches an engineering-based approach to developing and maintaining Sql Server applications. Examples of this run throughout the book:1. The Testing chapter - every type of testing is discussed, including enlightening discussions of refactoring existing code (ala Martin Fowler), Xtreme Programming (ala Kent Beck), unit testing, functional testing, and the entire test cycle. This is a great chapter that everyone creating or maintaining Sql Server-based systems should read and follow.2. The Design Patterns chapter - this chapter shows how to apply software design patterns to stored procedure and T-SQL script development in the same way that Erich Gamma and company have been doing for years with other languages. A novel and invaluable way of looking at the problem of design in Sql Server applications.3. The Data Volumes chapter - the one covers how to create large volumes of data for testing your applications and how to best deal with moving large volumes of data around in real applications. The data doubling technique alone is worth the price of admission.4. The Extended Procedures chapter - no other book that I know of covers how to write these. Until we get CLR-based procedures, these are the only way to solve certain types of problems. Bravo to Henderson for including a chapter that teaches how to build them from soup-to-nuts.5. The Views chapter - this chapter has proven invaluable to me, especially the section on partioned views and the many problems you can run into if they're not set up right or are misused.6. The Triggers chapter - I wondered how an entire chapter could be dedicated to triggers, but, having read it, I understand why it is. This is another one that every DBA or Sql Server developer should read.7. The Undocumented T-SQL chapter - this chapter catalogues literally hundreds of undocumented features in Sql Server that I would not have known about without having read it. Many are quite useful in the real world and you have to wonder why they aren't documented. Henderson says you shouldn't use them, and I'm being very cautious, but just knowing about them helps me better understand how Sql Server works.I can't give this book a higher recommendation. It will literally change the way you think about designing Sql Server applications and solving the tough problems that arise when you build complex systems."},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Stored Procedures, XML, and HTML","review":"The basic message of this book is one we would all do well to learn: that t-sql is a real language and you have to work at like any other language to be good at it.The book is a great mix of expert instruction and great code that you can put to use. For example, the xp_exec xproc lets you run any code you want from a user-defined function (UDF). That is huge. At the same time, the chapter on query performance is a great tour through the internals of the query processor. The chapters on sql-xml are a great combination of the two - thorough instruction and great code samples. This is a theme you will find throughout the book.I liked the essays at the end of the book, too. Particularly the one on the need for testing was great. The mixing of personal experiences with technical info was done just right.You get a very thorough book and one that is chalk-full of innovative code. It would be a bargain at ten times the price.Jim F."},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Stored Procedures, XML, and HTML","review":"The chapter on arrays in this book saved my life. They literally gave me a whole new way of solving certain kinds of problems. fn_createarray? fn_setarray? Way, way cool. The extended procedures in this book alone are worth the cost. xp_setpriority is ingeniously clever. And so are many, many others. sp_generate_script and many others deserve a place in your code library. If you are looking for a treasure chest of great code and examples you needn't look any further - this is your book."},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Stored Procedures, XML, and HTML","review":"This book would be fantastic if I would still run an older release of the SQL server ... and the stored procedures part is still very relevant. The XML and HTML parts (where I've expected most) unfortunately do not cover the new abilities of the SQL Server 2005, so I guess we just have to wait for a new release of this book."},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Stored Procedures, XML, and HTML","review":"In addition to the topics mentioned in the title, this book is the ultimate Extended Procedure reference. It shows you how to write them, how to utilize them in your own code, how to debug them, and how to make them handier to use.For example, there's a chapter showing how to build your own Extended Procedures from A-Z. It takes you through building several useful EPs. Want to know how to take control of SQL Server execution threads so that you can speed up your code? This book shows how to write an Extended Procedure that does just that.The book also shows you how to use EPs in user defined functions to basically do whatever you want. One of the example EPs is xp_exec which is basically an Extended Procedure version of EXEC(). Given that you can't call EXEC() from a user defined function this is really handy. You can execute any code you want.Another useful set of Extended Procedures the book shows you how to build has to do with arrays. Given that Transact-SQL doesn't have arrays, the book shows you how to build a set of Extended Procedures and user defined functions to add arrays to the language. You learn to build xp_createarray which is called by fn_createarray, xp_setarray which is call by fn_setarray, and so forth. Basically, you get arrays that look and feel like they're built into Transact-SQL by virtue of the ingenious use of Extended Procedures and user defined functions together to hide the details. They're speedy and handy to use.If you ever wanted to know how to build Extended Procedures, this is your book. In addition to all the other great info in the book, this alone makes it worth the price. In fact I would have paid twice what I did for it. Its that good."},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Stored Procedures, XML, and HTML","review":"Some might question whether they need a separate book on stored procedure coding. Trust me, you do.The book goes through one aspect after another of how to develop stored procedures for SQL Server. It differs from other books in that it treats T-SQL like a real language. It posits that you need to apply design patterns to you work, that you need to test it, and that it needs the same type of source code management as any other language.This book is different from other T-SQL and stored procedure books for this very reason. It approaches the language from the perspective of a professional developer. As Ron Soukup says in the forward this is a masterful guide written by a master coder.You can learn from this the same way I did. The writing is detailed, flows well, and extremely technical. Add to this the great SQL-XML info and HTML chapter and you have a book no SQL Server developer should be without."},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Stored Procedures, XML, and HTML","review":"This book is essential for those building solutions with Sql Svr. It is really a developer's take on how to create applications based on the world's best database.

I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Stored Procedures, XML, and HTML","review":"As an English major, I'm often very critical of the way in which technical books are written. Many times, the authors simply aren't very good writers. They may know their technical stuff, but they don't write very well. This book is a noteworthy exception. It is written in a clear, lucid style that flows naturally and keeps you engaged all along the way. Henderson actually makes stored procedure programming exciting and fun, which is no small feat considering the subject matter.I found that while the book isn't for dummies, it proceeds logically and systematically through the topics it broaches. I especially appreciated the discussion of design patterns. I don't know why someone didn't think of it before, but, in hindsight, applying common software design patterns to Transact-SQL makes perfect sense, and I commend Henderson for coming up with the idea and for his sagely advice on how to go about it.Also, the XML instruction is simply wonderful. From the XML language tutorial to all the SQL Server-specific information to the discussion of .NET, I found Henderson's teaching insightful and thorough. This section alone is worth the purchase price of the book.Lastly, I loved the essays. Showing that he is more than just a technical scribe, Henderson spreads his wings a bit and provides us some wonderful bits that would be at home in virtually any magazine, technical or not. As I said before, this author is also a writer in the true sense of the word. Very, very enjoyable book."},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Stored Procedures, XML, and HTML","review":"There is no better resource on the planet for learning stored procedure development in T-sql.

There's no fluff or other filler material. Instead, you just get the goods, and you get them by the boatload.My fav things about this one are:* Extended Proc coverage. I've always wondered how to build these. The coverage in this book is absolutely excellent. It could be a book unto itself.* XML coverage. I've never seen a better cut-to-the-chase introduction to XML and the XML features in SQL Server.

I had never heard this preached until I red this book, but am now a firm beleiver in it.I have Henderson's other book and this one is a nice follow-up. there is naturaly some overlap between this book and the TSql book but not much. this one gets into coding conventions and version control, extended procs, design patterns and of course SqlXml...things the first book doesn't talk about. I look at this book as the big brother to the first one. It's more serious and more for the professional developer as opposed to being more of a dictionary of solutions to difficult TSql problems.I also really liked the undocumented TSql chapter.

I am a developer who came to Sql Server late in life after a career writing COBOL, then DBase/Clipper, then FoxPro. I've watched the industry change, but have never really had the handle on all of it that this guy does. The book is ingenious. It takes Transact-Sql and gives it the hardcore language treatment. No one has ever done that before. I have all the other T-Sql books and, with the exception of Henderson's previous book, none come close to this one. You take Henderson's two Sql Server books and you have all you need to master Sql Server's programming language, Transact-Sql. Who talks about version control with Transact-Sql? Henderson does. Who gets into design patterns in stored procedures? Henderson does. Who discusses testing at length in an Sql book? Henderson does. Who shows how to add useful features to the language such as native array handling? Henderson does. Who would dare discuss how .NET relates to T-Sql development? Henderson does. Who talks about how eXtreme Programming applies to T-Sql developers? You know the answer. This is THE book to have if you want to master the T-Sql language."},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Stored Procedures, XML, and HTML","review":"This is the first SQL Server book that I can call a &quot;real&quot; programming book. It's not surprising that it comes from Addison-Wesley, the most prominent publisher of such books. In the spirit of Kernighan and Ritchie, Pike, Thomas and Hunt, Jon Bentley, and Erich Gamma, this is a thinker's Transact-SQL programming book.It begins with a wonderful overview of all that is worth knowing about stored procedure programming in Transact-SQL. This is the best &quot;in a nutshell&quot; discussion I've seen of stored procedure programming. It is better than most whole books dedicated to the subject.It moves on to coding conventions and source code management, two oft-neglected topics in the world of SQL Server. For some reason, most of us don't usually treat Transact-SQL as though it were true source code, but Henderson makes the compelling case that it is indeed, and he has convinced me.Next, is one of the crown jewels of the book: design patterns. For anyone who has read any of the patterns books out there (e.g., Erich Gamma, John V., etc.), this will seem like an epiphany. You'll go, &quot;Of course! Why didn't I think of that?!&quot;From here, we move on to database design. This is the best hands-on, practical guide to database design that I've ever seen. Henderson distills, in one chapter, all that you need to know to build complex business models, entity-relationship diagrams, and relational data models. What I like most about this is that Henderson doesn't start with physical modeling. He starts with the business processes the app that will use the database must encompass, then shows how to extrapolate business process flow charts, E-R diagrams, logical data models, and, finally physical data models. You start with nothing but an application concept and end up with a fully-functional SQL Server database. If you ever wanted to learn database modeling and design from the ground-up, this is your chance.Next, is the objects section. Here, individual chapters cover Views (normal, partitioned and indexed), UDFs (lots of great code here including how to create your own system and vector functions -- e.g., MEDIAN()), triggers (normal, instead of, auditing), and error handling. Transact-SQL error handling is an oft-misunderstood area of the language. Henderson shines a light on it and shares what the masters know.The SQLXML section is the second crown jewel of the book. When I saw that Henderson was covering SQLXML in his new book, I guess I should have guessed he would cut no corners, but, honestly, this section by itself is better than every other SQLXML book I've read. That's right - this one section of the book is better than other whole books dedicated to the subject. The introduction to XML is as good a synopsis of the language as you will find. The chapters covering the individual SQLXML features are also better than I've seen elsewhere. In true Henderson tradition, they are readable, in-depth, and thorougly engaging.The advanced section is exactly that: advanced. Want to learn about how SQL Server interfaces with COM? Look no further -- the chapter even includes a nice, concise introduction to COM itself for those new to it. Want to learn to build extended procs? Look no further. This chapter alone is worth the whole cost of the book. I guess I shouldn't be surprised by now, but it's as in-depth as they come. I'm not even a C++ coder, but I worked through the examples and successfully built my first extended proc.And I have to commend Henderson on the performance chapter. It's the best I've seen on the subject. It's far clearer and in-depth than what you find in Inside SQL Server 2000, for example.The arrays chapter is the third crown jewel of the book. The technique of using extended procs and UDFs to add array support to the T-SQL language is ingenius. I'll bet Henderson could sell this code commercially if he wanted.And the final crown jewel is the set of essays at the end of the book. What clear, lucid, lively, enjoyable prose. Henderson is one of the great technical writers of our generation. He spreads his wings a bit in these chapters and shows just what a great wordsmith he really is. Regardless of whether you're talking technical or nontechnical books, fiction or nonfiction, you will not find better writing than this. I think he should consider branching out into other kinds of writing because he obviously has the ability.In sum: this book elevates Transact-SQL to the plateau of &quot;real&quot; languages such as Java, Pascal, and C++. It is the first &quot;thinker's&quot; coding book I've seen for Transact-SQL stored procedure development and among the best programming books I've ever read. It is a worthy successor to &quot;The Guru's Guide to Transact-SQL.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Stored Procedures, XML, and HTML","review":"There is a lot to like in this book. The chapter on database design is fantastic. The chapter on views is excellent as well. But overall the book veering off topic now and again, which adds to it's girth (760 pages.)The book starts with a very solid introduction to stored procedures. As I say, the database design portion of the first part is probably worth the price of admission on it's own.Part two is titled objects, which is a little deceptive since the chapter mainly covers functions, triggers, stored procedures and other structural elements.Part three is where the book gets into XML and HTML. There is some introductory material on XML and XSL which is too brief to be a complete introduction for someone. That material is better presented in other books. But the material on XML queries direct to the SQL server is unique and valuable.Part four on advanced topics has some good chapters. In particular the section on query optimization is well done and serves as a good introduction to the topic. But this part is where the book veers off course and into topics like testing, refactoring, XP, and an introduction to the .NET framework and C#. It's all interesting, but it's covered better in other books and the book overall could be shorter and more focused were it not for these sections.Another downside is that Illustrations are a little underused. But the downsides aside, this is a great book, specifically for the first two parts including the excellent section on database design."},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Stored Procedures, XML, and HTML","review":"If you liked Henderson's first Guru's Guide book you will like this one as well. It has the same tone and same in depth coverage of useful topics.The Data Volumes chapter was a real pleasure to read. The data doubling trick was worth the cost of the book all by itself. We switched to using it in our test suites and they sped up by 50%!The chapter on Automation was also priceless. I love the sp_diffdb proc. I've needed to check two databases for schema differences many times over the years, but never had a tool for doing it. Now I get a free one with this book. That is some kind of value.I also loves the Guru's Guide VSS tool. We use Visual SourceSafe in our shop, so this tool that integrates Query Analyzer with VSS was a godsend.The .NET coverage was really eye-opening. You can tell the guy has definitely been there.If you had the first Guru's Guide book get this one too. You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Stored Procedures, XML, and HTML","review":"I don't know why no one else ever thought of it before but this is the only book I know of that treats T-Sql like a real language. It teaches that you have to work at it to master it and follow a disciplined engineering approach to it to be really good with it. For example, the chapter on design patterns takes the patterns made famous by Grady Booch and co. and applies them to T-Sql. It seems obvious now, but I never thought of this before and haven't read any other books that cover this.The Visual Source Safe integration is simply excellent. The book shows how to hook up Query Analzyer with VSS and even provides a tool to help manage your source code. I know a lot of shops that don't have any real management of their T-Sql code that would do themselves a favor to read an follow this chapter to the letter.The Undocumented stuff is also really good. I had no idea half of these undocumented stored procedures, extended procedures, functions and DBCC commands were even in there. A couple of come in really handy, but mostly they just provide some insight into how the server really works which, like most of the book, is invaluable."},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Stored Procedures, XML, and HTML","review":"I own all three of Ken Henderson's SQL Server books. They stand apart from the rest of the crowd as the best books available on their respective subjects. Henderson takes a fresh approach to teaching that other authors would do well to emulate.What do I mean exactly? I mean this: Every point of any significance that is raised is illustrated with code when possible. There are hundreds of code examples in each of Henderson's books - many times what you usually see in DBA or programming books. No details are glosssed over. If you really want to know how something works or what the best approach is to doing something, you need these books.Another thing that is great about these books is how easy to read they are. Complex subjects are regularly broached with explanations and teaching that practically anyone could understand. Topics that trip up other authors or that they skip altogether are discussed in terms that anyone can grasp. It is difficult to convey just how important this is, but suffice it to say that the books are simply easy to read.If you want to know SQL Server at an expert level, you need look no further. Get all three of Henderson's books and read them cover-to-cover."},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Stored Procedures, XML, and HTML","review":"I have been working as a programmer for 15+ years. I find this book to be an excellent balance of theory and practicality. I appreciate a writer who can give me an honest opinion, independent of the corporate party line, without taking a negative view of the product. I personally find this book to be much more readable than your average technical manual and it seems (to me) to indicate a depth of knowledge not readily demonstrated by most other authors who seem mostly to paraphrase the rather clinical books-on-line.I found this book to be so helpful that I have purchased his other books on Architecture and Transact-SQL.Before I purchased this book, I read several negative reviews, and was grateful for them. They convinced me beforehand (correctly) that this was the type of book I was looking for. If you are looking for a book with explicit solutions to every permutation of a problem, with code examples of how to solve \\"your specific\\" problem, this may not be your book. To me, those tend to fall under the heading of \\"give a man a fish\\" versus \\"teaching a man to fish\\". When I purchased this book, I was looking for a book that would explain things in a way that would let me know the ins-and-outs of this technology, showing me which things work, and more importantly which don't.I have found chapter 3, \\"Common Design Patterns\\" to be an outstanding resource should be required reading for developers learning to write SQL \\"code\\"."},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Stored Procedures, XML, and HTML","review":"Wife got me this one for xmas. Have to say - I love it. Great great writing. Henderson has a knack for teaching. And I agree that t-SQL should be approached as a &quot;real&quot; language. That is the best part of the book, IMHO. That and the fact that it does not treat you like an idiot or repeat what you already know (or should know). Good stuff."},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Stored Procedures, XML, and HTML","review":"I bought this to get familiar with the XML features in SQL SERVER. I was not disappointed. I especially liked the starter chapter on the XML language. I was already pretty good with XML before I read this book but I still learned several things about the language itself that I didn't know.Beyond this the SQLXML chapters are simply great. Each one tackles a different part of SQL SERVER'S XML features and takes the discussion from very basic stuff to advanced features. You learn gradually and systematically. I felt like I had my own personal SQLXML tutor. It's the best instruction I have seen in a computer book in a long time."},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Stored Procedures, XML, and HTML","review":"Except for minimal coverage of XML that is common knowledge at this point, maybe 20 to 40 pages, this is the same set of procs from book one that show up in magazines as tricks etc. The command line mindset still pervades this book.No professional programming tools or techniques are mentioned let alone talked about in any detail.Pros no longer use command line mentality in the real IT environments of today. [...] Even the best programmers of all time find problems with their own work let alone someone else's. I'd be very leery of these multitude of perfect scores. I own the book and can say with certainty it's not perfect in any ways mentioned and lacks any visual cues or talk of modern concerns such as security and other up to date topics. This is very outdated compared to how relational database programming is really done by the US's best programming pros.Do yourself a favor, think it over if you wnat a book with nothing but text, no visual cues, missing explanations and example code that has no bearing on a real project in any sense. And all of it in a command line format.

The SQL XML example code (especially sp_run_xml_proc) alone is worth the cost of the book. The code is top notch and explained by a master. I'm an old programmer at heart, so I love this stuff. I've never seen someone pull off being so code-centric but so in-depth with the explanations and advice. You can definitely tell the author &quot;has been there.&quot; That's why he writes stuff like sp_run_xml_proc, ingenious in its simplicity, infinitely useful -- like most of the code in the book. If you want a coder's take on SQL XML, .NET, xprocs, OLE Automation, and, above all, Tsql Stored Procedure programming, this is the book for you.TJDP.S.

I was not disappointed.There is chapter after chapter of great coverage of the XML features in SQL Server. Ken starts with the basics and ramps you up to the most advanced topics on the subject.

I bought all three of Henderson's books a few months ago and have been studying them ever since.This book was the third book I have bought to try to learn how to use XML with Sql Server. The other two are Malcom's book and Viera's general Sql Server programming book. Neither of those other two books covers Sql-Xml in the depth that this book does. Neither provides the kind of expert advice I have come to expect in these Guru Guides. And neither provides solutions to common problems you run into when building production Sql-Xml applications. This book gives you all of that and more.What I really like about the book is the way it covers everything from start to finish on XML. It starts off wtih a chapter on the XML language itself. For those who don't already know the language, this is a great start. I haven't seen a more concise intro to the language itself.The next chapters cover all of the Sql-Xml pieces one by one. There must be hundreds of sample XML documents and Sql-Xml queries. Every feature - FOR XML, sp_xmlpreparedocument, templates, XML bulk load, HTTP queries, style sheets, etc., is covered in detail. Approximately a third of the book is dedicated to covering these subjects. The chapters on Sql-Xml in this book are worth their weight in gold.I also like how the book builds on the first Guru Guide for Transact-Sql. Take the Undocumented features chapter... It adds to the wealth of undocumented features discussed in the Transact-Sql book. Rather than merely repeating this info, I found a whole host of new undocumented features and tools discussed. Worth the cost alone.Couldn't give this a higher recommendation. If you need to learn what the experts know about Sql-Xml in Sql Server this is the right book."},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Stored Procedures, XML, and HTML","review":"Finally a book that gives you, in the same chapter, a way to do arrays in SQL, and an excellent example of how to use extended stored procedures, and system functions.When I search for a good book, I look at a lot of books on the shelves, and often notice that many books just duplicate information readily available at &quot;Books on line&quot; or MSDN. This one doesn't do that. It explores a lot of topics that, although they do not appear immediatly useful, sooner or later will save you a lot of time.And that's what I look for when I buy a book!

My 15 world class programmers have told me this is the last book and series they would turn to for anything. There is no reference material for any arguments or things you don't want to have to open yet another browser session for, when my guys are running 10 to 15 screens doing development.

In one chapter I went from not knowing anything about XML to how to build some pretty complex documents and style sheets. I appreciate the thought that went into including the intro. Although it is not about SQLXML specifically it helps you understand the SQLXML chapters later in the book.The SQLXML chapters build on the earlier XML info and helped me get going with SQL Server's XML features. I was especially fond of the templates coverage. These are pretty cool and Henderson explains them in terms anyone could understand.Something that was also great to read was the .Net chapter. It convinced me that I needed to get into this more than I have."},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Stored Procedures, XML, and HTML","review":"There is a great deal to like about this book and almost nothing not to like. In the Preface, the author says that his intent is not to retread ground already plowed well by others. You see this philosophy at work throughout the book. Again and again, he goes to great lengths to avoid repeating the Books Online and other books already in print. What you get here is fresh material that picks up where the other books leave off. It takes you to the next level as a SQL Server practitioner because it does not waste your time repeating what you already know or what you could easily find elsewhere.Because of this, the coverage is necessarily not for beginners. Henderson does not take you from knowing nothing about stored procedure development to knowing everything about it in one book, nor could he or any other author. Instead, he says upfront that there are probably better books than his if you are a beginner and just now starting with stored procedure development. He aims a little higher than that -- he aims for the intermediate to advanced developer and covers things that only someone who has spent considerable time actually building SQL Server applications would know about.Examples of this abound. For example, you won't find coverage of the syntax for many commands in this book, but you will find detailed coverage of T-SQL coding conventions and how to integrate Query Analyzer and Visual SourceSafe. Henderson obviously assumes that you will read up on syntax when you need to in the BOL. You won't find much on justifying the use of stored procedures over ad hoc TSQL (Henderson obviously believes you shouldn't need any convincing about the value of stored procedures, otherwise you wouldn't have bought the book), but you will find detailed coverage of T-SQL design patterns, database design and normalization, and the quirks of T-SQL error handling. Time and again, Henderson focuses his energies on covering the real issues real practitioners face when building SQL Server applications using stored procedures. He deftly steps around what you can find in the BOL and elsewhere and leaves the easy stuff to others. Right about where you have exhausted all the other books have to tell you about stored procedure development, you find Henderson waiting to take you to the next level.Besides the general direction and focus of the coverage, another thing I really loved about the book is Henderson's style of writing. He has a gift for explaining difficult concepts in terms practically anyone could understand. He doesn't cut corners: when a complex topic needs further explanation, he goes into it depth. For other, more obvious subjects, he says just enough so that you can follow him without delving into the obvious or insulting your intelligence. The mix of in-depth discussion with summary info on lesser-important, more obvious topics is done just right: I found the discussions downright engaging more often than not. Finding an author with the technical know-how necessary to instruct others at an expert level and the teaching ability to do so successfully is rare indeed in this day and age. Henderson pulls it off masterfully. [...]"},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Stored Procedures, XML, and HTML","review":"The coverage on XML was very very good. I bought this book for the stored procedure information, but found myself drawn to the XML chapters. I read through them and learned a ton.I've never looked at XML the way Henderson presents it. He covers the basics and also covers the advanced stuff. He even presents some workarounds for limitations of the product. I guess my favorite part is the writing style.

It starts out with a primer on stored procedures. It devotes chapters to database design, triggers, views, UDF's, XML, and .NET, to list some of the topics. Once you read Mr. Henderson's book, you see there is so much to learn about SQL Server. I especially liked the chapter on UDF's. If you've ever searched for a better alternative to the builtin Soundex function, Mr. Henderson provides *the* best Soundex solution for SQL Server. In fact, that alone makes the book worthwhile. And let's not forget his listing and explanation of dozens of undocumented functions and features in SQL Server."},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Stored Procedures, XML, and HTML","review":"I have been looking for a book like this for a long time. Thank you very much for it. It's the first SQL Server programming book I've seen that doesn't treat you like an idiot. Mr. Henderson assumes you know what you're doing and simply want to get better at it.I consider myself somewhere between a beginner and an middle-level stored procedure builder and this book fit me just fine. I learn something practically every time I pick the book up.This is not your father's computer book. In fact I'll bet you will have trouble putting it down.For once a fresh approach has been taken to teaching this very complex subject. In the hands of a capable teacher such as Mr. Henderson, you will learn more than you could ever have hoped to from other books. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Stored Procedures, XML, and HTML","review":"I don't know how it happened, but somehow I worked in the SQL Server world for several years before I came across this book. I wish I'd had it two years ago when I started writing stored procedures pretty much full time. Like Mr. Soukup says in the Foreword, that would have saved me a lot of time. The book is by far the best stored proc book I have found.Before I found this book, I had about half a dozen topics that I was really struggling with in my work as a stored proc developer. An example would be error handling. I had discovered that trying to handle errors in my Transact-Sql code was difficult and didn't seem to work like I expected, but I didn't know why or what to do about it. It seemed there were certain errors that I simply couldn't detect or handle in my code, which left my bosses unhappy with me. Having read this book, I now understand completely where all the problems are and what to do about them. For that alone, the cost of the book was worth it.Another thing I struggled with was how to manage my source code logically. I coded for years in VB and dutifully checked my work in and out of Visual Source Safe, but had no clue as to how to do that with my stored proc source code with any mechanism even approaching efficiency. The instructions in this book on how to do this and how to avoid common pitfalls were a godsend. Thank you, thank you, thank you. It's all clear to me now.I have read all the others and pick this one as the best stored proc book money can buy. It opened my eyes to whole new ways of coding and working."},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Stored Procedures, XML, and HTML","review":"I own several of the author's other books, and this one carries on the fine &quot;Guru's Guide&quot; tradition quite well. As with his other books, the author doesn't bother getting into topics you can find information on in the product documentation or in other readily available books. Instead, the book covers the things those sources leave out, and it does so in spectacular detail with prose that is lucid and adroitly written. I have always enjoyed Ken Henderson's writing, and this book is no exception. I think I would enjoy reading through it even if the technical depth wasn't there. But, as it is, the technical information is there in abundance, as is a really distinct, enjoyable writing style.It strikes me that, in striving to avoid recovering what has already been covered over and over by other books, the author had a really difficult task with this book because he also had to avoid recovering what he himself has covered in other books. His previous book, The Guru's Guide to Transact-SQL, is all most people would need to become proficient stored procedure coders, so it naturally begs the question: How do you improve on this? How do you keep from repeating yourself? What do you do for an encore to a very successful book on essentially the same subject?Well, rest easy: This book does all that and more. Beyond the nuances of the T-SQL language, this book covers stored procedure development from the standpoint of traditional software development. It talks about subjects typically associated with more formal software development: coding conventions, testing, refactoring, source code management and version control, design patterns, etc. All of these are crucial areas for development with other languages, so the implicit question asked by this book is: Why are they not also important to Transact-SQL stored procedure development? Ken Henderson opines that they should be, and spends the entire book making his case as only a true guru could.I own several of the other Guru's Guide books and was proud to add this one to my collection. There's nary a SQL Server or T-SQL problem I can't find an answer to in at least one of them."},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Stored Procedures, XML, and HTML","review":"After reading Henderson's first Guru's Guide book I thought I knew all I needed to know about T-sql and stored proc creation. I was wrong. This book has proved invaluable to learning about developing stored procs apart from just knowing how to solve difficult T-sql problems.I loved the chapter on version control. I have been wondering how to manage all of my stored proc code, and this chapter gave me some great tips on how to do that. The tools that show how to integrate with Visual Source Safe are a real gem.The chapter on design patterns was a great one too. I never considered applying design patterns to T-sql. After I read this, I had a whole new way of looking at code, especially other people's code. Things seemed to jump out at me that I never noticed before.I really liked the extended procs chapter, too. I have been wondering how these things worked for years now. Now I not only know that, I can even write my own. I have been wanting to know how to build something like xp_setPriority for some time now. Now I have code I can simply drop in place.This book takes you beyond Henderson's first book and straight into professional first class stored proc development. If you build applications based on Sql Server you owe it to yourself to read this book."},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Stored Procedures, XML, and HTML","review":"I haven't even made it all the way through the book, but feel confident giving this book 5 stars just on the strength of the XML coverage. Henderson does an excellent job of taking a simple HTML page and stepping through how you would logically turn it into an XML document, including DTDs, XML Schemas, XSLT and more. Before I bought this book, I had no idea of the relation of all of those separate files, but it's all clear now.He also goes into great detail about the FOR XML clause, and the different options available. The section about using a universal table with FOR XML EXPLICIT to create complex XML documents is great.Beyond XML, the topics are all great -- arrays, unoducmented procedures, functions and tasks, tips on programming style and efficiency, ...the list goes on.All the while the writing style is very personal and to the point. He doesn't waste space with a ton of screen shots or overly-long result sets.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Software Engineering (International computer science series)","review":"Sommerville gives a keen view of the entire breath of this broad topic. His text is filled with easy to understand illustrations and chapter summaries. The examples are end-to-end because he provides the needed preliminaries (concepts and foundations) to understand the results. His treatment of requirements engineering and formal specification methods is quite good. In addition to the key points (of each chapter) he provides pointers to other resources on each subtopic. I find this text better for use in the classroom than the other leading text (which I use as a reference) because Sommerville's presentation provides a more logical flow and organization (i.e., its easier to read). I used the slides that are available (.ppt) from his web site to supplement my lectures."},{"Title":"Software Engineering (International computer science series)","review":"I checked several books on Software Engineering but this one was the only one readable by an ordinary human being. I was in for a nice surprise because it has a support page on the web (see &quot;preface&quot;) and you can download an updated chapter with recent stuff and examples in Java. At least someone cares to keep up with new things such as UML. I'd give this book 4.5 stars, but someone else says they gave it 4 instead of 4.5, so I'll give it 5."},{"Title":"Software Engineering (International computer science series)","review":"Sommerville has updated his classic textbook. We are using it for part of a Master in Software Engineering program. While you won't get detail on any one topic, you will find a very current (java, UML, distributed arch) review of many SE topics. Supposedly a big improvement over the last version. Clear, good examples, and reccomended readings that get you to key articles in the literature. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I reserve that for pure classics. It is hard to get a textbook into that category."},{"Title":"Software Engineering (International computer science series)","review":"I used this book in a 400 level college course on software engineering, and found it to be exceedingly shallow in its coverage of the topic. The work is a worthy attempt at providing a broad overview of the discipline. However, in my estimate it covers too much material in too little space and presents too few practical examples of the type that might be applicable to a \\"real-world\\" software project. Further the text only gives lip service to the wide array of tools now available. In all honesty I don't see how any one could give this book more than three starts (apologies to the other reviewers), especially considering that the book is now in its sixth edition.I was at the used book store recently and had the good fortune of acquiring Stephen R.

This book is a great supplemental reference to get more detailed information. I keep it on my shelf at work as a handy reference."},{"Title":"Software Engineering (International computer science series)","review":"I read this book as a text book for an Introduction to Software Engineering course.

A thorough introduction for a new engineer, or an overview of current trends and buzzwords for seasoned professionals."},{"Title":"Software Engineering (International computer science series)","review":"If you are a software project manager and would like additional insight into the software development life cycle (SDLC), then this is the book for you. It gives a conceptual overview on each phase of the SDLC as well as in depth knowledge that will help you determine how best to proceed with your project.I only gave it three stars because it is formatted more like a text book, which gives it an eerie feeling, but that is of course relative."},{"Title":"Software Engineering (International computer science series)","review":"While reading the contents list of the book, you already start feeling a software engineer. The author explains every important step of software engineering as promised in the contents list. All kind of specification posibilities, design systems, reliability and verification approaches are topics that opened my eyes. On the other hand, the part of object-oriented only told about OO as a modeling approach and hardly surpassed the level of buzzword. Perhaps some more attention in a next version? Still, the book is perfect for the novice at the topic of software engineering.(2000-06-29)"},{"Title":"Software Engineering (International computer science series)","review":"excellent diagrams. concise and clear summaries. brief chapters. broad coverage. the perfect software engineering 101 textbook"},{"Title":"Software Engineering (International computer science series)","review":"I used this book for an introductory course on software engineering. Although the book gives an expansive view of the field, there isn't enough detail or in-depth examples to make it anything more than an academic treatise. I don't feel that I could use much of what I've learned in an actual project - I would have to resort to more specific references.Now, the premise of having an entire book on software engineering may be more to blame than the clarity or presentation of the material. But software engineering is a practical field, and a software engineering text that doesn't provide practical information isn't useful. For this reason, I cannot give the book a passing grade."},{"Title":"Software Engineering (International computer science series)","review":"For a subject as broad as software engineering, Sommerville does a good job of introducing the topics of the still evolving discipline. The text is a good starting point for digging deeper into issues of interest.I also read the 4th edition of this text.

But I think it's not that &quot;concise and clear&quot;. Case studies are somehow trifling, and not easy to understand, because of the specific domain involved. Sometimes principles are not clearly identified. That's why I give it four stars. Mr. Sommerville is an English man and this book is not written in American English. Some readers might not get used to it. After all, it's worthy of spending money and time on this book."},{"Title":"Software Engineering (International computer science series)","review":"This book tries to cover way too much information in such a small space leaving topics overly vague and generic.Further, the author does not use American English, which is fine - when you don't attend an American university.

If I am going to have trouble reading it, let it be the material and now how the material is presented.If the book isn't forced upon you by a university, you should consider a different software engineering book if you want details.Of course, I won't even go into my professor who is using this book - yikes."},{"Title":"Software Engineering (International computer science series)","review":"This is a horrible book with lots of un-popular terminologies and using abbreviated words, I believe that we can live with &quot;it is likely to&quot; instead of &quot;it is prone that&quot;.

I'd like to say I spent all that time examining ethical issues, when in reality it was just a hard book to finish...Chapter list: System Administration and Operations; Audit; Vulnerability Disclosure; Digital Postmaster; E-mail Scams; Information Security Officers; Programmers and System Analysts; Database Administration; Information Service Providers; Brother's Keeper; End-user and Employee Computer Security; Customer Ethics; Trusted Assistant; Ethics and Contractors/Consultants; Telecommuting and Mobile Computer Security; Personal Computer Users; Penetration Testing; Content Providing; Privacy; Management/Employer Ethics; ConclusionEach chapter is made up of a brief discussion of ethical matters in that particular area, followed by vignettes where you have to figure out what you'd do. The author gives a \\"conservative\\" and \\"liberal\\" answer to the dilemma, followed by a summary of what they consider the right answer to be. While there's some benefit to be gained from thinking through some of the scenarios, the content is just far too uneven and in some cases irrelevant. It took me a number of attempts to find where the author explains what is meant by the conservative and liberal \\"answers\\". They are so extreme as to be comical in some cases. Apparently the author uses them as \\"guardrails\\" to set the boundaries of the issue. Even then, the author's answer is often too liberal for my tastes or just wishy-washy. In one scenario, the question is asked if IP spoofing is acceptable if it causes no damage (since it's a way for super hackers to show off). The author feels that at best it helps shore up security, and at worst it eats up resources and causes destruction. So what? Is it right or wrong?In the Personal Computer Users area, the first scenario is being unable to stop playing FreeCell when your husband asks you to come to bed and not play past midnight. For the life of me, I don't see how this has anything to do with IT ethics. The whole Trusted Assistant chapter has nothing to do with IT. It's basically about what an administrative assistant should or should not be able to do. Fine for general business, out of place for IT ethics. And as a final nit, the chapter on Information Service Providers has the term misspelled at the top of each page (\\"Information Sercive Providers\\").While it's possible to get some value from this book, I feel it could have been much better."},{"Title":"IT Ethics Handbook: Right and Wrong for IT Professionals","review":"Have you ever wondered if you are doing the right thing? Is is okay to steal from work? How about downloading pirated music using the company network? Do the rules apply to everyone? Can I do whatever I want if I'm a system administrator?These are real topics covered in \\"IT Ethics Handbook\\". Sadly, each answer comes in two varieties: Conservative and liberal (each of which get their own font!). If you don't like one answer, you can just choose the other. The (long) list of contributors put their heads together to come up with rationalizations for both sides.I tend to think that if you have to ask the question, you already know the answer, and if you truly don't, asking your friends, boss, or co-workers will clear it right up. Heck, the employee handbook might even answer them. The book doesn't really lay a foundation for ethics, but sticks to specifics questions. Indeed, it seems to ignore the idea that ethics isn't an absolute, and may vary between different groups and cultures. They merely mention all that stuff in the introduction, but then quickly discard it.Some other paraphrased questions, in case you still think you need this book. You can quickly find a rationalization for the right and wrong of each and apply the answer that you like best.* Can I write malicious virus code for profit?* Should I use somebody else's login and password?* Can I use company resources for personal gain?* Can I videotape my co-workers having sex in the hallways? (real question)* Do I have to obey the law?* Can I be lazy?* Can I spy on employees?* Can I take revenge on a co-worker?Perhaps this book is for the guy who wears the expensive suit and takes off fridays to play golf."},{"Title":"IT Ethics Handbook: Right and Wrong for IT Professionals","review":"I really wanted to like this book. There are a lot of good things in it, but the negatives outway them.Problems:* No bibliography, refrences or pointers to further reading/research. There have been other books on it/computer ethics, this is not the first.* The slant seems too much toward ethics as it relates to security and security-related matters. There's more to it/computer ethics then that.* No mention of the several professional organizations of IT/ITSEC people!!! Slight mention is made of ACM & IEEE, but no mention of SAGE (the System Administrators Guide at www.sage.org) which is THE professional association of sysadmins, who have spent YEARS developing a professional code of ethics. This code should have been included in the book. And what about the several professional groups of ITSEC people, like ISSA (Information Systems Security Association at www.issa.org) which also has a code of ethics, Computer Security Insitute (www.gocsi.com), and so forth?? They should have been mentioned. (and since SANS, the authors group, did stuff with SAGE, ignoring them is pretty bad)."},{"Title":"IT Ethics Handbook: Right and Wrong for IT Professionals","review":"It would be good if the author were capable of following his own advice; his personal examples contradict themselves on many important points, and when the moral questions get tough, he (or she) dashes away like a frightened rabbit, metaphorically speaking. A quick Google search turns up several lawsuits and evidence that this author is definitely not someone who should be writing about IT ethics under any circumstances."},{"Title":"IT Ethics Handbook: Right and Wrong for IT Professionals","review":"I'm glad that we are finally starting to see books like this. This is a good one but I would like to see more emphasis on this area with even better books.The book is organized into chapters based on various roles and functions within and organization. Then within each chapter there are various ethical dilemmas which are discussed. The dilemmas is defined, then both liberal and conservative takes on the matter are described and the item is closed with an explicit stance on the issue.This issues discussed are wide ranging, from storing personal files on work machines, to whether a workplace affair can be tolerated. This wide ranging discussion is one of the problems I have with the book. If the issues had been more focused on IT concerns then each item could have been covered in more depth.Another problem with the book is it's layout. I found that the layout of the text and the material distracted from the contents. There was too much formatting.I liked the book because I found the material compelling. If not the discussions themselves, which were too brief. It stretched my mind to think about these issues and to take input from different sides of the fence. I hope this book will be revised so that it is even more readable and valuable. In the meantime it is still worth the look for those in the IT field with ethics concerns."},{"Title":"IT Ethics Handbook: Right and Wrong for IT Professionals","review":"When do we as information technology professionals cross the line ethically? Who us to say what is right or wrong? Are there absolutes? Or is everything just relative. These are some of the questions posed by Stephen Northcutt in IT Ethics Handbook - Right and Wrong for IT Professionals ( 648 pages ; Syngress, 2004). The only problem is that for this reader, the book left me with more questions than it answered, though I found the many examples and \\"case studies\\" included would provide good references for discussion purposes.The first thing that caught my attention was the author's identification of \\"moral relativism\\" as one of the dominant \\"religious thoughts\\" in the world today. The author also boldly states that in many cases \\"moral relativism\\" will \\"rapidly get you fired in the workplace\\". This latter statement may or may not be true, but itstruck me more as an ethical goal in a perfect world than as statement of fact. And there is no way in the world that this reader would consider \\"moral relativism\\" a stream of religious thought because it has no grounding in religion at all. It is a by-product of the drive for a secular society in today's world. It seems that the author does acknowledge to some degree that moral relativism is a culprit in the ethical quandaries of today, it serves as the framework for the discussion of each ethical issue raised, casting answers in a \\"conservative\\" and \\"liberal\\" point of view to show the extremes of the answers to different scenarios.It is here that the readers of this book would need to be very careful, as is the challenge in looking at any case study, since nothing is always cut and dry since a scenario does not always include all the factors that can drive it. The author does acknowledge this and states that every case study and answer set offered may or may not be applicable to given organizational circumstances.All of this being said, I would not recommend this book for anyone expecting to find cut and dry answers that they can apply to their organization. I would recommend it as a desk reference to use for ethics training session or to find information for the starting point of discussions for ethics issues that may arise at any given time in the workplace. The price is not that expensive that you would not get at least some value out of the book, even if it just challenges your thinking about what issues really fall under the realm if \\"IT Ethics\\" or how you would approach a given situation.The Business Controls Caddy Scorecard: Even on a Par 4"},{"Title":"IT Ethics Handbook: Right and Wrong for IT Professionals","review":"This insightful book should be on the shelf of every IT professional!!

This book is not a reference book on any of the technologies mentioned on the cover! It is a great overview of each topic and how they inter-relate.The downside of this book is that it doesn't go into enough detail in some areas. To actually begin implementing some of the ideas, you need another teaching aid to learn the Microsoft Tool in question.

What a relief the book is relatively short because the further I read, the more hopelessly &quot;ushy-gushy, ho-hum&quot; it became. The book revolves around Fraser's two-year affair with a French university professor whom she meets on the Italian island of Ischia. Basically, Fraser's husband leaves her after a year of marriage (with her mental attitude and stability, I actually don't blame the guy) and she is now in search of her own identity - her true sexual and emotional self...believe me, it takes her a long time to find it! Let's get real here, the story is little more than a two-year tryst with a married man, in exotic places of the world - Milan, Lago, Maggiore, London, Aeolian Islands, Marrakech, San Francisco. Just what does it take to satisfy this woman - other than, obviously, a lot! If she chooses to have an affair, that is her business, but three quarters of the people who walk in her shoes do not write a book about it!What about the plot, you ask? What plot? The couple spend their days of glory basking in the sun, strolling hand-in-hand down quiet streets, dining on fine cuisine and sipping succulent wine along the way. Somehow it is immensely difficult for the average reader to relate to, or feel compassion for, this poor abandoned woman who is &quot;trying to find her true self&quot; while dining on Epicurean cuisine and tossing back lavish wine in opulent places around the world! Who the heck cares about her sordid little affair! I did give the book one star, just to be nice, and for at least having the creativity to move the &quot;action&quot; around to exotic locations. In reality, the basis of the story is not much different from what goes on somewhere around the world, for many &quot;married-but-not-to-each-other&quot; couples, twenty-four hours a day, day-in and day-out, but unless they are among the elite....usually in less exotic locations."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"I can only imagine that Laura Fraser had an affair with the publisher to get this piece of work printed.

It is a boring story of a middle age woman who travel thorugh Italy alone.

How would we face Fraser's situation, thinking about issues of divorce, children and the biological clock? And what are the &quot;right&quot; boundaries for a marriage?

This book grabbed me and held my attention the entire time. i loved this book. i wish i could find more like this. beautiful and fun. a great escape!"},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"I'm getting ready to set out on a three week trip to Ecuador on my own. I picked this book up on Monday and planned to read it on my trip. Poolside on Tuesday, I finished it and felt like I had just spent the past two days in Europe! This book brings the author's feelings and experiences to life- it is detail rich and helps you escape without really going anywhere. In addition, it reminds women that they can get out and make it on their own- affair or not!"},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"If I find the time, I will write to Laura Fraser personally and thank her for this book. Did she realize she was also writing a self-help book for other women who have experienced (and are still experiencing) similar circumstances? By reading and enjoying her book, I have been able to put a four year love affair of my own into perspective. The added bonus is that I have been to several of the places she describes in this book, and I feel that I am re-living those experiences while reading the book. Being another slightly over-weight strong athletic healthy live-life-to-the-fullest blonde, I feel I have found a sister, even if only in literary terms."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"Fraser's book is a sincere story of love, hope, and healing. She recounts how an affair with a French professor leads her to regain a sense of self badly damaged when her husband deserts her. Anyone who has felt the pain of rejection can instantly sympathize. Fraser has a wonderful, lyrical style. She borrows Italian words to flavor her narrative. Her precise observations are often humorous, from the shopkeepers who &quot;don't want to be responsible for any aesthetic errors walking around on the streets&quot; to Napoli's traffic &quot;zipping around without rules.&quot; Initially I found the second-person narration distracting but soon got caught up in her magical, triumphant tale."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"It isn't often that I read a book at one sitting. I just felt swept along by An Italian Affair. It is, by turns, heartbreaking, hilarious, life-affirming, delicious, and uplifting. I never wanted it to end! Give it to all your girlfriends--especially those who need a reminder that even if they aren't always in love, they're always lovable."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"I read this book in two days and wished there were others like it! The story is well told (except for the fact that it is written in second person which was very distracting for a good portion of the book!)and the descriptions of italian places are very vivid so I could really picture Laura and her lover there.I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to savor some romance that is enjoyed in beautiful and quaint settings. I would have given it 5 stars if had it been written in first or third person."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"I loved this book. It is wonderfully written and really stays with the reader. I really felt close to the author as she explains her feelings and the exotic destinations she visited. It was very touching. I highly recommend it. If nothing else it will definitly get your travel bug brewing!"},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"Author Laura Fraser makes it look easy: She applies the tricky second tense to a true-life saga of heartbreak, self-doubt and the courage to heal. Her style is so light and elegant, it becomes a polished window through which her story shines.The healing occurs during travels that unfold with cinematic intensity--the deep blue Aegian; hot white rocks on the beach; dark red wine; spicy olives; an earthy, sensual French lover.That Fraser does not shy away from recording her own fears and disappointments brings depth and sweetness to the gorgeous colorscape she paints. A lovely read."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"Fraser wonderfully decribed the scenery of each city she spoke about. Each chapter speaks about a different city in which her rendezvous with &quot;M&quot; took place, and I looked forward to finding out what destination was next. Through her vivid descriptions of scenery and food, it felt as if I was actually in Italy. I could not put this book down, and I was just upset that it had to end."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"Sorry, I just couldn't get through this book. The second person narrative was painful, and so was the plot. I rarely give up on a book, but this one ended up in the thrift store pile after about 60 pages."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"The stylistic quirk of a story written in the second person takes a little getting used to, but it wasn't a big deal for me. \\"An Italian Affair\\" is a terrific travel book, even as it tells a poignant personal tale of loneliness and hard-won self knowledge. Many of the places Laura Fraser describes are ones I've always wanted to visit, so that made the book especially enjoyable. Her descriptions are vivid yet written with restraint. \\"An Italian Affair\\" wears well, and makes me eager to read more of Fraser's writing."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"I just finished reading An Italian Affair over the week-end. It's a beautiful description of both the author's coming to terms with her divorce and the exotic locations that form the backdrop for her visits with the professor. It takes the reader along as they learn from each other and as their relationship changes and evolves.I've recommended the book to a number of friends, including a few who have recently gone through their own break-ups and are struggling to make sense of it all. Part love story, part travel story (I want to see some of those places now!) and part self exploration - it's a perfect summer read."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"This is a delightful read. Being written in the second person, the style took a chapter or so to get comfortable with but once done, the book is a joy. I enjoyed the unlikely pairing of the narcissistic French Professor and the broken hearted American Travel Writer. Italy's bounty is so richly described in this work of non-fiction. It was incredibly easy to varcariously feel, see, and taste it all. I didn't want the book to end. I'd love to read more from Ms. Fraser. Hurry and write faster Laura!"},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"This book is so enticing because it is nonfiction. She writes from the heart and is so honest in her thoughts. Great book and inspiring story!"},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"I read as much as I could...I got almost 1/2 of the way through and put it down. Written using the word 'you' instead of 'I' made me think she really didn't want to be associated with this story. Short sentences without any real emotion. Uninspiring and not 'full of hope' - I do not recommend this book."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"I stumbled across &quot;An Italian Affair&quot; while searching for a Father's Day gift. I read the inside cover and found it to be interesting so I bought it for myself. It wasn't until a few days ago that I finally picked up the book to read. Wow, why did I wait? I loved every minute. I also found that I didn't want the story to end...although I am happy to know that Laura finally came into own. I felt as if Laura was a friend and she was telling me her story. I felt I was with her on her journey enjoying every minute while she slowly embraced change and also feeling her pain as she grew. Who hasn't experienced some of the pain and insecurities she describes? A very touching, bittersweet, empowering story about love, loss and life. Great book, great story...way to go Laura! ^5"},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"Because it just wasn't that interesting. Yes the second-person style was irritating but ultimately I just didn't have any interest in wondering where this relationship was going. Nor did I have any interest in the author's healing process. In many parts of the book I sensed she was writing stuff just to get back at her ex. Why am I a part of this and how did this get published - I kept asking myself. But I did finish it - what can I say - insomnia and at 2 am I'm not that picky."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"I found this book by chance during my last visit to the library. I'm not really fond of memoirs, but I thought the jacket sounded intriguing, so I thought I'd give it a try. When I finally cracked it open, I couldn't put it down! I loved the author's honest voice, and I enjoyed tagging along as she encountered all kinds of interesting people and visited a variety of great spots around the world. It's been a while since I read a truly wonderful story. Although this book is based on actual events, it reads like a great piece of fiction. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"Laura (Fraser)tries to do the Bridget Jones thing - single girl does Europe - and does it badly. Laura is forever complaining about her age (36) and her looks (check out the jacket! - this woman is a babe). We should all have such problems.After being dumped by her husband (after reading this book you'll get a good idea why) Laura embarks on exotic adventures all over the world with a married French professor who she sometimes calls M and sometimes the Professor - she can't seem to make up her mind. The utter immorality of this cheap affair nothwithstanding, the book fails on so many levels.First are the characters themselves. They are uninvolving and uninteresting. We can't root for them because they have no redeeming qualities. The are both very shallow - boring us with what they eat and where they go as if anyone cared. And they are snobs - looking down on the rest of us as if only they knew what was worthy of enjoyment. If fact, the professor admits that he is a womanizer and a snob and those are his best qualities. Well if that is the kind of guy that women are attracted to, then nice decent guys have no chance. Laura also badly stereotypes American men as if all they are interested in is football. She complains about the city she lives in - San Francisco - she should be grateful she can afford to live there - and her job - she should be thankful she has one.Laura says she works - but at what we don't know. However she seems to have all the time in the world to drop whatever she is doing and run off to some exotic place. She is always complaining about money but somehow seems to have enough. And general taste in men - always going after someone who is attractive and wealthy - explains why she goes through men like water. When there is one Italian man who is attracted to her, she dimisses him by saying &quot;An Italian music teacher is not the best prospect&quot;. Back she goes to the chump.The story is incredibly uninvolving. It is written as a narrative (You do this and You do that) which means it is devoid of action. Laura and the professor are about the only characters which means it is almost devoid of conversation. The story only picks up near the end when they go to the island of Stromboli where they meet some interesting people but by then we have long stopped caring.Professor Snob, as we'll call him, is easily one of the most unlikable characters in literature. He is your typically sterotyped arrogant foreigner - always smoking, thinking that his taste in everything is the best and treating women as if all they are good for is sex and housework. While he is off galavanting, what is happening to his wife and kids? Some father. And his treatment of Laura is equally despicable. He classes her as a woman you can have a vacation with, as if all she is good for is sex. Of course the only reason this so-called relationship exists is sex which means it was doomed from the start.I couldn't put this book down - not because I was interested in the ending but because I just wanted to get it over with and get on to Zadie Smith's White Teeth.Laura, I know you were trying to chronicle your adventures but next time, make it fiction and please put some action and interesting characters in it. &quot;An Italian Affair&quot; is proof that someone's interesting life does not necessarily make an interesting novel. Sometimes, the thoughts should just stay in your head. Laura, please take a course in character development before your next book. I am very disappointed in you."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"A memoir that reads like a novel. I borrowed this book from my daughter and loved it so much I bought my own copy. I plan to read it again for the story and use it to plan a trip to Italy."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"I bought this book as an escape and it truly was. From the beautiful descriptions of the places she visits and the food she eats, Laura Fraser weaves a compelling tale that hooks the reader from the beginning. Wronged at the beginning of the book, Fraser starts out weak. But through her travels and her relationship with M., she becomes a stronger person. There is nothing wrong with leaning on someone or using their zest for life to make you stronger. That is what you should take from Fraser's autobiographical story. You should look at every day, every place as a pleasure. I have to admit, since taking her advise, I feel better about everything."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"I can't beleive how much I loved this book! I usualluy don't read love stories but as I was reviewing the San Francisco Chronicle Best Sellers List I read a sentence about the book and I thought, hey, I'll give it try. So, I went to my library to order it and I knew it would take some time to get it, so picked a book called, &quot;Last Time I Saw Paris&quot; to read while I waited for it. That was also about a women finding romance. I thought know way this is real, nobody can meet a man of her dreams just like that! Well, I was wrong! Laura's tale about her adventures in Italy made me so jealous! Here she could travel to these remote islands (I did look up the islands and they did exsist) and speak the language and eat the most delcious food, it seemed if I would her our taste buds would be the same., I believe that true love does exsit even when you don't expect it. The believeable thing about the story, &quot;M&quot; was just an ordianry guy who smoked alot and had nice comfortable marriage but he and Laura were companions to the bitter end of their relationship. I believe all women now and then should have a romance like that. A secret that you can always dream about when your by your self and sometimes an old married women needs that so make her complete within herself and by reading that book it brought alot of old memories back about certain things in my life. I actually re-read the book. It was happy and loving and and it got me through a hard time in my life right now. Now what I want to know when will the seqel be out?P.S. It took me days go get out of the trance of this book."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"The only differences between my life experiences and those of Ms. Fraser are that she has traveled to some very exotic places since her divorce and I haven't; she has had an exciting, life-affirming relationship and I haven't; she has written a great book about her experiences, and I haven't. I intend to recommend this book to several friends who have gone through the agony of divorce. I read the book in two days and felt I was reading someone's diary. It's great for the dog days of summer."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"An Italian Affair is the most unusual memoir that I have ever read about how a woman coped with divorce. When I describe the book to other people, they refuse to believe that it is not fiction. But the author says that the events occurred, and only the names have been changed. For those who like their romances to be exotic and perfectly shaped, An Italian Affair will lend new fanatasies. On the other hand, those who are concerned about proper behavior will wonder about the author's pursuit of pleasure with a married father. Whether you admire or admonish Ms. Fraser, you will be charmed by her marvelous writing and sense of joy.Ms. Fraser's marriage broke up in a most ugly way. Her husband of a year told her he had changed his mind about having children, and began staying out late. One night, she came home to find him cavorting with an old high school girl friend. After the divorce, he married the old girl friend and had a child with her.Ms. Fraser is now past 35 and feels her chance to be a mother ticking away. She is bent by the betrayal, but unbroken. Her work as a writer takes her around the world, and while visiting friends in Italy, she is encouraged to find an Italian lover on the island of Ischia. Soon Italian men are showing interest, but she connects instead with a Parisian who is half Italian on his annual vacation without his wife and children. His wife also sees other men, and they seem to have an \\"open\\" marriage. He is waiting for a Spanish brunette who has stood him up, but Ms. Fraser doesn't find out about this until later. M. teaches art, but also seems talented in the art of beautiful living and making her feel beautiful and appreciated. Over the next two years, they find many opportunities to meet around the world and continue the relationship. He encourages her at the end to find someone like himself who isn't married.This book can also be enjoyed as a travelogue of the many wonderful places they visited and how to enjoy time with someone you like to be with. The locations include Milan, London, San Francisco, Los Angeles, the Aeolian Islands, and Morocco. The pair has a special affinity for beaches and bare bathing, and fine food. To me, some of the most exquisite writing is about the food and wine they enjoyed together.What I found most appealing about the book was the way that M. could pay a compliment, avoid hurting her feelings, and make her feel appreciated while being perfectly candid that he wasn't in love with her and intended to stay married to his wife. If you take those skills and put them into a loving relationship, even better results should occur!For example, Ms. Fraser has a negative body image. M. describes that Renoir, Ingres, Boucher, and Poussin would have enjoyed having her as a nude model. He also caresses her in those places where she is most self-critical.After you finish enjoying this memoir, I suggest that you think about how you could capture some of its romance for you and your spouse or the person you are dating.Learn to speak and act more lovingly!"},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"I read this book because (a) I really like Laura Fraser's writing in Salon; (b) I love Italy; and (c) it looked like a good beach read. Wrong, wrong, wrong. In the acknowledgements page, Ms. Fraser thanks her editor. My reaction to her editor is decidedly different: she has to be the person who told her that writing in the second person throughout THE ENTIRE BOOK was a worthy literary device. BIG MISTAKE. I thought it made the author come off as self-indulgent, precious, aggrandizing, a bore, and a boor. I probably should not even be writing this review because, as Fraser would put it, &quot;you pick up the book, you hope that this second-person narrative device will change, your frustration mounts. Finally, you just hurl...&quot; Frankly, this grated on me so much that I zipped through just to get to the end and put myself out of my own misery. If Laura Fraser has another book in her, I can only hope that she figures this out. In the meantime, if you want to spend your non-reading time at the beach pounding sand in frustration, go ahead, buy this book, and go forth with your towel and a sand pail."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"I picked this book up as a weekend read as I am fascinated with anything concerning Italy. I guess I have been spoiled by other authors as I found this read to be rather dry and devoid of passion, which was unexpected. I was not convinced that either cared about the other and the way it was written was distracting. In places, I had a hard time figuring out just who was talking. By the ending all I could think of was 'so what'?"},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"Ms. Fraser suffers the ultimate heartbreak (her husband runs off with his high school sweetheart) and finds redemption in Italy through an affair with an (almost) dashing French professor of art history. Sound saccharin to you? No way! Fraser's memoir has just the right touches of introspection, wit, Italian food, sex and adventure to keep the prose lively and fun to read. This is a winner!"},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"It took me a number of page to realize this book was autobiographical. The second person narrative was misleading, and eventually became quite annoying. The author writes her story of an attempt to heal from an unsuccessful marriage, where her ex-husband had gone philandering. According to Fraser, what better way to fix that, than to do it herself with a similarly married man. The difference for her, though, is that she carries on her own illicit affair with a married Parisian in exotic and foreign locations.The only beauty of the book is in the descriptions of the beautiful scenery Laura encounters. There is no true beauty in the relationship she develops with Professor M. The timing is always on his terms, with an understanding that the relationship would always be only an affair, as he had no intention or desire to leave his wife. So, Laura has gone from a marriage where her husband dishonors her to an affair where her new love interest does the same. I suppose the progress she has made, is in the beauty of the surroundings, and the excitement of the chase, ever knowing that she will not win the race.Two thumbs down for this book. Fraser wasted a writing opportunity to enamor her readers with Italy, in exchange for sharing her immature pursuit of a lover she could never really have."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"As short at this book was (easy to finish in two days), I found myself increasingly eager to be done with it, despite the lure of Italy (which I love) and other exotic locations. Not least of my objections was the annoying present tense, second person narrative, which only added to the sense of being a participant in a rather shallow woman's self-indulgence. (An aesthetic sense and love of la dolce vita do not in themselves add up to depth.) Nor could I be particularly sympathetic to a woman with endless leisure and money to find herself (she mentions money being tight at times, but this is obviously relative, as she can fly to London or Italy or Morocco when the whim takes her), who in her late 30s still seems to think that loveless sex is a path to happiness, or who fails to realize that(despite the lulling effects of the romantic locations)trading sexual intimacies with men she's known less than a day (as she does in Stroboli)is not only stupid but dangerous. The fact that the book masquerades as some kind of inner journey only makes it all the more sad. The characters all play the same sexual games, hurting each other in the process and seem in the end as lonely as they began. The fact that (some)Europeans play the game with more grace and, frequently, more kindness than Americans does not detract from its ultimate emptiness."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"Forget Fodor's -- An Italian Affair is the best guidebook to Italy ever! I was totally mesmerized by Laura Fraser's descriptions of Italy (and beyond), its landscape, city life and food. Reading this book was just as good as being there -- and the fairy tale romance was the &quot;cherry on top of the cherry on top of the sundae.&quot;Written as a travel memoir, I was a bit surprised that An Italian Affair turned out to be a true story. It sounded like such a great fiction novel, so knowing this story actually happened to someone made it all the more incredible. Laura Fraser's story begins when her husband of one year dumps her for his high school sweetheart. Devastated, Laura decides to visit her friends for a therapeutical trip in Italy. Exploring one of the outer islands, Ischia, on her own one day, Laura crosses paths with her destiny. M., a dashing Frenchman, on a vacation of his own, finds Laura having breakfast in the same hotel, and from there a spectacular romantic rendez-vous ensues.M.'s and Laura's love affair is at once sweet and nurturing, but also has magical healing powers. Since meeting M., Laura's post-divorce depression has had a back-burner storyline in her life, and through M., Laura has been able to become the independent, strong woman she thought she had lost for good. Endearing and smart, An Italian Affair is a wonderful testimony of being a woman, falling in love and getting back your life. Highly recommended for a fabulous, quick read."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"Someone once said that we vacation to take a break from ourselves, but Laura Fraser's novel shows how travel can actually help us uncover who we really are. I read this memoir over the weekend and felt as if I'd gone on a brief adventure myself. Although I'm happily married, I could completely relate to the author's sense of loss and confusion post-divorce, and also to the sense of empowerment (and mild surprise) she felt as she met men who found her attractive and finally one she was interested in, too. More important, regardless of the fellas in the book, Laura Fraser stands on her own as an interesting, mature (I mean that in a good way), REAL character in this novel, absent perfect bodies or hair or clothes or the right thing to say all the time. But the book is still eminently sexy because you can easily put yourself into Ms. Fraser's well-traveled shoes. It's a quick read, a combination travelogue, love story, and girl-power piece, perfect for a little getaway of your own."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"You're very interested in Italy and are planning a vaction therein the spring. You have been reading books on Italian historyand accounts of travel in Italy. You find Laura Fraser'sbook \\"An Italian Affair\\" and you think that it sounds interestingso you order it. But when you start to read \\"An Italian Affair\\"you find that the books is simply unreadable. The book iswritten in the second person (the same tense that you wrote thisbook review in). You find Ms. Fraser describing your marriagewhich ended when your husband left you for another woman. Butwait, you don't have a husband. In fact, you check anddiscover that you're male. The book also describes your affairwith a married Italian professor. You're surprised, becauseyou have not even visited Italy yet. And neither the Italianprofessor or you are homosexual.After reading a few paragraphs of this horrible book you wonderhow it ever got past the editors at Vintage. You put the bookin the library donation pile and grab another book from thebookshelf. But before you put this whole experience behind you,you decide to write a review on Amazon to warn other readers ofwhat they may find if they buy this book."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"This book was great for me because the author wrote loving, detailed descriptions of the places she went, the food she ate, and the people she met. Her husband, who she thought was the love of her life, left her after only a year of marriage, in a nasty, hurtful way. She left San Francisco to spend time in Italy to distract herself from thinking about her marriage, and to avoid meeting her ex with his new wife in their old haunts. How many of us have fantisized about escaping to a beautiful place to lick our wounds in similar situations. Of course Laura was going to find an Italian man to help get her over her emotional hurt, but the man she settled on... I can't help thinking she could have done better. What bothers me is not that \\"M\\" was a married man with kids, it's that he was gross, and a user. She described him smoking stinky cigarettes and smelling like cigars. Yuk. He's a nasty arrogant middle-aged Parisian, not even a romantic young hunk. But the story of getting over a broken heart, and the romance of beautiful places, appeals to me greatly."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"Yes, it's a travel guide that gives the reader insights to places in Italy that are not on the usual tourist stops. Actually, it's easy to understand why. I liked that. But no, I couldn't get drawn into the intent of the author for her memoir to be seen as her recovery of self by having an affair with a Frenchman. She's also a little too easily flattered by the attentions of two Italian men she bumps into in Stromboli. This book has more the tinge of a college girl's traipse through Europe than a mature woman's escape to self-discovery."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"What can I say? I enjoyed this book. The second person style does take a little getting used to, but I liked reading about the different locales, the professor and Laura's honesty about her life. Really folks, let's not judge! Who wants to read a book about someone who is perfect? No conflict in that."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"it was very disconcerting to read a book that was written in the second person! I also felt that M treated Laura pretty shabbily, and I was amazed at how much she was willing to overlook. Howver, her fantasy verses reality mindset served her well in her healing process after the divorce. I loved the travelogue aspect of this book; all the wonderful details of off-the-beaten path charming places (esp islands in Italy) where they met up. These were described in such vivid detail, and I could almost taste the delicious foods, and picture the various sights in my mind. And this is precisely why I chose to read this book, so that objective was satisfied above and beyond!"},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"I essentially read this book in one sitting. I have been to many of the places Fraser described, and the descriptions gave me goose bumps. I respect her honesty, and would recommend this book to anyone looking for an adventure or a little romance."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"Laura Fraser has been married for only one year when her husband declares that he no longer loves her and has fallen for a younger woman. Totally devastated, she takes the advice of a friend to travel so as to meet new people and to take her mind off things, so sets off for some of the remoter islands off the coast of Italy. While climbing a small mountain, she meets a fifty something French Arts Professor who proves that what she needs is an older, sympathetic man to soothe her hurts and together they spend a holiday that is both intellectual and physical and agree to try to meet next holiday time. Laura realises that the Professor is a married man with a family but whose understanding wife agrees that once a year, he needs his own space. This gentle love affair, without commitment, is exactly what Laura needs to get back into life and they meet again over the next couple of years to the enjoyment of both of them. The author gives glowing descriptions of both the beautiful places they visit and mouth watering descriptions of the luscious food and drink that they try. A warning...don't read this book if you are dieting or unable to reach any food in a hurry as it will definitely make your tummy rumble!"},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"just wanted to rate it.

It is very poignant, graphic, detailed and mezmerizing.The author also showed how life can be completely different in another person's eyes.Go and read this book. It is worth the time of day."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"Having spent last summer in some of the places Laura travels it made for a very visual Italian experience. This reading can be very thought provoking for those woman who have allowed a man to make them feel so little of themselves. The transformation can be uplifting and a little on the &quot;self help&quot; side. I did not want to see this enchanting true story end. I hope you enjoy it as I did. For those who like romance and a little illicit adventure, and &quot;la bella vita&quot;; love of life, it is a must! Ciao Ciao"},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"The only character I like in this - I hesitate to use the word book, in this, let's say, piece of writing is the husband who had the good sense to divorce Ms. Fraser, fornicator ordinaire, adulterer sub-ordinaire. Go to Italy and have an affair with a shriveled Frenchman? A Parisian professor of aesthetics? Could you make a more limp choice among all the males available in Italy? (Note that irritating 2nd person usage.) Dear former husband, excellent choice that divorce -- although you must have had quite a draining year of marriage trying to fill the vast emotional pit of Ms Fraser.The self indulgent Fraser woman's poorly written observations about her &quot;recovery&quot; from divorce while swannning her way across Italy with other women's husbands is an insult to every abandoned, divorced woman trying to raise her children while her husband bops off with an emotionally arrogant Fraser clone.Ms Fraser's piece of print is not non-fiction. It is a piece of self delusion."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"Okay- I know I sound harsh, but I get angry when I read books like this one that defends self-serving, illicit affairs while disguising their true colors in tales of romance, mystery, intrigue,and great sex.Ms. Fraser - get a new therapist - one that will have the courage to point out your own insecurities couched in narcissistic behaviors. Sleeping with married men is not romantic. And it ain't very nice either! Granted, there are a lot of sleazy married men who are ready, able, and willing to bed just about anyone in a skirt who will accommodate them. Unfortunately, there are many lost, hurt, and insecure women who are willing to believe the lies and perpetuate the inevitable pain to so many others that follows.I confess I did not read the whole book. After reading about half of the book, I couldn't justify reading another word. I don't think the author is a bad person. I think she was going through a tough time and was desperate to feel better. But this kind of writing is irresponsible, especially for young women who experience heartache, and are encouraged to make reckless decisions which will often lead to short term relief and long term devastation.It's hard to believe Ms. Fraser actually included this quote that she used to defend her decision to sleep with Professor M in her book: \\"Finding pleasure is more important than any of the constraints society might put on people's inclinations to \\"forgather\\" together.\\"I notice Ms. Fraser wrote this book in 2001. Hopefully she likes herself enough now to choose healthier relationships and use her writing talents to send more positive messages to her fellow women!"},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"This is such a wonderful book! It took a few pages to lure me into the second person, but once I was there, I could not put the book down! Thanks for sharing your story Laura!"},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"I read another book by Ms. Fraser which was an excellent journalistic investigation of the weight loss industry. And I was very intrigued to see that she has written a novel, a memoir.I loved this book! Her use of the second person narrative was so refreshing and maintains the feeling that the book was written for her closest friends. Her descriptions of each locale, while inspired and exotic, were also believeable and compelling. It made me want to stock my kitchen with fresh basil, tomatoes and spicy olives, just in case friends drop by who actually have time for a chat. Or better yet, to get my plane tickets in order!The first visit, in Florence, I have such an affinity with, because I took a vacation there with the man who would later become my husband. The book made me remember again the incredible experience of being with someone who loves the exploration of a beautiful time and place as much as you do, and on the same &quot;level&quot; you do. I think folks dream for such and experience with a lover, and never get it. Some not even with their spouses. I imagine that a person finishing book and seeing the &quot;this is a true story&quot; on the last page just wouldn't believe it, but then think, &quot;well could be, I hope so at least.&quot;I admire her because she has related a painful time in her life while creating a beautiful story. Readers may sense that this healing process is not only true to the author, but could be true for anyone who has had to heal from a broken heart.Of course, not everyone choses to heal in the places she did! This is what I think makes it not just a decent book about relationship-recovery, but a book we remember. Others would love to heal in places like Morocco, with a wonderful person. But she actually leapt at the opportunity, and had the ability and talent to make it a story of stories. How many of us have the courage to take those kind of chances?She could have written this like a basic travelogue. A book like this could have been banal, or it could have been overly sexual or a trite &quot;bodice ripper&quot;. It could have been too jaded and bitter, it could have been self-absorbed. But happily it is none of these things. This book, to me, is about what can happen when you open yourself to new experiences. Readers who themselves have been rewarded by taking chances, as well as those to afraid to, will take something valuable out of this book. We might like to step &quot;outside of the box&quot; and evolve and not just grow old. Or we can read authors like Ms. Fraser, who make us feel we are there with her while she does the stepping out.I feel grateful Laura Fraser chose to share her versatile writing talent with the rest of the reading world. I finished the book feeling happy and hopeful.I hope she writes another book soon.7-8-01"},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"the story is attractive, i could't put down the book until the ending. but after reading the ending, i had a feeling being cheated. the author tactically combined her divorce healing process with her seductive romance. these two things happened at the same time but not necessarily twined together. the disappearance of the romance and phone call to her ex-husband seem abrupt, irrelevant and not convincing. however she has succeeded because of the seductive book title and human beings' desire to peep into someone elses' private lives."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"It's been mentioned that the author's choice to write in the second person was confusing and annoying so I won't say more on that. Laura Fraser is an incomparable boor. To justify an affair with a married man by writing about it is unconscionable. Someone else mentioned and I agree that the only likable character in this novel was Laura's ex-husband. He's smart to have run for the proverbial hills and done so early. I could not stand her character. Her belief that she deserved some of her husband's family wealth simply for having been married to him for one measly year irked me, her dismissal of Professor M's wife as un-loving and cold to her husband was unfounded and her childish escapades in Stromboli, just sad. In her late 30s and still confused, Laura Fraser has a long road to decency. Also, I despised that she mentioned more than once that being blond and American is SUCH a feather in her cap that it would open innumerable doors. This woman is really irksome. Lastly, had the book's jacket in any way even hinted that her affair was with a married man, I would never have supported such drivel."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"In this &quot;turning-a-corner&quot; book, Laura Fraser recounts her affair with M., a married Parisian professor whom she meets while vacationing in Italy (specifically Ischia---made visually famous in the film &quot;The Talented Mr Ripley.&quot;) At 35+, Laura is sensitive about her weight and particularly vulnerable about herself as a woman all due to the emotionally depleting fact that her husband, a San Francisco lawyer has left their less than 2 year marriage for another woman. Enter the professor--an intriguing combination of sophistication and magnanimousity in as much as he seems to know what Laura needs even before she does while worshiping her body in a way that her husband never has, would or even could. Although Laura knows from the get-go that there is no future to their relationship, she cannot help but wonder about what could be. She moves through the self-questioning phases of her divorce and her feelings about her inadequacy in the light of the failure of her marriage. Only the short duration rendez-vous with M. act as steadying high points of light in the otherwise dark tunnel portion of her life. However, rather than detail the agony of vulnerability, the author cheerfully focuses mainly on the magical healing quality that the pure physical pleasure her relationship with M induces. Wise M. knows instinctively when she is healed and without a fuss he disappears as quietly as he appears. As additional succor of the gods, Fraser includes wonderful travelogue descriptions of exotic trysting places while simultaneously reporting her progress towards a new life through the acute observations that M. makes each time they meet in a new locale.The story is told in the second person a la Italo Calvino; this technique moves the tale along quickly and smartly. Originally, I picked this book up thinking it was a novel and intrigued as it seemed to be about Italy, a country I have an immense fondness towards. Even though, the story is true, and has less to do with Italy than I first perceived, I would still recommend it as a pleasant 2 evenings worth of fast and fun reading."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"This book was great! I read it in one day! This is a yummy, satisfying read. I just finished the book and I am seriously considering reading it all over again because I am not ready to put it down. This book took me away to Italy, San Francisco and other exotic locations, while fulfilling fantasies of being savored as a beautiful woman, with a woman's body.Read this book!"},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"Great reading! This is a great book, in that it not only tells a story, but reads exactly like a travel guide! Laura's travel escapades are fantastic! What a great way to mend a broken heart! In my opinion, her husband was terrible! She was lucky that he left her! This book, was a &quot;rite of passage&quot; for Laura, while she was getting divorced. The beautiful, rich descriptions of this great country were fabulous! If you love Italy, ever wanted to go to Italy, or are thinking of going, you must read this book!"},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"With out a doubt, this book should be rated a 5+. Ms. Fraser presents the most fascinating descriptions of the local residents in the various places they visited. I felt like I, too, was traveling with them, enjoying the side trips, the bed and breakfasts, savoring the food, wine and coffees in all the places they vacationed. The love affair is beautifully articulated. Ms. Fraser shows us the many facets of all kinds of relationships. What I liked about her book is that she allows the reader to become intimate with her views, thoughts and feelings and also those of the Professor. Her descriptions of the social life in San Francisco is right on point and probably is true of the way many people interact in any city in the U.S. as compared to international cities. Ms. Fraser shows us the cultural differences.An Italian Affair is most definitely a second read and I think a sequel is in order!"},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"The title of this book led me to purchase it. Like other books set in Italy, I expected more of an emphasis on the country and its people. Laura Fraser's book should simply be entitled \\"Sordid Affair - Some of It Even Happened in Italy.\\" Ms. Fraser does head to Italy several times to have her affair with the professor, but she also meets him in London, Morocco, and California. The professor is from France, but he is one quarter Italian. Maybe that is the Italian Affair she refers to. When they get together they happen to speak Italian. That could be it, too. I just don't know.The book is about a woman whose husband left her for another woman and she then has an affair with a married man from France. This affair is part of her story for dealing with her emotions post marriage. The married man in this story has two children in what appears to be an open marriage. He is a most unlikable character. He is very narcissistic, hedonistic, and snobbish. He revels in hearing about Laura's trysts with other men.Laura, at first, is a sympathetic character. She is the wronged woman. As you get further into the book, you realize she is a train wreck. She drives down the wrong side of the road in the affairs of life and is consistently surprised to see that things don't work out.I would encourage you to read another book if you are interested in Italy."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"Part travel-log, part story of a woman and her relationships - one in particular - over a period of several years. Apparently at least based on fact, if not pure non-fiction. An unusual mix and style, but it works reasonably well. I read it because we were about to head off to Italy, so I was interested in the traveller's tales and experiences in Italy. Also includes holidays and short breaks in other parts of the world. As travel tales sometimes go, this is light and easy to read - but I doubt I would have chosen to read it if I hadn't been planning an Italian break."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"First let me say that I did enjoy reading this memoir of travel and love.But I wasn't really able to FEEL why Laura fell for the professor in the first place. I understand why she began an affair with him - being on the rebound from her failed marriage. I can see why she repeated her encounters with him, they seemed to be good travel companions and liked the same things most of the time. But why the professor? Why not, for example, Fabio, the music teacher she meets while visiting Stromboli?Maybe Laura Fraser wrote this book when she had already put a considerable emotional distance between herself and the professor, but at least for me this story didn't sizzle enough emotionally. Maybe it was also because she wrote the book in the &quot;you&quot; form, avoiding the much more personal &quot;I&quot; perspective...Throughout the book I was trying hard to understand what made the professor so special in her eyes - and ultimately failed to see it. This is not to say that the book doesn't have its highlights but interestingly, at least for me, these highlights are almost always things that are outside the relationship, things that have nothing to do with the professor, who appears to be more self-involved than anything else anyway.Laura Fraser's memoir somewhat reminded me of a French novel with a similar topic that was a bestseller in Europe in the early 90s: &quot;Salt on Our Skin&quot; by Benoite Groult. Although a novel, it is a lot more emotionally intense than Ms. Fraser's book. It's out of print, but if you can find a copy grab it - it's really worth it."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"Bored with your life? Dissatisfied with your relationship? An Italian Affair is an excellent short-term remedy. It's an armchair travel romance, with exotic islands, deserted beaches, sumptuous feasts, a sensual Frenchman, and tasteful sex - lots of it. The story is written it in the first person, and while this device seems forced at first, it eventually helps the reader slip into Laura's character and live vicariously. It gives this memoir a unique voice.Although An Italian Affair is a wonderful beach book, it has substance as well. The underlying story of Laura's abandonment by her husband and the way in which this affair helped her heal gives weight to the narrative. I liked this book very much. The author captures well the experience of falling in love with a man from a different culture. An Italian Affair sent my mind spinning backward to when I had a similarly delicious experience, and I liked that part best of all. Thanks, Laura."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"Here is what happened to me....I bought this book on a whim. I was not sure I would like it. I started it on a Sunday. I finished it on a Monday. I read it in Illinois, but for two days I felt like I could have been in Italy, San Francisco or Morroco. I mean to say I loved this book!!!!! I was totally transported to another world and I felt I was involved in a love affair. I highly recommend this book. It is a wonderful memoir on many levels, a love story, a travelogue, a tutorial on how to get over a broken heart, and a simply put, just a really good read. It will be difficult to go to work tomorrow as opposed to an Italian island with the love of my life......"},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"Page after luring page, Laura Fraser's story is delightful, evocative, and above all, personal to the core. Her conversational style is intriguing, sexy, gutsy. Loved it! As an author myself with a book about Italy, I wish I could go back and add Laura's title to my own book's suggested list of &quot;books that depict Italy&quot;."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"As someone who shares Frasers hometown of San Francisco as well as a love affair with Italy, I read this book with the eye of experience.Each chapter flows with an integrity of emotions and spirit of place that connects to our hearts in a way that only an old, true friend can.Fraser's insights are layered in gentle humor and observation yet stunningly profound in their grace. I did not want the book to end."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"Somebody PLEASE tell me persuasively why this book is worth reading! It's written (so very clumsily and annoyingly) in the second person. If you have been to any of the places the writer mentions--I've been to Paris, London, Ischia, Naples, Stromboli--you'll know that her descriptions are lazy and romantic generalizations. There is nothing compelling about her story: many of us women, 30-somethings and older, have been involved in relationships with married men. What, exactly, about her relationship sheds light on what so many women have experienced? Did she get stronger and grow and learn something because of the relationship? If so, it's not described in the book. Her telling of her experience makes her sound very, very shallow. I was kind of ashamed for her, especially since it's a true story and she's baring her life to the public.Reading this, I had to think of all the relationships I and my friends have had that could trump the author's. She just had the will to write about it and get published. Good on her for that!This is mind candy. I read the whole thing while I was in the laundromat. If you need something to read while the clothes tumble in the dryer, then I guess this one is OK. If you want something that gives you insight or a reason to think, look elsewhere.As another reviewer wrote, this is &quot;drivel&quot;."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"Does every American divorced woman take off for Italy immediately following her receipt of the final decree dissolving her marriage? And does every one of them find true love in that country?There have been too many similar books published just ahead of this one for there to be anything innovative about the theme here.And author Laura Fraser has written this book entirely in the second person, like a beauty article in a hackneyed women's magazine. (The whole work scans to, \\"First, you take an egg and you mix in a bit of good olive oil, then you spread it on your face.\\"\\") After a couple of pages, boy, does this self-conscious styling get tiring!I cannot agree with the majority of other Amazon readers who posted complimentary reviews about this book; I found AN ITALIAN AFFAIR to be predictable, stilted and, altogether, a waste of time."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"I cannot believe believe this writer graduated from Berkely! If I cared that much about it, I would count the number of times she used the word YOU! It drove me crazy and would have put it down had I not been stuck in Charles De Gualle airport for 24 hours. Ischia sounds nice....but don't bother, there's too much good stuff to read!"},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"This book is charming, from start to finish. It is billed as non-fiction. If it were fiction, something dramatic would have to happen. But as it is, this memoir of an angst-free international affair reads like a cross between an early Susan Cheever novel like &quot;Looking for Work&quot; and a Shirley Hazzard novel set in Italy, like &quot;The Evening of the Holiday.&quot; The book is drenched in Mediterranean food and sunlight. The narrator, Laura, is a lovely woman, a big blonde American, perhaps just a tad too concerned with her weight. (How many more conversations can we women be subjected to about diets? It's boring and it holds us back!) There's a lot of sex in this book, yet Laura is never explicit, and frankly, I'd like to know more about her lover. I nearly didn't read this book because of the author's weird decision to employ the second person voice. Why did she do this? After a couple of pages I didn't notice it, the way you don't notice subtitles on a foreign film after a moment. Despite this, the writing is crisp, the organization is simple but enviable, and I highly recommend this book to any woman looking for a charming, diverting read."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"Imagine you are going through a divorce yourself and fantasizing about spending a month in Italy where you will get over your loss by letting a man charm you at every village you visit. Browsing through the guidebooks you chance upon Laura Frasers memoir and promptly snap it up.Imagine your horror, when, after flipping through the first 20 pages you realize that Fraser is going to tell you her whole story in the second person. How annoying, you think. How willing she was to take the easy way out.But you read on anyway, entertained by her little tale. Never quite understanding what exactly it was she saw in the professor. Wondering why their lovemaking sounds so bland and boring.When you come to the part where she meets a really cute and sexy 100 percent Italian man who is AVAILABLE but she passes him up, you understand why Fraser wrote in the second person. You too would be embarrassed to own up to such foolishness."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"I chose this book because I've enjoyed everything I've read by Laura Fraser -- she writes well -- and because I've lived in Italy and wanted a chance to reminisce. The book did not disappoint me. I enjoy Fraser's sensitive, aware, and slightly sarcastic approach to things; I had some difficulty with the story line -- after several encounters with her Italian lover, I began to getfrustrated with him & I hoped that she would give him the boot. I understood at first -- Fraser's husband leaves her for an old girlfriend, she heads off to Europe to sooth her soul, she meets the beautiful professor on an island near Naples, they have an affair, sensuas, sexual -- I'm tracking so far -- but the continued, ongoing meetings in the States and abroad, that seem to be entirely at his discretion, at his beck and call, are more of a challenge to accept. Fraser is a smart, self-accepting woman, and I was a little disappointed that she would be in this type of a relationship. This would be a great little book if it were fictional. Because it is autobiographical rather than fictional, I find myself wanting to take Fraser aside on occasion and ask her what she is doing."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"When I read &quot;An Italian Affair&quot;, I couldn't put the book down. I read it all in one night. My love and passion to be able to visit Italy someday with someone special had me caught in Laura Frazier's heart and in her words. &quot;M&quot; (the professor) takes her places she never thought possible. &quot;M&quot; took ME places in my heart, I never thought still existed! If you like the mix of romance and travel, this is the book to read. Great job Laura!!!"},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"I loved this book. After I had a horrible heart wrenching break up, a friend lent it to me. I found it uplifting and inspiring. It showed a womans confidence and strength in getting through hard times. Its about finding yourself after losing your self in someone else. I would highly recommend this book to any woman to read at any point in their life."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"I've never been more moved by a non-fiction book. Fraser takes us right there, right to the center of her heart. Sometimes I want to kick her for all the wasted thinking she spends on her fink ex-husband, but her healing process is completed during the course of a novel. I was with her every step of the way, rooting. The only down side to the book is that for her to write another account as moving, she'd have to go through more bad experiences! Hopefully, Fraser will switch to fiction or write non-fiction accounts about somebody else."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"One of my favorite travel books. This is what some of us fantasize about, exotic islands, an affair with a Frenchman and lots of good food and wine! Laura Fraser is an excellent writer, I was really moved by this book!Please read it!"},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"I picked up this book because I read a magazine article (based on a chapter in the book)and enjoyed the writing. As expected, I loved the author's evocative descriptions of the varied destinations she visits as well as the delicious food she enjoys. What I did not enjoy were her descriptions of herself and her pitiful relationships. Many of the characters, especially her older lover, are unlikable and even a little mean. Her descriptions of herself (her photo on the back of the book shows she is an attractive woman) are self conscious and way too focused on her weight. While confident enough to travel by herself, the author cannot keep herself out of a destructive relationship. At the end I wished I didn't know as much about her as I did. For me, the author should stick with writing about her travels and keep her private life to herself."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"Real and engrossing, this book kept my attention the entire way through and is a revealing look into the nature of love and forgiveness. The author took a chance when writing in the second person, and it worked for me."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"I loved this book! From the moment I started reading, I felt as if the author (Laura Fraser) was a good friend and we were having an intimate conversation about her life. The conversation was difficult for her at times, especially when she shared her feelings of sadness about the break up of her marriage and the betrayal she felt. It pulled at my heartstrings having experienced the same emotions myself. I couldn't put the book down and stayed up well into the wee hours of the morning wanting to know how everything turned out for Laura. Her description of her travels, meeting the professor, returning to her home and friends, all keep my attention. Laura grew as a person from these experiences. She gained self confidence and her broken heart was healed. What an inspiring story to those of us who have found ourselves in similiar situations. Way to go Laura! Well done!"},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"Reader beware: this book is written in the second person. I found this HIGHLY ANNOYING. As a result, I cast the book aside for a few weeks before finally picking it up and finishing it. That said, I found her descriptions of her travels to be complete. In the end, I must admit, I found myself wondering what happened next in her life..."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"It isn't often that I read a book at one sitting. I just felt swept along by An Italian Affair. It is, by turns, heartbreaking, hilarious, life-affirming, delicious, and uplifting. I never wanted it to end! Give it to all your girlfriends--especially those who need a reminder that even if they aren't always in love, they're always lovable."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"Okay, let me get this straight: the narrator's heart is broken when her husband commits adultery, so she goes to Italy and mends said broken heart by sleeping with a MARRIED MAN???? How do you spell hypocrite? Sorry, I abandoned this one as soon as her clothes came off. She is not sympathetic in the least, and that second person narration is incredibly irritating. Maybe she refers to herself as \\"you\\" in order to get some distance from her guilt.The travel descriptions are nice, at least in the first few chapters. But go to Italy instead. You'll feel better about yourself in the morning."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"....because I was looking for a high spot from which to throw it! (Unfortunately, I borrowed it from a friend so I couldn't. At least it's not an embarrassment on my bookshelf).Two hundred and twenty-six pages of complete drivel. That's all you need to know."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"I loved reading about Italy and the other places she visited with the Professor. This book was a fun read. Laura's husband left her for another woman. Laura did something I would love to do after a breakup, she went to Europe to visit friends and did a lot of traveling by herself. [This book has given me the inspiration to one day soon travel to Italy by myself.] While visiting she met her Italian lover, Professor M. What an affair. The places they met in were too interesting. This is a good book to read if you are lonely for Italy. I was yearning for Italy after visiting last year in November, I came across this book and decided to read it to help me get through this period of yearning and it helped a lot, so theraputic for me. Signed, going back to Italy."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"Laura Fraser's autobiographical memoir of finding love in the most wonderful of places (literally!) with a French Art Professor is a real treat of a book. We should all thank her for sharing her remarkable experiences around the globe with her intelligent and eloquent Frenchman at her side.. it makes for a fascinating read...It was lovely to be able to see her go from wounded newly-separated wife to a freer and more open version of herself, at first drawn to love and sex and ideas with her new companion, and then ready to take on the rest of her life, bouyant, rejuvenated, and hopeful, when the chapter in her life that is this book comes to an end. A real treat."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"I found the narrative style (using you instead of I) so annoying that I didn't bother finishing the book. This author teaches magazine writing so surely she had a good reason for using this style. Any ideas on the reasoning? By the way, I have loaned this book to friends who loved it so maybe it is just me."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"Most fittingly I recently read this book on a flight from New York to Venice. As in flight entertainment it was enjoyable. The author's pain and vulnerability in the face of the collapse of her marriage is touching and honestly rendered, but I found the Professor not to be terribly appealing. The descriptions of various travel locales were wonderful, but the author's choosing to write the book in the second person was annoying and distracting."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"Until I can really afford the pleasure to be a world traveller I shall live vicariously through the many author's lives whose memoirs have touched me so deeply and have even sustained my yearning to visit the extraordinary places they write about. Amongst these great authors is Laura Fraser. Her memoir, in which I have just finished, completely captivated me from the first page. It was not so much the love affair that captured my heart but rather her elaborate depiction of every city and every island that she and her lover visited together. It is not hard to feel as though you are there with them in the most enchanting places. I suggest to anyone that shares such a \\"joie de vive\\" to buy this book, sit down with a bottle of wine and emmerse yourself in the warmth and amazing beauty of it's pages! \\"Ricorda e non dimenticare, non \`e mai sbagliato amare.\\"(From \\"An Italian Affair\\")"},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"This book is a very quick read but it is beautiful, sensual and fun. Fraser chronicles a jet-set love affair with a French man after a divorace. I read it once a year while lounging in the sunshine. The descriptions of food, place and character are vivid and delicious. Be sure to have some crusty bread, fresh mozzarella, tomato, basil, and olive oil on hand while reading this book!"},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"Be sure to pack An Italian Affair in your suitcase this summer. I found the second-person, present tense voice a bit distracting at first, but I was quickly drawn into the story and stayed up late on a camping trip, reading by flashlight. Laura keeps the focus on the magical places the lovers visit and their feelings, not on the sex. Laura, although self-deprecating, has an inner strength and pride, and her lover at times displays a surprising wisdom about life. A quick, uplifting read. Enjoy this book with a good glass of wine, wherever your travels take you this summer!"},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"While I liked the story itself (light, easy, didn't make me think too deeply, perfect for the beach) and am glad I read it (heck, I could have written it!), by page 30, I got annoyed by Ms. Fraser's use of the second person singluar. You go for a walk...you kiss him... you watch the island disappear. It disturbed my reading experience, because I had flashes of \\"no, not me, YOU, Laura Fraser, YOU walked to the harbor, YOU kissed him\\"! Other than that, perfectly enjoyable book - I really identified with the writer many times, and enjoyed some of her insights into how we, women, universally think."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"Seriously, to all the naysayers - lighten up! In the beginning, I too was upset that M. was married and had 2 kids. I didn't think I could like this guy at all... but really, it wasn't about him. Admittedly, Laura's troubles about having a dalliance with him were glossed over rather quickly... you'd think a woman who was cheated on would have more qualms about that kind of thing. But honestly, M. was there to fill a need (and no, not just sexually). The main character was emotionally devastated and mentally drained by the divorce from her husband. The fact that they had been married just a year in some ways made it even worse - Laura's world had been upended quickly and unexpectedly - so yeah, I would expect someone dealing with that situation and the resulting depression to act quite out of character and irrationally.The reasons why I gave the book five stars is that it transports you into this other life - sensual, filled with sunshine and beaches, incredible cities, mouthwatering food and wine, and yes, great sex :) Having just gone thru a bad break-up myself, An Italian Affair made this past Valentine's Day weekend bearable. I don't know why so many people have issues with the way the book was written (unless you're a hetero guy, but really, don't you know enough to at least skim a book a little before you decide to fork over your hard-earned money for it??). I thought the writing style actually gave this book a true escapist feel - I wanted to be experiencing these travels myself, and since I certianly don't have the money right now for a plane ticket or a fabulous hotel, then The Italian Affair at least did a great job of making me feel like I've still had some experience of all of these fantastic places. I guess the only thing that made me feel like the book was unfinished is that there was no further mention of the sweet (and hot!) Italian man Laura meets at the end..."},{"Title":"An Italian Affair","review":"Airy, smart and sweet are the three best words that I can use to describe this memoir. It suffers a little bit from its specificity (I do not think that it would appeal to all readers) and then a little bit more from its girly magazine-article tone. As a travel book, it is incomplete-- the relationship issues detracting from the scenery. As a relationship book, the travel episodes add a nice touch. They provide the reader with the exotic along with the comfortable.The use Fraser makes of the second person narration has been mentioned elsewhere, and I do not wish to belabor the point. However, it seriously detracts from the charms of the book and tends to make the really very nice prose sound like a poor Duras imitation. I would be interested to read something else by Fraser, but in the next outing I hope that she leaves this particular affectation at home.I would recommend this book as a nice beach read this summer.

The perfect mix of flirtatious romance, exotic scenery and food, and an occasional outpour of tender emotions makes this book refreshingly enticing. The liberal sprinkling of Italian phrases is a charm rather than a distraction because the author skillfully makes sure that her readers understand the conversation.This is a first person narrative written in a second person style.

Easily one of the best books of its' year, of any year, for that matter, at first glance it seems to be a standard thriller/mystery, with the unlikable (somewhat) journalist at its core, and some weird murders. But Banks spins a plot that's so knotty you miss the obvious, like the best mysteries the solution makes you go &quot;Why didn't I see that?&quot; Plus his command of the language is heads and shoulders above anyone else around, the characters seem to have more than three dimensions, the flashbacks literally tingle with realism, you don't read this story as much as you're drawn into it. Fortunately it's fairly short, or you'll find yourself neglecting family and friends trying to finish it in one sitting. It's quite possible. And yes, there are some brutal moments but the scary part of it is that it's nothing worse than you'll have read in your local newspaper. And the ending is nigh perfect, as good as they come. Having read Banks' science-fiction books I wasn't sure what to expect from his &quot;regular&quot; fiction but except that one genre has spaceships and ray guns, there's little difference, it's the same top quality. Read anything with this guy's name on it and harass the publishers until we get more of this guy's book in this country. You'll be glad for it."},{"Title":"Complicity","review":"This is the first of Bank's non-SciFi novels that I have read. His Culture series of stories had me so roped in, I thought I would give his 'regular' fiction a try...I was not disappointed.This is an action packed thriller that keeps changing the reader's perspective from a crusading murderer...to Scottish journalist (who is man with a number of flaws!). When describing the killer's actions, he keeps using 2nd person - such as 'You open the door' or 'You disarm the alarm'. So you are along for the ride in the passenger seat for each graphic misadventure.I was quickly engaged by the characters, who are all well thought out. The main character is like an onion, with surprise after surprise becoming aparent as the layers are peeled back."},{"Title":"Complicity","review":"This is a presentation of an alternative moral viewpoint but wrapped up as a murder-mystery. As a murder mystery it's entertaining though not brilliant. As a pointer to alternative views of our Western society it is thought provoking.It's not a novel for people with weak stomachs. The murders are gruesome, a characteristic of Banks writing, though the violence is not gratuitous; it's there for a reason. Nor is it for those who suffer nightmares easily. It is certainly not for those who accept what authority, be it legal, religious or moral, tells us to think.It is a novel for those who are prepared to think what mainstream society believes unthinkable. It's a novel that provokes thought about the inequitable, brutal, and irrational culture that Western society has become. For those with an open, enquiring and above all a suspicious mind this will add fuel to any distrust of authority.Don't expect to be uplifted, this is as dark as it gets, but then that's how the world is turning out. Read it and think..... while you're still allowed to."},{"Title":"Complicity","review":"I have just read Banks' novels A Song Of Stone and Complicity back-to-back. It hasn't been an especially pleasant experience; A Song of Stone is a pretentious, mean-spirited, violent, and not especially well-written book, and this one is mean-spirited and violent, and not especially well written either. At least it isn't pretentious.Here we have a reprobate, lefty Scottish hack who is unwittingly drawn into the police inquiry into a serial killer, when Inspector Knacker realises that the victims were all named in a single article written by the journalist a number of years previously. It's a frame up, Guv - or is it? Banks has a bob each way for about half the novel; cunningly (or tiresomely, depending on how you look at it) adopting the second person singular voice when recounting the grisly deeds of the murderer (and they are recounted in graphic detail: the squeamish should take the next exit and follow the signs back to Helen Fielding), but all the while else writing from Colley's first person perspective. So does Colley know the killer? Is it Colley himself? Is he an accomplice? Maybe he's schizophrenic! Surely, Iain Banks wouldn't stoop to such a level...And nor - I think - does he. The split narration a pretty neat device for creating suspense, but rather than stringing it out, Banks changes tack mid way through and reveals the killer's identity, at which point the second person singular narratives stop, and a pretty convoluted back-story emerges, involving, as is seemingly inevitable in Banks' fiction, unpleasant childhood flashbacks.This in turn gives perspective to the political/moral issues which gallivant throughout the book, but which are finally bludgeoned to death in a very poor denouement, in which Banks contrives to put his two main protagonists in a bunker on an island arguing intently about the rights and wrongs of the situation. Banks' writing, usually deft at handling this sort of situation, steers like a cow on this occasion.All is ultimately thrown into confusion again in the final couple of pages with the reintroduction of the second person narrative voice, previously only associated with the Killer. So was it Colley all along? Beats me. Hard on the heels of the obnoxious Pol Sci 101 lecture in from the bunker, I really didn't care.For all this, Complicity has had some (questionable) literary influence though: Irvine Welsh's protagonist DS Bruce Robertson in his genuinely dire novel, Filth, is heavily indebted to Cameron Colley - it's difficult to see Welsh devising a boozing, drug-doing, sex mad hypocritical Scotsman harbouring an internal parasite without having seen this first. Which makes Welsh's achievement all the more paltry.On the other hand, I think Banks owes a debt of gratitude to Thomas Harris - there is a distinctly Lecterish feel to the machinations of the Serial Killer.In summary, this is not as great a book as some would have you believe: Banks' style is refreshingly different at first, but when - as I just have - you read a couple of them back to back, the tricks in his magician's bag begin to reveal themselves."},{"Title":"Complicity","review":"Cameron Colley is an Edinburgh-based journalist with a habit for speed (both drug and motion), an obsession for computer games, and a highly developed sense of moral outrage. As a journalist, he worships the patron of all gonzos, St. Hunter S. Thompson, and his righteous indignation is expressed in print as exposes on cheap liquor, defense boondoggles, and inept judges. Of course Cameron is not without sin--no self respecting protagonist could be--and his is an adulterous affair and an abuse of substances. But he is a likable enough rogue that it would be hard to suspect him of a string of grisly revenge murders against a host of wealthy capitalists and political powermongers. We, however, get to see the story from his point-of-view, and the police don't.Iain Banks is one of my favorite authors, someone I truly admire for his ability to switch between genres like a chameleon changes colors. Under Iain M. Banks, he writes adventure-based science fiction that not only entertains, but usually has a moral underpinning. Without the middle initial, his books are variously mystery, thriller, or mainstream, always good, always interesting. If Banks was not so popular with other readers, I would likely have created a biopage for him similar to the one I did for Jonathan Carroll. But Carroll is a cult writer while Banks has been recognized in England as one of their best and brightest by almost every body politic. The result is that he has quite a presence of fans available to keep his name on the net and his books out of the mid-list...To return to Complicity, it is a novel that is not without faults, although what one person might see as problematic another might have no difficulty with. For example, the beginning of each early chapter has a crime described in second person. Some people might be a little squeamish about phrases like \\"you hit him on the head with the tyre iron, and it sounds like egsshells cracking\\" (my words--this phrase doesn't actually appear). The sexual references are not for prudes, and, while not truly glorified, drug use is not condemned, and that does not sit well with some people either. For those with strong stomachs ant open minds, Complicity is a fine novel that is well worth your time."},{"Title":"Complicity","review":"This is one of Banks's non-science-fiction books. (thus no middle initial) It's a murder mystery starring an investigative reporter. The reporter starts out with an anonymous tipster leading him into a government scandal, and ends up the center of a murder investigation. There are twists, turns, and the wonderfully erratic/eccentric characters that Banks likes to use with the skill that he uses them, and it's a good read. Not my favorite work of his, but I'm biased -- I like the SF stuff better. It's older too -- 1993 first pub, available here (here=US) only since 2002. Good, fun, entertaining, engaging stuff. Recommended."},{"Title":"Complicity","review":"Iain Banks - you've done it again. Take this book home and if you are a person willing to ride the wave of conspiracy, murder and exacting revenge - this is the story for you. We are introduced to a self-obsessed, depressive and slightly intriguing Scottish Journalist, who is on the highlands newspaper squad. Immediately, and soon into the book, we can see that this poor Hack has a difficult story coming up. Someone is giving leads, tips and ideas that suggest trouble is brewing. Step further into the book and you have a cleverly YOU vs ME narrative. If read with full attention, you are drawn into the novel and experience a certain disturbing &quot;I am there&quot; feeling. The pace is excellent, and Bank's ease with mod cons combined with thrilling storytelling provides a &quot;can't put it down&quot; scenario. The ending is slightly predictable, which lets the novel down, but it is still an exciting climax. There are moral questions throughout and the author paints a frank picture, leaving no controversial moment to our own imagination. This book confirms Bank's place in history as a truly remarkable author. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Complicity","review":"The first non SF Banks book I read, it contains all the ingredients of a classic thriller; Corruption, several brutal murders, and a flawed central character with a sense of alienation. In common with his other work, of both genres, it illuminates the dark side of peoples's consciousness whilst exploring their emmotional frailties. Unique humour, blended with tragic and macabre circumstances, has become a hallmark of Banks' work. Comic highlights include the apparent house break-in, resembling the previous murders, that transpires to be Cameron Collie's on-going sado-masochistic relationship with his friend's wife, and throughout the novel his attitudes to just about everyone he meets. The eventual unmasking of the killer is both shocking and thought provoking and leads to a gripping conclusion that leaves the reader feeling both entertained and satisfied."},{"Title":"Complicity","review":"This is a modern masterpiece and not just because Banks talks about the &quot;highly controversial&quot; topic of masturbation and graphic sex, but because it's so blinkin' good; approaches issues and points in a manner so as they're not in there for the sake of it. He actually wants them in there. His pen leaks them, rather than scrawls them dispassionately. Or his keyboard, as the case may well be.Which brings to another point: never before has the geekdom of video-games (i.e. Despot) been so brilliantly juxtaposed with a hip personality (Colley is undoubtedly hip, oh yes). It's mindblowing how he managed to pull it off and those flashbacks of his childhood: incredible.It should be in every bedside table in every hotel across the globe. Forget the Bible. It's old hat. Enter ... dum dum dum ..... COMPLICITY."},{"Title":"Complicity","review":"I regard this as the best of all Banks' books bar Use of Weapons and The Bridge. This was the first novel of his that I read and it hooked me from the start. At times it's horrifying, not only in its depictions of the &quot;Red Avenger's&quot; brutal murders and assaults, but more sinisterly in the way the reader is encouraged to almost rejoice in these deaths - the men involved deserve it. Or do they? Banks does not entirely agree with his murderer's actions. It's one thing to fantasise but another to act out your fantasies. Alleviating the gloom and the horror, at least in the first half of the novel, is a demonic sense of humour, gleefully savaging Tories (only metaphorically here) in particular. Appropriately the humour dries up as the full implications of the murders and their effect on the protagonist are gradually revealed. The conclusion is a real sickener, offering no hope or redemption; a perfect denouement for a thoroughly disturbing, shocking and yet perversely entertaining novel."},{"Title":"Complicity","review":"Surely there is a law against prose like:'It's a Finnish hunting knife, which you think is pretty appropriate since you've used it to finish him off.'About a year ago I read an article in which I discovered that Iain Banks spends nine months of every year haring around Scotland and having a great time, then uses the remaining three months to write a book. As you would expect, a writer who produces novels as a filler between long periods of hedonistic gallavanting is unlikely to output anything of quality. Hence: Complicity.It's difficult to convey in this space the awfulness of Banks' prose, the vacuousness of his ideas, the masturbatory content. The book reads like a cross between FHM and a supermarket mystery novel. Avoid."},{"Title":"Complicity","review":"Let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of Banks' sci-fi work. I'm as big a fan as they come, and his sci fi is as good as it gets. The characterization, desciptions, plot, action, dialogue, all of it is outstanding. Imagine my surprise and dismay, then, to find that this book seems to have been written by someone else. Sure, the dark tone is there, but the character is unsympathetic, the plot is mush, and the setting is tepid. Maybe I've been spoiled by his over the top space opera, but this was a total waste of time. You may disagree..."},{"Title":"Complicity","review":"I wholly fail to understand what anyone finds to like in this book. It is occasionally gripping, but it is also depraved without being in the least bit incisive. If you are the type of person who symapathises with Charles Manson or Fred West, you might enjoy the violence, but if you have a shred of humanity in you, you will find the unremitting cruelty initially repuslive and ultimately boring. None of the characters are either believable or sympathetic, and the story rambled on for far too long. A total waste of time."},{"Title":"Complicity","review":"This was without doubt the worst, and most disgustingly offensive piece of trash i have ever laid my eyes upon. I would like to start a petition to have this book burnt alongside furbies and john cusack. Anyone with me?"},{"Title":"Complicity","review":"Iain Banks was born in Scotland in 1954 and published his first book - \\"The Wasp Factory\\" - in 1984. In the years since, he's won critical acclaim, topped best-seller lists and has even written Science Fiction books under the cunning nom-de-plume 'Iain M. Banks'. \\"Complicity\\" was first published in 1993, and is his seventh non sci-fi book.Cameron Colley is a journalist based in Edinburgh. working for \\"The Caledonian\\". He has an eye for trouble, and enjoys using his articles to take pot-shots at the 'establishment' and big business. His past-times include alcohol, drugs and a computer game called \\"Despot\\" - one which sounds very similar to Civ II. Cameron's social circle seems quite small - there's William and Yvonne, a couple he met at university. The pair are married, though Cameron has no qualms about enjoying Yvonne (in as kinky a manner as possible) on a very regular basis. There's also Andy, who Cameron has known pretty much all his life. Andy has 'achievment' written all over his past - he was an officer in the Falklands War and was subsequently awarded the DSO. On leaving the army, he went into advertising - where he came up with the BIG campaigns for several global companies. After that, he then opened a chain of very successful shops, became obscenely rich...and then, strangely, dropped out. Andy is now living in a dilapidated old hotel (his own, naturally) in the Highlands - doing little other than drink and drugs, apparently..Workwise, Cameron is quite possibly on the verge on something big : he has a mole feeding - \\"Mr Archer\\" - feeding him about five high-profile deaths within the nuclear and security services. All five victims died within two years of each other and, although all were officially written off as suicides, there have been rumours of something murky about the deaths. Cameron isn't the first to have looked into the story -however, he's hoping Archer's information will lead him somewhere. (If what's he's been told is true, it's quite possible it could lead to to Iraq).Unfortunately, while Cameron's working on his mole-inspired story, another set of very high-profile individuals are finding themselves being assaulted and / or murdered. The problem, as it turns out, is that all the victims have been lambasted in one of Cameron's articles.\\"Complicity\\" is definitely a book I'd recommend - which is hardly a surprise, given that it's been written by Iain Banks. Banks has a certain way of telling a story I enjoy - the occasional jump back and forward, and the hint of looking at something from a slightly different angle. Most of the book is told by Cameron (\\"I drive the car up the little single track road leading towards the low hills\\"), part of the book is also told about the killer. Although it does mean we know who's getting killed and how they're dying, practically nothing is given away about the killers identity. It's even (deliberately) vague about the killer's gender - for example, \\"you get to the bedside and raise the log over your head\\". Excellent stuff."},{"Title":"Complicity","review":"The book complicity is one of Iain Banks finest and most enjoyable book in his life as a writer. It pivots around a some what mysterious beginning when a journalist called Cameron Colley is seen as being a rapist, murder and a phycotic killers, although is this the case.

Banks denies that desire, almost denies the possibility of hope.Wasp Factory_was so grotty that I just plain old could hardly read it, and I did not have that problem with Complicity. Banks is a wonderfully talented writer, and his portrait of the twitchy burnt-out Colley deserves all the praise that it has received.I am less enamored of the switches in time and voice, particularly in the last third of the novel I found it to become increasingly intrusive and distracting.I suspect that I would not have given this book five stars even with a more uplifting tone, but it most certainly deserves four on the quality of the writing. I gave it three stars because I am plain old unable to stomach such bleak and fatal compromise.

Indeed, this relationship was frought, and in the end it is still to be decided weathe ror not it stood the test of time and prooved to be a good relationship or not.

I wouldnt say that about all my favorite books, I wouldn't reccomend Philip K. Dick to all of my friends, but this book I push on the literate world as a whole. As I said, Banks' use of language is incredible, and his tale is absolutely enthralling. In partciular, he uses First and second person in so wholly original a way, it's both simple and astounding. The only other book I've ever read that used Second person at all significantly was Jay McInerney's &quot;Bright Lights, Big City&quot;, which was a great story, but Banks uses it so much more effectively, and with so much clearer an effect in mind, not as some literary experiment but as a way to both hide the antagonist's identity and personalize his acts and his mentality in a way third person narration would be hard pressed to do, especially alongside the Main characters first person. In ! addition, Banks is so insanely honest with our protagonist's personality, for good and bad, that we have one of the most real, most liefelike, and least one-dimensional protagonists in the history of literature. Like Shakespeare, this book is both a thrill to read and a true contribution to English Literature."},{"Title":"Complicity","review":"Cameron Colley just isn't a very likable person. He's got poor self-control, a drug and alcohol habit, a severe gaming addiction, facilitates adultery, and... he's a journalist to boot! And when he is confronted with a series of gruesome murders that seem to be happening when he has no alibi, life gets even more complicated.Author Iain Banks puts the reader \\"inside\\" Colley's head, and it's not a pretty picture. Colley seems always on the edge of taking himself out, and when he is driving, taking out a few innocents as well. He is not obviously suffering from a mental disorder (except perhaps narcissism), but the drinking and drugs are relentless.It was difficult to feel sorry for Colley in Complicity, and this lack of empathy affected my interest in his life.

Either in reaction to his snide comments to his 'friends' or his obsessive manner when confronted with matters narcotic or carnal.

Iain Banks has an incredible imagination and is not afraid to explore the darker areas of human nature. Imo the best Scottish author writing just now. I've read 4 of his books and this is my second favourite , after &quot;The Crow Road&quot;"},{"Title":"Complicity","review":"This is possibly my favourite Banks book. Some people may think the violence gratuitous and if that sort of thing offends you then avoid this book! But I don't think most people would find anything offensive here and personally I found the violence quite entertaining. The plotline to this book is criticised by some here for being too obvious. This may or may not be the case, but there is always more that plot to enjoy in a Banks novel. For instance, The Crow Road's plot is drawn out across the whole, long book and at times it appears there isn't one at all, but the book is still totally absorbing. Banks's writing is engaging, witty and young and it is a breath of fresh air to read."},{"Title":"Complicity","review":"Iain Banks has lost the plot recently - buy this to see him at his best. This was far and away the most coherent of his books (having said that, some of the wilder ones were great fun - The Crow Road is a good example of that), and it's the one in which he nails his imagination to a solid plot. The result is thought-provoking and compelling."},{"Title":"Complicity","review":"A mystery and suspense novel that is remarkable in its narrative. Loved it. Banks' humour is superb and the politics right on!"},{"Title":"Complicity","review":"This was the 3rd Iain Banks novel I have read. Wasp Factory was dark, twisted, but kindof a waste. Crow Road was long, poignant and quite moving.Complicity is...well, somewhere in between. It reads more like a Thomas Harris (Red Dragon, Silence of the Lambs) and is pretty effective at maintaining the suspense level throughout. It was very imaginitive and Banks has a great mastery of language.I think the main reason I'm only giving it 3 stars is because I never felt like we got a chance to really know the characters. Like the characters were all running around doing stuff just to advance the plot. The problem with that approach is that you never really care about the main character. I understand that Banks likes to use \\"human\\" characters that aren't all warm and fuzzy, but sometimes they are so unlikable that it kinda kills the story (see Wasp Factory.) In this case, the main character, Cameron, isn't an awful guy (in fact he's pretty \\"real\\") but he's just not quite likeable enough to really get me to root for him. The relationship with Yvonne (and her husband) was very interesting and could have been an even bigger part of the story. Those were the portions where you finally felt like you got to know Cameron. The other problem is that the involvement of Andy as a pivotal character, seemed like it was thrown in there way too late in the game. In the Crow Road, Banks really let the reader see the relationships between all the characters and this made the plot much stronger, and more intriguing.I liked the changes in perspective and time. Banks always does this sortof thing well. I'm still a bit confused on one or two things, but not enough to ruin the experience.All in all, a good compelling read that is still far superior to most of the drivel that fills the bookshelves nowadays. I just wish Banks would dabble in the literary genre more often, because he has the goods to write really great novels."},{"Title":"Collectible Aluminum: An Identification and Value Guide Including Hammered, Wrought, Forged, and Cast","review":"I have been collecting hammered aluminum for many years and can honestly say that this is the worst book that I have ever seen on the subject.

The author's premise, that AIDS is manmade, the world is just full of conspiracies to keep the truth from us, etc, is simply not supported by any evidence. And his comment that AIDS can be transmitted by such contact as handling the sheets of patients, or by insects such as mosquitoes and bed bugs, just isn't true. If mosquitoes could spread AIDS, every person in the USA South would now be infected.This book is a cruel, poorly presented, lie that uses the suffering of people in order to make money for the author, in my opinion."},{"Title":"In tune with the world;: A theory of festivity","review":"Josef Pieper is probably best known for his book &quot;Leisure: The Basis of Culture.&quot; This book on festivity is a good companion to that volume. Pieper discusses festivity's contrast to ordinary, everyday work, but points out that festivity involves more than the absence of labor. Real festivity also requires a quality of spirit which makes enjoyment possible, and that quality of spirit is love. He says, &quot;One who loves nothing and nobody cannot possibly rejoice.&quot; The artificial festivals created by business can not possibly regenerate us the way festival is meant to do, because they are rooted in acquisitiveness rather than love and generosity of spirit. This is a beautiful book which will make you want to celebrate something truly festive!"},{"Title":"In tune with the world;: A theory of festivity","review":"Pieper's argument is outstanding, expansive and joyful. This particular edition, on the other hand, is riddled with typographical errors that make the reading more of an effort than it would otherwise be. One example is that the letter &quot;b&quot; often appears as the letter &quot;h&quot;. One wonders why these errors were allowed to make it into print and thus sully what is otherwise a very pleasant way to pass an afternoon."},{"Title":"In tune with the world;: A theory of festivity","review":"The principal thesis of Pieper's book is that festivity is first and foremost a celebration of being and the whole creation as gift. For Pieper festivity and worship are interconnected. As usual, Pieper's writing is crystal clear and a joy to read. On easter, he writes: \\"Easter itself, although it celebrates a historical event, could never be a real festival, let alone \\"the festival of the Church\\", if it were not more than and different from a mere memorial day. What is in truth involved is a mysterious contemporizing of this event, which evokes an incomparably more real present than memory can\\". This thought resonated with me following a week spent at Solemes Abbey, where each Mass was (and is) an extraodinary solemn and festive occasion. I experienced there a powerful sense of memory i.e. the Church's memory of the Lord's last supper and passion was a real lived and sacred memory which was being kind of breathed into my memory, so that it became my memory too."},{"Title":"In tune with the world;: A theory of festivity","review":"In Tune with the World is a fine translation of a German monograph on feasts and festivals by philosopher Josef Pieper. It is a short but high quality softcover with heavy paper, large print, and nice wide margins.I had never read anything of Pieper's before and knew only his name from hearing of \\"Liesure, the Basis of Culture.\\" I found him to be an interesting writer. He is a philosopher of Christian background who writes philosophy rather than religious texts. He references here Aquinas, Nietzsche, Rousseau and the French Revolution, and socialists from Hitler to Trotsky. He is therefore, squarely in the realm of the philosophical conversation of the 20th century.As for what festivity is, let me try to summarize his argument:Festivals are special days, and therefore require ordinary days to exist.Ordinary days are days consisting of servile work, that is, work that is not just busy but has meaning in the utilitarian support of life.The opposite of servile work is not non-work but non-utilitarian work.Therefore, festivals are days of non-utilitarian activity, or work that is meaningful in itself.In order to define festivals, then, one must be able to define work that is meaningful in itself.Historically, religious and philosophical authorities have defined contemplation--the joy of seeing the world--as the ultimate form of activity that has meaning in itself.In order to engage in contemplation, one must have existential wealth, or the ability to be joyful; i.e., festivity and nihilism are not compatible.Joy requires an object or reason for joy, and if festivity requires joy, festivity then requires an object or reason, such as an event like a marriage or birth.Events are reasons for joy only if they are microcosms of the essential goodness of the universe.Therefore, festivals are properly days for remembering or confirming the essential goodness of the universe: \\"To celebrate a festival means: to live out, for some special occasion and in an uncommon manner, the universal assent to the world as a whole.\\"Pieper goes on to examine other aspects of festivity, such as its ritual nature, its need to touch on something eternal, its relationship to art, Easter as its ultimate example, and its relationship to modernity, including the incompatibility of festivity with totalitarianism.Although Pieper writes in a somewhat serpentine fashion, digressing and then returning to his main point over and over, and can be hard to follow at times because of this, I think this would an interesting read for anyone serious about festivals and celebrations, Christian or not."},{"Title":"In tune with the world;: A theory of festivity","review":"Father Thomas Hopko has remarked, along with many others, that man is essentially homo adorans. That is, we are created to glorify and celebrate. God, the chief object of our glorification, and the very nature and cycle of our existence are the continual subjects of adoration and festive reflection across so many cultures and times. Even when the concept of God is removed from society, there persists the nagging need to commemorate and celebrate the past in terms quite religious. Memorial Day is a real anamnesis, Thanksgiving is eucharistic, etc. Some will disagree with this thesis, but I think it bears consideration.Pieper does something similar in his work by drawing on the ancient and more recent past to analyze the notions of Feast, sacred rest, and joy. This book ties in very well with his book on leisure and is very insightful. I would also recommend Alexander Schmemann's \\"For the Life of the World\\" as an excellent introduction to the sacramental worldview. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"In tune with the world;: A theory of festivity","review":"To be sure, this is a brilliant and thoughtful work, but it is so ponderously Germanic that it took me a year to get through this very thin book. True festivity, as the author defines it, comprises a great number of factors, most of which are predicated by an acknowledgment of God. I wish the author had made reference to more real-world examples than he did. He briefly mentioned the manufactured festivals of the French Revolution as examples of pseudo-festivity because of their secular, man-focused worship, but I would have liked him to expound on the praxis of true festivity as seen in history. I think of the great Catholic festivals as celebrated in the past. I compare them with the dreary and depressing experience of \\"celebrating\\" a Catholic \\"holy day\\" in modern times, and I wonder what exactly has changed, since we are still- at least ostensibly- celebrating the exact same things as in the past. This is a wonderful little monograph, but those of us with more concrete modes of thought might not appreciate the abstract and disembodied ideas at the center of this subject."},{"Title":"In tune with the world;: A theory of festivity","review":"Sometimes it helps to take a second look.I wasn't halfway through the first chapter before I was disappointed with In Tune with the World. It was my own fault: Despite the book's subtitle, I had been expecting practical suggestions for recovering festivity in a society where abundance is commonplace. However, when Pieper says \\"a THEORY of festivity,\\" that is exactly what he means.What's more, the first few pages put me off because Pieper seems to be dividing our lives between work and festivity, with work pretty much defined as what men do to earn a living, and I kept thinking, \\"But you still expect the women to cook and clean for your festivals; if they separated their work from the feast, it wouldn't be much of one!\\" He was writing in the early 1960's, so I can't say he's free from that attitude, but there's much more to what he is saying, and my preconceptions definitely distorted that first chapter.Before I had finished the book, however, I realized that it deserved re-reading for what it is rather than for what I wanted it to be. I'm not generally one to read books of philosophy -- largely, I'll admit, because I find them hard going. There is only so much of this kind of writing I can take without my eyes glazing over: \\"Human acts derive their meaning primarily from their content, from their object, not from the manner in which they are performed. Play, however, seems to be chiefly a mere modus of action, a specific way of performing something, at any rate a purely formal determinant.\\"The text is well worth working through, however -- perhaps several times.Pieper writes as a Christian, and clearly views Christian festivals as the highest and best of celebrations. Yet the theory of festivity he posits has its roots firmly in pagan, primitive, Jewish, Roman, and other practices as well, and the book is rife with quotations from sources many and varied.You can read In Tune with the World in under an hour, but Pieper's ideas are inexhaustible. If you consider what he has to say about the festivals of the French Revolution, you'll never look at the Olympic Opening Ceremonies the same way again."},{"Title":"Commitment to Love: Transforming Human Nature into Divine Nature","review":"Imagine a book that promises that life will be greater and grander than you have ever experienced and that you will be well compensated for living your passion - and you KNOW that you are reading truth.

It's not worth hiding the bad and unpleasant side of the group, especially during the Hamburg-period and during the world-tours in 65-66. They weren't angels at all and sometimes it is very illuminating to know the negative side of their character, for instance when you would like to understand the lyrics of the songs.

Competent journalist Hunter Davies spent a year observing the Beatles and interviewing them in their own homes during the heady, fascinating year of 1967. He emerged with a time piece: the Beatles as they were at that time, reflecting on what came before and unaware of what was yet to come. A chapter describing the writing and recording of &quot;With a Little Help From My Friends,&quot; &quot;Getting Better,&quot; and &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; offers unique and especially valuable glimpses of the Beatles at work. Chapters depicting the home life and personal outlook of each Beatle are also very interesting. I must also say that for an authorised biography, this is remarkably honest. Perceptive readers will be able to detect the whole truth here, and a fine introduction written by the author years later helps fill in any gaps. Apart from being hugely entertaining, this book is a tremendous boon to historians interested in the Beatles."},{"Title":"St. Joseph's Parish: More than a century of faith, Chester and Deep River, Connecticut","review":"This is a fabulous evocation of the fab four's rise to greatness, written with just the right amount of reverence and objectivity. Davies manages to ellicit some great anecdotes from people who were closest to The Beatles. Mimi, Paul's dad, the Harrisons, close friends, Fred Lennon (John's dad), Pete Best; they all get to have their say. The book is especially strong during the Hamburg years (loosely 59-62). Davies captures the growth in their popularity, attracting interesting characters along the way, yet having no fan base outside Liverpool and Hamburg. He demonstrates so vividly the growing desperation of the boys to make it big. Once the rollercoaster took off then the book is on trickier ground. Davies clearly wants to divulge stuff which The Beatles were not keen on him revealing (Davies was writing the book during 1967/early 68). For instance, Lennon was heavily into drugs at this time and Hunter Davies refers to John as being in a daze. Yes, you have to read between the lines! One of the strengths of this book is its matter-of-fact delivery. Although Davies is clearly a fan he still keeps his feet on the ground. The death of Brian Epstein is well-handled. Remember, this was written before all the Klein, Apple, Ono nonsense hit the fan. Yet Davies manages to convey a growing sense of isolation amongst the group. His pen-portraits of each member is uncannily (eerily) accurate, bearing in mind the general public thought The Beatles were a rock-solid national institution. The book is a cracker and loses a star of its rating only because of a rather mysterious lack of detail around Rubber Soul and Revolver. The rest is gear!"},{"Title":"St. Joseph's Parish: More than a century of faith, Chester and Deep River, Connecticut","review":"I finished reading this book recently and I have to say it is an excellent book. When Hunter Davies first interviewed the Beatles for this book from 1967-1968, it was before all the bickering and fighting started and before Yoko came into the picture. Davies takes an inside look in thier home and family life, the songwriting process, and recording sessions. It also gives a pretty good background on their childhoods and how they all met. Not to mention a lot of great pictures, including some I never seen before. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because it is not a totally definative bio. Lots of things were left out because it upset thier family members. For example, it is not mentioned that Brian Epstein was homosexual because it upset his mother at the time. And some things were left out of John's childhood because it upset his aunt Mimi. Other than that, I reccomend that you read this book. It is smart and thouroughly researched. A must have for all Beatles fans!"},{"Title":"St. Joseph's Parish: More than a century of faith, Chester and Deep River, Connecticut","review":"As a fan of nearly 30 years, this was one of the first Beatles books I ever bought, and it remains a worthwhile buy for today's new fans. It may not be as detailed or as enlightening as the Mark Lewishon-type of books, but it benefits greatly from being written in the sixties - and having a firsthand access to the band. Hunter Davies includes many stories and insights that would simply not be available to today's writers - because they weren't there. The chapter that describes them writing 'With A Little Help From My Friends', for example, is as amusing as it is amazing. And I very much enjoyed the prologue, where Davies explains the difficulties he had with Queenie Epstein and Aunt Mimi. And his meeting with Pete Best in the mid-sixties is as poignant a scene as you will ever get in a Beatles book. It is stories like those that make the book worth buying."},{"Title":"St. Joseph's Parish: More than a century of faith, Chester and Deep River, Connecticut","review":"This book is a fun read! Full of wonderful photos (including plenty of young pre-fab Four and Hamburg days) AND even a few letters (hand-written notes to the author from John, Paul's teenage-years letters hyping up their band, etc)What really sets it apart from other Beatles books is the author having an amazing opportunity to talk to his subjects back then and there (and their parents! and Astrid!) Before the \\"ugly divorce\\" breakup, before John was ret-conning his life every-other interview, before \\"everyone knows my history better than I do\\" set in on Paul's memory, before George got extra bitter & \\"didn't wanna be a star, wanted just to play guitar\\" set..._ahem_ where was I, oh yes, this book! Its full of interesting notes about their childhoods, some rather silly fly-on-the-wall descriptions of how certain songs were written and came to be, a great new chapter written in 1985 looking back and another in 2002 on how the Fab Four fandom just keeps getting bigger and bigger. Plus a few notes on why the biographies aren't as complete as current ones. Everyone involved back in the day wanted certain negative bits removed (John's auntie Mimi was SICK with worry over John's childhood memories coming off too wicked or bad. Of course she had her say in some edits too)Bonus points for having plenty of Ringo chapters. Somehow, most Beatles books focus 75% on John/Paul with 20% of George and barely 3 sentences of Ringo.

It's fun to read--not because you will discover anything new about The Beatles.This book is a time capsule of the type of book you'd read in the 60s that wasn't written to embarrass it's subjects. It's how The Beatles wanted their fans to view their lives--as \\"normal\\" working guys with wives and kids! The Beatles were music visionaries but they did not foresee the future of tabloid publishing where all-things-Beatle would be exposed by anyone who came in contact with them because it is a cash cow. Mr. Davis updated the orginial book with his later experiences with the Beatles up to 1985 in my version.Those updates start to reflect the current \\"tell all\\" bios. The most famous story in the updates, is a recounting of Paul calling Mr. Davis in 1981 and ranting about things Yoko said about him (Paul) after John's death -- exposing Paul's insecurities and (I thought) his obvious grief over John's death. It is hard to believe after all The Beatles have accomplished that anyone of them could be insecure but that is one of the themes of this book. They are after all, human and Mr. Davies succeeds in showing that side of them."},{"Title":"St. Joseph's Parish: More than a century of faith, Chester and Deep River, Connecticut","review":"This is an essential document for Beatles scholarship. At the time it was simply a pop bio by a competent writer, but it depicts the Beatles at a fascinating juncture in their career. It is particularly notable for its accounts of songwriting and recording sessions, for a glimpse of their home lives, and for their opinions about life in general at the time. Since this is an authorized biography, critics may complain that it is whitewashed - but one can read between the lines and gather the full meaning of everything pretty well. All in all, it is remarkably honest. This updated edition features a sterling introduction by the author about the writing of the book and offers further insight into the personalities of the Beatles."},{"Title":"St. Joseph's Parish: More than a century of faith, Chester and Deep River, Connecticut","review":"about The Beatles, this is one. Excellent and balanced. Another is \\"Shout! The Beatles in Their Generation\\". Both -- note -- were written by journalists who actually knew The Beatles over years, and were appreciated because they weren't sensationalizers or backstabbers.Those two stand head and shoulders above the trashy \\"The Love You Make,\\" the author of which Lennon said only came in at the tail end, took three-martini lunches, and was one of those angered by the break-up because it ended the \\"gravy train\\".Those sorts of realities about books about The Beatles are essential for those who don't realize the relative qualities of the books and authors of them, and as result fall for the Browns, Goldmans, and Guilianos. Do a little additional research and determine, for example, how many authors of books about The Beatles claim to have been \\"insiders\\" but in fact could not have been. (How many \\"fifth Beatles\\" were there? One would guess \\"One,\\" right? It must be hundreds by now, most of whom never even met The Beatles, let alone got their autographs.)This is one of the few essentials. Read it and rely on it as a measure against all the others."},{"Title":"St. Joseph's Parish: More than a century of faith, Chester and Deep River, Connecticut","review":"I'm sure there were books about the Beatles written before this, but this book was written with the Beatles (complete with interviews). Hunter Davies includes some of his own opinions in later editions but this is about the Fab 4, their rise, and where they were in 1968 when this book originally came out (John admits to be bored with life as Yoko Ono had not yet been a household name to us and George was already sick of being a Beatle at the time). The later editions have a section about the breakup, what they did individually in the 1970's, the tragedy of John Lennon in 1980 and more recent interviews with Paul, George, and Ringo. You can trust Davies since he got the Beatles' authorization and respected their privacy (he mentions that George Harrison asked that certain things not be printed). As Davies points out, this story is about the rise and not the fall."},{"Title":"St. Joseph's Parish: More than a century of faith, Chester and Deep River, Connecticut","review":"Though not what I would call the \\"definitive\\" 3rd party Beatles history, Davies' book is still worthy of reading. Because it was actually written while the Beatles were together, and because Davies had first hand access to the Boys, this book has a certain charm that makes it worthwhile. The style is intimate, lighthearted, and easy-going.What sticks in my head when I read this book is the fact that it was written before the bitter breakup. Granted, the White Album era had its tensions (though these are not discussed in this book, a tasteful decision) but because this book doesn't have to end with \\"and then they broke up\\" it exists like a strange time capsule. In this book the Beatles will be together forever, good friends, jamming in the studio and enjoying a legendary camaraderie.That's not to say that this book is a lie...it just focuses on the positive aspects of the relationship that existed between those four guys. And because Davies had first hand access to the Beatles while writing it he was around for some very intimate, personal moments. Reading this book is the equivalent of being at a party with the Beatles and having the bonus of them all being in good moods.Now, at heart this is a Beatles history book. It's not the best in this respect, even though the author had such great access to the Beatles, largely because the material is too glossy and PR oriented to be relied upon as the sole source of ones Beatle knowledge. It's like looking at the Beatles phenomenon through rose-colored glasses; not that seeing the Beatles \\"warts and all\\" is so great, just more balanced.Still, even though the Beatles had to \\"approve\\" this book before publication (resulting in a little fab censorship, I suspect) I think it is worth a read. The style is so casual and conversational that the text flows smoothly, and I can guarantee it won't be like any other Beatles history you've seen. This book is less academic and more accessible. It was not created to be comprehensive, but rather readable.Just like Mikey used to say about Life cereal \\"try it, you'll like it.\\" And if you don't, well, sell it on Amazon and get your money back."},{"Title":"St. Joseph's Parish: More than a century of faith, Chester and Deep River, Connecticut","review":"This is the only biography authorized by the Beatles themselves, and it gives a detailed account of the rise to fame of the Fab Four, and many details of each band member's life. Davies was asked by Harrison not to print certain details, and an aunt suggested he revise some of the account of John's early life to make it sound better. Some details couldn't be divulged at the time, such as Brian Epstein's gay orientation, and the extent to which John was into drugs, although you get a sense of this from some brief passages in the book although Davies obviously avoids dwelling for too long on these issues. Still, despite glossing over a few negatives like these, Davies nevertheless had access to information that no other writer had, and no doubt the book benefits from that despite its being slightly sanitized.One thing that distinguises this book from all the other bios is Davies spent a year living and travelling with the Beatles and observing them in their day-to-day lives. The year was 1967, and although the group was soon to break-up, 1967 was still a great year for the band and Davies gives many fine insights and details into the life of the group during this period. Davies enlivens the account with anecdotes and stories from many relatives and friends who knew the Beatles best.I want to take a brief detour here to tell you about a funny piece of Beatles trivia I discovered recently, and I just have to mention it here, since I don't recall seeing it in the book. Supposedly The Beatles loved cartoons, and a friend of mine who is a big Beatles fan and trivia buff and I got to talking about it, and since I'm sort of a trivia nut myself, he suggested an unlikely cartoon, which was Popeye the Sailor, and challenged me to find a connection to the Beatles. Well, it's not known if this was a cartoon the Beatles liked or not, but after doing only about an hour of research on the web, I came up with a funny but true connection.I found out one of the songs the Beatles often performed during their Hamburg years, before they were writing all their own songs, was \\"Falling in Love Again,\\" by Sammy Lerner, an important songwriter of the 40s and 50s. But it so happens that Lerner also was enlisted to write the theme song for the Popeye the Sailor cartoon, which he did. So it turns out that there is indeed a connection between the Beatles and Popeye in that Lerner composed songs for, shall we say, both groups of singers. :-)Anyway, I hope you didn't mind my little digression, but getting back to the book, this is a fine biography of the Beatles and is especially strong in its treatment of their early years and rise to fame. Although updated in the later edition, there isn't as much information about the post-1970 years, but as others have pointed out about the book, it's about the famous band's rise, not about their fall."},{"Title":"St. Joseph's Parish: More than a century of faith, Chester and Deep River, Connecticut","review":"While this book may have been the definitive bio on the Beatles in 1968, because it was written before the group broke up it leaves out alot of important info on the band such as Brian's homosexuality and other facts about the band that could not be made public at the time. I highly recommend this book for those of you who have recently discovered the Beatles and are looking for a great overview. Then you will be ready for the &quot;truth&quot; behind the greatest rock band of all time! Don't forget to order you copy of &quot;Anthology&quot; which is due out soon!"},{"Title":"St. Joseph's Parish: More than a century of faith, Chester and Deep River, Connecticut","review":"Just started reading and the author is enjoyable to read.

It's nice to have someone tell it like it was for a change. But then, it is helpful to write a book as the events are happening instead of trying to re-create history after the fact, like some books I've read. I felt the update at the end of the book was truthful and factual. An absolute recommend for anyone interested in the history of the greatest band of all time. I loved it!!"},{"Title":"St. Joseph's Parish: More than a century of faith, Chester and Deep River, Connecticut","review":"This book is the best bio I have read in years!!

If you're a true Beatles fan, buy this book NOW!!!!!"},{"Title":"St. Joseph's Parish: More than a century of faith, Chester and Deep River, Connecticut","review":"As a 14 year old Beatle fan I read this book in its original release in 1968. (I think just about everyone in my Catholic girl's school in Queens was reading it). I loved reading about the birth of the Beatles; their days in Liverpool and Hamburg, their early influences, etc. I have always remained a fan and recently reread the book. I loved it just as much the second time around -- it brought me back to a time I loved and I remembered how great it was the grow up in the 60's and the Beatles were a big part of that great decade. My 14 year old daugher (also a Beatles fan) loves it as well. I never expected this reaction - I was suprised that the Beatles still have a huge amount of young fans. Suprised and happy because we certainly have found some common ground. She loved learning about the Beatles and the decade they came to represent. I do think this is the best book on the Beatles to date I (and the only authorized one as far as I know)- although I hear there will soon be an autobiography by Paul, George and Ringo. It's a must read for any Beatles fan!"},{"Title":"St. Joseph's Parish: More than a century of faith, Chester and Deep River, Connecticut","review":"I found Davies' account an interesting read. It was written in 1968 after the author had spent considerable time hanging with the Beatles during the peak of their popularity. It's refreshingly non-technical and non-critical -- Davies has no academic pretensions and in fact the book reads like it was primarily written for the Beatles young fans of the time. There is also an updated chapter discussing the group's breakup. Be sure to read to the (relatively recent) introduction as it puts the ensuing account into modern perspective. I wouldn't exactly call this book definitive, but I would definitely recommend it to Beatles fans and rock historians."},{"Title":"St. Joseph's Parish: More than a century of faith, Chester and Deep River, Connecticut","review":"This was an amazingly informative book. I enjoyed every minute of it and found it hard to put down. It was intelligently written and offered lots of information about the Beatles that even as a lifelong fan of the Four I had not heard before. It seemed to transport me to that time and place. I particularly found it fascinating to read of each Beatle's early lives and the struggles they went through to attain the pinnacle. It is the story of a time and place that will never happen again. I highly recommend this book to any true fan of the Beatles. The Beatles and their music are magic and an are integral part of our lives."},{"Title":"St. Joseph's Parish: More than a century of faith, Chester and Deep River, Connecticut","review":"Because this book was the only authorized biography ever written of The Beatles and also because it was written at the time, rather than researched &amp; compiled years later, I felt that I could believe what I was reading. It was facsinating reading comments from John before the breakup when he still enjoyed being a Beatle, rather than the cynical type of quotes from after all the animosity came into their relationships."},{"Title":"St. Joseph's Parish: More than a century of faith, Chester and Deep River, Connecticut","review":"This is an amazing book! It gives great information! The author was there during the rise of the Beatles, and he tells all that he saw. He also has some great interviews with all The Beatles themselves! It also has great photos of the lads, and pictures of early written songs."},{"Title":"St. Joseph's Parish: More than a century of faith, Chester and Deep River, Connecticut","review":"This book is the first Beatle biography that I read ( the &quot;only authorized biography of the Beatles&quot; subtitle catching my attention). I must say, all of the ones I have read since have dissapointed me compared to this book. Its awesome!! At first, the author talks about himself to establish his credibility, and its worth it. He talked to each of the Beatles privately and spent several days in each of their homes, and stayed in contact with them after the break up. The one thing that really sticks out in my mind is a conversation that Mr. Davis had with Mr. McCartney five years after Mr. Lennon's death. Paul called him to talk about current events and to establish truth to several myths going around, and it was really wonderful. I would suggest this to everyone who is looking for a biography of the Beatles!! THIS IS DEFINATELY THE ONE TO READ!!"},{"Title":"St. Joseph's Parish: More than a century of faith, Chester and Deep River, Connecticut","review":"I was too young to remember much of the Beatles in their heyday, and although I was familiar with a lot of their songs, I did not know a lot about them as individuals. Two things happened towards the end of last year to arouse my interest. The first was the death of George Harrison, with all the media interest it generated. The second was when I asked my niece Imogen (then aged seven) what she wanted for Christmas. \\"A Beatles CD\\" came the reply. And this from a little girl whose parents are too young to remember much of the sixties. So much for those who say that the Beatles are only relevant to ageing ex-hippies, not to modern youngsters.I decided to look for a book which gave the full story of the group. this was surprisingly difficult to find in the shops, but I eventually came across Hunter Davies's book on Amazon. This was just what I was looking for. Most biographies of popstars and showbiz celebrities are very lightweight affairs, but Davies's book is solid and workmanlike and full of useful information, despite having first been published in 1968 at the height of the Beatles boom.The sections about the Beatles' early years are excellent. My only criticism is that their later years are not covered in such detail, although there are possibly reasons for this. When the book was first published, Davies may well have thought that the events of 1966-68 (when the Beatles did much of their best work) were too well-known to be retold in great detail. The book also includes a postscript dating from 1985; I would have liked this to have been more detailed, but perhaps the author, who knew the Beatles personally, felt that it was not appropriate to go into detail about the events surrounding the group's break-up in 1969-70. He may also have felt that the details of their post-1970 careers were beyond the scope of his book.All in all, I felt that this was an excellent book which I could recommend to anyone looking like me for an introduction to the Beatles' lives and work."},{"Title":"St. Joseph's Parish: More than a century of faith, Chester and Deep River, Connecticut","review":"I first read the Davies book, 2005 edition, last summer, borrowed from a friend. When I ordered my own copy in October, I was presented with the choice of a new updated version or the 2005. I opted for the latest, but I regretted when it arrived as the new edition is downsized and cheaply printed.Pro: The updates in the 2010 edition include a bit about Paul's divorce; the best update is a new final chapter: a \\"Post-Morti\\" describing the lives and destinies of the Beatles' (and Brian Epstein's) relatives and most significant members of their supporting cast, such as Neil Aspinall. Davies even tracked down most or all of the members of the Quarrymen. Davies does a fine, professional job of it. The Post Morti section replaces about an equal number of pages devoted in earlier editions to the chronology and contents of Beatles releases in the UK versus the US. Presumably this list is now deemed unneccessary, since the 2009 CD re-releases seem to be follow the British originals.My only quarrels are with the publisher: a down-sized version in a physical sense, printed on cheap quality paper, uses cheaper looking type, all of which sadly results in muddy -look photographs (esp. John's early boyhood pics.) There are also some editorial carelessness as in typos and occasional missing punctuation that I did not notice in the 2005 edition. I may search for a 2005 edition to own as well, just because it looked great and felt good to hold in my hands; fittingly of legendary Beatles \\"quality\\". The 2010 edition looks and feels cheap, sorry. But the new info may make up for it for most people.Four stars because of the decidedly inferior quality of the publication, not because of its contents!"},{"Title":"St. Joseph's Parish: More than a century of faith, Chester and Deep River, Connecticut","review":"This is truly an excellent biography of the Beatles. First published in 1967, it was merely regarded as a \\"pop star story\\" as opposed to the serious and comprehensive biography it really is. This is a must have for any die hard Beatles' fan and for folks who plain love their music. This is a book for everyone.Davies chronicles each Beatle's life, his own personal input and experiences. In so doing, he guides his readers to how each Beatle became members of the world's most influential band in history. Quotes from relatives, folks who knew the Beatles and the Beatles themselves round out the book so that readers get a \\"feel\\" for, a \\"sense\\" of each Beatle. Photographs of the Beatles as boys are an added treat. Readers get to travel down the long and winding road with the Beatles from Liverpool to world wide fame.The writing style is fast paced and Davies is quite skilled at maintaining his readers' interest. I am delighted this has been reissued and updated. This is a keeper."},{"Title":"St. Joseph's Parish: More than a century of faith, Chester and Deep River, Connecticut","review":"This is a great book. It is good to read one that was written by someone who actually knew the Beatles. I get sick of authors who think they know everything about the Beatles writing books about them. Hunter Davies truly knows the fab four as people, and his book is great from cover to cover. Cheers to Davies!"},{"Title":"St. Joseph's Parish: More than a century of faith, Chester and Deep River, Connecticut","review":"This fine book was the only biography (the Anthology was not a biography per se) authorized by the group. Mr. Davies interviewed and hung out with the band and their friends, associates and families in late 1966 and 1967. It was first published in 1968. The book shares the usual fault of most authorized bios in that the views and \\"facts\\" offered up by the subjects are unquestioned and unchallenged. Mr. Davies had access to the band and their inner circle, but no one outside that group whose views might contradict those of the principals was quoted or consulted. It was famously derided by John Lennon as a whitewash. Mr. Davies allowed the band's family members, particularly Mr. Lennon's Aunt Mimi, to censor certain passages. And consequently the capsule bios of the individual members are sketchy and incomplete. The later printings have added material that goes some way toward correcting some of these shortcomings and omissions, but the original work is flawed.That said, this is a very valuable addition to the literature about this groundbreaking band. Mr. Davies was allowed to observe the group in settings that no outsider could ever penetrate. He was even allowed to watch Lennon & McCartney while composing and this reportage is of incalculable value for musicians and others curious about the working method of the most successful songwriting team of the 20th century. Even when espousing the company line, the band members reveal attitudes and views that have been important to the work of later biographers and to those able to read between the lines. Much has been made, for one example, of Mr. Davies description of Mr. Lennon's home life with his first wife. So this is a must-read for any fan or scholar of the Beatles. Those with a more casual interest in the group might want to choose one of the many unauthorized bios on the group. The Bob Spitz book is the least bad of the books from any of the outsiders who have written about them. But nothing will ever replace this one. It is a document of historic importance."},{"Title":"St. Joseph's Parish: More than a century of faith, Chester and Deep River, Connecticut","review":"Ah, I remember first reading this classic biography in the early 1980's, and reading it over and over again. I was a pre-teen and had just become a Beatles freak - - I'd thought I found the holy grail. It didn't occur to me until much later that this was an authorized biography, written from a fan's perspective. As such, looking back on it, it succeeds. Hunter Davies was there with the Beatles, knew McCartney fairly well and hung out with all of them for a time. He could've really written a major work had he waited till after the break up, but chose to get it out quickly and after approval from the Beatles. It is very intimate and light, the structure allows for a breezy and anecdotal approach. The Beatles really talk to the public of 1968 in a serious and intimate way that they hadn't done in their many press conferences. Emphasis apparently on early years, their rise as Davies puts it, and on the magazine style profiles of each Beatle (to 1968). The chapter on George Harrison is surprisingly thorough on his new found religious beliefs. It does include an update for the break up and decades following, but this adds little. (besides, Peter Brown's more gossipy \\"Love You Make\\" handles that period better)It's rather weak on the incredible development of the Beatles music from LP to LP, and devotes one brief chapter on it - - actually, that he was present at a couple of John and Paul's songwriting sessions is a plus. Otherwise, Davies is rather hopeless in giving readers insight on this vital area of Beatles. But to be fair very few have succeeded in discussing the Beatles music anyway. (OK, I'll give a nod to Mellers, Schafner and McDonald)I also like the photos in this book, as they complement the introductory nature of the text very well, especally as done in this \\"illustrated\\" edition.Overall, I still consider this a great book (hence the 5 stars), a nostalgic favorite of mine - - the 2nd book I'd ever read on the Beatles (Miles' \\"Beatles In Their Own Words\\" was 1st), when I was hungry like a pig for more. I recommend this to be the first book new fans read if they're seriously interested in the history of the great Beatles. This will do!"},{"Title":"St. Joseph's Parish: More than a century of faith, Chester and Deep River, Connecticut","review":"The Beatles are undoubtedly the most popular band in world history. Hunter Davies creates a thorough, honest biography of the four famous members and their rise to stardom. Because this book was written in 1967, Davies gets an insight into the Beatles' lives before they began fighting. Davies writes an honest account of the Beatles' lives, chronicling their lives from birth, but the reader can sense that some facts have been omitted, perhaps to save the dignity of the Beatles' family members. However, Davies gives enough information for readers to fill in the blanks. The book contains loads of interesting facts, pictures, and Beatles memorabilia.

Even though this is a weightloss book, and I do need to lose weight, I bought it because it talks about a way to get past the addictive behavior, the negative self-talk, all of that, by 'checking in' with yourself several times a day before you go too far down that spiral of self-destructive behavior. I've tried it a couple of times and it works! I encourage people to take a look at this book because the approach IS different than other diet books. But, it is not very well laid out or edited. There are several times where I have to re-read a sentence, because she's written it in such a convoluted way... instead of getting to the point, she gets too wordy, and you lose your momentum as you're reading. Also, there are, as I understand and I can't be sure because the bad format of the book, 3 main components to the 'solution', but then there are several part to each main component. And it's nearly impossible to figure it out, or remember it, unless you take notes. She talks about White Stuff once, and then doesn't mention it until several chapters later, and you have no idea what it is. Same with Masterful Living... This book needs to be re-released in a waaaaayyyyy better format, so that you can easily read about each part to the Solution, and follow it easier. The little cutout cards at the end of the book are helpful only to copy them down on your own piece of paper.

Thin Within does not ban foods, gives you more time to establish new habits, and is more about focusing on you and what you can do for yourself.

However, I must confess, I was a little daunted by the cover description: \\"A Narrative Poem,\\" which implies a long poem.I recalled Mr. Bricuth telling us it was written in blank verse (not the free verse I'm accustomed to), and I thought, Gee, am I qualified to read this? I hadn't actually read a long narrative poem since college and that was, yikes, more than thirty years ago.After the first page or so, however, I was absorbed. Now, after having finished the book, the form fascinates me, primarily because of Bricuth's brilliant mastery of it. He made it easy and natural to read, almost like listening to my own heartbeat, quickly, in tempo with my life and all of those around me. Reading in rhythm with the rhyme is of course the intended effect but how few of us can write in such rhythmic rhyme?Bricuth's pacing and the juxtaposition of tragic verse and humor work exceptionally well. I'm amazed with As Long As It's Big, how its three-line blank verse is so skillfully crafted and beautifully written, especially since it is a 217-page (long) narrative poem. One of my favorite passages is, \\"Looking back, realizing most of / What they'd gotten simply served to give / Times liquid moments weight, some space where life's / Bright foam could pool and linger in a thing, / Not run away like moonlight through your fingers....\\" As throughout the book, it matches the imagery with the character's emotions perfectly.This fine poem will remain on my shelf as a mainstay of brilliant writing to encourage others to read, to read again, and to select passages for inspiration.Jeff MayAs with all my writing, if you don't agree you can always feed it to the fish."},{"Title":"As Long As It's Big: A Narrative Poem (Johns Hopkins: Poetry and Fiction)","review":"this book reads like a novelette and the fact that it's written as verse distracts not at all form the narrativeoffers wonderful insights into love, marriage, sexuality, life"},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"Since I chose oil futures as a term paper topic for my graduate investment class, I really wanted to get a strong background on how oil became such a powerful commodity since it was discovered back in the 1800s.

There are many interesting and valuable facts in this book."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"A rather long work but told in a gripping manner that compels the reader to keep forging ahead, the lateness of the hour be damned. Yergin takes us from the earliest days of oil exploration to Churchill's decision to convert British navy ships to oil from coal, the automobile and gasoline, the Arabs demanding more control over what was being extracted out of their territory, an especially intriguing account of the CIA overthrow of the Mossadegh regime in Iran to the development of OPEC and the energy crises suffered by Americans and others. Yergin has complete mastery of his subject and relays it concisely with a very cohesive thematic focus. This is a dead essential piece of work that should even probably be used as a textbook for those lecturing on 19th-20th century history because the oil question still looms so large in each of our lives and Yergin has created a conduit to understanding how and why it became thus."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"The Prize is the best non-fiction book I've read, and it is definitely among the besk book I've read in any genre!

Throughout this nearly 800-page effort, Yergin does a terrific job of presenting a detailed and comprehensive account that is informative and extremely entertaining. Yergin describes the creation of the major oil companies and how their relationship with the governments of the oil-producing nations evolved from a tenant/landlord relationship into full blown partnerships. Some of the things that I learned that surprised me were:1. The number of key political figures from the 20th and 21st century whose political careers had ties to oil.2. Synthetic fuels have been discussed and produced since World War I. However, the low cost of oil, relative to the creation and implementation of these synthetic fuels has made it cost-prohibitive to make it a true alternative to oil.3. The role oil has played in nearly every military struggle since its discovery in the late 19th century.4. How the low cost of oil over the last century is what has really has transformed the global economic state of affairs.This book is written from an objective perspective that is non partisan in any shape or form. Yergin does such a great job presenting detailed information in such an entertaining and engaging manner that I rarely had to consult the index when key figures or corporations were re-introduced throughout the narrative.

The book is a descriptive, insightful, exciting and at times provocative view on the history of oil. While to book does well in explaining the scientific aspects of this history of oil (i.e. the evolution of the refining process), it focuses largely on the political and economic ramifications of the discovery of oil, the increase in productivity and consumption of oil and eventually the dependence of oil. It provided great insight in relation to the impact oil had on state (i.e Saudi Arabia) and non-State (i.e British Petroleoum) actors and the evolution of state sovereignty over the ownership of oil, especially in developing and third world economies such as Nigeria, Iraq, Iran and Venezuala. By large I am satisfied with the book, however I found faults with aspects of the book.While the author remains largely neutral in his evaluation and description of the history of oil, at times he seemed overtly sympathetic to the oil tycoons, to critical of states and heads-of-state who attempted to assert their sovereignty over the oil companies and at times even mocked leaders such as Mohammed Mossadeq. His description of the 1953 overthrow of Iranian Parlimentary Democracy and its replacement with the absolute monarchy of the Shah. He claims that the overthrow of Mossadeq had widespread public support and that Mossadeq's supporters were largely a band of thugs. Most history books will argue to the contrary and I suggest people attain a book in regards to the 1953 overthrow of Mossadeq that is not written by this author. Other than this however, the book is a great read. It is long and factual."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"A book the tells in a readable manner the origin and fascinating world of the oil industry as well as the way it shaped the 20 century, essencial for those professionals or laymen who wants to know about one of the most important commodities in the world..."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"This is by far one of the best books I have ever read.

Amazon shipment was a slick execution which makes the book more valuable..This book is a must-have for oil and gas pros."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"I first encountered this book in connection with a recent family trip that included a stop at the museum in Titusville, Pa. where \\"Colonel\\" Edward Drake first discovered oil in 1859. Oil was back then, possibly somewhat like the computer industry today, quite speculative and a town like Pithole, Pa. could go from boom to bust in a single year. The biggest drawback of this long history of oil is that it ends in 1992 with the 1st Gulf War, so it isn't truly current. It has nothing about the second Gulf War or subsequent events in Iraq or America's current problems with Iran or North Korea. But as a thorough history of oil including its connection to wars, cultural clashes, and world politics, it is an impressive and scholarly work, somewhat similar possibly to the historical novels of James Michener . Not only does it cover many of the industry's colorful early wheeler-dealers,wildcatters, promoters--the most notorious of whom, arguably, was the Armenian Calouste Gulbenkian (\\"Mr.5 Percent\\")-- capitalists and CEO's on an international scale, but it is also quite thorough on the motivations and maneuvers of OPEC in the book's last half as they relate to economics and national self-interest. The PBS series is also good and certainly more concise. He discusses the theories of important economists like David Ricardo and E.F. Schumacher, who defended coal over oil, as they pertain to oil. It is methodically thorough on the history of the discovery of oil particularly in the Middle East, as well as in America, Venezuela,Indonesia, Russia, the North Sea, and Alaska. It also covers most of the 20th century's major American, British, and Middle Eastern and even Far Eastern politicians, negotiators,events, and sheikhs and the important military figures of the two world wars as they relate to oil, so in many ways it reads well as pure world history and politics. FDR's and Churchill's meetings with King Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia; the machinations of the Shah of Iran,early pro-Communist strikes in Baku in southern Russia, the Iranian Revolution and the Iran-Iraq and 2nd Gulf Wars particularly stand out. The coverage of the importance of oil in the two World Wars in the 8-part PBS television series of the same name is quite good, I thought, so I avoided these sections, to some degree, when I picked up the book.I thought Yergin was suitably sympathetic to OPEC--not too long ago, Saudi Arabia was little more than a stopover on Islamic pilgrimages to Mecca-- while perhaps being too much of an apologist fot the oil industry overall, and giving too little weight to alternative technologies, which he does cover in several chapters. But with the glut of oil up to the present largely a result of Middle Eastern oil and America's love affair with the automobile, the interstate highway system, and suburban living these new technologies have so far proved to be somewhat irrelevant, with the possible exception of fuel efficiency standards and emissions standards in cars. The new technologies have come up in times of crisis or oil embargo, like 1973 or 1979, when conservation was all the rage, only seemingly to be quickly put on the back burner when the oil began to flow again. Yergin does devote some pages to the \\"new\\" environmental consciousness, particularly in the PBS series. As a baby boomer I didn't fully realize that up until the early 20th Century, approximately until Churchill's decision to switch the British Navy from coal to oil prior to World War I, and the invention of the internal combustion engine and the airplane--that the major fuel of the industrialized nations was coal, then for several decades, kerosene for lighting. In my life, I've taken the switch to oil pretty much for granted. Oil, which is much cleaner though also much less abundant than coal, seems to be on a par with electicity and medical advances as one of the benefits of modern life. Overall the book is less about the technological advances than about the people, world events, and economics involved. I read it somewhat as a reference work, picking it up over a period of two weeks and choosing chapters somewhat at random, and usually enjoying the excerpts I read. It increased my understanding of the Arab-Israeli conflict,of Middle Eastern values and history,of Soviet influence in the Middle East, and of the colonialist policies of the British Empire and its eventual demise, with the advent of political figures like Gamal Nasser of Egypt, Iran's Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh, and 3rd World sympathizers like Italy's oil CEO Enrico Mattei who sought to break the stranglehold of the \\"7 Sisters\\" Oil companies in the Middle East and offered a better deal to the producers. Notable also is that there has been a trend away from vertical integration among the major oil companies for several decades--whereas John D. Rockefeller pioneered in his Standard Oil Company by combining oil drilling, refining, transportation, and marketing, there has not been a new refinery built in the U.S. since the 1970's."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"This book is one of those rare non-fiction books that is simultaneously huge, broad, very deeply researched and annotated, and emminantly readable.

What makes it a great book and a bestseller is the epic nature the book takes on. The subtitle 'Epic Quest,&quot; sounds a lot like an editorial decision to sell books, but it is quite accurately descriptive of the book's evocative power. One really gets a sense of global struggle, and Yergin's focus on the stories of individual people gives the book a very intimate feel to it. Hense 'Epic Quest.'

From the epilogue: \\"In America, throughout the 20th century, the companies have been the object of intense scrutiny, suspicion, and mistrust.\\" Here is a pivotal point and Mr. Yergin's last chance to address the roots of pervasive and historical public mistrust of Big Oil. But in the next sentence, Mr. Yergin fails for the last time by quoting Robert O. Anderson, the former Chairman of Arco instead: \\"We can't be low profile.\\" Mr. Yergin then finishes the paragraph with, \\"And that fact alone will continue to bridle the power of the giants of the industry.\\" - The fact that they can't operate stealthily is at the heart of the issue, all else be damned??Mr. Yergin cites numerous references to challenges faced by Big and Independent Oil companies, such as: Continuous U.S. Justice Department crackdown on monopolistic practices of Big Oil, wild fluctuations in oil prices and the ensuing price risk for both producers and consumers, costly drilling of empty holes. All of these give the impression of his tendency to sympathize with the plight of the 7 Sisters (petroleum supermajors) throughout. Whether this bias is intentional or not is irrelevant.It is rather curious that an 800 page book on the history of oil wins a Pulitzer prize in 1992 with only a cursory coverage of the political influences of the multinational oil corporations.

Overall, it is a book that makes very enjoyable reading on the history and development of the petroleum industry and its importance in politics and economics. I would have given this book a five star rating if it had including much more information and deserved attention on the country of Canada and its petroleum industry since it is one of the biggest suppliers of petroleum to the United States.

Yet there is so much more here than \\"oil\\".\\"The Prize\\" is moreover, a virtual chronicle of the World during that span-especially the 20th century after World War I. Military history is key: Shortages of petroleum drastically hampered Japan and Germany and hastened the end of hostilities in WWII. This reader already knew that but author Yergin drove the point home anew. He was not aware of Japan's crucial failure to destroy oil depots during the attack on Pearl Harbor. And all of Germany's vast iron and coal deposits were of little value in the end. Yergin is very adept at waving military annals into his story.It seems impossible to imagine now, but during WW2 the United States supplied 80% of the Allied powers oil and 67% of the World's needs. Tempus fugit.This reader's favorite section was the Suez Canal crisis of 1956. Egypt seized the strategic waterway and President Eisenhower declined to intervene. That episode marked the passing of England as a great power. Writing of then Prime Minister Anthony Eden, the Times of London stated that \\"he was the last Prime Minister to believe that Great Britain was still a great power and the first to realize it was not\\".\\"The Prize\\" duly outlines an incredible amount of wheeling, dealing, back stabbing and double dealing plus the rise and fall of some Great Powers. All is supported by 94 pages of end notes. Everything is documented: Yergin has done his homework. The one weakness here is the length. That proverbial stern editor with a sharp blue pencil could have been hired to thin out the text. (Do publishers employ folks like that any more?). Still, the final call here is positive! \\"The Prize\\" could have been a ponderous tome. Instead Yergin has produced a highly readable historical novel on a most serious subject. Well done!"},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"The Prize is one of the best books I've ever read. I wish I could give it a couple of bonus stars in my rating here.You'd really be selling this book short to think of it just as a history of oil, the oil business, and oil politics in the middle east. Even that would have been an ambitious book but Yergin makes it so much more. It honestly is a thorough history of the entire 20th century (sans the 90s) viewed through the perspective of the oil industry.As each chapter, era, decade, and war unfolds in Yergin's story, you'll gain a much better understanding of the roots of many of the US public's stances on big business, anti-trust legislation, and other pivotal issues of the last 100 years. You'll see how pivotal energy resources were in shaping the planning and rationale for 2 world wars and how the ready availability or lack of oil played as much of a role in winning and losing those wars as did battlefield strategies and the valor of the millions of soldiers involved. You'll see the role oil and energy played in the final collapse of the great imperial powers.Probably most relevant to 2007, the lessons Yergin teaches about middle east history, the changing power roles the evolved in the last 50-60 years as the power shifted from the oil companies to the oil producing countries. Tracing the roots of nationalization of oil production in Mexico and Venezuela is a great stepping stone to understanding out current relationship with Venezuela but it also properly frames the story of the origins of OPEC and OPEC policies. And it's so important to get a understanding of the power plays, who's who, back room deals, and longstanding rivalries that built and reinforced the animosity that so many in the middle east felt and feel toward the US and other western and oil consuming countries.It also traces the missteps and failed attempts at alternative energy sources as far back as the turn of the 19th century, including how alternative sources for aviation fuel provided the German Luftwaffe almost enough fuel to keep going in WWII. And it's easy to see how most other western nations have failed miserably to make the alternative fuel investments that might have paid those same kind of dividends.The history of how many relations between nations were built on the personal charisma and power of individual leaders is also a powerful lesson for the future when you look at what happens to those relationships when the leader falls or is removed from power. Yergin's tracing of the entire story of the rise and exile of the Shah of Iran is must reading as western leaders might all be thinking while middle eastern leaders and families might be in danger of falling to that same fate and what effect that would have on our immediate oil supplies.Any western reader and especially readers in the US should look at Yergin's perspective on the fall of the British empire as partially a failure to efficiently transition from a coal economy (coal being a resource England was rich in) to an oil economy (oil being scarce in the British empire until the North Sea discoveries at which time it was really to late to matter). When the US oil balance tipped from exporter to importer and as that balance swings even more out of whack, US readers have to be forced to ask themselves, how long can the US sustain as a world power while exporting so many dollars in exchange for oil and even worse, how ill prepared we could be for a scarcity of oil 25, 50, or 70 years from now. The oil producing nations all recognized 50 or more years ago that their oil revenue would only last so long, that there are only so many decades worth of oil to pump out of the ground at a given pace, and that it was in their interest to maximize the revenue from each barrel pumped. The US and other consumers need to make the corollary discovery: that there is only such much oil to be had and we need to maximize the use and benefit out of each barrel pumped.Fanatically, even though it covers all this ground, all these disparate topics, Yergin's writing is still incredibly readable and the story well put together. It's hard to imagine a history book that is a \\"page turner\\" but this one really is.In short, if you haven't read this, you should. Maybe if every member of the US House and Senate and all the President's advisors would read this, a few light bulbs would turn on (compact fluorescent energy saving bulbs of course) regarding our energy and foreign policies."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"My interest in Daniel Yergin's &quot;The Prize&quot; was piqued earlier in the year, when energy, not terrorism, was the most pressing domestic problem. For an economy that had gotten so caught up with the intangibles, with over-hyped, un-real products (haven't we all had enough of &quot;e-business solutions?&quot;), it was refreshing to study an industry dealing with a very tangible product whose supply is so essential to the survival of our economy itself.&quot;The Prize&quot; traces the history of oil from its humble, entrepreneurial beginnings in the hillsides of western Pennsylvania, to the shrewd domination of the industry by John D. Rockefeller, to the breakup of Standard Oil, and through the discovery of oil in the farthest flung corners of the globe. Part of Yergin's history is something of a tragedy: the gradual seizure of oil from the voyagers who discovered it by national governments who were able to use their seizures to threaten the West during the 1973 oil shock and beyond. In this one very big instance, third world governments really did take on multinational corporations -- and defeated them.Yergin chronicles how oil went from a freewheeling business of refiners and speculators to an instrument of great geopolitical importance, one where nation-states played at least as great a role in shaping the industry as the oil companies did. In this transition, anything could -- and did -- happen. Rock bottom prices threatened the survival of oil producers one year, and sky-high prices forced drastic changes in consumer behavior the next (indeed, &quot;The Prize&quot; does give one a crystal-clear view of the price mechanism). Nightmare scenarios involving the political manipulation of oil did indeed come to pass in 1973, in 1979, and during the Gulf War. There is no shortage of high drama throughout this story.One thing I would add to this book is a few pages, no more, no less, on the science and technology behind oil. What is it -- or what do we think it came from? How is it extracted? How have new technologies increased efficiency?If you want a business history that will simultaneously teach you quite a bit about world history (and about the Middle East), &quot;The Prize&quot; is a sure bet."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"...'Hydrocarbon Man' rocks on. 'Rock Oil' and the 'Age of Oil' are two descriptive phrases that Yergin uses to 'bookend' his epic story - 'The Prize'. He starts with a vignette about how rock oil - a black, sticky substance found in the backwoods of northwest Pennsylvania and used as a folk medicine came to be made into an illuminant (kerosene); one which quickly supplanted whale oil, camphene and 'town gas' (a distillate of coal) as the preferred means of lighting one's home. Yergin concludes with the prospects for the future of us -'hydrocarbon man' as we continue with our dependancy on oil.From the opening pages it is clear that Yergin is an authority on the subject. We have not travelled more than 10 years along the 150 year history of oil and yet we have already learnt it's origins, it's ancient and alternate uses, the products it was competing with, and we have met some of the early inventors, entrepreneur's and explorers.There are three themes that Yergin develops throughout the book. Firstly, the story of oil is the story of capitalism and modern business. The province of Fortune 500 companies, multinationals and the underpinning of wealth in the industrialized west. Certainly, from as early as the late 19th Century, with the emergence of Standard Oil as the first multinational company (a subject Yergin devotes a fair amount of time to),- it's hard to refute this claim. Yergin does recognize that the late 20th Century was less oil lubricated and more computer chip driven, and it's obvious to all of us that this trend will only intensify in this century. Indeed from the time the first edition of 'The Prize' was published (just before the Gulf War) and even since this edition came out in 1993 -things have changed quite a bit economically. In 1990, seven of the top 20 Fortune 500 Companies were in the oil industry. Today you have to extend the search further, and even then only come up with Exxon-Mobil, Enron, Chevron and Texaco.The second theme he highlights is the role oil had in strategic global geoplolitical decicions and disasters. He lays at the feet of 'oil politics' the Japanese decision to bomb Pearl Harbour and Germany's invasion of Russia. Typically in a classic example of the irony that history is famous for, the eventual defeat of these two empires was also due to oil (actually the lack of it). There are of course other more recent strategic oil wars - what was the Gulf War and the unprecedented United Nations stand against Iraq if not a defense of the 'blood supply' for industrialized nations? This revised edition of the book makes it quite clear that Iraq if successful in it's swallowing of Kuwait, would have been the most powerful nation in The Persian Gulf.The third theme is more sociological and forces us to deal with questions not of history but of our future. Yergin states that we have become a 'Hydrocarbon Society' and thus we are 'Hydrocarbon Man'. What characterizes us as this new species? Basically that our cities, politics, economics, values - in fact almost all things material and of importance to us are lubricated with a concern about oil. This used to be seen as a universal good - but no more, There are some of us, Mr Yergin says, including himself, that are concerned about this dependency - It's impact on our behavior, our health and our environment and our ability to sustain our way of life.I agree with other reviewers in that more could have been said on some issues such as alternative energy sources, the economic and environmental arguments for and against our continued reliance on oil and the spin off activities and other associated industries such as plastics and chemicals. But, in fairness to Mr Yergin, there is so much that you can and should say, especially when you find that it is taking you over 800 pages to say it. For me, as a history book on the oil industry, it's certainly long enough but more importantly - good enough."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"Yergin's prize-winning 1991 history stretches from the first Pennsylvania oil rush in 1860 to the crash of world oil prices in 2008, and it all reads like a novel. Well, not quite. The new epilogue, which covers the period after the Gulf war in 11 pages, skims along ten times faster than the rest and feels a bit more like a history lesson. But it gives you a balanced view of recent events.I bought it as I started researching energy. Two full bookshelves later, I can tell you, no other book in this field holds a candle to it for fascination and information. I've read complaints about what it doesn't cover so here are some alternatives, but if you want tales of the way greed, ignorance, and cleverness respond to natural wealth and, in turn, shape world history and current global politics, this is your book.&bull; Oil geology and exploration:Hubbert's Peak: The Impending World Oil Shortage (New Edition).&bull; What to do about OPEC:Carbonomics: How to Fix the Climate and Charge It to OPEC.&bull; Alternatives to Oil:Plan B 3.0: Mobilizing to Save Civilization, Third Edition.&bull; Big Oil's power:The Tyranny of Oil: The World's Most Powerful Industry--and What We Must Do to Stop It.There's no summarizing such a book, but this might give you an idea of the tales it tells: The 1930 discovery of the Black Giant in East Texas nearly destroyed the oil industry, sending prices down to thirteen cents a barrel. After a voluntary shutdown failed, the Governor of Texas sent the Texas Rangers in on horseback. They shut down production and sent prices back up. This led to the Texas Railroad Commission becoming the first government-organized oil cartel &mdash; a model for OPEC years later.As an economist I really appreciate the fact that Yergin gets his economics right. This is crucial for a book about price manipulation, and it's pretty unusual. For example he understands why the Saudis tried to hold price down in 1979 and why Bush Senior flew to Saudi Arabia in 1986 to try to get them to raise the price back up! Yergen helps you understand exactly why things happen in this topsey-turvey world.In any case, The Prize has been selling like hotcakes for 18 years. Whether you're fascinated by powerful historical forces or disgusted but intrigued by fossil fuel, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"Yergin does a great job in writing an informative AND easy to read book. There is little technical jargon to get in the way of the story he tells. \\"The Prize\\" is not onlyinformative,it is also entertaining, especially the cast of characters, ranging form Rockefeller to Bush the Elder (there is a great picture of G.W. Bush as a little boy standing next to his father at an unveiling of an oil facility). There are a few problems, however. First, although it is already over 800 pages long, the book deserves to be longer. More on the Soviet experience in oil, and a focus on pre-Saddam Iraq and other oil producers outside the Persian Gulf would have been welcome. Second, as other reviewers have mentioned,it would be great to see an updated edition come out. The world has changed a lot since the end of Gulf War ( I think the book ends before the collapse of the USSR, but I may be wrong) and I would be very intersted in reading what Yergin has to write about it. Third, while Yergin does discuss many aspects of the international oil scene,it seems to me that his account focuses on the Anglo-American experience a little too much. This stems partly from the pact that America and Britain were the power players in oil for so long, but it would still be nice to see how the oil drama played out elsewhere in the world. My final issue with this otherwise wonderful book is has to do with politics and economics. It is obvious that Yergin was trying to write a \\"fair and balanced\\" account of the history of oil. However, as someone who has been influenced by free-market economics,it is difficult for me not to point out the relationship between oil companies and governments. Whether it is Mexico nationalizing oil wells or New Dealers suing American oil companies for practices the New Dealers themselves encouraged, \\"The Prize\\" tells a story of various governments using every method, fair and foul (usually foul), to pump ,pun intended, oil comapnies out of as much money as possible. The most obivous examples are the nationalizations of oil companies' property in the Middle East,Iran, Mexico,and Venezuela. This is not meant to defend the oil companies as angels of all that is good: they too engage in political rent seeking when it promised more money or power. But, it becomes very easy to see towards the end of the book who really calls the shots in the oil industry. All in all,\\"The Prize\\" is entertaing and informative and makes a great summer read"},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"The Prize follows the major developments in the oil industry, from its inception with the Pennsylvania Rock Oil Company through the Gulf War.The Prize well deserves the praise it has received. Yergin's research and knowledge of the history of the oil industry are obvious and make this a great historical work, yet the length and the abundance of detail do not impinge on the readability of the book.Among many insightful sections of this book, I found the chapters on the role of oil in the Second World War to be particularly interesting. After reading other books about the battles of that war, it was useful to learn something about the logistics behind those battles.It is unfortunate that this book is already a decade old. In his epilogue, Yergin touches on the Gulf War and the effects of the collapse of the Soviet Union, the world's largest oil producer in the late 1980's, but this was not quite history yet when he was writing The Prize."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"We are living in the Age of oil.World and human civilization have experienced different \\"ages\\" such as the Bronze Age, Iron Age, and Gilded Age, and so on. The 20th and 21st Centuries are indeed, the \\"Oil Age.\\" We are living in it. This book is one of the most informative and relevant books published in recent years, In my opinion. This work by Daniel Yergin was and still is prescient today, in 2007. \\"The Prize\\" tells the story of where we are today, and how we got here. It also latently foresees where we're going in the future. The book doesn't tell us - we just know. We're human. This book is so comprehensive and has so much information only a small portion of it can be noted. Below relates to WWII, and former Iranian leader Dr. Mohammed Mossadegh.\\"The Prize\\" proceeds chronologically. And within the chapters there are numerous mini-subtitles for sub-chapters that connect the big picture. The bibliography and index are excellent and can be used to tie in different figures and historical occurrences. The 'history of oil' is actually the history of the world: humankind, business, innovations, globalization, war, and geo-political power-plays. The very survival of a nation-state is based upon oil.\\"The Prize\\" begins with tiny puddles of black, sticky, goo, in Pennsylvania in the mid 1800s. Locals collected this goo and realized its many uses. In 1859 oil was struck. Almost immediately, the wealth and power amassed from possession and control of oil was realized. The initial trust acts in the U.S. are related to the oil industry, in which Barons quickly gained gargantuan amounts of wealth and political power.Enter WWII:The Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor because of oil. Japanese conquests throughout South-East Asia and the Pacific were motivated not only by the quest for dominance but for securing oil and keeping their oil (fuel) supply lines open. Without supply lines of oil, the war machine would completely break down, as it later did (Chapter 8).The Americans sacrificed a lot, but Japan in large part lost WWII because of its lack of fuel for planes, ships, and ground forces. Domestically, the Japanese economy collapsed because of its inability to import oil. The Kamikazes were brought into existence after the Battle of Leyte Gulf, Philippines, in 1944. Lack of oil meant lack of fighter plane fuel. Fuel supplies became so low they actually stopped training Japanese pilots at all. Pilots were ordered to \\"follow the leader\\" to the attack site because they didn't even have navigation training.There was even an \\"Oil Czar\\" In the U.S. during World War II in PAW, the Petroleum Administration for War. The Oil Czar was Harold Ickes.In the European Theater's Eastern Front Germany invaded Russia with Operation Barbarossa mostly to get the oil in the Caucuses (In addition to \\"lebensraum\\" and \\"untermensch\\" beliefs). In addition, a needed land-route to Iron Ore in Scandinavia via the Baltic SSR Republics was a factor. Hitler also began making synthetic oil because without enough of it Germany's war machine, domestic economy, and arms production were doomed. These synthetic oil factories were top targets in Allied bombing missions.Oil and the Cold War World:The Soviets dominated Eastern Europe and exerted its influence after WWII for 45 years because the Allies ran out of gasoline. When the British 3rd Army and U.S. 1st Army were advancing eastward toward Berlin chasing demoralized, retreating, and broken German troops in disarray. But because of the lack of gasoline for the Allied Armies, a million people ended up losing their lives and war was prolonged because the Germans were able to retreat and re-organize (page 388).If someone says \\"it's not about the oil\\" today in 2007, tell them to read this book. Oil encompasses almost all things in our daily lives, whether we are are conscious of it, or not.Oil, Military, and Economic Interests:Democratically elected governments are overthrown by foreign governments because of oil. In 1953 Dr. Mohammed Mossadegh was democratically elected in Iran. He was an anti-communist. He didn't like the 93% to 7% profit sharing split with a British Oil company operating inside Iran. He changed it to 50-50. The CIA sponsored a coup to overthrow him. Americans were repeatedly told by the U.S. media that Mossadegh was a communist and communist sympathizer, although factually untrue. The American public believed this propaganda, according to poll results. Gullible? Mossadegh was ousted and the Shah was placed in power. Democracy has never been supported in the Middle East and it isn't now by the U.S. government. Also see the Carter Doctrine of 1980.Most of us as individual consumers literally need oil to function. Dependence upon oil is for the continuation of the nation-state, its military machines, and domestic economy. More critical today, is that nation-states need a *sufficient* supply of it.This is a positive book. It's a history book.We're in the heart of the \\"Oil Age.\\""},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"\\"The Prize\\" is considered to be the \\"black bible\\" of the oil industry and not without reason. Yergin has written an outstanding book, so well researched that just the notes and bibliography together are almost 100 pages!! This book is highly deserving of the Pulitzer price.Reading this book will be like an intensive course / refresher of your history knowledge of the last two centuries. The author starts back in the 19th century. The big day, 27 August 1859, the day \\"The Colonel\\" Edwin L. Drake found oil in Titusville, Texas - till just after the Golf War in 1991.A book covering the last two centuries, gives us quite naturally, a large dose of world history. And many pages are dedicated to men that made a huge impact, and was an important part of this history - Nobel, Teagle, Rockefeller, \\"The Colonel\\" (Drake), Gulbenkian, and Churchill just to mention a few. Further, the author gives us an insight to the politics in the oil industry, governmental interference and how the politics in the industry works (or don't...). In lay man terms Yergin explains why and how vulnerable the industry is, about the more resent but also the past oil-crisis, how little it takes for the oil-price to spin out of control, and how the economies around the world more and more depend on the black gold.Unfortunately, with its +800 pages this is not a book you accidentally pick just to have something to read. I am sure that the length of this book keeps lay readers away from it and that is a shame. It can be quite daunting project to start on, but once you have started, you will not put it away until you have finished it. I must admit that I was a little sceptical to what level the language would be on, but fear not, the book is kept on an accessible level, even for the lay reader. To the author's credit, he strikes the perfect balance between facts, technical jargon, and anecdotes, which makes \\"The Prize\\" a long, time-consuming, but nevertheless fascinating and entertaining read.I found \\"The Prize\\" to be a great overview over the industry. I picked up lots and lots of new facts from this book, and I am certain that I will cite this book in the future. On a personal note, I wish the author would update the book with more than a new preface. A few more chapters to include the last decade as well would be highly welcome.I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to fill in on the knowledge of the oil industry."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"I decided to pick up this book because I wanted to know how influential oil was as a factor in international politics. In the run-up to Operation Iraqi Freedom, many protestors held signs saying &quot;No blood for Oil.&quot; Was the war all about oil?? I decided to find out. I was told by many that this was a definitive account of the role of oil in world politics and a good place to start...Not only was it a great history lesson, it was an absolute page turner!! You wouldn't think a history of the oil industry could be gripping, but his depiction of the characters, world leaders and crucial decisions of the 20th century was compulsive reading.Clearly, as Yergin points out, oil is a VERY strong, motivating factor behind many geo-political issues...Absolutely brilliant.

It should be required reading for all students of history..."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"As an engineer who has worked in both exploration and refining, I would have to recommend this as required reading for anyone who works in the oil and gas industry. Several years of working in the industry have given me a knowledge base, but nothing like the education Yergin gave me in The Prize. This book looks at the history of oil from its beginnings in Pennsylvania, the Standard Oil Trust, the middle east and all the other major discoveries that laid the foundation for the world's largest industry. The most interesting part of the book I found to be the major part oil and its supply played in both world wars. I had no idea what a crucial factor it was in instigating and ending the wars. What an amazing book!! It may be a bit long for those who are not familiar with the industry. But even so, for anyone with a thirst for knowledge about the world we live in, it will be extremely entertaining. Well deserving of a Pullitzer Prize when it was written."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"This book spells out how oil fuels our national affluence, how the very survivals of nations depend upon oil, how competition for oil contributed to WWI and caused WW2, and how the lack of oil defeated Rommell's North Africa campaign and left Japan defenseless. It contains information without which we, the electorate, would be voting largely in the dark. It reveals, for example, the true motivation for our war on Iraq. This book will help to restore our republic.Why only four stars for such a master-work? Because Yergin covered up at least these four major facts:1. That soon after Middle Eastern oil was discovered Britain set up puppet regimes protected by British troops acting as enforcers in a lucrative (for Britain) protection racket.2. The US/UK's pre-WW2 threat to Japan's access to oil.3. That Reagan's successful pressure on Saudi-Arabia to sell more oil at lower prices was aimed at destroying the USSR by cutting off its crucial oil income.4. That US Ambassador April Glasbie OK'd Saddam's invasion of Kuwait."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"Yergin rewrites the history of the last 150 years through the perspective of the oil industry. Oil is the hidden hand that controls unfolding events. Is it any accident that the U.S. and Russia became the great powers of the 20th Century? -- they were the two early leaders in oil production. War machinery starts to shift to oil in World War I -- battleships goes from coal to oil; and the French and British pioneer the military use of automobiles and tanks. World War II is all about oil. Japan starts the Pacific War in response to American embargo of oil and with intent to seize the oil fields of the East Indies. Hitler strikes out for the Russian oil fields and overextends himself. By the end of the war he lacks the oil to feed his new jets, tanks, and armored divisions. An important front of the Cold War involves competition for the new oil in the Middle East. And finally, the history of the last 20 years is dominated by Hussein's attempt to get a corner on the oil market by seizing Kuwait and threatening Saudi Arabia.More fascinating than the wars is the lack of wars over this major commodity. As Yergin points out, the largest wealth transfer in history is the one to oil exporting countries in the late 20th century. The system of oil concessions that split profits with the host company is abandoned; host now takes all. These small, militarily weak producing countries were able to seize all of the profits and to reap extraordinary profit from the intense demand for this product. Remarkably (with the exception of Hussein's gambit) there is no assertion of military power to interfere with this. I suppose that too much is at stake for the big players to make a power grab -- it's in everyone's interest to cooperate so that we don't descend into international economic and political chaos.Yergin also sees the business cycle as driven by oil. The economy under Carter fails because of high oil prices. An oil glut in the 1980's explains the success of the economy under Reagan. The economy rebounds in the mid to late 1990s because of cheap oil. And the boom times of the early years of the 21st century is also explained by cheap oil. Supply and demand oscillate wildly over the years and the exporters and oil companies strive to stabilize the market. At present, demand is extraodinary given the emergence of China, India, and a host of other eocnomies. Conservation efforts have the effect of moderating demand, and at times the willingness of producers to cheat the quoata system combined with conservation efforts have led to boom times of cheap oil.As Yergin points out, fears that we will soon run out of oil have always been present. Certainly there will be a push to get oil from more difficult locations and a push for more alternative energy sources and conservation. So the oil won't run out, but the cost of it will spiral upwards and the ability of the world to sustain prolonged boom periods is doubtful.Yergin does a good job of making very dry material interesting. He explores the personalities of the men involved in this industry, and he writes well.This book will take you forever to read, but it will change your view of history."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"The book is full of interesting connections between petroleum and history, but is a substantial book.The Audible audiobook is a joke with less than three hours for a book that would be tens of hours if actually narrated."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"The economic development of the past 200 years has been both remarkable and entirely unanticipated. Over this period, the average person in the U.S. has been able to increase his well-being by a multiple of at least 37, using conservative measures of real per capita GDP over time.Affordable technologies, such as the washing machine, automobile, airplane, television, medical equipment, cheap clothing, air conditioning, freight transport, etc., have enabled the common man to have access to the 19th Century equivalent of approximately 99 servants (voluntary or otherwise). The economic base of these technologies has been plentiful and cheap energy. Coal, oil, natural gas and nuclear energy have replaced or supplemented the labor of 19th Century servants, which was only accessible to the elites and ruling classes of the time.Thus, in order to understand the economic development of the last 200 years, we need to understand the history of energy. In \\"The Prize,\\" Daniel Yergin provides a very interesting and reasonably comprehensive history of oil. Clocking in at approximately 900 pages, Yergin documents the people, enterprises, technologies and political intrigue that have shaped our modern conception of oil. However, don't let the heft of the tome intimidate you. Yergin's writing style and storytelling are accessible and the book was hard to put down. The only downside is that the book ends at the first Iraq war and has not been updated in subsequent re-issues.The most interesting themes in the book are as follows:* The boom and bust cycle: The debates over peak oil have been with us from almost the very beginning of large scale oil production. Used first as an illuminate and then subsequently transformed into a source of motor power, oil has gone through several cycles of being incredibly cheap (i.e. free) to being a source of extreme anxiety over scarcity and price.* Political conflict: The quest for oil has led to severe political conflicts and its abundance or scarcity among enemies has impacted the outcomes of several wars, particularly WWII.* Economic rents: While the conflict over oil concessions and revenue splits has largely been resolved, Ricardian rents in oil and whether these rents should accrue primarily to the oil producers or the host countries provides an interesting real-world example of this economic concept.* The tragedy of the commons: The manner in which oil rights are defined can lead to \\"over grazing\\" (i.e. premature exhaustion) since no one has a property right in the reserve itself. A reserve's yield is dependent on its inherent pressure and this pressure decreases as more wells are drilled to access it. Enterprises and governments have a difficult time overcoming this problem as antitrust laws collide with government sanctioned production quotas meant to alleviate overproduction.* The resource curse: Having sovereignty over a large oil reserve is a lot like winning the lottery. Your wealth and happiness are anything but assured (e.g. Iran, Libya, and Iraq).We consumers love the technologies and increased well-being that cheap energy enables. But, we continue to have a deep-seated concern about the impact of oil on the environment and resource dependency. Since this ambivalence will be with us for the foreseeable future, Yergin's book will continue to be relevant even though it has not been updated since the early 1990s. Recommended."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"Daniel Yergin's monster of a book was completed in 1990, right at the start of the first Gulf War and before the fall of the USSR. That means that you only get to learn about 1859--1989 while reading his 780 pp history of the oil business.This book has been on my \\"to do\\" list for a long time, and I am glad that I read it. I now know a lot more about the oil business (and oil politics!). That knowledge provides useful insights into the the present and gives me some idea of what will happen in the future.I will not give you a long summary of the book. For that, start with wikipedia. The short version of the book is:1. Americans started the oil industry with lighting; it was run by rough, smart, aggressive characters.2. Electricity killed the lighting market (kerosene), but the fuel market (diesel and gasoline) took its place.3. Before WWII, most oil was controlled by US and UK firms that worked all over the world; the US was the biggest producer.4. Mexico was first to nationalize its oil (breaking contacts with foreign companies) in 1938.5. Oil was important in WWI, when it helped machines replace horses. It was critical in WWII, when its absence choked the Nazis and a shortage nearly ended Britain's resistance.6. After WWII, supply outran demand, and prices dropped.7. Iran (under the Shah) fought with Saudi Arabia for title of biggest exporter. These \\"beggar thy neighbor\\" races for market share hurt everyone, in an echo of the same overpumping that harmed oil US producers in the 1920s.8. It was not until the 1980s that oil prices were really set in transparent markets; before then, they were set in long-term contracts, in bilateral negotiations that sometimes had nothing to do with economics.In addition to this outline of trends, I made the following notes:* Water is not even CLOSE to oil in significance for military or political actions. It's VERY unlikely that an army would lose a battle for lack of water or a nation be invaded for its water supplies. That's because water is everywhere, but oil is not.* There were a lot of VERY smart people in the oil business. Global competition forced the best to the top. No such competition exists in the water world, either in terms of measured talent or productivity nor in terms of the size of the market or incentives to succeed or fail.* The Office of Price Administration (J.K. Galbraith was on staff and on topic) opposed raising prices in WWII, making it more likely that the US would have fuel shortages and the military would not have enough oil to fight. Vacations to Florida were making it more likely that the Axis would be the owners of Disney World.* The US was involved in Saudi Arabia from the start, and that involvement meant that the US was not too critical of mistakes or misrule in Saudi.* The first oil concessions favored capitalist companies. Producing countries then unilaterally rewrote contracts for 50/50 profit splits. New-comers offered more to get into the game. After awhile, most concessions were nationalized.* Everything changed in 1973, when the Arab -- not OPEC -- embargo against Israeli allies during the Yom Kippur War raised prices to levels never before seen. It's important to note that Small is Beautiful and Limits to Growth were in the public consciousness at the time. With the intellectual background in place, people saw the advantages to using less. It was a total change compared to use more more more...In the United States, the shortfall struck at fundamental beliefs in the endless abundance of resources, convictions so deeply rooted in the American character and experience that a large part of the public did not even know, up to October 1973, that the United States imported any oil at all. But, in a matter of months, American motorists saw retail gasoline prices climb by 40 percent -- for reasons that they did not understand... The embargo and the shortage it caused were an abrupt break with America's past, and the experience would severely undermine America's confidence in the future. [pp 616-7]* Oil exploration, production and distribution takes a lot of money, talent and coordination. The oil market was run like a big bureaucracy for many years, but many surprises and mistakes increased the cost of handling complexity. The rise of markets removed a lot of those problems, or at least minimized their harm.This book provides an excellent background to how the oil business grew and changed the world. For more on the (financial, environmental and political) damage that oil causes us today, read Crude World.Bottom Line: I give The Prize five stars for its clear and thorough exposition of an industry that gave us the good life today -- and the industry whose unsustainable product threatens to take that prosperity away."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"This is the standard.

He shows that the basic problems of the oil industry (overproduction, underproduction and voliatile prices) have consistantly repeated since the beginnings of the industry.If there is a flaw, its that Yergin doesn't give enough coverage to the oil industry in Africa and its role in the global oil trade. It gets occasional mentions, but not the comprehensive coverage the middle east gets. The same comments apply to an extent to south america. He could have also done a better job in explaining how oil money tends to distort economies from Alaska to Norway to Saudi Arabia in the same general ways.The final chapter of the book is dated and some of its speculation about the future didn't hold up very well.

It reads like a thriller as it describes the perpetual oil shortage that plagued the industry and consumer from day one; explains how nations such as Japan and Germany were affected profoundly by oil, or lack thereof, during World War II; and U.S. & European prospecting in the Middle East.Heavy as it may sound, it is an easy read with historical anecdotes throughout such as why Marcus Samuel named his oil company \\"Shell\\" and how Alfred Nobel instituted the Nobel Prize as a meaningful legacy after the media erroneously announced his death, published his obituary, and condemned him for creating dynamite.As oil prices continue to rise and our president publicly announces that we must seek alternative energy sources, The Prize has been more than entertaining: it's been enlightening, educational and offered a manageable understanding of the industry and international relations."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"This is an excellent book for anyone wanting to learn about the history of the oil industry and its effect on World history. Not only is it informative, but it is also well written and interesting to read.Although it is almost 1000 pages long, it kept my interest throughout. Much of the book is focused on the impact oil, or lack of it, has had on governments and wars. Although the book discusses many major oil field discoveries with some detail. I would have preferred the author to go into more detail with regard to the discovery of Prudhoe Bay and the North Sea. Nonetheless, this is a book that I would strongly recommend to any history fan or anyone interested in oil."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"This book takes the reader into the inside of oil history, as empires rise and fall just because of abundance of oil or lack of it. We see today that energy has become an integral part of our lives, and the author's theory is that we live in the \\"Hydrocarbon Age\\" as \\"Hydrocarbon Men\\". I think this is the best book anyone should seek to educate him/herself on Oil. Really worth evry penny spent."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"Yes, the size of the book is a bit daunting- over 700 pages. Thankfullly Yergin is an excellent writer and those 700 pages quickly seem like no burden at all. \\"The Prize\\" is an engrossing tale of oil that shows how important the commodity has been for the last century and a half.Yergin adds short little stories to his history that add flavor and color to the book. My favorite was about the last British man to leave Iran following the 1979 revolution. He had just come down with a major sickness when the Ayatollah came to power and he went through one hell of a time to get back to Great Britian.Anyway, the book hardly ever drags and is not boring at all. The history of WW II is especially enlightening. \\"The Prize\\" also is a great explanation of why we have such a vested interest in the Middle East.

I especially found his chapters on World War II interesting; the degree to which a need for oil drove Hitler's war plans, as well as those of the Japanese and Americans. It's an aspect of the war that war historians don't pay much attention to but it's incredibly important. This approach provides insights into other areas of world affairs that make it worth struggling through the book's considerable length."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"In a word, superb.

Every time the oil companies are thwarted he seems to blame straw men for it: tree huggers, the people that hounded poor misunderstood Tricky Dick Nixon, the Saudi sheiks (best friends of Bush, Cheney, et al). He never turns his gaze on the corruption of the oil companies themselves. We hit peak oil in the U.S. in the 1960s. The oil companies suppressed any attempts since then to find alternative fuels.

K.Get ready.Take a ...deeeeeeep ....breath.....This book, written in 1991, is about to become relevant again!Yergin's \\"hydrocarbon man\\" is alive and well and living in the 21st century. No book has ever captured the excitement, risk, and reward of the oil business like this volume does. Daniel Yergin documents oil patch history, from the simple beginnings as a native american medicine to todays complex international traffiking. Truely, hydrocarbon extraction from the subsurface is the stuff of modern life. Try to live without the carbon-hydrogen bond and you'll find out what life is like with an odd-even social-security-number lottery for the gas chamber.

And buy him a beer."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"This book was published in 1992 so it doesn't contain information beyond the Bush presidency and into the 21st Century. What it contains is the history of the use of oil as a means of energy and light. While Oil does appear in the background of many history textbooks, its history is ignored even as it gradually takes over the lives of most on the planet Earth. This book covers the period in which oil is discovered to be a better source of light than whale oil and cheap enough to be used by the general public. Kerosene changes lives. No longer do people feel force to go to bed once the sun goes down and rise when it comes up, but to actually do somethings at night especially in the rural areas. The danger of transporting kerosene pails in the light of profits and a better standard of living. Later the internal combustion engine is invented using oil as the combustion source and oil takes flight. This book is also great at revealing how the World Wars were able to expand and focus on greater transportation, weapons and technology due to the expanding use of oil. It also affected where people fought and what they fought over. The lack of oil may have helped damn the Nazis from taking over all of Europe. This book is very good at explaining how oil has affected lives. The details on the Carter Administration and the Gulf War are fascinating. This book won a well deserved Pulitzer Prize for Non-Fiction. I highly recommend it and would like to see the PBS series also."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"This significant tome is Daniel Yergin's fascinating, 1992 Pulitzer prize-winning account of the personalities, politics, adventures and misadventures behind the evolution of the ruthless global oil business. This authoritative, intelligent and highly entertaining book reports on the past, present and future of the commodity that shapes the world power struggle. Yergin delves knowledgeably into fulcrum events. For example, shortly before World War I, Winston Churchill made the fateful decision to convert British navy's fuel from coal to Iranian oil. This decision set off the modern Western quest for Middle Eastern oil. The world is still feeling its wrenching impact, and Yergin shows how and why. getAbstract finds that this book provides an essential context for understanding today's international conflicts."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"Daniel Yergin made is his name as an oil industry analyst by writing this book. As far as I am aware, this book is the best history of the oil industry ever written.It is comprehensive and begins prior to the start of the modern oil industry, discusses the U.S. oil industry when U.S. oil production on U.S. soil was a major player in global oil. It then proceeds to the rise of middle east production, the formation of ARAMCO (Saudi American Oil Company), and winds its way to the modern dominance of the oil and gas fields in and about the Persian Gulf. You may need to check for an updated edition - if there is one - or supplement this book with the history of the oil industry within the last ten years. This supplementation is just a function of when this book was published. The book has not been superceded in its field.This is required reading for any student of the global oil industry."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"As a third generation oilman, this book, while now dated by about eighteen years, gives the reader one of the best oil and gas history books ever written. It was the last book that my father, a wiildcatter for over forty years, read before his death and he too was amazed how Mr. Yergin was able to take such enormous amount of information and distill it down into a narrative as if one were there during the major events that shaped the petroleum industry. If only the so-called envirnomentalists would lift a finger and read books like this, their credibilty as to the subject matter would rise dramatically. What is striking about this particular history book on the petroleum industry, is how Mr. Yergin does a tremendous job in informing the reader how petroleum actually brought human society into what we now call the \\"modern age\\" and how the industry truly affected almost every event over the last 150 years, from scientific advancements to world wars. I would put this book into the category of required reading for anyone entering the oil and gas business right up there with \\"The Greatest Gamblers\\" written almost a half century ago by Ruth Sheldon Knowles."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"I just finished the Prize after 4 months and it was a great read.

I don't have any complaints really, just two minor ones: the discussion of detailed negotiations tends to be long-winded, but otherwise that's not a problem. I know this is not a science book, perhaps because Americans tend to be scared by science and chemistry, but I would have loved to have had some chemistry and geology tossed in to replace the overly detailed negotiation accounts. This is a wonderful book, among the top ten non-fiction books I have ever read. Yergin has a wonderfully readable style, loads of information that is easily digested.

Yergen who is also the author of \\"Commanding Heights\\" the proclaimed PBS documentary is an excellent writer. Althought I came late to the table to read this book it is still as valuable today as it was when first published. If you are interested in oil and oil policy this is a must read."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"I can't overemphasize how good this book is. Published 15 years ago, it remains current. The oil industry continues to lay close to the center of the struggle for international power and survival in world affairs.Yergin is equally good at explaining oil's colorful and distant past and the events of more modern memory - the oil shocks of the 1970s and the seizing of power by the oil producing states from the big oil companies.He makes comprehensible the ebb and flow of market forces and politics that constantly reshape the industry. He lays out the many fascinating personalities who shaped the business, from John D. Rockefeller to the Buckleys and Mellons, to the trading geniuses who shaped the European, Russian and Indonesian ends of the business, to the many adventurers who risked everything to find or secure huge oil fields.And he is invaluable at explaining the evolution of the oil situation in critical countries - Iran, Saudi Arabia and Iraq. His explanation, for example, of the overthrow of the Mossadegh government in Iran in the early 1950s, and the restoration of the Shah to the throne, is not only illuminating but entirely at odds with the usual \\"imperialism at its worst!!\\" that socialist types like to hurl at it.I would be fascinated to hear Yergin's take on the events of the current day - whether or not the Iraq war is actually a \\"war for oil\\", as critics can't resist saying; how the perception of global warming or the booming Chinese and Indian demand affects the industry; and whether we're actually running out of oil. As readers learn, this particular doomsday scenario has been regularly predicted for more than a century."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"With growing urbanization and rapid population growth, there was growing understanding that the existing sources of energy were rapidly being depleted. It became obvious to the brightest and most adventurous that whoever found a new energy source would be incredibly wealthy. Of course, I am talking about the 1850's and the energy source was whale oil.Thus began the modern age's love affair with petroleum. The Prize is the best (and as far as this reviewer knows the only) one volume history of the oil industry. As the author mentioned on CSPAN, he tried to write a history of oil and ended up writing a history of the 20th Century.As mentioned in the reviews and on the cover, this book has been developed into a major PBS documentary. Additionally, the History channel has done a special based on the book that is quite good. Moreover, one can see the author providing expert opinion on MSNBC where he is a paid oil consultant. Despite these other information sources that are available, none of these compare with the level of knowledge in this book.Ever wonder what happened to Standard Oil? The story is in this book.Ever wonder why we just can not build more refineries in theU S to fix the refinery short-fall? That answer is in this book.Ever wonder why the Germans could make synthetic fuel for the last two and half years of WWII and why we still do not do that now? The answer is in this book.The author's insights and opinions are quite good and as relevant to events today as there were when the book was first published in 1990. However, he is on shaky ground when he tries to apply his knowledge of the oil industry to warfare. His analysis on WWI is uniquely insightful, but he only repeats the standard (and accepted) dogma on the Japanese in World War II. However, when he discusses the land war in Europe in WWII, he is completely in the land of conjecture that more fuel would have ended the war more quickly. It is just as possible that more fuel would have simply allowed Patton to lead his forces off into a trap.Despite that one shortfall, this is one of those books that every American citizen should read to understand the current world around them. I can not imagine anyone making intelligent voting decisions or participating in the development of public policy without the firm grounding provided by The Prize."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"...then you really want to know about this book.

As Yergin stresses, little that has been achieved in the 20th century could have been achieved without it. Starting with the initial discoveries during the mid-nineteenth century and culminating with the Gulf War, this is a sweeping story in the mode of David McCullogh's &quot;The Path Between the Seas.&quot; Yergin is a insightful and talented writer and the book reads like an adventure story. Along the way, he very much gives an important history subject its due."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"\\"Behind every great fortune is a great crime.\\" The fortunes discussed here involve oil. Two of the most interesting figures are Rockefeller Sr., who is portrayed as a miserly monopolist; and Gulbenkian, an Armenian philosopher and consummate businessman. Getty, the muckrackers, and other historical figures are also mentioned in detail. But Yergin's book--more accurately described as a delightful tome--does not stop there. He covers world leaders from Eisenhower--who stopped the British from re-taking the Suez Canal post-Nasser--to the Shah, who replaced, then jailed, Mossadegh.A major historical omission Yergin makes is that he fails to note Kermit Roosevelt's possible role in Operation Ajax, which is discussed in Perkins' _Confessions of an Economic Hit Man_. Still, the scope of this book is incredible. We learn that oil was around one dollar a barrel in the 1940's (meaning our addiction to \\"black gold\\" is fairly new); that BP is the successor to the nationalized Anglo-Persian Oil Company; that U.S. and British policy wished to prevent Anglo-Persian's oil from falling into Communist hands, making today's current events especially interesting; that one possible reason we, rather than the British, have a special relationship with Saudi Arabia may involve FDR's superior knowledge of Middle Eastern culture, as well as his polio; that at one point, Venezuela and Mexico were our major suppliers of oil, with Venezuela supplying 55% of the U.S.'s oil (Today, Canada, Mexico, and Venezuela still supply most of our oil); that Leavittown gave rise to suburbs (fun quote from its founder: \\"No man who owns his own house and lot can be a Communist. He has too much to do.\\"); and much more. This book should be required reading in every history classroom in America. It enlivens history with its detailed depictions of characters who changed the course of world history. It is around 800 pages in paperback, and is, without question, worth the time investment."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"Reading \\"The Prize\\" is no easy feat, and it is certainly not your typical Sunday afternoon engagement. But the book's volume is testament both the complexity of the subject with which it is preoccupied as it is to the author's willingness to approach it with sufficient detail to do it justice (and the book's references are a great guide for further reading). After all, the story of oil begins in America almost a century and a half ago, and, in the meantime, fascinates entrepreneurs, politicians, strategists, economists, and, increasingly, consumers who care about the price on the pump and of the heating oil to keep the house warm. To put all this in a single narrative is no small task; and yet Daniel Yergin succeeds admirably, and it is no wonder that he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for his effort.What makes \\"The Prize\\" a great book is that it is a great read; it is sufficiently attuned to the broader history that it gives the reader a sense of perspective and purpose--it offers a continuous idea of how the part fits in the whole. But Mr. Yergin's talents extend beyond his ability to make sense out of a complicated story; it is refreshing to read his book combine politics and economics in a coherent and understandable fashion; to read him navigate through various historical and political settings, whether that is turn-of-the-century America, conservative Saudi Arabia or revolutionary Iran. And yet the richness of the story is to be found in anecdotes--the brief glimpses which reveal so much in so little space, whether that is insight into a personality or a window into a historical moment.If making sense of a disparate story is the book's chief goal, the need to do so is the book's real significance. Our current preoccupations--whether regarding the price of oil, or the search for alternative energy sources, or the instability of the regions which produce oil--are rather old, about as old as oil itself. In a way, this offers comfort--it is always good to read that previous alarms have proven largely false. But it is also a warning to avoid simplistic ways out--if nothing else, \\"The Prize\\" offers a wealth of information which can put oil in a historic context. Reading it will prove not only educational, but it will also help a reader distinguish between the serious and the silly in the public debates on the future of energy in general and oil in particular."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"This book is fantastic.

Drake drilled the first oil well in 1859, to 1990 and Saddam Hussein's invasion of Europe. Mr. Yergin combines the remarkable story-telling style of Gibbon (Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire) with the intensely factual and rigorous analysis style of Paul Keneddy (Rise and Fall of Great POwers). The result is a book which you shall like, irrespective of whether your interest is in stories or in the economics or in the politics of oil.An understanding of Oil and its Strategic Significance as a natural resource have driven the foreign policy of all major powers all through the 20th century.This book also offers insights into the Psyche of the oil producing nations and the factors governing their policy.

Michael Yergin, now the CEO of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, in 1991 wrote this tome which is the defacto standard text and reference for anyone interested in reading about the history of oil.This is a meticulously researched book which chronicles the rise of oil from Pennsylvania through the present. Yergin weaves a comprehensive chronological narrative of how the modern oil industry came into existence. This work from Michael Yergin won the Pulitzer Prize to boot.There are numerous books on oil. Many focus on peak oil. Some focus on the tyranny or how the industry is downright evil. This book though is all about the facts. College history professors could use this book. It presents the facts and the history and lets the reader reach any conclusions they want. Some have mentioned that this work is \\"pro-oil\\" but in my frank opinion, the book merely focuses on the facts vs the rhetorical or political aspects of the industry. After you read this book, you can make up your own mind or read supplementary materials to develop your own position. However, without reading this book, it is somewhat difficult to develop an informed opinion on the industry. If you want to know the history of the oil industry, this is the one stop shop.Beware though, this is not light reading. Sometimes it reads very fast and sometimes you muddle through it depending on what aspect of the oil industry you're interested in.After studying this work the reader will be able to intelligently speak about the history of oil and see through many of the shallower and erroneous assumptions people make about the industry.If you have to buy 1 and only 1 book on oil.

I read it during a flight to DC and several people commented to me on the plane and in the airports that it was a great book. This story is really a story of the twentieth century. It is the story of the rise of the Oil industry. What a mess! What a collection of crooks, crony capitalists, get-rich schemers, and arrogant imperialists! I loved it! Not that I want to be like any of these guys. But it was really engrossing to read. The author really brought the characters alive, and I think he didn't really damn them or worship them. He just told us what happened in a lively and very detailed way. The most interesting part for me was the way Oil was at the heart of most of the geo-political issues in all of modern history. I always knew that oil was part of the equation in historical issues, but to have the whole story revolve around it gave new appreciation for its impact on world societies.

In fact, as late as WWII, the United States was the top oil producer in the world, which helped not only its own development but also single handedly helped the Allies win what was supposed to be the final world war. The history of oil and the impact it has had in the world in every way, from politics, to country conflicts, to corporate structures is profound.

The one fact that burned into my brain is the energy content of oil versus coal for warships during World War I. Ships burning oil instead of coal had more powerful engines while saving space and man-power. I don't recollect the figure, but it was staggering to realize an oil-fueled ship, say a British cruiser, could have as much firepower (after deducting weight and space for the bigger ship) as a coal-fueled German battleship. Oil is the stuff of victory. Akin to Frank Herbert's literary object \\"Spice\\" in his Dune series, alliances and treaties mean nothing to nations when struggling for a secure source of oil.To understand the importance of oil is to also understand how vulnerable oil-dependent countries are against suppliers, dwindling supply, and the politics involved in protecting the flow of oil products.Realizing the implications of oil-dependency should be an important part of our future public education cirriculum."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"Very informative.

It is one of my all time favorites, including novels, biographies and the lot. Daniel Yergin, the author, makes a very exciting plot of the history of the oil business, starting in Pennsylvania in 1859.The best parts, both analytical and epical, is where he writes about the upstream part of the oil business, ie. exploring, finding and producing crude. The story takes us from Pennsylvania, to Texas, Indonesia, Russia, Venezuela, Mexico, Persia, Kuwait and Saudi-Arabia to Alaska.Yergins main thesis is that oil became a strategic commodity around 1900. Nations and governments want control over crude, because they are unable to conduct wars without it. Therefore they are willing to go to war to secure oil supplies, and availability of oil determined to a certain extent the outcome of WWII.The book is also a very good account on general world history between 1859 and 1991.

Yergin's style is masterful: a complex historical epic is told as a series of succinct anecdotes, filled with colorful characters who are deftly drawn and dramatic episodes that are vivid and alive. Along the way, &quot;The Prize&quot; provides an amazing education on the development of modern industry, the creation of the global economy, and just about every important historical event of the past 150 years. This is a compelling book: read it and you will have a far greater understanding of world events, both past and present."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"Kind librarians should consider filing The Prize in the \\"Reference\\" section as a clear warning to readers. Yergin's book is a laboriously impressive volume of forgettable details by one of the oil industry's most gifted analysts. It is not a light bedtime or commuter train friend!- The storyline lacks a cohesive theme- There are no main characters (including the oil companies!) tying the narrative together- Personalities appear and dissolve forever in rapid-fire succession, leaving little imprint on the storyline- The chronology often spirals confusingly in time, digressing into analyses which exhibit all the charm of a workplace memoYergin has written an exhaustive business history using the wrong medium. I suggest chopping The Prize up into bite-sized pieces and posting it to a website. There, at least, the disjointed pages would bear no responsibility for drawing the reader forward."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"Daniel Yergin certainly writes well and has a good eye for a telling anecdote. This profile of the oil industry offers an important perspective on 20th century world history, and it highlights numerous entertaining characters. Although the book provides solid insights into the Middle East, it always presents a westernized (big oil company) perspective."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"An excellent history of the oil industry. This book civers fron the first oil find until today. It well documents the impact that oil has had on the world in the past as well as today. The formation of some of the biggest industrial concerns in the history of the world a covered in this book as well. The author also explains the dominant role of the Middle East in the oil industry picture. This is a very informative and readable book even if it is long. This book is a good writing on a subject that is hard to write about. This book also does a good job describing the makeup and breakup of the Standard Oil Company. Be sure to read this book."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"The Prize is a lengthy historical narrative. &quot;Historical&quot; means that the book concentrates on politics and social implications, with minimal attention to technological developments (i.e., viturally no mention of the science or technology of oil production). &quot;Narrative&quot; means that it isn't always specified exactly who did what when, and coverage is erratic and fagmented. So, while fascinating, this is not a reference. The reader does not get a reasonably complete history of any specific oil company or producing area."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"This is a thoroughly readable text starting with the discovery of oil in Titusville, Pennsylvania and ending with the Iranian revolution. I ponder what insight Yergin would bring to a follow-up book but he is secure resting on his laurels. This book is a must-read for anyone wishing to understand the power-struggles in the oil industry. As for shortages, Yergin suggests that there have been several. Once oil became scarce in Pennsylvania, which supplied kerosene for lamps throughout the world, new discoveries followed in turn-in Indonesia, in east Texas, Russia, Iraq, Iran, and the Arabian peninsula. It is small wonder that as the thirst for oil grew, we, in the modern world, became accustomed to new finds. Beyond the new discoveries, Yergin explains how Standard Oil of Indiana saved the day by developing, in the early 1900s, a new process for cracking oil to produce gasoline efficiently. Without this invention, the internal combustion engine would have stalled on the market-long before Henry Ford could dismiss his customer's complaint about the model T by saying, \\"They can have any color they want, as long as it's black.\\" This is also a story about interesting characters. The descriptions of Rockefeller, Getty and the founders of Shell and British Petroleum were very entertaining. But, I am forgetting the undertone in Yergin's book. I enjoyed the tales of how the thirst for oil affected the strategies of the warring parties during World War II. And, how political intrigue between the great powers (England, the US, and others), and the indigenous people, who owned the oil, worked to shape our modern world.Hey, if you found this helpful, please show your appreciation."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"The definitive documented history of petroleum's profound influence on the course civilization.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"This book is comprehensive and well written. It will give the reader a complete history of the development of the oil industry and how it has contributed to the shaping of world events. It is especially relevant to anyone seeking to understand what is happening in the Middle East"},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"The engines of the modern world run on hydrocarbons, and especially on oil & gas. and The Prize is an excellent, accessible history of the oil & gas industry, the impact it has had on world history and politics, and the corresponding impact of world events back on the industry itself.Oil fields are a wasting asset -- once found, they require capital for development, and once developed they become depleted. Yergin shows that the industry's story is largely a matter of finding balance -- (1) the balance between the ongoing need to find new sources, the depletion of those sources, and the need to find and hold market share, and (2) the balance between the countries that own resources, the companies that develop those resources and the consumers of oil and gas.Although this is not a very recent book, it explains the principlpes that underlie the dynamics of the oil industry. The reader comes away with an understanding of both yesterday's and today's oil-related geopolitics and economics. Explaining that complex linkage is quite an accomplishment, and explaining it so well and in so readable a manner justifies the high praise this book has won for nearly a generation.Yergin does a very good job of explaining the pre-World Way I and II strategic issues revolving around the availablity and security of oil supplies, and oil-related postwar political issues. It's a particularly interesting book in light of the recent declassification of British documents from 1973 indicating that the US was considering seizure of mideast oilfields during the 1973 Arab oil embargo. If you want to understand the history and economics of a powerful industry and its impact on global economics and geopolitics, read The Prize."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"This is an accomplished work detailing the story of oil from the mid nineteenth century to the end of the gulf war. I found the story riveting up until the end of the second world war. The book loses it's grip on the significance of oil in history here. The focus shifts to oil prices, markets and many far too broad issues for a reader to easily ingest and understand. I found the details of the Middle East conflicts muddled and lacking a clear insight. The grasp on history slips into uncertainty. Possibily not all information is available to the author due to national security however he omits to say if this is so and the picture can be confusing. By contrast the first half or so of the book has a clear grasp of the story being told. Significant individuals are singled out and the narrative proceeds with a natural development of human proportions. The forces at work are clearly expressed and conveyed. Some flashes of this story telling ability appear later in the book but as the story goes global and more up-to-date the sureness of touch is lost. The reader really needs to want to read about oil price fluctuation in order to enjoy this latter part of the book."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"Yergin's grasp of the broad view of the history of oil and its context in world history is amazing.

Ex- President Bush is heavily documented in his actions with those of the Middle Est in his attempts at acquiring a chunk of the oil industry. It highlights South America's Venezuela and its failing oil fields. It shows the world's efforts at unity for one major purpose. It defines OPEC and ARAMCO as they need to be understood.

I read it during a flight to DC and several people commented to me on the plane and in the airports that it was a great book. This story is really a story of the twentieth century. It is the story of the rise of the Oil industry. What a mess! What a collection of crooks, crony capitalists, get-rich schemers, and arrogant imperialists! I loved it! Not that I want to be like any of these guys. But it was really engrossing to read. The author really brought the characters alive, and I think he didn't really damn them or worship them. He just told us what happened in a lively and very detailed way. The most interesting part for me was the way Oil was at the heart of most of the geo-political issues in all of modern history. I always knew that oil was part of the equation in historical issues, but to have the whole story revolve around it gave new appreciation for its impact on world societies. The treatments of the World Wars were my favorite parts. But the whole book just gave me a new prospective."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"I highly recommend this book to all.

I read the first edition in the 1990's and it is no less timely now than it was then. The new epilogue is succinct and Dan's command of the English language is remarkable with unique wording and phrases that will be used in many students papers for decades to come. Reading the new one was like visiting an old friend. I often see him on the business channels on TV as he is recognized as a worldwide expert on oil. This is a treatise on world history from the perspective of oil by a truly brilliant observer. Barry Reinhard"},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"The recent and tumultuous situation with petroleum pricing, coupled with the obviously baleful effects on the environment of hydrocarbon fuels, combined with rising demands, diminishing supplies, economic turmoil in the world economy and sourcing from the ever-unstable Middle East prompted me to re-read Daniel Yergin's masterpiece, \\"The Prize\\".While everyone has an opinion on petroleum pricing and usage, ranging from simple-minded conspiracy theories to empirical invocations of \\"market economies\\", no one outside \\"the business\\" can legitimately lay claim to having an informed opinion on the topic without having carefully read this book.As is often the case in history, there is an annoyingly repetitious flavor to the story. Fluctuations in petroleum supply/demand ratios, wildly variable pricing, toxic waste accumulation, political machinations, corporate manipulation, Cassandra-like warnings of the dire implications of reliance on hydrocarbon-based energy, attempts to formulate national and international strategies...its all been stated, argued and ignored since the 1930s. As US Interior Secretary Harold Ickes caustically remarked during the War, \\"It is impossible to carry the American people along with you on a program of caution to forestall a threatening position.\\" Yergin noted that, \\"Prevention, whether it be an ounce or a pound was bad politics...\\" Of course, the same holds true now, as then.The insights into the \\"culture\\" of the oil magnates as well as those of the governments who sometimes worked with them (whilst simultaneously indicting them for \\"collusion\\", as did the US Justice Department); the motives of the Middle Eastern oil producers; the founding of OPEC (largely instigated by a Venezualan with Spartan tastes combined with ecological sympathies) and the re-appearance of the same confusion and mixed motives by virtually the same cast of players who currently occupy the stage are all brilliantly detailed in this book.As for the writing, Yergin writes in an engaging and interesting style. Of course, there are some tedious sections in this very long book, but it certainly holds the interest of the motivated, non-technical reader.In summary, this book, while written almost twenty years ago, remains important and timely at the close of the second decade of the 21st century. It is necessary background for understanding the current state of the world economy."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"Daniel Yergin's well-researched and sourced book provides the oil-based context for much of what happened, happens, and will happen in politics and war.

Daniel Yergin has detailed, in broad strokes, the entire history of the Oil Industry from the first discovery in Titusville, PA to the invasion of Iraq.What makes this book good is its easy and flowing storyteller style in detailing very complex political and socio-economic world affairs. What makes it a great book and a bestseller is the epic nature the book takes on. The subtitle 'Epic Quest,\\" sounds a lot like an editorial decision to sell books, but it is quite accurately descriptive of the book's evocative power. One really gets a sense of global struggle, and Yergin's focus on the stories of individual people gives the book a very intimate feel to it. Hense 'Epic Quest.' Sounds silly, but read the book and you'll understand."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"Although the western world's dependence on fossil fuels requires us to deal with some of the world's most odious regimes because of our massive needs, we will be importing massive amount of oil for the foreseeable future. While there are alternative energy sources that show some promise, it will clearly take decades to develop them and the investment of many billions of dollars. So, we are left drilling deep in the earth so that we can extract the \\"black gold\\" that our industrialized societies run on. Unfortunately, some of the most massive oil reserves are located in the most politically volatile areas on earth and are controlled by autocratic regimes with populations that resent our presence and involvement in the region. How did we end up where we are today? This is the question that Daniel Yergen answers in his long, epic history of oil. He is a gifted writer and beginning with early oil discoveries in America and the growth of Standard Oil, John D. Rockefeller's colossal corporation, he adroitly sketched the businessmen, bureaucrats and diplomats that forged the oil business. He then artfully describes the discovery and race to develop the world's largest oil deposit in the Middle East, the vital importance of oil reserves to the warring powers during World War II, the emergence of OPEC and the current state of energy strategy. Yergin has a deep background in the energy business as well as a firm grasp of the complex strategic issues that face is and \\"The Prize\\" is a sweeping panoramic history of one of the world's most important commodities.

Its reach is unequalled. From the beginning of the industry in western Pennsylvania to oil's modern strategic importance, the book is simply awesome in scope. Yergin does an excellent job of telling the story and backing it with plenty of source information and footnotes.After reading this book, I see World War II in a completely new way. Oil as a strategic resource has changed the face of warfare. I always knew this, but couldn't tell you exactly why. After reading this book, I can tell you why. I loved the history of the Germans' and Japanese efforts at synthetic fuels productions. This book also contains a good chapter about the Iran-Iraq war, a topic that has been relatively difficult to find good information on.If I was forced to make one critical comment about this book I would say that I would have liked to have had one chapter describing some of the basic technical processes involved in refining oil. But with such a long and informative book, I suppose everybody could list &quot;one&quot; more chapter that they would have liked.Read this book."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"If you want to learn about the impact that oil has had and still has on the world--read this outstanding book.

After all, he heads Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a think tank that sells \\"guidances\\" for $5000 per copy. Unlike the audience for those reports, this book has a feel that appeals to anyone who wants to read narrative history. He mixes several elements in his book. First, there are a series of personality profiles around famous oil personalities. They go back as far as Standard Oil and the Rockefeller family. There are also some interesting dramas -- oil rushes in Western Pennsyvania, the Six Days War in the Middle East, the last days of World War II.This book changed my understanding of what oil means to warfare. Oil is speed. That makes the difference in the oceans and in the deserts. Winston Churchill saw this in the years prior to WWI when he sought funding for more naval research into oil powered ships. That paid off for England handsomely in both WWI and II. Rommel and the German effort may have failed for the absence of oil. Yergin describes the efforts of the Germans to develop synthetic oil and the inability to continue their blitzkrieg strategy without oil. Same thing for the Japanese. One of my favorite parts was reading about the efforts by the Japanese to make oil from tree extracts in lieu of petroleum.This book won the Pulitzer Prize in the early 90s. It stops just prior to the First Gulf War. The photographs inserted between the text add a lot to the book as well."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"I read this meticulously-researched book many years ago, and it changed the way I see the world.

This book looks at history from that perspective from 1800's to the Gulf War.But that isn't why I rated this book a 5 and that isn't why I used this book as the inspiration for my senior thesis in college. This book has enough information in here to teach an oil executive more about his field, and it tells the story on a level that the average curious mind could digest it all.Why I love this book? Because this is the book you give to a cousin or a friend who always had the ability to learn a lot about the world but never did because he doesn't see how it is relevant to his life. This book is the one that wakes someone up. If you can get past the formidable size, you get to a great great story. A great story that, as I said to an 11-year old who I actually sucked into the stories in this book, &quot;a great story and it actually happened - it's a true story!&quot;That's the most amazing part of this book.

The book shows how oil influenced world events like World War II and the Suez Canal crisis. In addition, it shows how the major oil companies like Shell, Exxon, and Texaco came about and how they negotiated (and most of the time abused) the host countries. The best part about the book was its global perspective as it covers all of the major oil producing areas from South America to Azerbaijan to the the Far East, and of course the Middle East.

I know I did."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"Since I first laid my hands on this book a few years ago I have found myself going back to it over and over again. It is extremely well researched, packed with an incredible amount of information (the notes and bibliography sections are among the most ridiculous I have ever seen), touching subjects as varied as the two world wars, the shaping of the Middle East and the impact of the automobile on American society. At the same time it is easy to read and a wealth of great anecdotes make it more entertaining than a lot of novels. It covers almost 150 years of world history from the specific angle of the oil industry. Rather than being one-sided it adds an additional perspective to periods and events that is hard to find in such a refined form elsewhere.This is certainly one of the best books I have read in the past years.

Regarding Shell's efforts to involve Americans and American investors during its operations in the USA(while the country was still a net exporter of oil): \\"It is, of course, always galling...in any country to see an enterprise doing well without the local people being interested...It is contrary to human nature, however well a concern like that may be directed...not to anticipate there will be a kind of jealous feeling against such a company\\". While the oil industry was all OK with the sentiment of local control of oil operations (refining, marketing, selling, etc.) they (and the author, Daniel Yergin) have definitely not been disposed towards it in their operations in non-industrialized countries. How is local competition even to start up in producing countries if all the land containing oil fields is completely bought up by multinationals on ridiculously long 70,80,90,100 year leases? The results in Mexico, Iran and elsewhere speak for themselves.I found that kind of thinking symptomatic in this book - which is highly informative and interesting, but clearly obviously biased in favour of the oil industry, ignoring or glossing over some of the abuses committed in its favour. When speaking of Iranian resentment towards the British in the 40s, for example, Yergin dismisses it as conveniently finding a \\"foreign scapegoat when so much was wrong at home\\" completely absolving the Brits of any reponsibility for their actions (including the carpet bombing of Persian villages in the early 20th century) in a country they had so much power over.Read this book, but with the ability to read between the lines."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"This is a thoroughly engrossing, still-relevant treatment of the history of oil and its effect on history. Many of the events recounted are familiar from high school and college history courses, but in the typical linear-timeline of such studies, the interconnectedness of oil toward other major historical events is often lost. This book puts all that in perspective, neatly tieing other technological and political events across 150 years to the rise of oil and its use in the internal combustion engine.

This account completely modified my understanding of world history for the past 150 years. Oil today is central to the world economy, but yet it seems we are remaking many of the mistakes of the past. The middle east has been and continues to be a remarkable but challenging place to deal with. Not a day goes by that I don't see some important news story regarding oil or the middle east. Reading this book has helped me to more clearly understand why many of these important world events are happening.

I hope the author updates the book every 25 years or so because once again this industry is going through another cycle. Also a lot of previously classified documents are becoming publicly available such as in 2004 the British released papers stating Nixon was willing to occupy OPEC oil fields with military force because of their embargo.But the book does have faults mainly with Daniel Yergin put way to many of his opinions in this book (maybe that is inevitable). For example he says in the Epiloge that Iraqi soldiers commits certain crimes while in Kuwait, that information is know known to be completly wrong, so i hope the next printing of this book updates that. Also he says that Saddam Hussein had ambitions for Arab-conquest, maybe he is right but i feel his opinion is wrong...it would have been nice if he said that was his opinion, and another possible ansewer excists for him trieng to take over Iran and Kuwait.Also this book does a great job of telling the story of Saudi, Iran, and Venezuala. But much is desired with Iraq, Libya, the North Sea, and Nigeria.Maybe i am demanding too much from this book, it is already a 800+ page book.I found the best way to complete it is: read one chapter a day, so you will finish it in about a month....it takes disipline but it worked for me.This is a must read, everyone in high school or college should be required to read this book."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"This book is biased on the side of the oil companies and USA, UK foreign policy while depicting leaders in the middle east as clowns.

Although Yergin recounts in painful detail the impressive sweep of oil over 150 years, it reads like the \\"one damn thing after another\\" version of history. There is no attempt at synthesis. Yergin introduces characters with a paragraph of irrelevant detail \\"he had an impressive moustache\\", reserving equal detail for someone as important as Rockefeller and as trivial as some guy who drilled a handful of wells in Texas. This book may be a great reference, but the lack of fitting facts into an overarching hierarchy makes it almost unreadable. Interesting chapters on the early history of oil, oil during the world wars, and oil crises. Badly needed some context for the facts and figures: a graph of the production history of oil regions and a graph of oil prices vs time would have eliminated endless, painful, contextless statements like \\" production in Iran went from xx to xx bpd.\\" do we care? was that production change important?

But I found myself routinely cursing at the author's hypocrisy. When the United States, England, France, or any other empire invades some country to make certain that American or European oil transnationals have access to that nation's oil, the actions of these empires are seen as rational, normal, expected. These empires are seen as acting in their national interest. Yet if any country attempts to keep them out, they are seen as \\"greedy,\\" \\"rapacious,\\" and their leaders are seen as silly or foolish or dangerous (many of Yergin's characterizations of third world leaders are shockingly racist). When the US wants to use any and all means to gain access to oil from the Middle East, well, that's \\"defending\\" national interest. When the Soviet Union wanted to do the same, well, that was \\"Soviet aggression.\\" (And I'm not suggesting that Soviet aggression would have been any better than US aggression, but merely pointing out the obvious double standard.) He consistently trivializes those of the third world who oppose the despoliation of their land and the theft of their resources. He also consistently trivializes or ignores the massive environmental destruction and social dislocation caused by the oil economy. In search of an informative history, I found a propaganda tract for the oil industry and for the nations that provide the muscle for them."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"Propaganda, no matter how couched in research is still propaganda. The author seems gung-ho on the archievements of \\"the industry\\" and its dominant actors and never expresses dismay at the wanton destruction it has and continues to perpetuate. Right from the premise, when he had reported on the greed which the inceptions of the industry created/fed upon, I found myself wishing he would take a moral stance and say something against what could only be disastrous for all in the long-term. But, alas, nothing there, and yet, robber barons like Rockefeller were touted to no end.

Clearly you need to be ready to devote the time to do justice to a near-800 page book of fairly dense text. However if you are interested in certain aspects of the story of oil then you could just read the sections of greatest appeal - for me it was Part 3, War and Strategy, focusing on the vital importance of oil supplies in WW2. Some sections on the various oil companies could probably be skimmed without great loss too, if you are short of time. And if you just want the stories of the colorful Texas oil barons then Bryan Burrough's The Big Rich is the best option. But I both enjoyed and learned much from this epic tale very well told. Yergin writes clearly and doesn't waste words - the book is long simply because oil's story is so wide-ranging and important.

It is meticulously detailed and highly entertaining and enlightening.Before reading this book, I was under the typical California liberal impression of the oil industry: that we went into foreign countries, took the oil rights and screwed everyone out of everything for the almighty dollar. What I learned surprised me: everything oil companies did was through painstakingly negotiated contracts with the government, which was supposed to last for decades but, due to foreign greed, forced new contracts with steeper terms every couple of years. In fact, most if not all of the oil would have remained rotting in the ground without these companies going in and developing them, for not only their profit but for the third world country's as well.I want to add that while Mexico and Iran fully nationalized their industries despite clear legal obligations to the contrary, pretty much every other country refused to honor their commitments.

Don't understand why Kindle Edition costs more than the paperback edition. Perhaps a disdain for preserving natural resources?"},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"The first 200 pages of \\"The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power\\" are compelling and fascinating because they are about the compelling and fascinating characters who created the modern oil industry. There is, of course, John D. Rockefeller whose organizational genius permitted the rise of Standard Oil, the antecedent of today's Exxon-Mobil. Then there is the hopelessly disorganized but very lucky British merchant Marcus Samuel who founded Shell, and the meticulous and disciplined Dutchman Henri Deterding who would turn it into Standard Oil's global competitor.Oil's early pioneers sustain the early narrative but as we progress further into Daniel Yergin's 788-page tome the author's fundamental weaknesses as a writer are all too apparent. First there is his clunky writing style, so clunky in fact that the writing doesn't feel edited. Second Mr. Yergin chooses to talk about everything and about everyone, and so this book is more encyclopedia than narrative -- and it's very discomforting to read an encyclopedia structured as a chronological narrative. Third is how Mr. Yergin insists on the equal importance of his many characters -- in his estimate there is not a handful of founders of the modern oil industry but dozens. Fourth there is Mr. Yergin's insistence on the primacy of oil, leading him to make simplistic arguments such as that World War II was fundamentally battles over oil (it's very true that war is about resources and logistics but oil is only one resource).A lot of these problems stem from the fact that Mr. Yergin really doesn't know that much about oil (Yes, I know it says on the back that he's an \\"authority on world affairs and the oil business\\"!). He ignores the environmental problems with oil, and doesn't at all mention the excellent and disturbing point that the documentary \\"Eleventh Hour\\" makes so explicit: that oil is captured sunshine, and by living off oil today we are essentially living off the past and mortgaging the future. \\"The Prize\\" has no original research, and feels like a hastily put together of newspaper clippings and books. The book's final 200 pages especially feel this way, and are just unreadable. What is the point of regurgitating the events leading up to the Suez Canal Crisis, the Iran-Iraq War, and other late twentieth-century crises that any reader who chooses to pick up a 788-page book on oil would already know about?Mr. Yergin would have served his readers better to focus on the oil industry's early pioneers, and to trace how their corporate descendants have fared in the modern world. His tracing of the founding of OPEC to the Texas Railroad Commission's containment of the Texas oil glut in the 1920s is very interesting and informative. And if Mr. Yergin had more of these examples connecting the past to the present \\"The Prize\\" would be an informative narrative instead of the overwrought encyclopedia it is now."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"I am glad for a book of this stature.

The author really brought the characters alive, and I think he didn't really damn them or worship them. He just told us what happened in a lively and very detailed way. The most interesting part for me was the way Oil was at the heart of most of the geo-political issues in all of modern history.

He succeeded in covering about a century and a half of discoveries and developments providing accurate information on historical events, national and international politics and key players, achieving to write a reference book on the subject.Certainly no author whomsoever can be impartial - and throughout the reading one may well notice that Mr. Yergin is writing from a North-American standpoint. However, partiality is subtile and does not jeopardise his work's strict conformity to facts. Actually, it is only now and then - as in the case of Mossadegh and Nasser - that one might notice that the author could have stepped forward into a less contained critique of Washington's inertia and refrained from a more stark appraisal of Western European role.Nonetheless, Mr. Yergin is probably the best historian of the subject, faithful to facts, besides being able to imprint a light and entertaining style into his narrative."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"Yergin's opus is a compelling read but the plot falls apart in the paperback version - literally!

Khuristan provided 90% of Iran's oil. Oil has become another commodity. The myth that oil prices have no limit was quickly dispelled in the early 1980s. Oil does have a price ceiling. If the oil price rose too high the world market will abandoned it, never to return, as it invests in alternate energy infrastructure.Prices in the futures market are influenced by how much the oil commodities cost in the spot market. Traders on the London and New York exchanges influence price through buying and selling oil contracts. Supply and demand are the important factors determining price. The first oil shock kicked as the Shah was deposed of power and Ayatollah Khomeini rise too power disrupted oil production.The second oil shock, the Iraqi-Iran war was characterized by immobilized tankers unable to leave Iraqi ports; 8 mil/bar a day decreased to 1 mil/bar; panicked spot buying in Japan and Europe; US exceeding oil production of Non-Opec locals over OPEC importers; increased US dependence on Alaska, Mexico, and Canadian oil; development of the North Seas Oil production.Carter lobbied congressional proposals for production of synthetic oil from shale and coal. Synthetic fuel costs $18 billion for 500,000 gallons and the cost and its survivability questionable. Iran withstood the first hard attacks by Iraq. Political instability was exploited by the Media and panic set in.However, the world's total oil production was not significantly affected by either of the two shocks. Saudi began escalating its level of daily production and in coordination with other countries exceeded demand. The total amount of daily oil production was about 31 million barrels a day. This was too much supply for the demand. OPEC dropped daily production attempting to soften against a crash in price. OPEC decided price and supply and the oil companies brokered the oil out to world consumers. OPEC wanted a price of $18 a barrel. The price per barrel ranged from $10 to $35 a barrel, a huge increase from the $1.90 a barrel before the shocks. OPEC countries received sudden surge of financial available from banks. The buying spree seemed to have no bounds.Saudi played the role of the swing producer increasing oil inventory supplies offsetting Iran oil production drops. Saudi became the Arab political leader and often competed head to head with Iran.Additional shocks included the Arab-Israeli war of 1973, three-mile island nuclear disaster, and Nixon policy of price fixing. Availability of oil was still plentiful and cheap.What caused the Oil price to rise? Oil traders searched the open market for oil purchases. Japan received 20% of its oil from Iran. BP received 40% of its contracts from Iran. The buyers bought oil now and sold it latter when it was expensive. Oil companies experienced record level profits. The public outrage direct charges at the big oil companies that they caused the shortage. Oil companies defended their position that huge price fluctuations in oil inventories were cyclic and profits were needed to offset drops in price. The oil reserve had billions of gallons of oil in inventory. The oil inventory served to cushion against sudden surges in demand caused from an especially cold winter. The oil companies bought the oil cheap and stored the oil in tankers and oil storage containers and remained fat on the oil. The game increased in danger as the price drove upward and warnings that increasing price could suddenly turn because supply was too large. Political and social instability increased the fear and buyers pushed up price.Federal Monetary policies were rigidly tight, interest rates rose to 21 percent, and recession set in, unemployment rose sharply, and production dropped. As production drop so did the demand for oil. US car increased fuel efficiency 31 percent with cars achieving 27.5 mpg. Japan reached 51 percent fuel efficiency and consumption decreased. The price is a simple function of supply and demand. If supply exceeds demand than the price will drop. The price of oil dropped suddenly and hard.The rich began adding oil commodities to their portfolios. Financial portfolio greedy for big profits increased institutional investing in oil commodities and oil stocks and argued that the investment made sense as a hedge against inflation. Oil profits drove up stock prices. The stock market increased in valuation as a direct result of oil company valuation increases. Gold prices rose as dollars were exchanged for Gold. Gold prices may have drove up oil prices. The drop in oil prices hammer oil profits and investors hung too long and kept their money in oil, for the long haul. New oil exploration and discovery could not displace the king of oil and the seven sisters pushed Saudi center stage exploiting the vast oil reserves of the Middle East. The crisis in the Middle East was bound to repeat history again in another round of huge profits for the oil companies"},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"The book itself often reads more like a business reporter in a local paper reporting rather then a historical study which I was looking for.

Even beyond the gulf war however, Yergen shows why and how we entered into the Faustian bargain of supporting the opressive and undemocratic regimes of the gulf in exchange for cheap oil.As Yergen makes clear, because of our dependance on oil of the mideast and it is sometimes an impossible balancing act to both supporting our traditional ally Israel while at the same time placating oil producing states in which anti-semitism is both ingrained in the political culture and used as a way to deflect political dissent. This tension exploded in 1973 when the arab states embargoed our oil for our support of Israel in the Yom Kippur war.If I were to falt Yergen for anything it would be that he never explains the tensions which run against the oil pressures. For example, he never articulates really any reason for why we supported Israel through the cold war, he just says that this support came under pressure from our need to have cheap oil.More than anything, Yergen brings truth to the recent assertion that to be patriotic you shouldn't fly an american flag from your SUV, rather you shouldn't drive an SUV."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"It is an masterpiece on the history of the oil industry, giving a complete account of the political factors that have affected the industry since its birth in Titusville, PA."}]`),R={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:S,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},O={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],P={key:0},V={key:1};function H(n,e,s,c,r,a){const m=f("PoemCard");return t(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",O,[(t(!0),i(y,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(h,w)=>(t(),p(m,{key:w,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(t(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),i("span",V,"Loading...")):(t(),i("span",P,"See more"))],8,x)):v("",!0)])}const q=u(R,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-1a807784"]]),W=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/31.md","filePath":"library/31.md"}'),C={name:"library/31.md"},j=Object.assign(C,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),i("div",null,[b(q)]))}});export{W as __pageData,j as default};
