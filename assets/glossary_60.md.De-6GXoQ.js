But I perservered because the subject matter interested me, and I was amply rewarded. It is a novel which makes you count your every day blessings, and it is a novel which will make you look at things you take for granted in an entirely new light.As the novel progresses you do come to identify with the characters and their trials and tribulations. Some of the issues it addresses are shocking. It is also very sad. But it is a well crafted novel.I feel that it loses some of its momentum in the final chapters after their &quot;escape&quot; from the Congo, but this is only a small criticism, and the novel is pulled together nicely by the last chapter.This is a difficult novel to read at several levels, but this is also a very good novel, and well worth your time."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Truly one of the best books I have read in a very long time. Ms. Kingsolver is more than adept at putting feelings into words, and matching words with feelings. The story is about a family living in the Congo with an extraordinarily insane father whose sole reason for being there is to change the Congolese into Christians. With that goal in mind, he is oblivious to the slow, torturous ordeals of his family, and remains oblivious to the steady destruction of their lives. The trials faced by mother and daughters are so uniquely described you will find yourself absorbed. I took this book with me everywhere I went, I could not be without it. It's a beautifully woven tail. I could smell Africa and the Congo, and I have never been there. I could taste the manioc, and I don't even know what it is. Mostly I could feel the hearts of the family in peril. This book is worth much more than five stars, and you should rush right out and buy it today."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. Not only was it a moving story but I feel like I have visited Africa at it's best and worst. I also feel as though I have known this family personally. I could not put it down."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I was truly meant to read this book. A woman I didn't even know pulled me by the arm in the store and told me if I enjoy reading Oprah book selections I just have to read this one. I stopped, picked it up, and bought it without even reading the cover. I thought, if this woman felt this strong about it then it couldn't be too bad. Well I have no idea who that woman was but \\"THANK YOU!\\" I found this book very hard to put down. I didn't have the feeling of being preached to like other reviewers felt nor did I even notice that there was a so-called political agenda. I felt pulled into the middle of this family and at times cheered for them and cried with them. It brought the Congo to me, and I am most certain that I would never in my life sought to learn about the Congo. The part where the ants invaded the village is the real turning point for me. That is what the story was all about in my opinion. I had to think about my child hood.... would my mother choose me or a younger sibling and then I had to think about my children...would I choose one over the other. I can't get the picture out of my mind. I had such a connection with each daughter and the mother. I found a little of myself in each of them. Read this book and read the emotion!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"An outstanding story with an absolutely truthful historical reflection of U.S involvement in The Congo in the 50's and 60's. The chapters written in Adah's voice are exquisitely done."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The novel raises important questions about the role of missionaries and the clash of cultures that results when progress, fueled by religious fanaticism, collides with poverty and thousands of years of survival on instinct. The daughters' characters breathe. The visual imagery is stunning. Read this."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I enjoyed this book more for the language than the story. Not to say the tale wasn't interesting, and for me, knowing little of the Congolese history, it was gripping. But other things were even more interesting. I was really fascinated by Kingsolver's picture of what it was like inside Adah's head (daeh's hada!)and her unique use of language. The different voices maintained my interest in the story throughout, and unlike many others who've reviewed the book I found the characters quite realistic and convincing. The one character I felt was less than sufficiently deep was the mother. I wanted to sympathize with her, but found her too insipid to get involved with. Nevertheless, a jolly good read, and educational too. (Political freaks take note, this is a novel, not a textbook. Literary freaks take note, this is a popular novel, not a pivotal literary masterpiece.)"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"In &quot;The Poisonwood Bible,&quot; Kingsolver's use of separate and distinct personae as the tellers of the tale is very effective, particularly Adah's wonderfully slanted inner takes on the realities and her many palindromes. As is always the case with Kingsolver, the mothers, daughters, sis-siblings, and assorted other femmes are wonderfully portrayed as are their interactions; the men are flat, foolish, and primarily incidental. Otherwise, I thought Kingsolver's transitions between her narrative fictional elements and the historical facts she researched and/or gleaned from other sources were a bit forced. It's an interesting time and take, but for me her shorter tales are better. And, as for &quot;feeling&quot; the reality of post-colonial Africa, I think Hemingway's &quot;True at First Light&quot; is vastly superior to this effort by Ms. Kingsolver."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"&quot;There are Christians, and then there are Christians.&quot;This line from the book is one of my favorites. The great missionaries from America go to the Congo to save the savages from the pits of damnation. In the process, it is the saviors who need the saving. This is one of the best pieces of fiction that has crossed my path in years. The average nonthinking conservative will have trouble with this book. There are many instances of political irresponsibility on the part of the USA, and sins far more inhumane. The characters are brilliant, led by the luny Nathan Price, who I pictured as Robert Duvall in the movie &quot;The apostle&quot;. Please read this book and tell others to read it as well. In the world of popular fiction, which is usually only barely passable, this effort shines like the July sun!!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"a combination of recent history and facinating story. a hard book to understand completely but i think her best so far."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"barbara kingsolver's previous works were thought provoking and good reads but the Poisonwood Bible outshines them all. What isn't in this novel: politics, philosophy, religion, racism, family dynamics, travel, adventure and drama. well structured and well written, the characters and their observations of the world and its interconnectedness will leave you thinking about your own place in the universe for a long time after you finish this book. if i had a top ten list this would be on it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I love Barbara Kingsolver's work. I have read everything she's got available. The Poisonwood Bible has now become my favorite. As I read it, I knew this was an important book. Her characters became friends, their travels and troubles became my own. I truly felt like I had experienced the rough lives that were, and still are lived in the Congo. I worry that the next novel I read, no matter how good, can not possibly measure up to this one. Many many thanks to Barbara Kingsolver for another wonderful novel."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I first discovered Barabra Kingsolver when hearing her interviewed over a local PBS radio station. Her musical, Appalachian manner of speaking lead me to buying three of her previous books; Bean Trees, Pigs in Heaven, and High Tide in Tucson. However, reading The Poisonwood Bible was a experience unlike any of the others. Telling her story in the voice of several different characters gave me the fun of enjoying daughter Rachel's naive simplicity as well as the serious contemplation of witnessing Congo history through the mouth's of twins, Leah and Adah. The Reverend and Mrs. Price are memorable works of art. This novel met all my criteria for a great read; compelling, suspenseful, emotionally moving, educational, entertaining and generated the feeling of friendship with the novel's wonderful characters. I've encouraged at least ten good friends to read this book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is the first time I have felt compelled to write a review - I want everyone to know what a brilliant and well-crafted book this is. Kingsolver has managed to capture several distinct voices and stories and weave them into a book that grips both heart and mind. I have enjoyed all her work, but to my thinking, this is by far her best and most complicated. My only critique is that, toward the end, she might have edited a little more stringently: wonderful sayings and metaphors lose their magic after being used a few times too many, and Rachel's malaprops wear a little thin over time. While the story goes on longer than I might have considered necessary, every chapter was worth diving into, and I was truly sad when I reached the last page. I closed the book feeling I had learned a great deal, both about Zaire's political history, and the history of a complex and compelling family."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book will tear at your heart. It will make you question beliefs and ideals. It has wonderful turns of phrase and thoughts out of the ordinary. I have been completely caught up in it and will re-read it when it is returned to me from the many friends to whom I will loan it; I NEVER read anything twice, so you can imagine how much I am moved by this book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Without belaboring the points already made by others (the last section is a disappointment), I am surprised that so many critical readers object to Leah's political viewpoint. She is fanatic and a zealot, but is this unreasonable as the child most attached to and devoted to her father? It seems to me his unreasoning zeal is mirrored, not exactly, but recognizably, in Leah's ardent politics. I cannot hear Leah's voice as &quot;the truth&quot; or as Ms. Kingsolver's voice, but as the voice of a unique person, raised to be one kind of a believer, whose life converts her into another type of believer! Also, I was amused and gratified by Rachel from beginning to end. To me, she remained true to her original self. Perhaps many &quot;literary types&quot; who read and write reviews do not recognize her, but the world (our world!) is populated in great part by those practical, unquestioning people. And I love them! This is a great book, full of thinking and arguing to last many a spirited conversation!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is Barbara Kingsolving's best book to date; I found it to be one of the best books I have read this year. I strongly disagree with the reviewer who found Rachel's malaprop-laden sections &quot;tedious and annoying. I thought they provided comic relief from the telling of the tragic and bloody history of the Congo."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver tells a dramatic tale of a family deep in the Congo who try to not only understand the people they have come to &quot;save&quot;, but each other."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This novel took my breath away. The writing is exquisite, the characters are alive and real. But most of all, this book offers an insightful view into the inter-relatedness of all life on earth... how even the smallest action has a reaction. While telling a compelling story, it also urges us to move through the world with greater sensitivity and understanding about the role we play and the impact we have. This book has it all -- beautiful writing, great story, insight into the human condition, and a thought-provoking view our our relationship to the earth, the world and to each other. This is a &quot;must read&quot; book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver truly captures real human emotions in this book. This story of a naive American family traveling to Africa to teach Christianity desribes how adversity and tragedy affects the individual family members. I particularly liked the style the author uses in telling the story from each of the daughters' perspectives. It becomes very easy to know who is speaking in each chapter. The mother's voice of the present sums up the events of the preceding chapters which rotate through each daughter's voice of the past. I have talked with other readers that think the book is too depressing. But, I see it from an opposite point of view. I feel the story reveals how the human spirit may endure, and possibly triumph, after physical and emotional devastation. Barbara Kingsolver conveys every woman in the family's heartfelt emotions. I felt that each of these triumphant women were heroes."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is an amazing book, one that everybody should read, for the following reasons.The prose is sublime - Kingsolver has this incredible natural feel for words. Her descriptions are mind-blowingly evocative, but it doesn't end there: even her more narrative passages are casually scattered with poetic gems.The &quot;shifting POVs&quot; style is challenging and interesting - each character has a distinctive personality, a soon recognizable individual style of writing. I've read some reviews complaining that Nathan Price is never given a chance to speak, but I think this is intentional and works in favour of the book. His voice is not denied, as it is he who has the say in the family - and the fact we never hear any &quot;soliloquies&quot; from him adds to his imposing presence in the book, leaving you to make up your own mind.I've read criticisms of the Rachel character too - I too wished she could have matured more, but also think that the author's decision to let her keep her self-absorbed and jingoistic POV was deliberate, to question what kind of maturity she really achieved and to suggest many more adults take her view - which is absolutely true.Then you have the politics. Ah, the &quot;politics&quot; - a dirty word in our apathetic culture. Leah does get a bit didactic towards the end, but if you think of Kingsolver's &quot;Leah&quot; writing style as being deliberate (reflecting Leah's personality instead of an all-knowing objective narrator), than think of it this way. Leah can't help but think about the implications of what she knows - and neither should we. This book made me feeling ashamed of myself, feeling massively angry and helpless about the West, and feeling a huge need to learn more. Both angry and scared at how easily most of us (including me) tend to brush &quot;political, depressing&quot; things under the carpet.The book is uneven - springing erratically through time, through descriptive and narrative passages, through a thousand myriad and even self-contradicting conclusions about life that characters such as Leah and Adah make. Some sections are almost like a stream of consciousness, and the general uneven impression seems suitable for the book's exploration of life, which is essentially uneven and contradictory. The last section of the book speeds up time, something that spoilt the otherwise great &quot;Captain Corelli's Mandolin&quot; but which is pulled off with much more skill and meaning in &quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot;.In the end, this book reminds me of nothing so much as a poem. It flashes with moments of sheer brilliant meaning, as well as with complex introspection and confusion - any flaws are just totally outweighed. Its unconventionally uneven structure suits its message perfectly (&quot;Evol's dog! Dog ho!&quot;). And, like the best poems, it crystallises knowledge, understanding, emotion in such perfect words that even after turning the last page, you still feel the force of the book pushing on - hopefully moving me a little bit closer to doing the right thing."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"So good I hardly know where to begin. OK page one. Here you discover you are in the presence of truly delicious prose. Kingsolver is always just right on- tough, poetic, ironic, angry - whatever it is, she finds the perfect way to say it. That's what it's like from the first page to the last. I did not want to stop reading it. Also this is a great big book about great big themes, about Europeans and what they have done (and are doing) to Africa, the inherent dignity of the people of the Congo, the rapacious greed of the West, the way we - yeah it's us- never question the assumption of our &quot;superiority&quot;. Kingsolver does, and wickedly skewers the overbearing conceits- religious, political, or social that Europeans have always brought to Africa. All of this is presented in the context of a family saga that would by itself make this a great book- wonderful characters, perfectly drawn, impossible to forget. Move this one right up to the top of your list."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This novel will tiptoe gracefully into your mind, plant seeds of initial interest, and then knock you flat onto the ground, gasping for more. I finished it with tears streaming down my face from the simple emotion of it all, and the sadness I felt in coming to the end. I might add that I am not generally an overly emotional person. Although the first chapters start a little slow, I was hooked in no time, and felt like I knew the characters as real people. For younger readers, like myself, at 22, they will be simultaneously appalled and interested in the US's historical involvement in the heart of Africa. Another American tragedy rewritten in history for the next generation. To make a long story short, go read this book now."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"How interesting that when a critic disagrees with an author's point of view, the author is \\"wearing her politics on her sleeve,\\" and this is considered to be a \\"weakness\\" of the book! Perhaps because I agree with the political ideas of Barbara Kingsolver, I found the book to be insightful, fascinating, and a thoroughly great read."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I bought this book because I needed something that would last through 2 six hour flights and it fit that length. I expected that the book would be dry and boring and to my pleasant surprise it turned out to be one of the most engaging novels that I have ever read. An absolute page turner from the first page to the end. The characters were well developed to a point where I actually began to feel their emotions. A Southern Baptist Minister moves his family to the Congo with the hopes of bringing Christianity to Africa. This book illustrates the effects of his mission on himself, his family and the surrounding population."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"For the first 300 pages, this is a great book that thoroughly engages you in another world. While the plot and characters are all well done, the highlight of this book is the author's wonderful depicition of the Congo. Not only does she do a wonderful job of evoking the setting, but she also skillfully interweaves the historical and political background of the region. This will be a welcome discovery for most readers. Unfortunately, my enjoyment of the first two thirds of the book was tempered by the incredibly long resolution. Without spoinling it for new readers, there is a definite point where the primary plot is resolved. The rest of the book felt like one big afterword to me. Yes, I had become invested in the lives of the primary characters, and it was nice to find out what happened to them. However, the tension and drama of the original storyline was gone."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I am working on my third read of The Poisonwood Bible, and still find it to be a wild, intriguing, entertaining and informative ride through the African Congo. During that ride one cannot help but feel intensely BLESSED by the pure abundance we enjoy in our daily lives - abudance that we so often take for granted. (I daily remind myself that access to nutrious food, medical care, transportation, toilet paper, etc. etc. etc. is a BLESSING I cannot have done anything to deserve)Kingsolver offers us this brilliant tale of a doomed, white Southern Baptist family headed by an arrogant, eccentric, and quite sincere evangelist who dedicates his life (and the lives of his family) to bringing the so-called \\"savages\\" of the Congo home to Jesus.It is impossible not to see the Price family as a symbol of European Colonialism, and Nathan Price himself as the &quot;burdened white man&quot; who has convinced himself that his White American Christian &quot;superiority&quot; can only be truly deserved through his single-minded and patronizing attempt to help the &quot;savages&quot; assimilate to &quot;the True Path&quot;.Never mind that the village Nathan foists himself upon has been surviving for centuries without his religion; that his obsession for dunking the village children in the crocodile-laden Kwilu river makes him nothing but evil in the villager's eyes ; or that his family of young women is assimilating far more of the culture of the village natives, than the natives are of Price's religious convictions.In her telling of the Price family's story, the author's amazing arrangement of words paints an unforgettable work of art and her weaving in of scripture and the juxtaposing of American culture and language with African tradition and language creates a rich feast of the spirit you won't soon forget.Kingsolver's decision to tell this story through the eyes and intellects of the Price children was nothing short of genius. As a vehicle, this allowed for deep and intriguing commentary on such sensitive subjects as politics, religion, culture and race with that remarkable combination of navet&eacute; and clarity that children naturally possess.In the end, however, I thought this story was really the coming-of-age story of Orleanna Price, Nathan's obedient wife. It was after all her initial passivity that allowed the story to ever even take place, and I cannot help but wonder if Kingsolver was telling us something about the world, and the ways of conquering men and the women who do not resist them.What does it ultimately take for us to say &quot;enough?&quot;Enough."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Here I am, adding my thoughts to those of currently 713 other people who have already reviewed this book. What can I add that has not already been said? Probably nothing.I will start by saying this is probably the best new book that I have read this year. From the outset I was captivated by the use of multiple voices as the storytellers; the constantly shifting tone and viewpoint fascinated, as did the unique insights each provided. The story, taken as a whole, reads almost like an epic.My sole criticism is that it seems to lose steam towards the end. I felt myself pushing through the last couple of chapters solely to finish them, rather than savor them. However, this is not enough, in my opinion, to take away from the five-star rating."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book is unbelieveably powerful. Kingsolver's description of the Congo is dark and, at the same time, reverential. She really celebrates the cuture and traditions of the Congolese people, highlighting how the struggles for political freeedom take a long time to trickle down into everyday life, if indeed they ever do. I found this to be a novel that spoke to me on a number of levels, from the relationships between the sisters who are the primary narrators, to the problemtatic relationship between the daughters and their extreme Baptist father. The end does drag a little bit, but it is still very powerful and moving. This is a book that I will read again and again."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Having Read &quot;Animal Dreams&quot;, I somehow thought Poisonwood would be the same light hearted, albeit well-written, brain candy. What a terrific surprise! I almost couldn't believe it was written by the same author. Kingsolver captures the heavy equatorial atmosphere of Africa perfectly, and describes the uneasiness of living in a country on the verge of total political breakdown without any dry political ranting. The directions these four characters go in towards the end are surprising, and unique, and written in such a way that you still see the scars from a traumatic childhood. Without giving too much away, some of the issues in the book are resolved a little too cleanly. Some of the resolutions are downright miraculous. But overall, the book was a great read."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"As the Poisonwood Bible unravels its tale there is no mistaking the magnificent genius that is Barbara Kingsolver. Like her other novels Bible gives us strong and clear pictures of people who are striving to find fulfillment, love, and a sense of self. Unlike her other novels this story cuts close to the bone offering a seering portrait of colonial missions and zealous and misguided Americans who's only idea of God is defined by the U.S. culture. Bible not only serves as a wonderful story it shows the complexities of a government in turmoil and the people who fight for peace and understanding. I highly recomend it. A"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"An engaging, beautifully written novel, with as much poetry as prose woven through its subtle tapestry. The best book I've read in the past year. It has a sense of depth and resonance that is only hinted at in Kingsolver's previous fiction, but the same charm we have come to expect from this very talented author. This tale of a family coming apart and together again under extreme conditions is even profound, and one I'm sure I'll come back to down the road. So many images and scenes I'll never forget... When you're finished with this one, if you haven't read her other books, get your hands on &quot;The Bean Trees&quot; and &quot;Animal Dreams.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I would recommend this book to anyone who's interested in an historically accurate, heart wrenching tale of women and their struggle to be whole. What seems a hostile environment at first, slowly reveals itself to be quite friendly but only after extreme sacrifices from the misplaced family. Great book!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I have recently discovered BK and just finished three of her novels. &quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot; is a masterpiece and pulls the reader inexorably into the Belgian Congo of 1959. I was first acquainted with this country's struggles through reading the fascinating work, &quot;The Nun's Story&quot; many years ago. Even though &quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot; is fiction, the political upheaval and gross injustices perpetrated through foreign imperialism and religious naivete were very real and acquired greater urgency through the voices of the Price family. I could not put this book down and savored every page. Thank you, thank you, thank you for enriching my life and awakening my social conscience."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"A compelling story with fascinating background. I found the mother the most compelling character--a woman completely under the control of a man, wanting to rebel but tied down to obligation, children, a notion of God perpetrated by her husband. So easy to say &quot;just leave&quot;--but Kingsolver convinces us of her struggle, even for women readers who find it hard to imagine being so trapped, 40 years and womens emancipation later. The book made me want to find out what the real story of the US in the Congo was."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I can't believe this book wasn't a front runner for the National Book Award. Charming Billy was a tiresome book. The runner-up for the National Book Award, A Man in Full, by Tom Wolfe was trite...also ridiculous!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I enjoyed this book until the very end. I found the wrap up of all the girl's lives too quick and neat. It certainly gives a good history lesson on the Congo in the fifties."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Kingsolver has written a true masterpiece. It is part history, part novel, part sociological study, a large part poetry - and all of it is saturated in a truth that is too seldom spoken. All of the viewpoints presented (the mother's and each of the daughters') ring true, and one wonders how one author's mind could have entered so convincingly into each of those beings. Kingsolver's great understanding of Africa in general - and specifically the Congo - puts all other studies in the shade. I feel my own understanding is greatly enlarged for having read it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I was unprepared for the impact this book would have on me during and after I read it. It has flaws, but the power &amp; beauty of Kingsolver's prose, her depictions of the Congo, missionary work and the world of 1960's Africa thru the eyes of four women are astonishing. I still cry when I think about this book five months later."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"As a fan of Barbara Kingsolver, I was delighted to find that this book is as good if not better than all of her others. The plot and setting are very different and a refreshing change. The characters are compelling and incredibly well-written. I don't usually find this rotating narrative style interesting but Kingsolver does it very well. You can stop reading after page 385 as the climax is really the strongest part of the book. I read it in three days and think it is the best book I've read all year."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Just when I thought &quot;The Bean Trees&quot; was my favorite book ever, she goes and writes this one! She says it all in the acknowlegements at the beginning...&quot; It took me 30 years to get the wisdom and maturity to write this book &quot;... I believed this fiction to be nonfiction by the end and know these people will be a part of my life forever!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Reading this book, I cannot understand how so many people could have recommended it to me--I even BOUGHT this one b/c everybody told me it was so good...well, I barely dragged myself through it. I felt absolutely no attachment to any of the characters (maybe I was slightly interested in Adah, but even that was minimal) and found them to be flat and bland at best. Moreover, having grown up in Africa (Zaire, in fact, along with parts of West Africa), I found that Kingsolver completely failed to capture the soul of Africa and what it feels like to grow up there. As a deep, meaningful novel, I think it missed the boat; if her point was to do a political analysis, then she should have spared us the Prices...."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"As a fifteen year old girl living in the year 2000, maybe it's just pickiness that causes me to say I think this book lacked the excitement I crave. Although most of the first half was really interesting and very well written, the second half drove me crazy. I was excited by all the events that took place in Belgian Congo, but once the family was seperated it seemed like page upon page of endless bla bla bla-ing. Not very interesting. I believe a book that spans over ten years is just too much."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I've read several of the Oprah selections and only liked two of them, so I was leery of giving another one a try. I'd heard some feedback previously to The Poisonwood Bible and had wanted to read it anyway, so I used that as an excuse to pick this one up. I really enjoyed it--so much, that I read it in less than a week. I was extremely interested in the historical aspect since these things were happening while I was a child unaware. The ending was slow and much too long after the climax, so expect the final chapters to be a drugery. Other than that, it's a good read and well worth the time."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I found this book to be deeply moving as well as informative. Although much of the criticism has centered on the author's &quot;preaching&quot; regarding the political climate in Africa, I found it to be an important and interesting piece of fiction.I loved the way each of the women &quot;spoke&quot; in her own voice in each chapter, and found that this book has stayed with me long after I have finished reading it. An excellent and interesting read. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I am almost through the final chapter of this book and want to remind readers that this book is a work of fiction! So any discrepancies or expansions on the truth were the author's perogative! Who cares if lions don't live in this part of Africa? Who cares if the savannah and the rainforest cannot exist in the same geographic area? It works with the story and makes it a spellbinding tale if you remember to give up any need for total factual reality. Perhaps the author is trying to make political statements; if you take the book as pure entertainment (however gutwrenching it can be at times), it is worth the read. I am reminded of the Clan of the Cave Bear series, the proverbial caveman soap opera, which was also criticized for its lack of accuracy. Who cares - did it keep your attention and did you enjoy reading it?"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I found this book to be riveting, from start to finish. Kingsolver's writing paints beautiful pictures of life in Africa. Her style of using a &quot;voices&quot; of each character in alternating chapters was a brilliant way to give the reader of graphic view of life in the Congo through many different eyes. I felt changed by this book and it's power. I only wish it had gone on another few chapters. It was really stunning. One caveat to readers who like &quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot;-- I ran out and bought Kingsolver's other books immediately and found the writing disjointed and bizarre. (I read 3 others by her). This is clearly her best."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver's The Poisonwood Bible is a delicious read up to a point, and then she kept going. Her plot climaxed just past the middle of the book (and a brilliant, well written climax it is, no doubt) but the remaining chapters were superfluous sequel fodder. The characters became like old clothes: just plain worn out and full of holes. Where an epilogue would do, she wrote another book..."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I picked this book up on a whim to read over my Christmas break for school, and found it to be SO difficult to put it down. \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\" had me wrapped around it's finger, to say the least. What I really found troubling, however, were the flaws with the Baptist faith. I've been a Baptist my whole life, and can say without a doubt that we do not believe baptism is what brings one into Heaven upon passing away, but asking Jesus into your heart. Baptism is simply the next step in your walk of faith, a public display. Secondly, the Apocrypha is found nowhere in our religious services or devotions, we stick strictly to the Bible. While I understand that these are MAJOR flaws within the book since Nathan Price is supposed to be a fire and brimstone evangelical Baptist missionary, this book remains to be one of the best books that I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The story reminded me of the book of Job. Near the end of the story the pastor is portrayed as a really awful man. He is authoritarian, traditional, and religious, but I didn't think of him as a bad person."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I found it to be well crafted and dense. A mother and four daughters, each with a distinctive personality and voice, take turns giving their particular perspectives on the story of how their family, led by the fire-and-brimstone Free Baptist preaching father of this Georgia clan, ventured into the deepest Congo on a mission to an obscure village named Kilanga during the closing years of the Eisenhower administration. The novel, which runs on for 543 pages, recounts how this mission to Africa affected their family dynamic, their interpersonal relationships, and their futures. But it is much more than just a story of how Southern Baptists adapted (or not) to life in the Congo, it is about the process of self-discovery, the presumptions of proselytizers, the range of different approaches people might take to living in a foreign culture, the impact of colonialism, American hegemony during the Cold War, and the history and natural essence of Mother Africa herself."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book literally put me into rage. In fact, I had to put it aside and read something a tad lighter (compared to The Poisonwood Bible even depressing The Lonely Polygamist is a lighter read) to be able to fall asleep. Reading about social injustices can do this to me sometimes.The Poisonwood Bible is a story of a Baptist preacher Nathan Price who chooses to become a missionary in the Belgian Congo of 1959. Along with his unwavering beliefs and desire to bring salvation and enlightenment to savage natives, Nathan takes his wife and four daughters to Africa. His attempts to introduce Christianity to the residents of a tiny Congolese village are mostly fruitless, as Price knows very little of their language, culture, and religious beliefs. But the preacher is relentless, even when he hears the news of the looming Congolese independence and is warned to leave the country immediately because any westerner is unsafe in the country which is trying to free itself of decades-long white oppression. Nathan decides it is his calling to stay and continue his righteous work at all cost to him and his family. This decision does cost the family dearly. Not one of them comes out of this experience unscathed.The novel is narrated from the POV of 5 Price women - Nathan's wife and daughters. Each has her own perspective on Nathan's work and on what is happening in the Congo. While none of the women physically takes part in a whirlwind of events the Congo is going through - the Congo's fight for independence from Belgium, first election of the Prime Minister, the CIA-staged coup to eliminate this democratically chosen Prime Minister and to install his replacement who would guarantee the West's access to the Congo's natural resources and safeguard the country as a pillar of capitalism in Africa - each has to carry a burden of responsibility for what has happened to their family specifically and the country in general. The reactions vary from solidified dismissal of the natives and rampant feeling of white supremacy to complete acceptance of the responsibility for atrocities forced onto the African nations by whites.In a way, the Price family is a symbol of colonialism. Nathan Price symbolizes the colonialist forces that think it is their right (if not responsibility) to bring change to the countries they misunderstand and look down upon, at any cost, including destroying people's cultures, religions, and leadership. And the Price women are representative of all of us, unwitting participants in all of this, who may chose to close our eyes and pretend nothing is happening or to try to do something drastic about it or in the least to acknowledge that such cultural arrogance is wrong.I suppose some readers will this book off-putting because of its seeming liberal agenda and its negative portrayal of both Christianity and the West (mostly America). Well, I'll leave them to admire Rachel Price's POV and live in denial. I personally found this book very enlightening. Kingsolver speaks my language.The reason why I am giving The Poisonwood Bible 4 stars and not 5 is because of the last few pages which left me feeling rather helpless. It seems, nothing that we do (including absolutely good-intentioned vaccinations and efforts to save children's lives) can bring anything but hardship to Africa. I guess, Kingsolver's last advice is to leave Africa to its own devices..."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This goes into my library as one of my favs simply because I felt I hadn't ever read anything like it...which is saying something. I loved the way the story is told from different persepctives. The only reason I don't give this book 5 starts is because I felt the last 100 pages are so were slow. Otherwise, great!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Overall this is a good book. However, after the death of one of Orleanna's children, the story gets tedious, repeating the same points over and over again about the situation in the Congo. Could have been a great book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I think Kingsolver did an excellent job in \\"speaking\\" in her characters voices as they expressed their discontent over being dragged to far off Africa for a clueless father. I loved the backwards writings of Adah, and her insight into how every word in Africa has a different meaning depending on how you say it, yet her father never understood this, or any of the African people, for that matter.This book is written almost in 2 parts, but I liked that it didn't end where I thought it would. It would have been cliche if they had just left Africa when we thought and gone home to be \\"oh so American\\". Instead Africa changed them, instead of the other way around...her ghost is felt wherever they run."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver is a genious! This book has moved me like no other. Her writing is magnificient!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is a \\"must-read\\" book. It will certainly broaden your understanding about \\"less-developed\\" countries and their people."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"A wonderful job of blending history with fiction. Travel to the Congo through the eyes of a mother and her four daughters. Each unique voice provides a different perspective of human endurance and a nation struggling to survive."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"When I started The Poisonwood Bible, all I could think about was how impressed I was. Kingsolver's description is excellent, and the sense of gloom, threat, and bewilderment-- spiritually, politically, and physically-- made me deeply thankful I live on this continent. She manages to cycle through the viewpoints of the family's women without confusing the reader, and although the childs-eye views grate at times, the gears shift fast enough, and the story is good enough, that they doesn't present a major obstacle.The real problem comes late in the book, when Kingsolver goes all political. Perhaps if I too were furious about the state of affairs in the Belgian Congo, it wouldn't be such a big deal, but it really spoiled the book for me.Make no mistake-- there are many good things about The Poisonwood Bible (including some I haven't mentioned at all), and the early part is a real show of power. But the polemical, political ranting toward the end puts a millstone around its neck."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible is a very difficult book for me to review because I have such mixed feeling about it. The first two thirds of the book are wonderful! The story about a missionary &quot;gone off to save the heathens&quot; in Africa and what becomes of him and his family is compelling enough. Yet the author doesn't stop there, she throws in some seriously deep insight into the lives of women oppressed by domineering husbands and fathers. Then she sets it against what happens to these people in a village of &quot;savages&quot; who turn out not to be so savage, who in fact act as their saviours on a few occasions. She shows the reader how to relate to both groups of people through their shared miseries, of which the author pulls no punches. This African experience is brutal. For salt, the author provides some insight into the political and cultural issues of the Congo. All of this is wrapped together in some of the most beautiful prose a person will ever read. It seriously took my breath away. I give the first two thirds of The Poisonwood Bible 5 stars. It's just plain awesome!Now the bad part. The final third of The Poisonwood Bible is a long, rambling, irritating and pointless diatribe about what happens to the family after they leave the Congo. Like a rock on water it skips from here to there with no apparent meaning. It adds nothing to the book except for physical weight. Reading the last third of The Poisonwood Bible and getting to the end to find out that there wasn't going to be any explanation for that painful bit of reading seriously made me want to strike the author. I cannot begin to fathom what happened when the author penned that part of the novel. Perhaps writers block suddenly set in? Or maybe Miss Kingsolver died and someone else finished the book? I don't know.Borrow The Poisonwood Bible and read it. After you find that you have read about two thirds of the book watch out for signs of drag. As soon as that sets in, give up. It's not worth wasting your time or ruining the experience of the rest of the book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I am particularly enticed by the creative literature and precise seperation of character as seen when I move from chapter to chapter exploring the caustic Africa. Kingslover has made a novel both the amature and the advance can obtain knowledge from and wisen for the most part. Every teenager should indulge in this fantastic book. The book created a fear in me for I was oblivious to the world outside the paradise to which I live but now I can empathise and feel that sort of need to explore and discover the ruthlessness of life in a world we often take for granted.I give Kingslover all my support, since I cannot find the dedication she had to write with such intense characterization as I wish to achieve as a young writer."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"To me, a great read doesn't just keep you turning the pages, it also teaches you something and whets your appetite for more information. This is definitely one of those books. It's just brilliant, and had me racing out to buy more Kingsolvers (she's always good, I discovered). It'll challenge you. It'll make you think. It may even open your mind. It's THAT good."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"sure, this book has its flaws, it's 'mindless prose' but damn if it isn't a wonderful read and amazing story, following the lives of four daughters and a mother as they are brought to Congo in the 60's for a missionary salvation. I highly recommend it for a fantastic read."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"On the recommendation of a friend, (the Oprah seal on the notwithstanding), I plunged right in. For those who feel or felt that this is just a &quot;women's book,&quot; think again. The pages are packed with juicy descriptions, vivid details, sad truths, pointed questions, and even a quick lesson in African history that speak to the human condition.The book is not brief, does not attempt to solve the problems it depicts, nor does it paint a rosy glow on anything- from family conflict to world inequity, to human suffering. It is merely many stories within a story containing human reactions. Despite the depression and despondency this novel tended to stir up in me, I found it difficult to set aside.Although I would agree with other reviewers that Kinsolver sounds, at times, un-American, many of the conclusions drawn here are inescapable. So long as the great imbalance exists between the haves and the have-nots, problems will continue to arise. Perhaps more important is the question of whether organized religion ought to be thrust upon other &quot;uncivilized&quot; societies in the name of charity. Can we not just be humane without first having others believe what we do?"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is the finest recent American novel that I've read in years. The characters are wonderfully realized. There are wonderful poetic qualities about the prose, especially in the character of Adah. It's fascinating history; I remember when these things were going on as a child, and I appreciated this view from within by a sympathetic Westerner. There are occasional places where I think it may need editing, but it's such an ambitious project, and such an admirable search for the truth about Africa and about the human condition, that I still must give it five stars. I had never read Kingsolver before, and now I'm avid to read all her other works."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I was very hesitant to read anything with the word 'bible' in the title, especially something about missionaries, but I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed this book immensely. Kingsolver has done a wonderful job giving the reader a sense of what happens when your average apple pie American gets thrown into a jungle environment where no one wants to hear missionary banter about Jesus. Told from the point of view of four daughters, the maniacal Tata Price relentlessly tries to convert the 'heathen' Kilanga residents to god fearing Christians, only to ultimately enrage both his family and village, resulting in a tragic conclusion.My only criticism is this: Although I always enjoy follow-up at the end of a story as to how everyone's life transpired following the main event, I felt that it was a bit overdone. I appreciate knowing where all the daughters ended up, but by the last chapter, I really wanted to just have them go away. So, that is why I gave it a 4 and not a 5, but in all, it is a wonderful novel. Also, anyone who is interested in following up on the Congo should also read King Leopold's Ghost for a real glimpse at the horrors that took place in the Congo."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"What an epic!I read this book with great interest the plot was good. Arrogant Minister/Father feeling he can change all in the name of God. I felt Nathan's character was also a mirror to America's cold-war mentality: Go Out and destroy Communism wherever it may crop up/Go and preach the word of god among the highways and byways... funny parallelism there, no?The story told in the form of the Mother and her children was done well with each have their distinct voice this was rich. Kingslover thickens her plot with the very real historical and political backdrop -- it made very good auxilliary reading to understand the time.Thank you Ms. Kingslover for telling us a wonderful story of fiction, but moreso for educating us somewhat on a part of history that few folks stateside will choose to recall."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"A friend of mine told me that this was the best book she had ever read, so I began it with very high expectations. I was very disappointed and frustrated by the end of this reading experience. I think the author missed some opportunities to tie things together at the end of the book. Why the abrupt shift of setting, for instance, after making the Congo the focus throughout the entire book? Why wasn't the father's fate more clearly defined? He is such a strong presence in the novel, yet me know so little about him. Most of all, I found the daughter's wordplay just plain annoying by the time I got to the end."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I am breaking my own rule of reviewing a book which I did not completely read, but I felt like going through 350 pages was enough to get the idea it wasn't going anywhere.My main criticism of the book is the lack of any attachment I received with the characters. After 300 pages, I really lost all care for this family trapped in the Congo. The author would reveal a possible plot line every few chapters only to extinguish it or not really tie it with what was going on.The characters I enjoyed the most, or thought were the most compelling, don't even appear often or become fleshed out. The father, good 'ol Reverend Price, is almost the apparent boogey man of the story; he is the source of all the troubles these women are facing. But the author leaves him so one-sided and flat by not letting him express his ideals or opinions or views of the situation.The girls, varying in age, are the ones the story is told through with some rare pages from Orleanna, the mother. The whole scope of the story is told through them, so the most compelling characters always have to be filtered through these different woman's points of view.Doesn't that sound like a pretty neat narrative trick? It does, if it was done right. The journal entries that we get from each woman within the family is contrived, forced, and not realistic. I felt like the author wanted to do the effect for fun, not really to add to the overall narrative.Overall this book wasn't compelling. The themes that were so ripe for the pickin' were just left out and never were engaged. The characters are all contrived and uninteresting except for a few moments, but there experiences hardly add to the overall arch of the whole book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible is a wonderful piece of literature, thoroughly gripping and haunting. The multiple, cycling points of view completely drew me in. I had the &quot;misfortune&quot; of picking this book up right before Finals week at my University. I couldn't study until I was done reading it.In our schools growing up, we are often presented with a rather benign view of evangelicals and those who journeyed to foreign lands to save the souls of &quot;savages&quot; and &quot;infidels&quot;. This book changed how I look at these people. It's not about recognizing wrong or right, it's just about recognizing different.From a purely critical literary viewpoint, I think Kingsolver's weakness lies her inability to conceal her liberal political views and stick to the journey her characters go through but honestly since I agree with those views, I had no problem with that part of the book.Regardless of those digressions, this is an incredible work that deserves all the admiration and adulation I can muster forth for it. The Poisonwood Bible is forever on my All-Time Top 10 List."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I HAVE SUCH A DEEP APPRECIATION FOR THIS BOOK. SO MUCH RESEARCH MUST HAVE BEEN DONE BY KINGSOLVER. I WAS ENTRANCED AND I COULDN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT THE STORY FOR DAYS AFTER I FINISHED THE BOOK. I FELT THAT I WAS THERE IN EACH SCENE BECAUSE IT WAS SO WELL WRITTEN AND VIVID. IT'S BELIEVABLE AND HEARTBREAKING. THIS IS MY FAVORITE PIECE OF WORK BY B.K. AND ONE OF MY ALL-TIME FAVORITE BOOKS IN GENERAL! I LOVED IT!!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"So many reviews means so much passion! No surprise since this book is amazingly phenomenal in its scope - the mother and her daughters are so amazingly diverse, the plot is as suspensful as as a thriller, the writing flows off the page to transport you into the jungle. Take this book through to the end and you will be amazed. I have read hundreds of books (honest) including all of Kingsolver's work (except her latest) and I can honestly say that Poisonwood Bible is the best novel I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Once I picked up this book, I could not put it down! An excellent summer read, I took it to work, read it on my lunch break, and came home read it some more. It's that interesting! I've never read any of her books before, but now that I've read this one, I'm sure as heck gonna go and buy her other books! So please keep reading, you wont be disappointed!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I've been a fan of Barbara Kingsolver's for a long time now. When it's time for a new release, I'm at the bookstore when it opens that morning. I devoured The Poisonwood Bible in just a couple of days. Kingsolver has an incredible gift for making her stories come alive-- and seem so real that you feel like you could just close your eyes and step into the village. I can't begin to describe how I felt when I read this book. And though I don't agree with Oprah's methods of choosing her book club selections, I can console myself by the thought that perhaps a few Oprah readers will discover the world of Barbara Kingsolver and enjoy her as much as I do."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"With all the fancy stylistic posturing to which Kingsolver resorts to tell this story, she denies a voice to what should be the most interesting of her characters: the father who brought them to Africa. Without any intimate knowledge of him and his motives, we have to take them for granted, which is smug. Are we deprived of him because he's a man (arbitrary) or because of a complete failure of imagination at the heart of the structure?I think this is why the book is much too long and self-indulgently &quot;cute&quot; - Joseph Conrad's tight construction would have been a better model."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The premise of this novel is very interesting: a fire and brimstone Baptist preacher decides to pick up his family and move to the jungle of the Congo to preach the Gospel. His wife and 4 daughters, ranging in age from 5 to 15, are the narrators of this story, which covers a time span of roughly 25+ years. This includes the time of great political upheaval in the Congo, modern day Zaire, and the differing viewpoints from the various females is interesting.This novel provided somewhat of a fictional account of the history of the Congo (or Zaire), but how much of that was accurate is debatable. Admittedly, I do not know all that much about the history of Africa, but the author does have a heavy social agenda, and when that occurs in a book, I find myself disbelieving an author's \\"facts.\\" The author usually attempts to sway the facts according to their own agenda.There were a number of troubling points to this novel. Certain characters - the ones the author really disliked and wanted her readers to dislike as well - were written in a way that provided them with absolutely no redeemable or likeable qualities whatsoever. This is true for the minister, Reverend Price, and one of the daughters, Rachel. I have a difficult time believing that people are all good or all bad. These two characters, for me, were just too difficult to believe and seemed comical most of the time.The Reverend Price, a Baptist pastor, taught from, believed in the validity of, and held sacred the apocrophya. While I'm certain this can happen under some sort of extraordinary condition, perhaps, it is never, ever explained in the novel exactly how the Reverend Price came to this understanding. I have never met any religious pastor, outside of Catholicism, who accepted the validity of the apocrophya. But, of course, these books do provide the author with some great quotes and stories to throw into her book! The only down side is that the Catholics do not have missionaries that can marry and have children. Awkward that, for Ms. Kingsolver!I can certainly respect an author (or anyone, for that matter) having an anti-religious streak to their writing. However, I do get rather insulted when the author doesn't even take the time or effort to research and resolve these mistakes in religious dogma and tenents.I also found it somewhat tedious in the character of Leah to be so self-hating. I do understand enough of the history of Africa to realize the imperializing and colonizing of this continent by Europeans was devasting. However, Leah takes on the mantle of \\"white guilt\\" to the point where it becomes tedious, dull, and boring. Perhaps Ms. Kingsolver feels this way herself, and perhaps she wishes all white people to feel this way, but I don't.Overall, the book was an OK read. It kept my interest through most of it. At the end, when Ms. Kingsolver gets a bit heavy-handed with the political and social issues, I lost a bit of interest and it was harder to keep going. By then, I simply wanted to finish the book. I doubt I'll be reading any other works by this author."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book is a great read. I couldn't put it down from the time I started reading it. There are so many eye opening messages in it. It is a must read!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is one of the best books I've read in five years - and I read a lot. Ms Kingsolver's earlier novels were quirky and intriguing, but The Poisonwood Bible soars above most contemporary fiction. Unless you're a rabid evangelical Christian, you will be moved by this honest (and frequently amusing) story."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Just as a painter must finally put down the brush and admit the painting is finished, a writer, too, must know when to put down her pen. Up until the family exits Africa, I couldn't stop reading (even did one all-nighter). I thoroughly loved the different voices of the girls and was riveted by the trials and tribulations the family endured in the Congo. BUT after the climax, my interest waned GREATLY--(and there's still several hundred pages to read!)--because the rest of the book seems like epilogue. I didn't really care to follow the characters into &quot;Life After Congo.&quot; It was ALMOST the best book I read all year--had Kingsolver ended the story sooner, I would have found myself leaving the POISONWOOD BIBLE &quot;wanting more,&quot; instead of &quot;praying for less.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I'm not normally given to reading fiction as so often it's poorly done and as a historian I have pretty high standards for historical fiction. I was recommended \\"Poisonwood Bible\\" as it is somewhat along the lines of historical fiction and it was my introduction to Barbara Kingsolver outside of film adaptations such asMosquito Coastand others. As it is the first book by her I've read I'm not certain if this is indicative of her style of writing, if this was something of a deviation or what. I hate to dismiss an author based on just one book, but having read \\"Poisonwood Bible\\" I can honestly say I have no interest in reading anything else she has written or will come to write. Reading through it so many adjectives came to mind and none of them complimentary. In her introduction Kingsolver apologizes for having to read up on the history of the Congo/Zaire, admitting she didn't know much about it and was thankful for those more knowledgeable about it than her. At that point as her editor I would have said \\"STOP!\\" Why on earth would you tackle something you don't know much about, don't fully comprehend, and have no connection to? As a historian I can speak to how immersed GOOD writers get with their subject. They throw themselves fully into the subject. What Kingsolver produced here is dilettantish to say the least. This novel is the story of a Baptist family who travels to the Congo just as the beginning of that country's crisis in 1960. Kingsolver's characters are crude caricatures; the fire-and brimstone Baptist minister Nathan Price, his dutiful yet detached wife Orleanna, and their four daughters. All except Nathan take turns narrating the story of their lives, yet throughout it was the same overwrought purple prose going into laborious descriptions of their surroundings and unfolding events that screamed out for editing and dialing things back. The narration belies the supposed differences of the characters, instead pointing out the flaws in Kingsolver's writing. If she's writing from a young child's perspective then why does it sound like she's far more mature or writing from many years in the future? The differences between the narration by mother and her daughters is so wildly different that it seems that Kingsolver is almost overcompensating to make them sound unique and varied. What results comes off reads as a poorly written autobiography. If you're expecting keen character development and insight into the human condition this isn't the place! The characters are un-relatable and unlikable to put it mildly. When layered on top of the horrid narration it makes for an unreadable stew, though certainly many people have enjoyed \\"Poisonwood Bible\\". I am not one of them.Kingsolver seems to be falling into a trope for popular fiction writers like Jonathan Franzen, who I likewise found tedious and pretentious. Take un-relatable and unlikable characters, put them in a contentious setting, and have them spout crypto-profound musings on their condition and their world as events unfold. Then grind the reader down over several hundred pages as you plod on to a rather predictable formulaic conclusion. I had hated the aforementioned Franzen's ponderousFreedom by Jonathan Franzenas the worst fiction I'd read until I picked up \\"Poisonwood Bible\\", which now deservedly is the worst thing I've ever read. It's clear that Kingsolver wants to make a grand and profound statement on the horrors the West has inflicted on the Congo/Zaire over many decades; from Belgian colonialism to the present ongoing conflicts there. She could have done so more effectively and there are FAR better books on the subject such asKing Leopold's GhostandDancing in the Glory of Monsters: The Collapse of the Congo and the Great War of Africathat you SHOULD read instead of this half-baked hash."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I love liturgical dramas, whether or not they are performed in church. I am reminded throughout The Poisonwood Bible of oratorio, in which soloists step up to the fore and sing along thematic lines unique to each character. With each of Kingsolver's characters, I hear a different mode of chant, a different language, a new pattern of drumming, dancing rhythms and antiphonal choruses in the background. I hear diatribe, supplication, anathema, love-calls. This is a musical, vital book. I do not begrudge Kingsolver her many pages of political preaching, I listened with rapt attention to her sermons because they were based on sound research and love for the people, whereas Nathan's could not be heard with complete dismissal. Leah's voice conveyed what God would have us do for these people, liberation theology in the rough, wheather she would have liked that label or not. I didn't get too emotionally involved with condemning Nathan, either, he was so beyond hope, and showed us glaringly that religion and prayer are not the same thing, do not need each other, and have totally opposite effects. I would have appreciated knowing, though, much earlier in the story, that he was consumed with survivor's guilt, now recognized as a bonified mental illness. I personally know the likenesses of all the characters who performed in this work, and they are real, let me tell you. I have probably reflected each of them at times (except Nathan, thank God)in my own life with reasonable mimicry, and that was a profound wake-up call to me. Orleanna's walking away from the ready to be buried body, her leaving that to Nathan as her perpetual blame and accusation, was a beautiful epiphany of responsibility on her part. I forgave her everything at that moment. But Nathan's misappropriation of Baptism in God's gift of rain was his crowning sacrilege, and his fate I feel, was sealed that very moment. But why didn't Kingsolver allow them to find Ruth May's grave so many years later? Why couldn't they at least have been given that? Read this book, weep, then go out and scrutinize faces for the same physical and spiritual hunger that the Price family saw and experienced, and feed it. In this way we will all practice Biblical justice. We and the world can be changed by this book. Thank you, Barbara."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"An otherwise excellent story was ruined about 100 pages from the end, when things digressed into a whiny politically correct diatribe about how all of Zaire's problems are due to the U.S. backing Mobutu when he first came to power. The political subplots would have been fine, though, if Kingsolver's characters hadn't been so disgustingly sanctimonious. It made the book really unpleasant to finish."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver's &quot;The Poisonwood Bible' arrived on my doorstep in South Africa in June 1999 - a gift from a dear friend in Boston MA. Like many in 'the West' she is very interested to learn more about Africa. She loved the book, and knew I would too. We laughed, wept and had our eyes opened in many different ways. Africa, with it's many places and peope, is not somwhere one can learn about on TV - or read about in history or travel books. However, Barbara Kingsolver - 'cheered on' by South Africa's own Kate Turkington, has done a wonderful job of putting us - even those of us here in the South - in the picture. A wonderful read for a few chilly July evenings."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"While on the whole I tend to avoid overtly &quot;political&quot; books, Poisonwood seduced me with unforgettable (though, in the case of Rachel, a bit caricatured) characters, and lovely prose. Not since &quot;As I Lay Dying&quot; has the multiple narrator gimmick worked so well, and Kingsolver unfolds the story at just the right pace. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book was a birthday gift from my son so even though I wanted to quit reading it so many times, I trudged on to the end. I kept hoping that it would get better but it never did. I found myself confessing to my husband that I'd be so happy when I was finished reading this book. My main complaint is that I never really connected with any of the characters. Plus, there was the element of being \\"preached\\" to by the author, which was both irritating and tiresome. I do not enjoy being coerced by an author to feel a particular way. There's no need for that. I believe if a story is told authentically, without an agenda, then it can be appreciated no matter which side the reader comes down on the substance of the story.I really wanted to like this book but I just found it lacking."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Of course it is a wonderful novel, and beautifully written. But it is not a disinterested study of the history of the Congo, and ought not to pretend that it is. Why, in the bibliography is there no reference to any Congo missionary or missionary organisation since the 19th century? There was plenty of real evangelical work going on but she hasn't used it, or researched it. Is this because she was worried it would not have fitted in exactly with the interpretation of events and attitudes that she is pushing? First hand direct descriptions such as those of Dr.Helen Roseveare would surely have not been hard to find and are not fiction. Why did she ignore accounts of evangelical religion there and then from the inside? It leaves me uneasy."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book should be required reading for humanitarian/international development professionals. Among many others, &quot;Poisonwood&quot; makes the point that the relevance of a particular worldview is ultimately tied to a very &quot;real&quot; time and place - and that to try to force a worldview on a time and place that it was not meant for can have unimaginable (and disasterous) results.This is also an excellent travel book: One trans-Pacific flight with a layover or two should be enough to finish it off!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This was one of the most powerful books I've ever read. You know these people better than you know yourself. The descriptions of life in the Congo make you realize how much you take for granted, and at the same time, you appreciate the rich culture of the people who live there. Everyone should read this incredibly moving book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The first two-thirds of this book is beautifully written. I love the way Kingsolver created unique voices for each of the characters and told the story through their eyes. However, the book takes a disappointing turn during the last third. Rachel's character turns into a parody of herself, and Leah's self-righteous and predictably PC diatribe becomes tiresome at best. It struck me that Kingsolver was projecting a fantasy of middle-class, baby-boomer-style radicalization onto both Leah and Orleanna. Toward the end of the book, Leah's voice started sounding like the author was preaching at the reader about first world imperialism in Africa--not that she doesn't have a good point, but preaching about politics is a great way to ruin a novel."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is a fascinating book, written from the perspectives of four different girls/women, who travel to the Congo at the behest of their evangelical missionary father/husband. I learned a tremendous amount about the history of the Congo and the realities of life in a third world country, as well as insights into the responsibility we accept or abdicate for our own lives. Outstanding reading."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I was so engrossed in this novel that I couldn't work. Every chance I got I was reading it. I honestly didn't want the book to end. I really loved reading from all points of view. My favorite sister was Adah. This book is very descriptive and you could actually see all the characters and the places. Near the end it did get a little slow especially with Leah's story, but overall it was great. I'd recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I loved this book and couldn't put it down. The characters narrative of their story was ingenius and put a different twist on one family's slide into hell. They say whales beach themselves, sometimes, because their leader as made a major error in judgement. Poisonwood Bible is the description of a family's personal disaster that actually results in hope for the remaining individuals."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"From the moment I closed the cover of this thick 543-page book, I felt an odd sense of achievement. Or maybe a bit of relief. Relief, not in the typical sense, meaning you are glad that it is over, but a strange tranquil peace since you now know the whole story. I reclined in my chair and took a deep breath to reflect on what I had just read. Such an intense story of the lives of a mother and her four daughters packed into so few pages. Never in my life have I read such an astounding story put together with such astonishing refinement. The ways in which the author put together her words and sentences is nothing I have ever encountered in a fictitious novel. One may think that I am deranged for rambling on about a book, but this is truly a work of art."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is one of the best books I have read in the last three years. The story is breathtaking; the descriptions go beyond reality itself and into poetic depth, and the characters are fascinating. It is impossible to read this book and not to have one's heart go to Africa and to the people so movingly painted by Kingsolver."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book is so alive! I could not put it down! The characters, villagers reactions, and communal effort to help one another, the chief and elders roles, reaction to the missionaries... This is the most realistic book I have yet read on Africa by a non-African."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"An awesome journey into Africa with a missionary, bible toting minister and his family of women. The alternating perspectives and vivid detail of the women's journey physically and emotionally into and out of Africa is extremely powerful as its influences left a lasting impression on who the women ultimately became. It left a lasting impression on the reader as well. Kingsolver touches so many emotions - her characters are so rich that it is hard to put the book down."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"If you live in modern society this book pertains to your lifestyle because you depend on the surplus of cobalt, copper, diamonds, rubber ... that western society has availed to you hidden within your conveniences.Plus Barbara Kingsolver's special talent is to give you characters you want to read about. They weave their fascinating tales for you. The scenery of the Congo 14** - current lives in her imagery."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"It took me quite awhile to get thru this book, because I thought it was depressing, and also quite unfair toward missionaries and Christians.The Price family and other Baptist missionaries combine all the mistakes and bad qualities of every missionary who has ever gone to Africa! Yes, all those mistakes have been made at one time or another, but are generally not concentrated all in one dysfunctional family.Furthermore, Kingsolver has not done her homework. At one point, she has Rev. Price telling women that if they had had their now-deceased babies and young children baptised, they would be in heaven. This is not Baptist theology! Baptists do not believe in baptismal regeneration but they DO believe in believer's (i.e., adult or children at age-or-reason) baptism. So in this area also, her premise is flawed.It's sad to think that some people will have their opinion of missions and missionaries formed by this book which emphasizes the worst of all possibilities. Every profession has its 'losers;' remember that the Price family is the exception not the norm in missionary work."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I'm currentley reading \\"Poisonwood Bible\\" for my history class im only about 60 pages in and I already love it dearly. I love the way the story rotates between Nathan Price's 4 different and hilarious daughters I especially love Adah Price, Leah Price's twin. Adah is mentally retarted yet she knows and sees more than all and is indeed a hilarious character. I also love the relationship between their mother and father. She seems to be such a normal person who curses, makes mistakes and tries hard but he seems to live his life on a pedastal trying to be the most perfect person ever (far from it in my opinion) I recommend this book to everyone it's a great read."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible is poetic, wrapping the rocky history of Belgium's withdraw from the Congo in the bodies of four young girls. When Nathan Price, a fiery Baptist preacher, moves his family to a Congan missionary in search of his own redemption, the four daughters he has raised fearing the wrath of God, begin to fear their father as much as the unfamiliarity surrounding them.Kingsolver's brilliant novel touches on several serious issues including the theme of salvation, strong throughout the novel. Her purpose seems to open the eyes of the audience to the injustice of Congo's independence. Kingsolver crafts her novel with a strong message delivered so softly, any audience will understand. Even the Belgian government, strongly the antagonist of the novel, could read Poisonwood without offence.This historical fiction places the imaginary lives of a missionary family lost in the accurate history of the African Congo's fight for independence. Kingsolver's creativity is unmatched in her portrayal of the serious happenings of a tormented father and an entire nation from the mouths of four little girls. Kingsolver show the effects of Congo independence on the Congo's youngest citizens, letting their experience of destruction of their family, foreign country, and lives as they know them swept away in front of their eyes.The reader walks away from Poisonwood with a bittersweet appreciation for strong religion and its effect upon the relationship between husband and wife. The book illustrates the dangers of having more power than one person, or one nation, can handle. The effect is humbling and eye opening."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book about a family that moves to the Congo (a preacher, his wife, and four daughters). I learned a lot about the area and culture; it is evident that meticulous research was involved here. I liked the writing style where chapters are devoted to the voice of a particular character. I did find the political ramblings a little much to take, but it was worth it in the long run. Great book -- highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Kingsolver's The Poisonwood Bible is the novel that made me fall in love with books all over again. I was captivated from the first page to the last and longed for even more. The novel is spiritual, historical, cultural, adventurous, its about desires, motivation, common sense, God, and a world far away from another's. The novel evokes feelings of adventure, empathy, sadness, pride, loss, joy, hope, and love. I recommend it to anyone who likes books that follow all the ups and downs of people who live out their dreams and do the best with what they have."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Is it possible to write an historical novel, with well-fleshed characters and socio-political import? &quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot; proves the answer to be a resounding yes!I will not delve into the plot, as that has been done by previous reviewers. However, some have said that the book lacked amiable characters. Here I must disagree. Would I want to live next door to these people? Probably not, but their lives were shaped by experiences I never had to endure. (I doubt anyone has ever compared an upbringing in suburban Atlanta with one in the Belgian Congo!) Nonetheless, I understood the characters and their actions, even when I liked neither.This was, quite simply, a fabulous novel that had me running to library for books on the history and politics of Zaire and Angola. It also made me deeply ashamed to be an American, although I'm beginning to get used to that."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book was presented to me as a school assignment.

This epic follows the family of an idealistic Southern Baptist preacher as he moves to the Congo to save the world from damnation. What makes it so lovely is that the story is told completely from the perspective of the wife and four daughters in the family, each of whom suffers her father's self-righteousness as the situation in the Congo turns from bad to worst.The story is not only one of the girls' struggle to free themselves from an overbearing father, but an allegory for the attempt of Africans to free themselves from their &quot;benevolent&quot; European colonizers. But unlike other post-colonialist diatribes, Kingsolver does not attempt to belittle Western values. Instead, she focuses on the wrongheaded assumptions the West has made about the delicate and ancient tribal culture of Africa.In these days of cultural clashing, the moral of this soulful story could not be more important. And there is perhaps no better story since Conrad's Heart of Darkness to warn would-be conquerers against riding the high-horse."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"A well written book about an American missionary family in the Congo (DRC) in the 1960s. Kingsolver is especially masterful in creating voices for the characters. She offers very realistic images of African life, as well as a portrayal of the negative effects missionaries can have. It loses its tightness towards the end, but is definitely a very enjoyable and educational read."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"1942. &quot;That was the last I would ever hear from the man I'd married - one who could laugh (even about sleeping in a manger), call me his 'honey lamb,' and trust in the miracle of good fortune.&quot; So recent bride Orleanna Price describes her husband's letter home from a military hospital on Corregidor. Shortly afterward, the war dumps onto his shoulders a load of guilt that he spends the rest of his life trying to expiate.1959. Baptist preacher Nathan Price, determined to bring the Gospel as he believes it to the heathens (as he perceives them) of darkest Africa, arrives in the Belgian Congo with his wife and four daughters. He hasn't been trained to speak the area's language, or to comprehend even the basics of its complex culture. Nor do he and his family know the first thing about how to survive in an environment where the very laws of nature operate differently than back home in Georgia, where Orleanna Price and her girls long to be. With the Congo verging on independence, the Missionary League places the Prices there reluctantly and recalls them a few months later when the area becomes too dangerous. But Nathan Price refuses to leave.Although I'm aware of the author's pantheist beliefs, I honestly do not view this lyrical, hysterically funny, yet at times horrifying novel as a condemnation of Christianity and a hymn to natural law. Its characters are too well drawn and too individual for that. Too real for that, especially after tragedy strikes in a way that finally drives Orleanna from her increasingly irrational husband's side. After their daughters scatter, and the story's second half begins.For me this is a book about the choices we humans make, and how those choices interacting with the world around us - physical, natural, and political - lead to consequences none of us can hope to predict. The guilt/atonement/redemption theme runs through its chapters in a unifying thread. It's also one of the most genuinely feminist novels I've read, in its honest depiction of individual women's lives over a half-century of time and across a variety of cultures. These are not &quot;types&quot; of womanhood. These are fully fleshed people.--Nina M.

Fantastic examination of motherhood and family. This may be the best book I read in '99."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I loved this book! I was an adult during the time of Patrice Lumumba. I am so ashamed that it took this work of fiction to awaken me to Congo (Zaire) history. Any book that inspires me to read more about its subject has done its job and more. I loved the five women who narrated their stories and loathed their religious fanatic husband and father. I was awed by the skill and wit it took for the author to create Adah. Remarkable. This is quite a departure for Kingsolver, who usually writes about the American Southwest. Brava!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"An enjoyable book, but I have to agree 100% with the Editorial Review above. There is also too much reference to politics, which caused the story to lose focus - i.e. on the emotional and physical development of the characters. The story dragged on once I got past one third of it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver captured my heart as we see the Congo of the late 50's through the eyes of a zealously neurotic, (psychotic?) missionary's four female children and his wife. The Price family arrives to find political unrest and a tribal culture that captivates and hones the heart and soul leaving all of them bewildered, embattled, and scarred, tearing the foreign family structure to the ground. It makes one realize the strength of our cultures."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"What a beautifully written book! I found myself rereading parts of it just for the pure pleasure of it. We hated the father and got angry with the mother but the book was a real joy to read."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"READ THIS BOOK! The writing is straightforward (don't look for a poetic masterpiece in this book), but WOW! What a great story. I enjoyed the storyline a great deal, but I also liked the way all of the characters suffered from deprivations, some physical (lack of food, shelter), some spiritual, some intelligence. These were contrasted in such a way that made me think about all of the things I take for granted every day and what my basic needs really are.Barbara Kingsolver is a consistently good writer. Don't miss any of her works. I am and will continue to be a big fan."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"As a male reading this book, it is hard for me to totally identify with the characters, however, I was able to identify with their struggles. While friends of mine criticized it for being a decidely female book, the story is universal, breaking gender and race boundaries. It is simply the story of the impact of the jungle (or any other serious trial) on a family. Each character is totally unique and it is difficult to pin one down as the &quot;heart and soul&quot; of the story. I found myself emotionally drained after prolonged reading (definitely a good thing). This is one of the few books that actually gave me goosebumps more than once. I reccomend it to anyone that can read."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I'm disappointed that so many readers dismiss this book as &quot;too political.&quot; Unless you already happen to have extensive life experience with Africa, are you really in any position to run up your nose at an outstanding novel that also informs us about US involvement in Zaire? If you think it has nothing to do with you, then like Rachel Price, you're living in denial. Incidentally, I do agree that the book drags towards the end, thought for me that had less to do with politics, and more with repetitious material regarding the characters."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Kingsolver does an amazing job of portraying the rise and fall of the Belgian Congo, as well as the tumultuous time afterward, through the eyes of young women. As we follow the Price family into the heart of darkness, we are consumed by the hardship and tragedy that befalls them. Africa refuses to succumb to their expectations. The characters are real, and the story riveting."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I had never read any books by Kingsolver before this one, and I have to say she is a wonderful and gifted writer. The Poisonwood Bible is a great novel, different from anything I've ever read before. I enjoyed the contrasting accounts of Congo life told by each girl. However, I felt this book was too long. After their mission in the Congo, I felt I wasn't as interested as before. I like to hear what happens to the characters after ordeals such as theirs, but it just dragged on for me. It became very political and symbolic in the end and I got somewhat confused. Other than this, the novel was expertly written and I am glad I took the time to read it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book -- it took a short while to understand who was speaking, and what the situation was (characters &amp; location were a bit muddled in the beginning), but then I found it difficult to put the book down. I enjoyed learning about the Congo/Zaire throught the eyes/minds of a variety of characters (ranging from an older, more mature mother to a 5 year old wildcat of a daughter).I enjoyed the fact that I really wasn't ever sure where the book was going to end (i.e. what would happen to the father, where would the sisters be at story's end, how would the mother's life turn out); and, when I finished the book, I spent several hours just thinking about what had just happened.It made me think about how spendthrift our lives are, how little we know about what goes on around the world, how big (and small) a difference people like missionaries can make, and finally, how much I'd enjoy visiting this part of the world.I highly recommend that you read this book -- despite its failings (per the editors &amp; other reviewers), I think that most people would find it very engaging &amp; informative."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible is one of Oprah's better selections this year. It is the story of the Prices a white family running a church mission in the Congo during the early years of Congo's independence from Belgium.

There are 4 sisters at the beginning of the who learn to assimilate to the culture and language in the Congo. Their mother is the victim of an abusive husband who doesn't care about his family. He only cares about preaching the word of God Thus the children are forced to learn to fend for themselves. This book is filled with African words that are enjoyable to learn. The lives and personalities of the sisters Leah, Rachel, and Adah are transformed after living in the Congo. The death of the youngest sister causes everyone to go their separate ways. All 3 sisters go on to have successful careers as a result of the work ethic they learned living in Congo. One sister becomes a teacher. One sister becomes a doctor. The other sister finds happiness in running a hotel. This book is impossible to put down."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible is the best book I have ever read. The viewpoint of seeing the beauty of &quot;primitive&quot; society with such insights into humankind's arrogance about being &quot;civilized&quot; is why I loved the book. Being a Native American, I see the world different from Caucasian or African, so the racial aspects of the book for me were important. I recommend this book for anyone who is caught up in the fast lane &amp; feels alienated without knowing really why. Even thought the African continent has contained &amp; still does, a lot of suffering there is the link with humankind's origins and connectedness with people that elevates the notion of being &quot;primtive&quot; that is long overdue.

Kingsolver is a masterful writer, and she knows a woman's heart. It is one of those books you wish was longer."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I have always been a big fan of Barbara Kingsolver, so I was thrilled to see a new novel come out. The Poisonwood Bible, however, is quite a departure from her earlier novels in that it blew me away. It really is incredible. The story is very interesting, but it is the telling that makes this book so special. Kingsolver tells the story through five different narrators with five distinct voices and personalities. Sometimes the narration can transform what would otherwise be a dull scene into a hilarious story.The Poisonwood Bible is the story of the Price family, a missionary, his wife and their four daughters as they travel to Africa. The story is fascinating and its affects on each member of the family are completely life changing. None will be the same when the book is over and we are the richer for having read this novel. I highly, highly recommend this novel. It is perhaps the best one Oprah has picked and is far, far superior to her normal selections."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book surpassed my expectations, which were high from the subject and the author. Barbara Kingsolver not only paints a family with the brushes of 5 distinct voices but also portrays a complex political history in personal terms. I was swept away by the writing, the emotion, and the compassion for a very distant and different culture that The Poisonwood Bible pulls together in a seamless whole. An excellent book that I began recommending to others before I'd even finished it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible served as my introduction to the writings of Barbara Kingsolver. The novel's two distinct sections worked well together, although I did prefer the first half of the novel to the second.The novel begins as a fine example of characterization and plot, and the use of multiple voices to define the members of the Price family works quite well. I think the author was at her best here, allowing us to see the gradual development of each child's own personality as the years in the Congo pass by. Character development in the first half of the novel rang true, at least to me.Later, as the family goes there separate ways, things seem to degrade a bit. While the first half of the novel bounced through the ups and downs of a well imagined world that could easily be mistaken for reality, later on everything looked like a five year weather forecast, with each character just traversing along in a (somewhat) tedious and all too predictable way.The book remains an enjoyable read to the finish, but it just doesn't reach the level of excellence hinted at in the earlier chapters.That being said, my knowledge of the political history of the Congo was greatly enhanced by reading the later chapters of this book--how could it not be? As a typical American, I know very little about Africa from a political perspective, and while the author certainly has her own point of view and perhaps even her own political agenda, her retelling of Congo's political past is eye opening, to say the least."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"You can almost hear the drumbeats of the Belgian Congo leap off the page. Imagine, dragging your four young girls off to live in the jungle. The father Nathan Price has some serious character flaws which are fascinating to uncover. The first part of the book is voiced by each daughter and the mother taking an alternate chapter. This book is long and it is good. It is not for the Danielle Steel crowd. In addition to learning about the Price family, the &quot;natives&quot;, and missionaries I also learned a great deal about the Congo and the politics that surrounded it in the 1960s. This book is an excellent book, the kind you may keep on your bookshelf for years and actually re-read years down the road. Highly highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Kingslover does an excellent job in telling a gripping story about intense missionary work in the Congo, but she also goes deep into analyzing the psyche of man, especially as the story is told through various characters and therefore from quite a few different perspectives. Her story shows us that nobody is perfect, although we may have a strong faith in God. It's a thick book all right, and it's not an easy read, but once you've read The Poisonwood Bible, you know you've read a book with excellent characterization, first-class narrative, interesting dialogues and a gripping tale of survival. For practical Christianity though, I recommend a non-fiction book by Dietmar Scherf called &quot;I Love Me: Avoiding and Overcoming Depression&quot; which will shed a lot of light on important aspects of true faith."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"this book is beautifully written. i would reccommend it to anyone. not only is the fictional story compelling, the historical background is woven in without distracting or feeling \\"educational\\". i finished this story completely in love with these characters and with a better appreciation for all the american luxuries we take for granted."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I read this book a few years ago, but it is always one of the first ones I recommend to other people. It is an amazing story set against true historical events. The author writes the chapters from the different perspectives of the mother and her four daughters, and it was fascinating to me to watch how her writing style changes from character to character.One cautionary note.....the first 100 pages or so are slow and hard to get through. In fact, the first time I tried to read it I got bored and put it down for several months. But I eventually picked up again and forced my way through thanks to a long plane flight....and was very gald I did. Everyone I have recommended it to has the same experience and can't believe how much better the story gets once you get further in. So if you find it slow at first, don't give up....it's worth it.The last chapter, one paragraph in particular, is powerful and haunting in a way...I often pick the book up just to re-read the last chapter."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible is the first book I ever read by Barbra Kingsolver. Parts of it were truly amazing. I really like her writing style and she did a good job developing the character of Leah - although I agree with some of the other reviewers that the character of Rachel was one-dimensional. I feel that the best part of the book was the first half, when the family was still living in a small village in the Belgian Congo. It reminded me of \\"Little Women\\" but with a terrifying survivalist kind of edge. The later part of the book was a little disappointing to me (the last 20% - I don't want to give anything away plot-wise). I felt that much of the character development in this section fell flat, although I really enjoyed learning more about the history of the Congo. I wish I could give this book five stars. It had a great plot, excellent narrative but I have to give it four stars because I don't think that some of the characters were very realistic."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I am not drawn to books about Africa or religion, but this was recommended by a friend and turned out to be the best book I've read in years. It is so philosophical and well-woven that it effortlessly guides the reader through a number of years and changes while provoking one to consider some of life's biggest mysteries: What is God? What is His intent for mankind? What is sin? What is worth? And yet the storytelling is so spellbinding that you read every word to eek out the meaning(s).This book changed my life."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible by Barbara Kingsolver, is a story with something for readers with many different interests. While it begins as a story of a family's overseas missionary adventure, it later becomes an inside look at political struggle in Africa.The story chronicles the journey of the Price family, led by Nathan Price, an evangelical Baptist preacher, who leads his somewhat reluctant family into the Belgian Congo on a mission trip in 1959. Nathan is followed by his wife Orleanna, and his four daughters: Rachel, the twins Adah and Leah, with Ruth May as the youngest. This unfortunate family, however, ends up getting more than they bargain for as their father's decisions on top of political events prolong the family's one year trip.Perhaps the most interesting thing about this novel is the way in which it is told. Readers will hear the story from the perspective of all four daughters, along with occasional blurbs from Orleanna. These four girls are drastically different in their views on life, and their experiences in the Congo. Many readers may find themselves quickly getting to know the girls, and perhaps even identifying with one or more of them.Early on, The Poisonwood Bible is amusing, as it details the mishaps of the Prices as they are transplanted in Africa. The story carries on at a moderate pace, a great story all the while, until an unfortunate turn of events slows the pace significantly. From this moment on, the book seems to become a series of tragedies until the close of the book.Despite the double-sided nature of this novel, it is an enthralling and involving story that keeps its readers quickly turning its 543 pages. Kingsolver exquisitely uses beautiful imagery and language throughout, especially when describing the African landscape. Readers also get an in-depth look at some of the history of the Congo in the 1960s from a non-American perspective. In fact, this is one of Kingsolver's main reasons for writing the book. Under the surface, Kingsolver explores a myriad of different themes and issues. Among them are topics such as racism, disabilities, religion, individual worth, leaving home, love, and imperialism. Her bold opinions on these matters are clear and interesting to read about through this novel.Whether you are looking for an entertaining story, or a political account form the past, The Poisonwood Bible is a quality work with something for nearly everyone."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"When Barbara Kingsolver's The Poisonwood Bible became a New York Times Bestseller and selection of Oprah's book club, I avoided it, figuring that is the kind of soft-headed \\"redemption\\" story that would make for a bad television mini-series. Part of me also assumed that the portrayal of the missionary father would be the sort of unsophisticated denunciation of proselytizing that the current culture feels no need to defend. With the hub-bub quite gone now (and the book available to me at a bargain price), I picked up the novel to find, of course, that I was wrong on both counts. It is a redemption story, but one that is about the hard work and pain of real healing. It is also the account of the worst kind of missionary and what he has wrought, but it also attempts to discover why this man is the way he is, and the book also reminds us of the other kind of missionary, the kind that does understand love and grace and forgiveness.Kingsolver presents us with first person narratives of the five women of the Price family: Orleanna, the mother; Rachel, the shallow beauty; Leah, the earnest believer; Adah, Leah's twin, whose deformed body and quirky mental process set her apart from the others; and Ruth May, the girl child. In a Faulkneresque account, we see through each woman's eyes the story of the Price family as they leave their home in Bethlehem, GA to take over a mission outpost in the Congo. While Nathan Price, the dominating Our Father, never speaks his own tale, he is the center of all their lives, influencing their actions even after his death.Determined not to be tainted by the African darkness, Nathan refuses all local help and doggedly insists that his American ways will save the lost African children. After a series of horrific events-some natural, some the result of the Price's stubbornness-the breaking point arrives with the death of one of the children. Orleanna quietly packs up the remaining children and leaves her unfeeling husband in the bush.The rest of the book chronicles the development of these women set against the backdrop of the political upheavals of Africa in general and the Congo specifically. Kingsolver tries to explore not only the political hypocrisy of western (and U.S.) policy in the area but also the difficulty of applying a Western political system to a way of life based on a non-commercial lifestyle.An aging Ada, now walking straight, observes towards the end of the book that \\"we are our injuries, as much as we are our successes.\\" Kingsolver shows us each part of that equation for each woman as they struggle not only to make a way for themselves in a quickly changing word but also as they struggle to fill the daughter/sister shaped hole left in their lives while trying to throw off the burden of the madman they left in the jungle. ...Kingsolver's The Poisonwood Bible is a book about redemption, but it is a hard-won redemption that the characters may not even realize they have won. Does the pain in their lives come from a raging caricature of a missionary? Perhaps, but it is more a portrait of a man whose own fears and failures drive him rather than faith in a loving, forgiving Jesus. As one of the other missionaries says, \\"There are Christians, and then there are Christians.\\" If the book offers indictments, it is a more generalized indictment of hypocritical government and uninformed good intentions."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I am really throwing myself out on a limb when I say I don't see what all the buzz is on this book. EVERYONE has it on their lists, and I dove in full force. I was a little disappointed; the book was a bit long and wordy, repeating many descriptions repeatedly, and my main reason for giving the book only 3 stars is because of a writing rule most know: the ending must stay true to the character, and in numerous cases this doesn't happen here. I won't give details in case of spoiling your fun, but a handicapped twist and controlling husband simple \\"moving on\\" will clue you inas to a few un characteristic \\"twists\\". This is well written most of the time, and if you are into learning about the congo and African Culture (which was fascinating) Kingsolver does a beautiful job of this, but overall I can not give it more stars due to the inconsistancies I saw. I may also mention that in my book club, about 90% of us were disappointed with this novel. I will say though, it is written better then many things you see on the best seller list, so if you need a change, this may suit you well."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Half-way through The Poisonwood Bible I was telling everyone what an absolutely fabulous novel this was - complex, imaginative, lyrical, heartbreaking, and funny - and now that I've finished it, I wouldn't change any of those adjectives. I must, however, admit that the last part of novel (not the very last chapter, which is remarkable)is disappointing. From a purely literary point of view, there is no story arc left for Kingsolver to complete. It also lapses into the worst sin of fiction writing: telling rather than showing. I blame her editors for not having the courage to tell Ms. Kingsolver that she was becoming repetitive and didactic (surely something the creator of Nathan Price could appreciate!). I see that many other reviewers have made the same point. This is a powerful and memorable story, and it only saddened me to see it, like the young Adah, come limping in at the end. Many have criticized Ms. Kingsolver for being excruciatingly PC, and I see their point even as I agree with most of her views. There is a core of self-loathing (Western loathing?)that becomes hard to bear after a while. If I'm going to be &quot;instructed&quot; in a book, I like it to be far subtler than it was here. Despite these reservations, I still highly recommend the novel, and I know I will never forget it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"If you enjoy in-depth character development, historical drama, reading beautifully written prose and are not afraid of having your &quot;eyes opened wide&quot; - you should read this book. It's intriguing and thought-provoking. I totally disagree with the &quot;white south-African&quot; reviewer but wouldn't expect any high praise from someone with that background - That's exactly what Kingsolver was writing about: the hypocrisy and unfairness of colonial rule. The reason the Congo is still suffering is because of the arrogance and selfishness of those kept unfortunately in power by the Europeans and Americans for decades - not because of the ineptitude of the people. Read this book, do your own research, and you will develop a deep compassion for the people of the Congo."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Very rarely does one have the opportunity to read a book which so alters her thoughts and feeds her brain. There are lessons to be learned, here. Just when I thought I knew everything! A main theme is the pride which seems to so inevitably go before each fall. I felt that Ms. Kingsolver was sometimes telling me, &quot;You are spoiled. Stop buying all of those things and do something charitable and worthwhile.&quot; Everyone hates the father in this book. He is just so bad. Enjoy."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is a remarkably complex account of a missionary who spent thirty years ministering to 'the least of these' in postcolonial South Africa at the expense of his family. Coming from Bethlehem, GA., with the Southern naivete, to the jungles of what was called the Congo (now Zaire) where there were no Piggly Wiggly sores, they are hardly prepared for the political upheaval taking place.The writer had lived in Africa as the child of medical and public-health workers. She thought of it as a place of wonders. That is typical childhood memories. She chose an evangelical Baptist preacher to interpret her 'path of exploring the great, shifting terrain between righteousness and what's right.' It took her thirty years to finish the final draft with a little help from her friends.However, trained as a biologist, her previous books reflect her interest in the natural world. Her collection of essays explore her beliefs that life choices must be ultimately made alone.With titles like ANIMAL DREAMS, PIGS IN HEAVEN, THE BEAN TREES, they really concern family problems, individual rights, but this one primarily is based on her influence by the Bible (King James Version).Some of her articles on natural history have appeared in 'Smithsonian' and 'National Geographic' magazines. This ambitious epic into the 1980s was a New York Times Bestseller and one of Oprah's Book Club favorites."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book takes place in the Congo in the 1960s, when the country was fighting for independence from Belgium. It centers around Nathan &amp; Orleana Price and their four daughters, who go there from Atlanta to do missionary work. The story shows how Nathan, blinded by his mindless determination to force the villagers to adopt his ways, never gets a clue about the people and the culture he has transplanted himself into. At the same time, he completely misunderstands his own family, and refuses to leave when they come in danger. He's is completely out of touch, and each of the women in his family learn to adapt in different ways. But the book is more about the four daughters and how they grow from that world-changing first year in the Congo into adults.Each chapter is written from the perspective of one of the four daughters or the mother, which I found an interesting and effective device to help us understand the characters, both through their own eyes and through each other's eyes. The characters themselves are interesting and very different from each other, and I enjoyed getting to know them. One is an insecure prima donna, another a liberal intellectual, another a brilliant girl who is paralyzed on half of her body, and the other a carefree child. However, at the same time, I felt somewhat removed from what was going on in the Congo, and had a hard time piecing together the political events that affected them so dramatically. Over the course of the book, it becomes more important to understand the external events, so I found that I lost a connection with the characters. In the last third of the book, we follow the characters through adulthood, and I found I didn't really understand the different choices they made as well as I would have liked. Although I still enjoyed their story, I didn't feel, as I had in Kingsolver's other books, a real connection with the characters in a way that affected me personally. This book felt more distant."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is a must read for all that are interested in great works of literature."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"An enchanting book that is best saved for a rainy day in bed. This book dug to the core sweetness and pain of motherhood."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The story of the Price family's journey to Africa and all that entails was mildy interesting at first, then built up enough steam to be compelling reading. If the book had ended about 250 pages sooner, I would probably have given this book three stars. However, it did not end there. In the latter part of this book, the reader is treated to several hundred pages that are basically a lecture on morality. If I want to know the history of the Republic of Congo (which I admit I know very little of) I will read a history book. I do not wish to learn the history through the obviously slanted perspective of this author. Not only is it boring, but I hate it when someone tries to shove their political beliefs down my throat in the guise of fiction.Once I became annoyed with the author, other parts of the book that I had been able to accept as possible became more unbelievable. For example, the Price twins are portrayed as advanced students. Even in 1959 white America, there were books detailing life in the jungles of Africa and all of the hazards lying in wait there. If anything,these dangers were probably exagerated, if that is possible. Would not the Price twins have educated their family and known what to expect? Would not these girls been aware of the reality of the situation and therfore not bothered carrying with them items such as cake mix?I fininshed this book because it is my policy to never leave a book unread after starting it. But I feel like I just wasted a week of my \\"reading time\\"."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"As a male, it's really scary to me that so many women would rate a book like this as their \\"all-time\\" favorite. There are no male characters that come close to being multi-dimensional and well-imagined. And one of the only non-egomanaical, essentially evil, male characters is a totally non-credible flaky man-child, who's drawn as a cutsie aphorism-spewing sprite.Even the emotional evolution of the women is very ideologically driven and not true to life. Example is the daughters' instantly forgetting about their evil father once he's out of their life (even horribly abused children still have some sort of mixed emotions to their abusers). And the only woman interested in men (beside the daughter who falls for the one-dimensional, crusading ideologue), is drawn as a manipulative schemer who uses sex to ensnare rich men.Finally, I found African history fascinating, but there's no artistry in the way it's presented. It feels as if a Wikipedia article was simply cut and pasted into the text."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Although this is a work of fiction it smacks of the truth throughout the entire read. It would be helpful to brushup on colonial Africa history to get the full enjoyment out of the book. I consider this a must reference for those that travel to aid others internationally. As a pure story I enjoyed the book thoroughly."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I loved this book. Once I started it I couldn't put it down until I was done.I laughed out loud at Rachel and her \\"command\\" of the English language.I cried with Orleanna and her depression.I empathized with the twins Adah and Leah.My heart broke for Ruth May.I sobbed at the ending, and wished there were more.I loved how the characters were so much alike, but at the same time so very different. Reading each of their perpectives was a really unique way of writing the story, and I enjoyed it immensley.The history lesson of the independence of the Congo was wonderful and I felt very factful. I've read other books on the Congo, and found this one to be very accurate."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is a book about how life can be unfair, how people can be horribly biased in their views, how religion can be hokey (on many counts), and explores the reactions of those subjected to trauma in five very distinct voices. I admired Kingsolver's ability to lend a unique voice to each of the story's narrators: the wife and daughters of a self-righteous, horrid minister. The blights and scars the Congo imposes upon this family are healed in very individual ways, much like the Congo itself grows over with vines and heals itself after an injury. This book explores the effects of values on a world society, and highlights how superficial many Americans (and Europeans) can be, and the imposition of the American government on other nations' leaders and governmental organization. It even touches on the nature of God, if such exists, and the presence of the supernatural in the natural. At the very least, even if the concepts explored are antithetical to your own views, this book prompts deep thought and discussion. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"WHOA--no way would I have lasted 5 minutes in the Congo described by Kingsolver in The Poisonwood Bible. This story, about 5 people who have no business living in an area where they are not suited, will take you into their world, and you can practically feel what they feel. I liked that the chapters were told by the women in the family--you learn about the tyrannical Baptist minister through their words. The story is well-told, and you'll follow the family for a number of years during their stay in the Congo, and afterwards. I don't want to give anything away here, but you'll laugh (Rachel is the stereotypical &quot;dumb blonde&quot;--but she's got interesting motivations)you'll cry, you'll get angry...read this story. It also has a lot of information about the Congo that I wasn't aware of. Kingsolver weaves a great tale mixed with fact. You'll feel like you've been through a lot with this Price Family."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I see \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\" not as a political book so much as a philosophical one, albeit an unflinchingly honest philosophical book which relates historical events as they were regardless of whether the truth offends American sensibilities.Kingsolver, who spent some of her youth in the Congo, was deeply affected by it. The four daughters and the wife of the missionary Reverend Nathan Price, all of whom relate parts of the story, are able to give voice to impressions that Kingsolver must have had when she arrived there, as she lived there, and after she left there. (When one daughter returns to the United States she is stunned in the way Peace Corps volunteers report that they are upon arriving back here.)The story of how the United States and Belgium deposed Patrice Lumumba after he was elected is truthful. For me the discussion of the history brought back memories of the names Lumumba, Tschomb&eacute;, and Mobutu and of studying a map of The Belgian Congo in the fourth grade. I do not think my teacher knew then the role that President Eisenhower had in deposing and murdering Patrice Lumumba, but that has come to light since then. If what the United States did to Patrice Lumumba reminds us of other things the United States has done (Salvador Allende in Chile, anyone?), Kingsolver is not to blame. She is merely the messenger that some would like to shoot lest she deliver her message.Kingsolver's thesis is that Africa, due to its climate, is not conducive to the cultivation of crops on a wide scale and that that has influenced its history. She probably believes that Africa would have been better off had Europeans never gone there. Yet she is loathe to blame individuals within the Price family for its sorrows or any one nation for the misery of Africa.The irreverence of Adah Price who writes in palindromes and refers to the Reverend Price as Our Father made me laugh and her betrayal by her entire family on one fateful night made me cry. Leah's bravery loyalty, and stubborness inspired me. Only Rachel Price appeared more caricature than person.I found the book riveting; I stayed up late reading because I didn't want to put it down. And has no on yet said, \\"love story\\"?"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"For the most part, The Poisonwood Bible is an incredible piece of literature. The voices of each narrator give thorough descriptions of their personalities and the biblical allusions are utilized incredibly well. The plot is moving and tragic, and the characters are very realistic. The book accurately portrays the way imperialist nations destroyed the Congo and demonstrates the dangers of religious fundamentalism. However, the book was about 150-200 pages too long. Some of the sections definitely could have been shortened slightly, and after Bel and the Serpent the book really started to drag. The positives do vastly outweigh the negatives, so I would definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible is definitely one of the most poignant and entertaining books that I have read within the last couple of years. The book tells the story of the Price family, who are brought to the Congo by their domineering Baptist father. Nathan (the father) decides to journey to Africa in the 1960's to help convert the native people to Christianity. Nathan also brings his wife Orleanna, and their four daughters, Rachel, Leah, Adah, and Ruth-May. The four children and Orleanna undergo severe culture shock upon arriving in the Congo, and must learn to adapt in their new surroundings. Surprisingly, life in the Congo turns out to be equally as difficult for Nathan. The people of the Congo have long been exploited by the Belgian government and do not openly embrace the idea of Christianity. After days of rigorous hardship and troubles, Orleanna becomes ill with depression. Overwhelmed by their mother's absence from everyday life, the girls must learn to fend for themselves. All the while, Nathan becomes more crazed with his missionary work and eventually goes insane. Ultimately, price family learns both difficult and valuable lessons while living in the Congo. I highly recommend the Poison Wood Bible, and enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is a truly precious book. It is best example since \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" of an important literary novel that is a heart-stopping pageturner. THE POISONWOOD BIBLE delivers the most intriguing, real and moving accounts of the Congo ever pun into print. While Conrad chased big metaphors in central Africa, Kingsolver finds just as much poetry and philosophy in the way the women tend their manoic fields.This book succeeds in totally removing the cloak of darkness from the Congo without denying it can be a most unforgiving place with parasites and worms for every part of the body, crocodiles ready to crash river baptisms and armies of ants capable of destroying whole villages. Despite all the 'horror' I felt, I came away from this book with same feeling as Orleana Price, the wife of Baptist missionary Nathan Price who drags his family to the Congo on the eve of the country's independence from Belgian rule: I was haunted by the Congo's beauty, moved by its spirituality and enamored of its people.The story is told by the four daughters of Nathan Price. There is the oldest, Rachel, a shallow teeny bopper who is sixteen going on twenty-five and speaks in commercial lingo and hilarious malapropisms that were a little too hilarious for my taste. There is Ruth, a precocious five-year-old who often misunderstands things with great clarity. Finally are the genius twins, Leah, a tomboy who identifies most with Dad the pulpit-pounder and Adah, who suffers from the crippling effects of being nearly smoothered by her twin sister in the womb. Adah is bit like Vladamir Nabakov reincarnated as a 13-year old girl. She is brilliant, dark and reads backwards and forwards. Great stuff.But, to be honest, I felt the book was a bit cartoonish at times. Nathan Price is absent for most of the book, off doing God's work, returning only to commit one more outrageous and contrived faux paus or slap a daughter for disrespect. Kingsolver makes no real attempt to understand him or explain what would make a man endanger the welfare of his family by nearly starving them to death in the middle of Africa with no money and support. She mentions a traumatic event in the war, but I was not convinced.The book also, at times, had a PERILS OF PAULINE feel to it as I read with one eye, not wanting to be told of yet another horror of the Congo being visited upon the girls.But no book is perfect. At least no book worth reading. And this book gives you at least double your money's worth.The West, American included, has done unspeakable things in the Congo, as this book makes abundantly clear. That can never be changed and no book can begin to wash away all that blood and suffering and injustice. But a book, a very special book, can serve in its own small way as a kind of truth and reconcilliation committee. This is such a book and Kingsolver has earned my deepest respect for writing it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book is a moving and beautiful tapestry of words. I finished it a month or so ago, but Kingsolver's imagery remains in my mind. The problem I have, however, is the portrayal of Nathan Price. The women of the book are so multifaceted, and poor Nathan is a one-dimentional \\"Bible Thumper.\\" Kingsolver shows her lack of familiarity with Baptist thought and practice (Nathan Price is a Baptist missionary) again and again. No Baptist minister would constantly quote non-canonical books as though they were scripture, for example. If he did, he wouldn't be Baptist for long. There are many other problems like this. While trivial, they made me question other things the writer asserts. I also confess to being a bit tired of \\"missionary-as-evil-bigot\\" themes. Most missionaries are hard-working, loving people who give up much in order to serve others. That said, I still enjoyed the book for its rich imagery of Africa (sights, sounds, smells and all) and its vivid character development."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I enjoyed the reading of this book so much, and also the feeling it gave that now I could understand more about the people of Congo. How the book made the peple there more real and how recent happenings in Congo suddenly made sense.I also enjoy the way Kingsolver manage to make 6 very different people come alive trough this story and how she manage to let each of them help forward the story and at the same time give faces to different ways we humans handle hardship and challenges. The technique of allowing each of the five women to have chapters of their own was wonderful, especially since the father, who as the driving force of the family and whom made them all go there, had no voice at all! I agree with the reviewer that said it was like he was the eye of the hurricane: full of his empty promises, with zero understanding of the situation around him and his all-consuming, petty inability to be anything other than such a self sentered and diapointing person.I loved Kingsolver's discussion of local languages and how she played with words and sentences: evil live. devil lived.Not only have I a feeling of having enjoyed myself and laughed and felt for the people of Congo and the american family, but I also meet Elie, my old teacher of Christianity trough this pages. I remember vividly her showing us photoes of her as a missionair (as was both her brothers) bringing the white mans god into darkest Africa, as she put it. Suddenly I could remember the photoes she used to send around in class of X-mas dinners, where only those who went regulary to church could enjoy the heaps of food. I also remember her talk about her dear chocolate children, and the photoes of them with their big unhealthy bellys. But my strongest memmory is the smiles of the same people and the happiness they often radiated. So unlike Elie.A lot of reviewers of this book has split into two camps. The ones who feel this is a angry attack on christianity and those who like the book whatsoever.I have one message to those of you who trash this book as an attack on christianity because it tells a story about such a egosentric and miserable missonair as Nathan. If you see this as an attack on your religion, you obviosly do not accept that anyone who calls themself christian can be a bad person. That is very interesting in itself.I am really impressed with this book, which is my first experience with Kingsolver. I advice all readers (whatever belief) to read the book yourself and to enjoy Kingsolvers great storytelling. She is a great writer and this is a great book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I started this book understanding the basics of its story. But I sure did not expect that I would get drawn in so quickly. The pitiful Orleanna and arrogant Nathan Price and thier four daughters took me on an amazing adventure into the Congo and I really appreciated the trip.Then, once I really cared about what happened to these people, I had to wade through the preaching about Africa's woes and I got a bit put off. While I was very interested in the story she was revealing about the history of the Congo, I remember thinking, \\"Gosh, she's almost as dogmatic as Nathan Price!\\"Forinstance, Kingsolver's deliberate attempt to make Rachel into an \\"ugly american\\" stereotype, made me uncomfortable. It seemed artificial and unfair because I can't imagine what might have happened to ANY 16-year-old girl ripped as she was from all that she knew and dumped into a completely alien land without pity or preparation.But, gosh, Ms. Kingsolver sure can write! The scene in the yard after the snake left the chicken house (don't want to give anything away!)was just amazing. Ms. Kingsolver writes of mothers and children with huge power. Clearly, however, this is a woman's book. Men aren't going to love this book. That's not a bad thing. It just is."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver uses one of my favorite fictional conventions--the shifting viewpoints of different characters throughout time--to tell this tale of a missionary family in a futile setting. It is fascinating to watch the different characters change and develop-or in one case, to not change- as they struggle with a dogmatic father who fails to see that his mission in the Belgian Congo can not be realized in the way he would hope.As the family struggles with the political and tropical climate,the characters narrate throughout their lifetime how they see each other and their parents. These women are so well developed, that after a few chapters, one can tell who is speaking without reading the chapter heading.Although I become frustrated that so many novels portray members of the clergy in such a poor light, it is probably a reality that many do struggle with the balance between their beliefs and those of the people they are trying to convert. However, to tell this story in this way, and to see how the daughters dealt with such a man as father and how that affected their outlooks on life, he had to be this kind of preacher.Interspersed with the story is the background of the struggle for independence in the Belgian Congo. This is an engrossing way to familiarize oneself with the history of the fight for freedom that occurs with frequency on the African continent."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"An excellent study of a patriarch and his family as strangers in a strange land. If you know little of Africa in the early sixties, I highly recommend you read this novel. It's not a historical book, but it sheds light on a part of the world that we Americans don't spend enough time thinking about. I thought the narrative was excellent, particularly the character of Adah. She's one of the finest literary creations in a long time. As a whole, the novel doesn't let down although personally I wish the author would've either pared down the rush to cover almost 30 years' history towards the end or elaborated a little more thoroughly (especially in regards to Nathan). But don't let that stop you from experiencing a great American novel. It lingers on in your memory long after you've put it down."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I loved this book. The language is captivating and spellbinding. I am aquainted with the history of the Congo and was there many times. Kingsolver manages to weave a GOOD story within a historical and nature context that is real and true-she managed beautifully to bring the Congo back vividly. The harm and uselessness of missionary work ,where missioners are not sensitive to the 'godsence' of the local people, is sadly brought to focus.The reader experiences the heartache and pain of a wife who has to cope against all odds in a harsh country -for 'The Power, the Kingdom and the Glory' It left me with a sence of sadness for what was done on this beautiful continent by well meaning governments ,who became involved with the plea of Africa, merely for monetary gain. Against this back ground, she weaves the strenght's' and weakness's of her charachters in a credible and acceptable way. I recommend this book as a'MUST READ'"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I've been reading Ms. Kingsolver for years now but this book convinces me that she's writing on a whole new level. I loved the narrative structure: chapters written in first person from the point of view of a different daughter. Each daughter is well drawn and very different from the other three. I could not put this book down and stayed up late two nights in a row to finish it. I wish they had more than 5 stars that I could give!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I had a hard time getting into this book because the style was a cut away from the Barbara Kingsolver that I've grown to love.

I have anxiously awaited every subsequent book and have never been dissappointed yet. Poisonwood Bible was very different from her other works. Aside from the political commentaries that punctuate all her writings, I did not hear the Kingsolver that I have admired for so long now. The writing itself was poetic, characters well developed and the story an incredibly moving and heartwrenching work of art. But .... I have to say I missed her wit that really set her apart from so many modern women writers. I still laugh when I think of Sal Monelli at the salsa plant in B.T. Maybe the freshness or spontaneity was missing. After all, my expectations of Ms Kingsolver are higher than any other author I have read. I really enjoyed Poisonwood Bible and have lent my copy many times over. I just wish some of the magic of Bean Trees and of her shorts in Homeland had been here too. If you happen to read this Ms Kingsolver, no pressure, I will always be one of your most admiring fans."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"For me this was surely one of the finest works of fiction I have ever read. In every great work of art, be it music, painting, sculpture, architecture etc., flaws can always be discovered, but a masterpiece overwhelms its flaws and communicates so vividly that the receiver feels changed, challenged, and enriched. For me this work is a MASTERPIECE of human insight and conscience; a thought-provoking and beautifully crafted work of art. My nomination for every literary prize for fiction in 1998 goes to the Poisonwood Bible. ....The astounding portrayal of a woman's plight in the world. My heart ached in ways I cannot describe for the women in the book and for every woman because we each know these experiences to one degree or another."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Certainly one of Barbara Kingsolver's very best. This is a well written novel which not only provides us with an insightful look at US-Africa policy in the 60's and later but presents us with extraordinary characters with whom we become personally attached. This was a thoroughly enjoyable novel which once started I couldn't put down."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I had it all wrong, the way I thought and what I believed that I knew about Africa and its people. I guess that I had pretty much accepted the &quot;party-line&quot; about the history and morality of its people. Maybe all that Kingsolver says about Africa can't be believed either, but I will forever look at what I hear and read now with entirely different ears and eyes. The book is beautifully written. I felt that I was living there in their times with all five of the writers. I do think that it took awhile to become involved in the book, but once there, it was almost impossible to put down. I thought that the book was wonderful and would recommend it highly."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver just gets better and better.

Having been to Africa, I connected with Barbara Kingsolver's storyline.Editor of Michele Cozzens' award winning women's fiction A Line Between Friends"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Every day I could not wait until I could sit down and get back into this book. I loved the unique characters and the way you were able to hear all their voices. And to grow with them and see where their individual reactions to their bizarre Congo upbringing took them. Do yourself a huge favor and read this book!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"A great great story with deep personal characters, humor and truth. A must read."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Since there are several very apt descriptions, I'll forego that here. But to summarize, this book is an intriguing look into the lives of the wife and four daughters of a fascist preacher intent on converting the Congolese people to his form of religion. As though reading a continuing journal, each of the five women tells their own story of the trials and tribulations they were forced to endure during their time in the Congo.Interwoven with historical facts, vivid descriptions of the people and places, this is a wonderful book. Barbara Kingsolver is a fantastic storyteller, and I recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The poisonwood Bible is an interesting novel by Barbara Kingsolver, born on April 8, 1955, in Annapolis, Maryland, which is set in the Congolese jungle in the 1950's and 60's. As the story goes, a Baptist preacher named Nathan Price travels to Africa on a mission to save Congolese souls, taking his wife and four kids with him, but things don't work out as well as Nathan planned.The story is told through the eyes of the four daughters (Ruth May, Adah, Leah and Rachel) and their mother (Orleanna), but mostly through the four daughters. Each daughter has her own fully developed personality and the level at which Barbara Kingsolver makes them unique and so seemingly humanly real is amazing, which proves that Kingsolver is skilled at writing stories such as these. The writing style is not only unique, but it's good too - it flows well.The storyline rarely gets boring, either. It can a bit, considering its length, but not often. All the events are wonderfully connected and seem to flow very well. All the messages and morals (and believe me, there are a good amount of them in this book) all come together and really mean something as far as the book goes.The book is mostly a serious one, being dramatic from time to time, but it has plenty of it's own humorous moments (and you'll find some of the characters make what's going on pretty much amusing most of the time they're there), and this balances out nicely in the book.Overall, the book is pretty well-written, and pretty interesting, if nothing else. I think everybody should at least check such a book out.Josh, 14, KY"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is a good book to read in an afternoon or two. I felt as if I were visiting the Congo. I liked the way Kingsolver changed points of view and voice between characters. With all the hype, I was pleasantly surprised to find an easy read."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I really have been out of touch with reading for a long time. Thanks to Oprah for getting me back into it. I read Poisonwood Bible last summer. I could not put it down. I thought 'till the end that it was a true story. Barbara is a fantastic writer. It was all so real to me that I could almost smell the Congo. I could feel the heat of the Congo & almost feel the pain of starvation the village struggled with. I cried at the end when the youngest was bitten by the snake. I mean that I cried like she was my own child. I don't even have kids. Now, I can not wait to read another of Barbara's books. I have since been picking up any thing to do with Africa. Everyone should read this book"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I picked up this book after deciding it was time to read something different for a change. The Congo, eh? I didn't know much about the Congo and the many years of tumultous war...I figured I'd learn something. I searched for titles that Oprah had specifically recommended (for I've had success there before), and fell upon The Poisonwood Bible. The first Kingsolver book I've read.Well! In addition to a history lesson, I experienced the unfolding of a story I won't soon be forgetting, if I ever do. Each character had such a distinctive voice! The inside jacket mentioned a five year old...I wondered how the author would pull that one off...how does a five year old talk in depth about anything? But I was not disappointed in little Ruth May. I wasn't disappointed in any of them. The characterizations brought each of them fully into my mind's eye. What a fantastic story.This story touched me in ways I will never be able to put into words. I found myself wanting to experience Africa too, to see how it would shift beneath *my* feet...how it would change me. Would I be willing to sacrifice whatever Africa demanded of *me*?And wow, the last chapter. Brought me to tears.Just really powerful stuff.Do yourself a favor: Buy it. Read it. Experience it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I loved this book. The story was told from the perspective of each of the female characters. As a result, the reader gets a sense of the emotional impact of every event on the characters. You are able to see how each one of these women evolved into very unique individuals because of the madness of their environment. The story unfolds as a family of six travel to Africa as missionaries. The father seems to have only a delicate grasp on his sanity in the beginning and steadily loses it as time goes on."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Since this was an assigned book for school, I picked up this book with great trepidation. (Most of the books our school assigns are rather boring.) This book definitely broke the mold. This well-crafted story of Nathan Price, his dynamic daughters and submissive wife is entertaining as fascinating. The book was the longest book I have ever read, but the pages never stopped turning and I honestly had a hard time putting it down at night. Each character is exquisitely developed throughout the novel. The plot is unpredictable and memorable. You will hate some characters and fall in love with others. This tale of love, racism, politics, imperialism, abuse, and womanhood should be read by all those who enjoy a blend of genuine history and tantalizing fantasy."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver has written this excellent book in such an interesting fashion it is as if she had first-hand experience. Her format in presenting the story through the narration of the mother and four daughters works extremely well.Imagine, if you can, moving from Atlanta, Georgia to a tiny village in Africa. Forget about having the convenience of a basic grocery store, local medical aid, radio, running water, electricity, etc. How do you survive?Relocating in the Belgian Congo, a Georgia missionary and his family are barely able to eke out minimal survival. Having enough to eat is at times a critical problem. Life and death become daily concerns and the family of six is eventually reduced to a group of five. Living in poverty, much as the village inhabitants of Kilanga, the Southern Baptist father's goal of baptizing local children is found to be a far greater challenge than was anticipated.Evangelism is not an accepted mission by most of the local villagers, making this family's purpose and mere existence in Africa a continual struggle. The father, however, is not about to give up.Compounding the family's struggle is that the year is 1959 and the Congo is in the midst of great political turmoil.The four children, all girls, and three are teen-agers, meet the challenges of adaptation and acceptance in their own individual ways. Kingsolver's narrative technique provides an excellent format for each of the girls, as well as the mother, to relate their experiences in their own words. We readers get right into the minds of these individuals and feel their struggle to survive.The continued life-long suffering and guilt experienced by the mother for her once deprived children leaves an ache in any parent's heart. Some things a person just doesn't get over."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is not a book one can read in a day (atleast for most readers).

Her book The Poisonwood Bible, is like a bible to me. I was once a beggar on the streets of Chicago, when a kind man let me read this book. From that day forward I have been a changed man. This compelling story has touched my soul in a way nothing else has ever been able to do. It is a heartwarming novel that should be read by everyone in Chicago - especially you!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I COMMENCED READING THIS BOOK NOT BEING FAMILIAR WITH THE AUTHOR. WHAT A PLEASANT SURPRISE IT WAS TO ENCOUNTER A STORY THAT WAS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM ITS COUNTERPARTS!!THE STORY CENTERS AROUND THE PRICE FAMILY WHO ARE TAKEN TO THE BELGIUM CONGO IN THE 1950's BY THEIR BAPTIST FATHER ON A MISSION. WELL IT TURNS OUT TO BE MORE THAN A RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE FOR MOST MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY, ESPECIALLY AS SOME CONSIDER A BETTY CROCKER CAKE MIX AN ESSENTIAL ITEM TO TAKE WITH THEM!ONE OF THE UNUSUAL ASPECTS OF THIS STORY IS THAT IT IS TOLD BY THE MOTHER AND HER FOUR DAUGHTERS IN ALTERNATIVE CHAPTERS. IT SEEMS VERY ONE SIDED NARRATIVE AT FIRST (AS REV. PRICE ISN'T INCLUDED AS ONE OF THE NARRATORS) HOWEVER, AS YOU DELVE FURTHER INTO THE STORY IT ALMOST SEEMS UNNECESSARY DUE TO THE VARIOUS VIEWPOINTS OF THE OTHER FIVE CHARACTERS. IT ALSO LEAVES THE READER WITH LOTS TO PONDER AND ROOM TO FORM YOUR OWN OPINION ( WHICH NOT MANY NOVELS ALLOW FOR).THE CHARACTERS BELIEFS AND EXPECTATIONS ARE CHALLENGED IN THEIR NEW SURROUNDINGS OF THE CONGO AND ITS PEOPLE.

The story was well written and captivating. However, it was impossible to ignore that Kingsolver is very much an anti-capitalist. She deplores the capitalist system in the US. Therefore, it would be highly insulting to this talented writer for her readers to PURCHASE her books and therefore increase her royalties. Rather than purchase the book new, buy a USED copy or check it out from your local library. That way, you can enjoy the story, without the author becoming soiled by monies from the dirty, capitalist system which she does so despise.Additionally, you should be aware that this author is the same woman who in the 15-October edition of the LA Times was extremely critical of the US/UK efforts in Afghanistan."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Without exception the most heartfelt fiction of supreme craftsmenship I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I'll admit, I did not really expect to enjoy this book, but much to my surprise I loved it! I enjoyed hearing the girls different interpretations of what they were experiencing. I think it gave me a better understanding of what was really happening. I also find this book really interesting because not only is it a story of an American family trying to survive in the Congo, but it also describes the politics that were governing the Congo. I think that by the end of the book I had a better understanding of how some places are intrinsically different. Neither the government nor the religion of the USA is necessarily the best solution for other countries, even if it works great in the US. The geographical and climatic differences make it impossible for their cultures to ever be similar. Overall, this book was wonderfully crafted to show life in the Congo."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I truly enjoyed this book! I was lost for days and had to consciously pull myself back to reality after a reading session. The book was informative, educational and a wonderful story. Thank you Barabar Kinsolver."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Kingsolver is marvelous narrativist. She writes with humor. She does well inside the heads of her four female characters. Maybe she knows wherein her talents lie and where they fail. She had a marvelous tragic hero here, but she only painted him from the view of his childish daughters. Even more from inside the wife's head would have given us a better aspect of the story she only hints at. All her male characters are pretty plastic. Would that we had a really great story about the impact of this misguided missionary on the cultures he seeks to impose his Jesusite politics on. As it is, it's like seeing the story through the wrong end of the telescope."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book is in a class by itself - The story which pulls you in from the first chapter and shows you the irony of religion within the small minded gives you Africa and the lives of these people who you know in such personal ways.

Barbara Kingsolver has a true gift that few writers possess - READ THIS BOOK - it will become the one you recommend to any and everybody."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is a fabulous women's book - it is a must read!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"What could I add to the praise already given to the Poisonwood Bible by all of the other reviewers?

Her use of storytelling through the voice of several separate characters is the most successful employment of the technique since Faulkner's As I Lay Dying. Everything comes together perfectly in this novel: a powerful prose style, marvelous character development, and a captivating plot.

The first of it this book I found boring but as my sister encouraged me to continue reading I did. She was right, it does get better. At first I could care less about the characters and their whining about the horrible life they had in the Congo. Now about half way into the book (maybe a little less) it has become a page turner and I can't wait to find out how it ends. Sorry to write this when I haven't even finished the book but anyone interested in this book I encourage to read it and don't give up with the boring begininng, it gets much better almost out of no where."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"i remember one of the few tricks from college english that still sticks with me to this day. never fully believe any narrator. this story is wonderful because it challenges you to grasp these separate stories and decide for yourself what is true and what's colored by their unique traits and shortcomings. even leah's voice, so infused with passion and truth, eventually succumbs to its own traps. i loved the metamorphosis of adah's language as time passes, from something strangely unique and tortured to something slightly more homogoneous yet slyly revealing.the pacing of this book is good, except for the last 50 pages. the &quot;summary&quot; chapters seem a tiny bit forced--there's no need to try and wrap this up neatly--or as neatly as most people would like.anyway this was a great book!!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver has written this excellent book in such an interesting fashion it is as if she had first-hand experience.

I didn't think I'd like this book, and yet it became one of my favorites!The changing points of view are refreshing, the characters are so very real, and the writing is beautiful. The political lesson is fine by me - in fact, right after I finished this book the movie &quot;Lumumba&quot; premiered on HBO. However, the politics aren't until the very end - when you're already involved with the characters - so they fit in the flow.I kept shaking my head and rolling my eyes at the arrogance, even ignorance, of Rev. Price in the beginning. The story could have taken place here - Guam was ruled by Spanish missionaries for three hundred years, until the Spanish American War. Being anti-missionary is in my blood - so the story of this family and their ultimate failure to tame Africa is especially meaningful to me."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver's Poisionwood Bible is one of the most well written books I have ever read. It is painfully honest and Kingsolver uses such vivd words and descriptions that it is hard not to be sucked in to the jungle Belgian Congo world of the Price family. Another reason I found this book to be so enjoyable were the colorful and realistic characters, the slightly crazy preacher, the daughters and their different views of the situation, and the wife. It is intersting to hear the same story from all of the characters points of view, it makes the story easier to relate to and more believable."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Anyone who is skeptical about organized religion will enjoy this book. I had no interest really in reading about missionaries in Africa and didn't think this book was for me, but one of my friends recommended it. The story has been eye-opening for me. The women in the book are very well-developed. It reminds me that women in the 50's weren't necessarily encouraged to go to college and were second-class citizens. Really makes me mad!!I truly enjoyed this book!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"From the recent reviews, it is clear that this book is not for everyone. I nearly put it down on page three. There are many weaknesses in the writing style and the characterization. Apparently the historical and religious accuracy is also suspect. So why the 5 stars? For me this book succeeds on three essential levels: the prose is excellent, the story is engaging, and the first-person perspectives are full of insight. In many places the prose is glorious. I found myself re-reading sections just for the joy of the words. Sure, the voice of Rachel is annoying (shades of Adrian Mole?), but Leah and Orleanna have line after line of first-rate prose. Second, this novel delivers two great stories, beautifully woven together. The story of Leah and Anatole is in many ways more interesting that of the central tale of the perils of the family in the jungle. Finally, how many books deliver so many wonderful perspectives? To see through the eyes of a white woman that curses her lack of blackness, through the eyes of a mother that has lost a young daughter, a rehabilitated cripple that misses the &quot;perfection&quot; of her disabilities, a wife with a husband in a brutal prison,...and so on. I would have liked to have had a chapter or two through the eyes of Nathan Price. For him we are left to piece together the nature of his torments from third-person fragments. Overall, I enjoyed this book better than any book since &quot;Trainspotting.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Clearly this is Barbara Kingsolver's most difficult and ambitious work... departing from the light heartedness, amusing narrators in the Bean Trees and Pigs in Heaven. The five women who narrate the story are captivating... and i thank Kingsolver for exposing her politics... it seems to me that most American readers do not want to have to face politics in &quot;pleasure&quot; writing, as ignorance is bliss. :-) She gave me an amazing history lesson about Zaire, and the U.S.'s fear of socialist economic systems. This is a fine work, despite the minor problems with its length, etc. Definatly worth reading, and serves as a much needed wake up call to us Americans, who are all too comfortable in our capitalist revery, unaware of what it costs the rest of the world."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Both times I read this book, I cried, and had the most vivid dreams. God bless you, Ms. Kingsolver.

I endearingly beseech of you to write more, more, more."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is the heart-breaking story of an overly zealous, misguided missionary who sincerely felt he was doing the Lord's work in the Congo. He put his entire family at risk while he tried to jam what he felt was the Lord's will for these people down their throats. This tale is also political in that it shows, in no uncertain terms, the negative role the United States played just when the Congolese were attempting to achieve independence from Belgium. Shame on us for thinking we're the saviour of the world, and thanks to Barbara Kingsolver for her courage in the writing of this book! The most dramatic and heart-rending moment for me was when the youngest daughter was bitten by the deadly mamba snake (probably the deadliest snake in the world), and died very soon afterwards. The missionary father eventually descends into a world of madness, and the mother and remaining daughters leave for the states. It is a story that is still with me, months after having read it. Not for the Danielle Steel crowd, but definitely for those who appreciate fine literature."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"A totally fascinating read and I haven't even finished it! Having travelled in Africa shortly after they attained their independence, I have never forgotten the magic of the place which may very well stem from the fact that it is so very primitive and such a stark contrast to our modern world. I never cease to be amazed that there are people who will devote their lives to trying to bring the natives of this amazing country into the 21st century. Their stark poverty and chronic starvation seem to be beyond all efforts to help them. I feel sorry for this family who is at the mercy of their zealot father. How dare he submit them to the dangers and poverty of living in the Congo. How selfish of him to inflict his passions on his helpless children. Hopefully, as I read on, there will be some justification. I am thoroughly enjoying the characters--they are diverse and unique and, tho somewhat precocious for children, I don't find them unbelievable. Children are a lot smarter than most of us adults give them credit for being. I did have a problem with some of the technical weaknesses--they seem to be totally unprepared for the living conditions in which they find themselves. Didn't either of the adults think to ask before they left the States what awaited them where they were going? Did Orleanna really think there would be a modern kitchen with a refrigerator and an oven and electricity?It is still a totally engrossing read and I can't wait to get back to it--"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Certain images still haunt me even though I read the book many months ago.

It is part psychological and part political. I am very impressed with the author's ability to speak in the language of a poorly educated teenager, then in the voice of her brilliant younger sister who reads backwards and forewards, and who thinks in poetry and palindromes; and then write in the voice of a five year old child. Barbara Kingsolver, herself, must be brilliant! I learned a great deal about the Belgian Congo -- now Zaire, including anti-American viewpoints. I really recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I read the book cover to cover waiting for it to get off the ground. Barbara has some worthwhile things to say on philosophy, politics, religion, economics, and culture. Unfortunately, she rambles on and on in first person accounts from four females. She could accomplish her literary objectives with half as many words."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I found the first half of &quot;Poisonwood Bible&quot; absorbing. For a zealous husband to lead his wife and family into a totally different culture and to be so ill equipped and unprepared was absorbing. All 4 daughters were 3 dimensional as well as the mother. It would have been nice to hear what went on inside Nathan's head as well. But I really couldn't sympathize with any of the sisters. They were all so different: running from the total devotion Leah had towards her father to Rachel's selfishness and Ada's cynicism. A large portion of the novel is dedicated to Kingsolver's personal political views of the Belgian Congo."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"&lt;&lt;The Poisonwood Bible&gt;&gt; is meticulously researched, comprehensive, and a long overdue investigation into the fate of colonial and post-colonial Africa still so unfairly criticized for its allege primitive and violent acts commonly presented by the media without mentioning the role played by greedy Europe and America. Barbara Kingsolver provides readers with a full picture of how superpowers have managed to exploit, corrupt, and destabilize the already fragile sociopolitical situation of Zaire (presently renamed Congo) in search of its identity after two centuries of harsh European colonialism and cultural confusion. Barbara Kingsolver gives examples taken directly from American Newspapers as published in the sixties in order to illustrate how American citizens were badly informed and even manipulated by incomplete information. This needed to be said, and I admire Barbara Kingsolver for opening the readers' eyes as to how reality can be slanted by partial truths that dangerously pave the way to unfair stereotypes and prejudices.Throughout the novel, Barbara Kingsolver provides us with an introspective and feminine narration, empowering the female voices that portray Zaire's chaotic struggle for political and economic independence while the same women are struggling for their own survival and independence. I loved this parallelism. While reports on historical facts are traditionally reconstructed by &quot;know-it-all men&quot; who describe historical events as if detached from personal lives, Barbara Kingsolver uses the voice of five women (a mother and her four daughters) to reintegrate History into people's lives. To illustrate the replacement of traditional literary male canons with a more holistic feminine narration, Barbara Kingsolver had the wonderful idea of depicting a missionary father who claims to be in charge and in control of the Word, but who is symbolically denied any narrative voice in the novel... The father only becomes the passive object talked about in the mother's and daughters' respective diaries. Beautiful!...Barbara Kingsolver's unique artistic style managed to have sociopolitical events intertwine with introspective reflections on the fate of women. Like exploited Africans, women have suffered a long history of enslavement by ruthless masters/husbands. As in the case of enslaved Africans, women's bodies and spirits have been mutilated. Like Africans, women have learned how to express cultural resistance to abusive WASP men who take for granted dichotomies such as the superiority of men, and the inferiority of who is not; the superiority of whites, and the inferiority of who is not; the superiority of fundamentalist protestant sects, and the inferiority of other spiritual philosophies. In short, Barbara Kingsolver dares discussing the errors and sins of righteous men: &lt;&lt;You have nothing to lose but your chains &gt;&gt; she says (p. 495).I especially appreciated Barbara Kingsolver's work on linguistic ambiguities created by homonymic, polysemic, and phonetic issues that the missionary father failed to grasp for lack of an open-mind. He actually remained trapped in his one track-mind where words could only have one meaning, which eventually cost him his life: &lt;&lt;His punishment is the Word, and his deficiencies are failures of words&gt;&gt; (p. 213). For the sole reason of making his sermons more powerful the Reverend decided to learn Kikongo, a local language, naively thinking that language learning is only a matter of word-for-word translation. In his inability to take any criticism as to how to adjust intonation, he turned his own sermons into ridiculous stories. For instance &quot;Batiza&quot; can be pronounced two ways, meaning either &quot;baptism&quot; or &quot;to terrify.&quot; The word &quot;bantika&quot; means &quot;to kill&quot; when pronounced correctly, but in the case of David's and Goliath's story, the Reverend pronounced &quot;bantika&quot; in such a way that David ended up deflowering Goliath's virginity. &quot;Father in Heaven&quot; became &quot;Father of Fish Bait.&quot; Least but not last, every sermon closed with the phrase &lt;&lt;Tata Jesus is B&auml;ngala&gt;&gt; which led the local population to believe that Christianity was definitely strange: &lt;&lt;&quot;B&auml;ngala&quot; means something precious and dear. But the way he pronounces it, it means the poisonwood tree. Praise the Lord, halleluia, my friends! For Jesus will make you itch like nobody's business.&gt;&gt; (p. 276).Barbara Kingsolver uses these live examples of miscommunication to make us reflect about historical mistranslations that today's Bibles may be full of: &lt;&lt;God's Word was brought to you by a crew of romantic idealists in a harsh desert culture eons ago, followed by a chain of translators two thousand years long&gt;&gt; (p. 247). The reader is invited to wonder about all the translations and mistranslations of earlier translations and mistranslations: &lt;&lt;... did you think God wrote it all down in the English of King James himself?&gt;&gt; (p. (247) asks a Catholic priest who visited the Reverend's family and who ended up being chased away from the Baptist Reverend's home for the unforgivable sin of being a &quot;Catholic Papist.&quot; Indeed, the Baptist Reverend stood categorically against the Catholic Priest's attempt to explain that even the Bible contains animist messages agreeing with local animist traditions that advocate respecting the soul of everyone, of everything, of every act and of every event that surround each and every one of us.Besides making fun of the father's language mistakes that his arrogance could not see, Barbara Kingsolver plays with the children's refreshing ability to create neologies. Among various examples, &quot;Amnesty International&quot; becomes &quot;Damnistry International&quot;; &quot;circumcision&quot; becomes &quot;circus Mission&quot;; the opposite of polygamy becomes &quot;Monotony&quot;; &quot;Episcopalians&quot; becomes &quot;Episcopotaniams&quot;... in short, language creations that make the readers laugh even during the most intense episodes of the novel. These plays on words are an absolute delight!To conclude this review (that I did not plan to be so long), Barbara Kingsolver's &lt;&lt;Poisonwood Bible&gt;&gt; is a Work of Art that deserves five stars. I would even give it six stars for its unique and extraordinary debates on the meaning of life, for its fascinating discussions about the impact of History on personal stories, and for its deep reflections digging out the ignorance and stupidity contained in partial truths, stereotypes, prejudices, absolute values and close-mindedness. I very highly recommend the reading of this extraordinary novel."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Just finished this book and I loved it. I am not usually one to read books for a second time but will probably have to read this again. I found Barbara Kingsolver years ago and loved her but haven't read any of her books for a long time. So happy to have found her again. Would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"the poisonwood bible was very well written and gives a fairly modern view of the history of the congo region.i thoroughly enjoyed this book"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I read this book over a decade ago and I loved it. It has been one of those books that has stuck with me all these years. I just purchased it for my Kindle and am looking forward to re-reading it. Definitely recommend!!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"There is a reason this book won a few awards. It is well written and thought provoking. Written from several perspectives, we view the Congo, its transformation and its impact on the lives of one family who go their as missionaries - the parents voluntarily - the children without choice. The narrators each tell the same story from vastly different perspectives. Each is dragged off to the Congo on a missionarry mission by the head of the family - a husband and father - who is obsessed with bringing Christianity to the heathens in the Congo. Woven into this story is the history of a country whose oppression by its white leaders leads to the downfall of this family as well as the country. The pastor imposes his values on his family and attempts to impose them on the village they are sent to as missionaries with disasterous results. The story follows each of the female members of the family on this journey and the reader sees the impact on each of their lives.Thought provoking and filled with the back story of the Congo. Couldn't put it down. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes historical fiction with an environmental twist."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Beautifully written. Kingsolver expertly draws the reader into the experience of each family member as she copes with a tumultuous time in history (Congo in the 1960s), a drastic and unanticipated lifestyle change, and a tyrannical father haunted by his past. At times hilarious. I can't recommend it enough."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Got this for my Kindle on a recommendation from a friend, was not disappointed! I could not put this book down, ended up loving it way more than I expected! This is a story about a stubborn religious father who brings his family to Africa for a mission and refuses to leave, even in the midst of some horrible circumstances. The narration is divided between the four daughters who are dragged to Africa and their mom. Each character has a unique voice and personality and the story kept me interested the whole time. I would recommend this book to anyone!!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is the 3rd time I've read this incredible book. Her insight into human emotions, regardless of our culture or background or education, is so interesting. I laughed and cried throughout the book as it gave such hope that people can rise up from their situation or background, but also, insight into how we get sucked into these things in the first place. I've read all of Barbara Kingsolver's books, and this one I still think is the best."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Ms. Kingsolver touches upon so many important topics in this one compelling book. A Southern conservative baptist minister takes his wife and 4 young girls on a missionary tour into the depths of the jungle in what was the Belgian Congo just as the Belgians were ready to give the Congo it's independence. The story evolves around their experiences in this small village, but also explains what was going on politically. The mother and the 4 girls, the youngest eventually dies from a snake bite, suffer greatly, much of it as a result of the fathers erratic behavior and his inability to understand and accept the traditions and beliefs of the village. After two years, the mother and 3 girls manage to escape the Congo and try to find peace within themselves."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The characters are well developed and the story has great humor (black humor). One of my favorite reads! Listening to it in audio is a delight. The narrator is highly skilled."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"One of the best books I have read, After living in africa I could understand where the story came from."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The narrative scope of this novel is amazing. Between the conflict of the Price family against the revolution in the Congo, it is a work of art. The lush descriptions and points of view were refreshing."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is a very thought-provoking and intense novel. I highly recommend it. I was a bit disappointed in the quality of the condition of this softcover volume I purchased as it was not in the condition described. It also took over 3 weeks to get here. It is a good thing my book club decided to postpone our meeting this month!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"clearly, another review of this book is not needed. Just wanted to add my 2 cents that I think this book is absolutely brilliant. Barbara Kingsolver's genius shines in this novel."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I agree with all the reviews saying the second half of the book is preachy, and there may or may not be historical distortion, but it was *nevertheless* the most enthralling book I've read in a long, long time. In fact I can't even remember the last time I missed so many bus stops for being engrossed in a book. It's the kind of story that stays with you."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"One of my all time favorite books. Great characters. I keep an extra copy just to lend out."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible is one of those books that I have wanted to read for a long time. I finally had the opportunity to listen to the audio version, narrated by Dean Robertson and was very pleased.For those of you who are not familiar with this novel, The Poisonwood Bible is the story of fanatical Baptist missionary, Nathan Price, who moves his wife Orleanna, and their 4 daughters to the Belgian Congo from Bethlehem, Georgia in 1959. The Reverend Price was hoping to bring Christianity to the people in the village of Kilanga, at a time when the people of that village were struggling to survive and to remain free from Belgium.The family arrives in the Congo without a clue as to what they were in for. The bring seeds to plant, but the soil is so poor, seeds will not grow. There is no plumbing or electricity and disease is prevalent everywhere it seems. The Reverend tries to get the people to come to the river to be baptised, but no one is interested in finding God by bathing in waters where crocodiles live. While the goal of Nathan Price was to transform the the lives of the Congolese people by bringing God into their lives, what really happens is that the lives of this family is transformed bit by bit, by what life was really like for them in the Congo.The story is told in alternating voices of Oleanna and his daughters, and covers a period of about 30 years. The story hooks the reader immediately as each of the characters share realistic views of what they were experiencing along the way. Nathan Price is the only major character who does not have a voice in this novel, and yet in some ways I felt I got to know him the best through the eyes of his wife and daughters. He was an extremely arrogant and unlikeable man who put his entire family at risk. He was degrading to women, and I can't think of one positive thing to say about him. I think the fact he had no voice made this story all the more poignant.The Poisonwood Bible is a story you really need to read for yourself. It's touching, compelling and insightful. The author did an amazing job depicting the political climate at that time. It's a story about religious beliefs, a story of the disintegration of a family, and a story about forgiveness. It is a story that makes you think, and a story that makes you question the actions our government sometimes takes, which really is not always in the best interest of the people. I truly had sympathy for this family, especially as the years pass and each of the girls tries to find their place in the world. I loved the first half of this book, but felt that the second half got a little bogged down at times. Despite this, I highly recommend this book.Rating 4.5/5"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"When I first read this book several years ago, Kingsolver's narration sparked in me a desire to travel to Africa. Having now traveled there twice (one five-month stay in Ghana and another in Niger) and re-read the book after these travels, I have to say that Kingsolver has depicted the beauty, quirkiness, hardship, and overall \\"essence\\" of Africa (or what I know of it) in the most poetic and accurate words that I have come across. I was throughly engrossed from the first page to the last by the characters and plot, which in my opinion did not need to be entirely realistic or \\"believable\\" to be enjoyable. I enjoyed the historical backdrop of the story, and did not find her narrative \\"preachy\\"."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"As one reviewer commented, the last part of the Poisonwood Bible suffers from overpoliticalization. The ideas expressed are not unworthy or invaluable in themselves, but they begin to burden the story and slightly diminish the book's overall effect. The character Leah toward the end becomes reduced to a vehicle for delivering a lesson on Congolese history and politics.The larger part of the book(and the better part as well) focuses on the Price family's experience as Christian Missionaries in a small Congolese Village, a world vastly remote from their lives (and our's) in America . The flora, the fauna, the daily struggles of the villagers to simply survive are described with ability and insight. Each member of the Price family, with the exception of the domineering and myopic father Nathan, takes turns narrating the story. The result is a nuanced and insightful portrayal of Congolese village life as it comes up against the misguided intentions of Nathan.I learned a lot from this book, but far more from the first part in which I was more able to \\"feel\\" about things, than from the second, in which I learned about how strongly the author felt about things herself."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is one of the best written books we have read. It was recommended to my husband and he raved on the figurative language and word usage. He returned the borrowed copy so I purchased us a copy to read. It is an incredible piece of work. Also great insight in to the Congo and mission life."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book is so great that I read it three times over the past 4 years and will probably read it again. I first read it for my book club, and am so happy that I purchased it later. It is political and historical without being too heavy. Very easy to sink into..."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible was truly a work of art. My book club read it last month and thoroughly enjoyed it. We ran out of time before we ran out of life lessons to discuss from it. It was wonderful for a group read because after reading it, I just wanted to share the experience!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book is a superb read. I was immediately drawn into the struggle in the Congo while reading this book. It was like a vacation from life as I went along with the Price Family and seen through their eyes the strength of a people to survive in such devastating conditions. This book is poetic and insightful. I thouroughly enjoyed it. I would highly recommend The Poisonwood Bible."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I'm at this point, halfway through the book and I can't put it down. I enjoy having the book narrated from different character's points of view, especially the smallest of the daughters. The book might seem depressing for some, since its the story of a family in an unfamiliar area in El Congo, where they go with their father, who is not very aware of their needs and how much they suffer, while he goes off trying to convert the natives that really could care less about him. But the part that fascinates me, is how this people are able to adjust to having so little, especially the kids. It has, certainly, taught me to appreciate every little luxury item and think twice before I buy anything I dont need. It has also made me aware of other parts of the world that do not have as much as we have here in the US. It is a very engaging book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I really did like this book. The only problem I had was that in the middle it moved somewhat slowly. It did't really dampen the story though! As I read I felt like I was really in the Congo with the characters. This book made me realize how lucky I really am and how much I value my own family. In an overall review I think that this book was wonderful and if you read it you'll really enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"A great book. An eye opening view of the harships of the poor African nations through the eyes of a Baptist Minister's family."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara has outdone herself with this one. Unlike her Animal Dreams series, (which I also loved!) this thoroughly engrossing novel covers the life and times of a family whose missionary Congo plants himself, his wife and his daughters in the midst of a country in turmoil. Told from alternating points of view of the wife and daughters, you come to hope for their physical and emotional survival in spite of their minister father/husband who refuses to move out when dangers closes in. A literary masterpiece of finely woven history and the human psyche. The only thing I would have changed was to end it when the story ended. Too much after-story writing was anti-climactic."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book examines life on so many levels. I read it as I was leaving Zimbabwe this summer, and her descriptions of the Congolese family and the interpretations of their behaviors by Americans were funny, accurate and a bit scary. Also, this book discusses issues of greif and sprituality that I still think about."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Anyone raised in a fundamental baptist home will recognize the characters in this book. Ms. Kingsolver wonderfully explains the zeal and arrogance of this missionary; while eventually evoking sympathy for just about every character in the book.As a side benefit, woven in the story is more African history than is taught in any American school. I thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book contains so many historical inaccuracies and untruths that it is barely tolerable reading. The author continually exploits cliches of race whether they apply or not just to manipulate the reader's emotions. Leave this book at home, and read &quot;AFRICA&quot;, the true history is so much better than this weak fabrication."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"How can so many commend this book? Though the writing itself is good, there is a real feeling of artifice - the characters are not believable at all. They are all one voice speaking in different dialects and sounding very contrived. Ideologically, everything about this book is a sham and a cliche.It reminded me of those &quot;mandatory reading&quot; books assigned in my communist school which were really propaganda - except those were a lot shorter and you knew what they were selling you from the start.Ms Kingsolver falls for every cliche in the book. However, the most revolting one (since it is such a flagrant LIE) is the implied notion that the problems of Africa and Africans are entirely the responsibility of white men. Funny how all those who espouse this view seem to flip over that chapter in the history book where we learn how the Arabs bought sold and dehumanized the African long before a white face showed up on the African shore. Yeah, white men exploited Africans - so did everyone else - including Africans themselves. Someone had to sell those slaves at the shore. And let's not even get into how African men treat women - but Ms Kingsolver doesn't really pick up on that since it wouldn't quite fit into her &quot;good African&quot; story.Whatis also forgotten is that the very concept of equality that the Africans seized on so eagerly is a construct of white people and the Western civilization. Africans themselves have enslaved each other for centuries - they heard about communism from the Russians and about Democracy from Westerners.And oh yeah, Christianity is all evil and bad - but those witch doctors and their chicken bones they are okay! The Christian missionary who wants to control the Africans - he's bad. But the scorcerer who controls the AFricans with fear and senseless superstition -he's good! At least the white man has some medicine that has real effect.I'd be returning my book, but all that paper seems useful in the bathroom."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I just finished it. Remarkable writing from multiple perspectives. I was truly engrossed."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Told from the points of view of five American women, and providing engrossing insights into colonisation from the victims side, I loved this book especially its willingness to explore the difficult personal and political questions encountered when Americans journey into the world taking with them inter alia their goals of either economic exploitation, spiritual guidance for the barbarians, ideological sanctions via the CIA or the benefits of \\"the American way\\". Quite sensual in its attention to the physical details of space, touch, sounds, sights, smell - who can forget the African mages of the Eastern green mamba with its open mouth a sky blue or the squidgy mud underneath bare feet or the elegance of the erect women carrying goods on their heads. Or the cleanliness and odourlessness of the American suburb in comparison. Captivating and memorable."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I picked up Barbra Kingsolver's \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\" for my summer reading requirement for AP Literature, and found, to my surprise, that I actually enjoyed the book.For one, Kingsolver provides readers with five different opinions and personalities of life in the Congo. Nathan's four daughters (Rachel, Adah, Leah, and Ruth May) depict their daily life in the Congo. I found myself drawn to each character's vivid descriptions, as each perspective was completely different from the other. And then, at the openings of chapters, there is a somber and reflective Orleanna Price, who begs forgiveness from her youngest daughter. [Read the novel if you want to find out why she asks for the aformentioned forgiveness, because I don't want to spoil the novel].Second, the historical aspect (the Congo's independence) that is woven throughout the novel is quite informative, but is also intriguing to read.The characters, whether minor or major, and the plotline are the major reasons to read this novel. I strongly suggest that you read it. You may be surprised to find that you actually enjoyed it!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"My english teacher recommended Life of Pi and The Poisonwood Bible. The latter one, I actually liked. I'm an avid reader for a teenager, and I usually don't put down a book (unless its Pride and Prejudice). When I first saw all 607 pages of this novel, I thought it would be quite hard to finish. The novel does get boring a few times, but it's tolerable. All the Biblical references confused me, for I don't know much about the Bible. And Ruth May seemed way more grown-up for her age. Rachel was funny. I can understand where she's coming from, but she's way too materialistic and ignorant. I identified with Adah the most. Their father is cuckoo. I couldn't bear to live with a guy like that. If I were them, I would've left sooner. Their mother is a bit too submissive. And I hated the way they killed all those animals. I can't imagine becoming that savage. The rest of the book is great. It's beautifully written, powerful, and tragic. It made me question life here in America. Oh, and I finished the novel in a couple of days. I'm a fast reader, but I also enjoyed it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I listened to this book while walking for exercise. It was recommended by my husband who was totally in it's grasp. Once I started the book, I became so involved with the characters and the story line that I actually walked extra miles so I could listen longer. Good for the body and the mind! One of my all-time favorite books. Even though I have already enjoyed this book myself, I am buying it to be able to loan to my friends or perhaps actually listen to it again myself!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"If you're looking for a real book, definitely check out 'The Poisonwood Bible.' Besides Kingsolver's impeccable use and fluency of words, the storyline is absolutely complexically amazing!The story of a fervent Baptist missionary in the Belgian Congo unfolds before the reader's eyes in the story told by the Price women: Orleanna, and her four daughters, Rachel, Leah, Adah, and Ruth May. Their tale is not only complex, but amazing, heartbreaking, and thought-provoking.To some not quite so 'passionate' readers, 550 pages of pure writing may be a bit intimidating. Don't let this be the reason to stop you from reading this novel! It is definitely worth the time and effort!There are so many levels to Kingsolver's tale that it is hard to imagine that one person thought them all up. There are wonderful biblical references throughout, and the reader definitely learns a bit about African culture whilst the children tell their stories. After reading this novel, you will definitely be awed, as well as know how blessed we are, period.This book is absolutely amazing, and I highly recommend!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"My main disappointment was that I had to suspend an enormous amount of disbelief in order to believe in the characters. For example, I have a hard time believing that Rachel could spend that much time in the Congo and still grown up to be who she became. I also found it hard to believe that Adah's transformation would occur almost anecdotally. And I also did not like obvious foreshadowing of certain events. All in all, this book left me wanted more substance."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The time is 1959, and a minister, his wife, and four daughters have arrived in the Congo to set up a mission and convert the natives to Christianity. Indeed the natives provide a warm welcome for the family, but things seem to go wrong right from the start. The celebration is marred when the minister chastises the group because the women have, to him, the vile habit of wearing nothing from the waste up. This righteous, rigid man of God doesn&#65533;t have a chance. His preaching is pedantic, filled with biblical illusions that many American fundamentalists would have difficulty with. His theology is not one of love, but of stern exhortations to mind God&#65533;s law.Life in the jungle is difficult, and some members of the family become depressed with the hardships of a life that is made worse by the tyranny of the father. Then there is an event which prompts the family to begin its slow exodus back to civilization.We are now at about page 500 of a 650 page book, and this is where the novel really should end. Author Kingsolver continues the story, but turns this part of the book into a polemic on the continuing plight of the Congo.But, hey, you have 500 pages of good reading in front of you. If you are interested in more fictional and non fictional accounts of Congo history I would recommend the following books:Non-fiction:&#65533;King Leopold&#65533;s Ghost&#65533;, by Adam Hochschild. As the cover says it is &#65533;a story of greed, terror, and heroism in colonial Africa.\\" That sums it up adequately. This book won a prize for best book on international relations, and was a NY Times Notable Book.&#65533;In The Footsteps of Mr. Kurtz&#65533;, by Michela Wrong. The author, a reporter, recalls her years in the Congo (then Zaire) under the final years of Mobutu&#65533;s presidency. &#65533;Mr. Kurtz&#65533; in the title refers to a character from Conrad&#65533;s &#65533;Heart of Darkness&#65533;Fiction:&#65533;Heart of Darkness&#65533;, by Joseph Conrad. This is, of course, a classic novella that takes place during King Leopold&#65533;s reign of terror. I most strongly recommend that you buy the Norton Critical Edition of this book. In addition to the 76 page novella there are close to 350 more pages of background on the Congo, plus many interesting articles about Conrad&#65533;s story.&#65533;A Bend in The River&#65533;, by V.S. Naipaul. Imperialism falls, and the main character finds himself in a post &#65533;Heart of Darkness&#65533; Congo."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I highly recommend this book to both casual and serious readers. As an avid reader with a degree in literature, I could not get over how good this book was!!!! It is serious and humorous and sarcastic all at the same time. This book manages to be enjoyable, employ some excellent literary techniques, AND provide a timeless social commentary. Absolutely amazing!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I try to be very conservative with my 5 star ratings, but this book is well worth it. The word \\"ambitious\\" is used twice to describe the book on its own back cover. Indeed it is, in so many ways. First, I always have great admiration for authors who can convincingly base a fictional novel in a non-fictional time and place (and one so different from our own) as convincingly as Ms. Kingsolver has. If I ever decide to write a novel, you better believe that it's going to be about a made-up fantasyland, which will require no research on my part and will put me at no risk of making any factual errors.Second, Ms. Kingsolver's use of 5 different voices to tell the story was not only ambitious, but effective as well. I can imagine few things that would be more difficult than having to write one story from multiple perspectives. This risk very easily could have blown up in her face. A danger in doing something like this is that her efforts to distinguish her characters and give them their own unique identities could, if overdone, have turned them into caricatures of what she were trying to portray. Go ahead and try to write a story from the perspective of someone who is a lot dumber and a lot shallower than you. It is almost impossible to do effectively without overkill. Yet Ms. Kingsolver succeeds magnificently. Unlike the review selected by Amazon above, I never found the distinctive features of the styles to be \\"grating.\\" Indeed, I think the different idiosyncrasies ultimately made me feel much closer to all of the characters than I would have otherwise. You don't just hear them described. You literally get inside their heads. Maybe even more impressively, the characters' voices age as they do. So not only did Ms. Kingsolver have to figure out how these distinct voices would sound in 1959, but in the mid-1980s as well, when the characters were all in very different times and places than when you first meet them.Third, Ms. Kingsolver includes an important political message in the book. One of her main purposes is to educate her readers on the shady circumstances surrounding the rise to power, with full U.S. backing, of one of modern Africa's greatest thugs: Joseph Mobutu. Again, this is always a risk. There's a fine line between provoking thought in your readers' minds and bludgeoning them over the head, but again, Ms. Kingsolver succeeds. Admittedly, the political message was almost entirely one-sided (Ms. Kingsolver saves the arguments that she clearly does not agree with for the shallow, ditzy character to make). It is very easy these days to talk about our efforts to contain Communism -- which is what motivated our support of Mobutu -- as nothing but evil and shortsighted, but that is only because they ultimately succeeded. Thanks to our eventual triumph, it's almost impossible to remember how scared people were of Communism back in the 50s and 60s (and not completely unjustifiably, I might add). Perhaps some day, we'll look back on our current cozy relationships with Pakistan and Saudi Arabia and wonder what we were thinking. But without the benefit of hindsight, it seems a lot more complicated than that at the moment.However, I don't judge the quality of a book based on whether I immediately agree with its message. Frankly, I'd rather read something that I don't agree with that is well written and provokes thought. This book certainly achieves that. It is one of those books that you want to constantly read, and when you cannot, you constantly think about. The characters were not all likeable, and those that were had their flaws. But they were believable and fully developed. I became fascinated with what each of them did and thought. When I finally finished the book, I was sad to put it down. Perhaps that is the simplest and most important comment on the quality of a novel."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible was an amazing book. Little plot--that is, there's no climax visible at first, but it makes up for everything in the way it is told. Beautiful. Each of the narrating women seemed to be alive. Looking at the book days after I'd finished it, I marveled that the characters were only words on paper. This was a book that I could not, really could not, put down. I slogged through the first hundred or so pages to meet my reading quota for the week (the book was a school assignment), but once I'd made it that far, I found I had to keep going. I spent all of one weekend devouring it. It's the kind of book you don't want to read again after you finish it, an exausting read. But it grows on you, and you'll pick it up again. Don't miss this. God, I loved that book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is the best book I've read in several years. I read it several weeks ago, over a weekend, and the story and the characters made a powerful impression on me. It's fascinating how the same novel can be perceived so differently by various readers. It's difficult for me to understand how anyone could not be moved by writing of this caliber, and I find it interesting that some have let what they see as some kind of insult to Baptists, or to Christians in general, color their vision. I don't think fine points of doctrine...such as modes of or appropriate age for baptism...were really the issue to Nathan Price. He was obsessed with having *his* way with the villagers and was locked in a power struggle of his own making with the village chief that went much deeper than a difference in religious beliefs. Nathan had lost his way long before he dragged his family to the Congo, and he continued in a downward spiral, as evidenced by his increasing abuse and neglect of his wife and children. He was falling apart, as did his family and his mission. Surely we all know that the title &quot;Christian minister&quot; doesn't confer some magical kind of goodness or immunity from criticism upon a person. History is replete with inhumane horrors committed in the name of Christianity. That doesn't make all Christians bad people, but we shouldn't feel compelled to defend or deny those atrocities. Christ himself reminded His followers that unkindness toward their fellow man was tantamount to the same toward Him. *Of course* there have been kind and loving missionaries (one such, the man who'd previously held the post at Kilanga, is a character in this novel). Ms. Kingsolver is not slamming religion; she simply shows how poor and empty preaching and scripture-quoting can be if our actions reveal a callous and bitter heart. Nathan's inability to master the nuances of Kilanga's native language resulted in his words' being misinterpreted by those to whom he preached, but his insensitive behavior reinforced and magnified the distortion. The overall lesson of this novel is, I think, how we each affect and are affected by everything and everyone that touches our lives... and what an awesome and humbling thing that is."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"A book of biblical proportions, Kingsolver's &quot;Poisonwood Bible&quot; reads suprisingly quickly, probably mostly because the reader is quickly seduced by the scenes she sets so perfectly.I neglected friends and work for this novel, and Kingsolver made it all worth my time. Her characters are intoxicating, idiosyncratic, and undeniably realistic. With her characteristic storytelling ability, Kingsolver is more than capable of drawing the reader into the narrative.She uses the Price family as a window through which to tell multiple stories. At once, this is a story of colonialism and acquisition and of persistence and humanity.From the first scene, you know you're reading a train wreck of a novel--the idyllic CANNOT survive this saga of faith run amok.At times we lose focus of the intent behind each character's action, but Kingsolver is adept at tying loose threads together. While the ending is not poorly crafted, it can be a hearty shock to the reader whose heart was united with the young family early on.But that, in itself, is an act of purpose. In the traditional coming-of-age sense, this story grows up at the end when Kingsolver gives her characters lives that shadow the surreal, blank endings to malformed beginnings."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"She does a masterful job. As a person whose life experience is a (thankfully) distant cousin to the Price family's the only way to describe being young, not of the culture, and in Africa in a colonial context is through multiple voices. Simplicity, beauty, and the scent of Africa are contrasted with the hilarity of culture clash, and tragic politics which are touched unerringly and in turn by Kingsolver. All the women ring true. Nathan is a stretch but true of his era. Nelson rings true, Anatole is less so only because his character is weighted with an interacial marriage, a saintly tolerance, unbelievable prison survival and an extraordionary wisdom. Maybe Anatole wears the 'Politics on the sleeve' review above but to me the criticism is irrelevant if one reads for comfort. Technically maybe he could be rendered more believable but Kingsolver has done such a great job overall I still give her a glowing recommendation. If you read to be challenged and inspired and to feel connected this is a book for you. A must for any post-colonial."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"While I don't mind reading a 600+ page novel if the story is worthy of 600+ pages, I do mind reading a book that long without the story necessary to justify it's length.This novel takes a long time to get going, climaxes about 2/3 way through the book, and then leaves you with 200 more pages to read after the story is basically over. Additionally, the character development is horribly uneven. Kingsolver does a great job of dispelling the stereotypes of Africans, and yet, Nathan and Rachel are nothing more than the stereotypical militant preacher and dumb blonde, respectively.On the plus side, this novel has some great social commentary and relays a history of political events that most Americans know little about. Many of the characters are well developed and the story line is engaging in many areas.Overall, I don't horribly regret reading this novel, but in retrospect I probably would have picked something else."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I thought this story was fabulous from start to finish. Each of the women's voices was so distinct I could hear them. I truly felt Orleanna's complete sense of being lost in something that was out of her control. Crippled Adah's search for balance in palindromes and word games was brilliant. OK, so Rachel's malapropisms did start to wear on me after awhile and we never do find out exactly why she's so shallow. Leah is the heart and soul of the story, a woman who in many ways has all the tenacity of her father but decides to put it to better use. A lot of reviewers have complained about the last third of the book but I think that's a very necessary part of the story. A couple of quick pages explaining what happened to everyone would have been a travesty. The whole point of the story was the impact that those months in Kilanga had on the rest of their lives. Although it led each of them in a different path they were never able to break their ties to it. And as for the politics of the book: it was an educational experience. If even most of it is true (and I suspect a good deal is) it makes me ashamed. But as far as the story is concerned, who ever said a novelist had to be objective?"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"As an old Kingsolver fan, I was very disappointed in this novel. I will try reading it again another time, but I recently reread Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart and Kingsolver doesn't come close. I feel I'd rather read the insider's version of the damage done to Africa by the west. I'm not interested in this Baptist family's deconstruction or their view on what went wrong. I would be more interested in the Congolese view, in the view of anyone with a genuine stake in the Congo. Kingsolver cites Achebe in her acknowledgements and Things Fall Apart is a far better story than the one she's telling--the deconstruction of traditional life on the continent, the pugalistic hero, the women suffering on the edges. I am obviously not meant to sympathize with the preacher in Kingsolver's novel, and she hasn't given me any reason to care about him. I don't have to like him to want to understand his story, but I don't think she's going to give me any piece of this man's humanity. He's just the bad guy. I am left wondering--am I reading the story of the Congo or missionary work or the collapse of a family? Sadly, I don't much care anymore. For heartbreak, humanity, and history read Achebe."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"WELL--THIS IS MY FIRST REVIEW. THE FIRST TIME I FELT COMPELLED TO COMMENT ON SOMETHING I'VE READ AND TO RECOMMEND IT. THIS BOOK OPERATES ON SO MANY DIFFERENT LEVELS, A THNKING FICTION-LOVER HAS TO BE ENGAGED. THERE ARE INTERESTING, MOSTLY BELIEVABLE CHARACTERS, A FASCINATING STORY, NICE, SOLID WRITING, GREAT SCENIC DETAIL--WITHOUT GOING INTO LONG, OVERWROUGHT DESCRIPTIVE PASSAGES--INTERESTING COMMENTARY ON RELIGION, US FOREIGN POLICY, NEEDS VS. WANTS...IT'S A GREAT WAY TO SPEND YOUR TIME, AND MIGHT EVEN CHANGE THE WAY YOU THINK ABOUT LIFE, THE UNIVERSE, AND EVERYTHING."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Please forgive me if I fall into the trap of hyperbole, but I have simply been consumed by this amazing novel. The Poisonwood Bible is truly a precious gift; religious arrogance and political injustice are blended into a compelling story line, where the characters are addictive and the prose is crafted with elegant care. With each page, I found myself more deeply assimilated with the fear, anger, hope, guilt and confusion that afflicts the book's five protagonists. For Ruth May Price, I truly grieved in a way I have not grieved for a fictional character's passing since I witnessed the deaths of Lennie Small in \\"Of Mice and Men\\" and Paul Baumer in \\"All Quiet on the Western Front\\". As Africa absorbs the souls of Barbara Kingsolver's characters, my soul, too, has been absorbed; this book walks with me, sleeps with me, invades my idle thoughts and inspires tears at unexpected moments. For a work of fiction, there is no greater compliment."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver gives us a powerful picture of what the white man has done to Africa over the course of 500 years. She pinpoints the first 3/5 of her novel in the last few months of the Belgian Congo, circa 1960. She puts a misplaced and misguided missionary family in the deepest Congo and through them brings to life Africa's sad relationship with the West.The remainder of the novel brings Africa and Kingsolver's surviving white characters up to recent times. Africa has gotten into the heart of each of them as it surely got to the author. Her concluding chapters reflect her love for the Continent, her understanding of it, and a small but brave hope for Africa's future. The reader is richer for what Ms. Kingsolver has learned.What might have been a perfect read is despoiled just a little by the author's angry politics. There's a feminist dislike of all things white and male throughout the book, and her conservative characters are simple-minded and selfish while her folks leaning left are predictably intelligent, thoughtful, and kind. And while she frequently rips Dwight Eisenhower, she never mentions the Kennedy administration by name. Kennedy's record in Africa and the Congo was at least as terrible, probably more so.That said, this book remains an enlightening and entertaining read. Its 543 pages go by much too quickly."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver's evocation of the Congo is masterful and reflects her intimacy with the sights, sounds, and smells of a place she clearly views with admiration and compassion. Going there with Kingsolver as guide, along with four American girls, each speaking to us with a distinctive voice and point of view, is an amazing journey of both the external and internal conflicts inherent in moving to such an alien land. The girls and their family become the only whites in a small village with its own form of dignity and tradition, which is at first invisible to the eyes of the foreigners. The girls allow us to see their inflexible missionary father and struggling mother through the lens of various ages, from a teen sneaking makeup behind her father's back to a child who still echoes everything he says. As the family is pressured and the children grow to adulthood in this challenging environment, with its flooding, its isolation, and its lack of amenities, far past the tenure they anticipated, each discovers her true self and writes her own version of the Poisonwood Bible."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This was one of the best novels I have read in the last ten years. It is the story of a family that moves to Africa to be missionaries. Each chapter is told throught the eyes of a different member of the family (the mother and four daughters). Ms. Kingsolver is an excellent storyteller, very clever and witty. I can't wait to read more of her books."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I literally had trouble getting to sleep at night thinking about what would happen next in this book. It is that good. There are plenty of reviews describing the story here already, just do yourself a favor and read this book immediately."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"It is the rare contemporary writer who knows how to tell a truly good story. There are a few who come to mind. Barbara Kingsolver is right up there, and The Poisonwood Bible is a good reason why. Two writers who match Kingsolver with their instinct for telling a story are Joan Leslie Woodruff and Louise Erdrich."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is one great book. Barbara Kinsolver has done it again! This is a story of a family of a mother and her three daughters and their religious crazed father. The father picks up his family and makes them move to Africa so that he can preach and &quot;save&quot; the people from burning in hell. It is a wonderful story of how a city family adapts to the jungles in Congo. It is very suspensfull and at at the same time very heart warming. It is very emotional to follow the relationship between the daughters and their mother. The narration and description are wonderful. I actually felt I was in the jungle - it is that intense! Great book - a definite MUST READ."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"It's been a while since I read this one, but I will likely read it again. I recommend it to everyone. However, my sister is pursuing missionary work in Africa next year, and I hesitate to tell her to read this because the novel places the Western Christian faith into a domain and culture that is struggling as best it can under the circumstances, and outside ideologies merely fade into the background.Rich with history and cultural analysis, the novel reveals the timeless human struggle in a harsh wilderness through realistic characters in universal reality.Although I've not read any other Kingsolver, this is certainly everything a novel should be."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"What an amazing story - an acurate and wonderful account of life in the African wilds. I too had the struggles the family faced (garden wiped out by one rain storm, army ants attacking me in the night). I weeped for the characters and how Africa transformed them. I highly recomend this for anyone with an interest in living over seas (in a non ex-patriot lifestyle) to recieive the full story of how time in that area can transform you. Barbara Kingsglover is an amazing author with an ability to turn feelings, sights, smells for an a area of the world least travled (and lived in) by Americans into words on paper."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible is by far the best book I have ever read. I had trouble putting it down, but wanted to so it would last that much longer.The story of of four very different sisters forced to live in a place that they tought they might like and the trials and tribulations that they go through is excellent. The emtions that were poured into the book were bueatiful and heart-warming.I am not the average reader of this book, so maybe that is what made it that much more amazing to me."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This was an excellent, well written, enthralling book. The characters were well defined, meshed with and against each other as well as the Congo. They are well-rounded, dynamic, and multi-dimensional. As a Christian, I expected superficial stereotypes that reflect bias either for or against idealist missionary-types. This book was, rather, a story about one man who tried to do something he was totally unequipped for, and how the ones he drug along with him dealt with his inflexible refusal to either give up or change."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"More than just a novel, Kingsolver's gifted talent for writing brings out the injustice done by those whose plans are the largest. Nathan Price, a fervent Baptist, takes his family to the Congo on a mission to convert those who have not found the way to God. The story is told alternately from the viewpoints of the mother and their four daughters as they experience the changes, failures, and distresses of trying to retain their lifestyle in a place where it could no longer possibly apply.Price, though, is only the minor metaphor for a larger scheme of subjugation and ruin of an entire culture by those who would profit and prosper at their expense. With wonderful turns of phrase and great insight, Kingsolver takes us into the heart of Africa, and into the hearts of our own culture as well. By taking from others, what have we given up of ourselves? There is no clear answer, but there is the experience, which Kingsolver renders wonderfully"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I have loved this book ever since I read it when it was first published. It is a fabulously written and engrossing story. A haunting tale of a family and a country that lingers with the reader long after you're done reading. It is one of the books on my keeper shelf, and one I buy for others as gifts. It has also become one of my comfort reads, a book I reach for when nothing else captures my mind enough to escape from the everyday pressures of life. With that said, I bought the audiobook version (unabridged on CD) for a long car trip. Big mistake. DON'T GET THE AUDIOBOOK version! It is horribly read by Dean Robertson (fyi, a female, not a male). There is absolutely no inflection to the voice, no feeling, and the pace is completely wrong for the story. Very rushed and hurried from the start. There is no change when switching from one character to another. Don't waste your money on the audiobook. Buy the paperback version!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book is very good and very complex."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I truly enjoyed the first 250 pages of this book. I enjoyed the different perspectives of the 5 women and I thought that the author did a great job describing the feel of the Congo. BUT then everything went downhill quick- I feel that the author put down her writing for a long time and then picked it up again in a rush to finish it for publishing. The last 250 pages were rushed and the characters were suddenly boring and one dimensional. I hated the last part of this book- It was awful. If the author had continued the in the same vein as the first 250 pages the book would have been about 1500 pages long and would have been marvelous. ..."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Ok, the first part of the book was good but the last third was horrible. It skips from one sister to the next as they grow older and barely change. It drags on and on.And she kept going on about how they don't have grocery stores in Africa and apparently this is the root of all predjudice of white people against Africans. Because white people, apparently, are unable to understand the concept of small individual farms. I wanted to scream, \\"Ok! I get it! No grocery stores!\\" It's really not that revolutionary.*spoiler*I kept hoping for redemption for Leah and Rachel but that didn't happen. They could have just ended it with the youngest sister dying and it would have been a good book. The mother is boring by the end, and so is Ada. I prefered it when she read backwards. Leah is bitter and unhappy and somehow I can't sympathize with a person who would rather see her children starve in Africa (she discribes their swollen bellies- horrible!) that be stared at in America (for being half black, half white). How selfish. And speaking of selfish, I honestly wished she would simply stop writing about Rachel, seeing as how she does not grow or change or mature one iota from the beginning to the end of the book. A very two demensional character and I kept thinking that the only reason I was still reading about Rachel was that by the end there would be some magical breakthrough, some change of heart that would make it worth enduring her for the rest of the book, but no.All in all, I'm glad I got this at the library and don't own it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"We read this book in our book club last month and four out of five of us hated this book. I really don't see the appeal at all. Yes, it was well written drom a literary point of view, but also dry as dirt. I had to force myself to finish the book. If it had not been a club read I would have given up! It's starts slow and then climaxes half way through. The last third of the book is a big anti-climax. Perhaps I enjoyed it less becasue I disagreed so much with her liberal political and religious views, but it was definatly one of the worst books I have read in recent memory."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"As a white South African, whose parents, grand-parents, great-grandparents, and earlier ancestors have lived in South and Central Africa since the 1600s, I found the Poisonwood Bible to be typical anti-settler, pro-native, pro-Marxist tripe.I don't need to dwell on the author's obvious biases against men, whites, and capitalism--those are plain to see and she is entitled to her bigoted pinko-commie-liberal perspective.As for 'realism', please! We're supposed to believe that these missionaries went to live in the village of Kilanga and lived THE SAME WAY as the iron-age natives? My great-grandparents in Rhodesia (the country on the Congo's southern border) lived in houses with wells for water, windmills, and indoor plumbing--in the 1910s. The story of the Price family begins in 1959!Comically, Ms. Kingsolver believes the Congolese natives are all-knowing and the ignorant whites couldn't even survive without the natives' benevolence. That's why Black Africa TO THIS DAY is the most backward and undeveloped region of the whole planet--it's due to those brilliant black Africans. And, somehow, those countries with the largest number of white citizens (South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, and Kenya) somehow have per-capita GDP and living standards far above their black-only neighbours.Finally, two issues grated throughout: even though the author acknowledged Mobutu's 'Zairisation' programme of changing all the names (Leopoldville is now Kinshasa), she continued to use the colonial names long after her story moved into the 1980s. I guarantee you no one called Kisangani 'Stanleyville' in 1985!Secondly, the 'road trip' that the sisters take in the early 1980s from Dakar to Brazzaville is preposterous. First of all, the idea of 3 white women making that journey across West Africa by themselves is ludicrous (What route do you think they took? How many civil wars were underway along that route? Why wouldn't they just ship the Land Rover directly to the Zairean port of Matadi? And, WHY would someone buy a British Land Rover in ATLANTA in the early 1980s and not in Britain or ex-British Africa? Like I said--too preposterous.)All-in-all, I admit Kingsolver has a way with the English language--her prose is often. However, this story was ridiculous."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"If you want to be preached to by our culture read &quot;poisonwood&quot;. Kingsolver does us a disservice by feeding us the usual politically correct bull. She unashamedly promotes her agenda that is in lock step with the general culture of our land. Anti-Christian and anti-life. I knew it was coming but I had to wait till about page 500 before she outright promoted contraception as a possible end to African troubles. She, of course, didn't make me wade into the book any length before she showed her hostility to Christianity. Her intellectual smugness was too much for me to take throughout the book but I perservered not liking a book to defeat me. I closed it five pages before the end in protest."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Kingsolver is a very talented, very engaging story teller. I was throughly engaged with the Price family. But Kingsolver is also just another self-loathing white liberal. She alone as the writer reduces her story from an impressive work of art to just another banal lecture on how we as westerners should feel ashamed.Read it if you want to. I enjoyed the Prodigal Summer which is why I wanted to also read the Poisonwood Bible. However after reading Poisonwood I think I might be off Kingsolver indefinately."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I had to read this book for a literature class in a public University. I am persuing english writing as my major and enjoy both reading and writing my own stories. I, also, happen to be a very devout Catholic.The good points of this book is that the characters are so well rounded. The author does a brillant job at presenting what she wants to present.Its been awhile sense I have read it, but I can say that it can be slightly offensive in a Christian perspective. This author's viewpoint of Christianity is very apparent as her characters slowly abandon their faith for this new perspective of the world that the Congo has given them. I can only say that I was sad when the most devout girl in the book lost her book. However, part of the problem was that her faith was based on more of her love for her father and trying to gain his favor. As she sees his flaws through growing up, her faith deteriorates.For a person with a weak and questioning faith, this book could destroy that person's faith. And if you're discussing this book in a very secular class and still hold true to your faith, after the book is done being read, expect that your peers won't be too happy with you. I'm sorry I have more to complain about that class than anything else."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I found this book really interesting at first because of the historical context and the idea of writing a book from four different perspectives, but rather than adding objectivity, all four characters only serve to reinforce anti-American, anti-Christian sentiments. She creates unlikeable characters that you don't even love to hate. I found myself relating most to Leah, having been to a third world country and having struggled through the culture shock of returning to the U.S., but the more I read her voice, the more self-righteous she sounded. The saddest part was that there was absolutely no sense of cohesian in the family from the very beginning, nothing that bound them together, and no remorse for the father's fate. But reading this book did get me interested in learning more about the historical context and finding out how true the allegations are against the Eisenhower administration."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Kingsolver's themes and characters are so complex that the book literally takes you to a completely different level of critical reading. Her imagery of Afica's unpredictable terrain is simply beautiful. In addition, the story progresses in a way that just hooks and astounds you until you reach the last page. I highly recommend this amazing novel!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver's ambitious novel \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\" charts the course of Nathan Price, his wife and four daughters as they travel as missionaries to the Congo in the 1960s. The narration alternates between Nathan's wife and daughters in turn, and each voice is pleasingly distinct. During their first year in Africa, the children (and their mother) find that in this jungle they can never quite succeed in holding on to the familiar beliefs that have brought them this far, and struggle to discover what can replace them.The first two-thirds of the book are luminous. The multitude of characters are all piercingly human, the African environment richly realized, the writing sheer poetry. (The first page alone should have word lovers salivating.) These first four of the novel's seven \\"books\\" can be recommended without reservation.In the last third, things, as they say, fall apart. After spending 350 pages on roughly one year in the life of her protagonists, Kingsolver takes us on a whirlwind tour of the next three decades of African politics in what comes to feel like a 200-page epilogue. The last three \\"books\\" bear a gratingly didactic tone, and the rushed account of the girls' sudden adulthood is much less pleasant reading than their meticulously-rendered first year in Africa.But despite the misplaced history lesson and the weak, belated ending, the brilliance of the first four books is enough to qualify this as a must-read.~"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I have been there and I could have not described the people and the events any better; she is amazing!!!!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver is undoubtedly one of the most gifted contemporary novelists. She has the ability to draw her readers into her books in such a fashion that they will believe they are a part of them.The Poisonwood Bible is one of the most powerful books I have read in the last decade. It became an exotic journey for me to travel into an unknown land containing unknown beauty and horror. As in both of the books I have read by her, she draws upon her background in biology so that you will feel as if you are witnessing nature firsthand.The story is not for the faint of heart. It is heart-wrenching at points. Yet it is a story of the strength of the human spirit. As the author of a series of spiritual novels, [...], I especially appreciated this.

So much so that I give the entire book 4 out of 5 stars. I loved the structure Kingsolver used, and I was especially pleased by how Ruth May ends the novel. I was riveted by this family of Christian Missionaries in the Congo in the 60s. I thought it was truthful and accurate -- the language barriers, the way the village reacts to them, the diseases, the animals, etc -- but the book somewhat lost my interest after Ruth May is bit by the snake and the sisters head in different directions. I found the character of Leah to be extremely annoying. My favorite was Adah -- I loved the palindromes and poetry. But the Leah chapters (in the second half) were like reading an encyclopedia. I could have learned about the political strife in Zaire from reading a text book. Still, this book was better than a lot of stuff I have read."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Poisonwood Bible is one of my favorite books, why pick it apart? Every few years I get hungry to read it again. My criteria for a good book is simple: Does it make me laugh, cry, think, feel, does it take me into other worlds or other times? Poisonwood does all of those things."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"\\"Jesus is Bangala!\\" declares Reverend Nathan Price to his ragtag congregation deep in the Congolese jungle. The exclamation is full of irony; in the villagers' native Kikongo, \\"bangala\\" means either \\"precious and dear\\" or \\"poisonwood tree,\\" depending on the pronunciation. Rev. Price blithely uses the latter pronunciation, characteristically misunderstanding his would-be flock as he blunderingly tries to superimpose Christianity and American customs onto their culture. The consequences of Price's ignorance (and arrogance) are grave, playing out alongside the exploitative history of Belgian colonialism, the struggle for independence, and the subsequent CIA coup that replaced the Congo's first elected leader.Kingsolver's engrossing novel is narrated by the five Price females, each coping in her own way with what they have been part of. Orleanna is a missionary wife who, as a woman in the late 1950s, has little choice but to obey her husband, but who later struggles with her complicity in Nathan's--and America's--interventions in the Congo. Rachel, the eldest daughter, is vain and superficial (when the house is besieged by army ants, Rachel rescues not one of her weaker siblings, but her mirror), with an attitude of pure condescension toward the villagers she lives among. Then there are the twins: Leah, a tomboy who tries in vain to win her father's love, and the dark, poetic Adah, who was crippled in the womb. The youngest daughter, Ruth May, is most beloved by Orleanna, who struggles to protect her from the dangers of the jungle. Some make it out of the Congo; others do not, whether by tragedy or by choice. In the latter half of the book, the surviving members come to terms with their time in the Congo in different ways: becoming part of the machinery of exploitation, shunning whiteness and assimilating into Congolese culture, entering the healing profession, or turning inward.Only Nathan remains essentially untransformed by the Congo, although he does evolve into a more grotesque version of himself. Unlike the (mostly) dynamic Price females, he is a one-dimensional character with no redeeming qualities, quick to anger and incapable of seeing past his rigid views. While he is a poignant symbol of colonialism and post-colonial intervention, trying to baptize the village children in crocodile-infested waters, the flatness of his character makes him seem inhuman.\\"The Poisonwood Bible\\" is beautifully written, and the story of Price family is absorbing, as is the history of Western intervention in the Congo. A brilliant novel."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This novel kept me up at night, and woke me early. It brought laughter and, more than once, tears. It is part of me now in a way that only a few books each year manage to achieve. Stunning. Also, great fun. The word play, palindromes, and nuanced use of phrases in Kikongo, an African language from the Congo region where the tale is set, are, alone, worth the read. The story is told in rounds by five women, a mother and her daughters, who were hauled to the -- then -- Begian Congo by the father, an abusive iconoclast, and rabid Baptist preacher bent on saving the savages. The natives are far more deeply spiritual than the preacher can comprehend, and his simplistic promises of salvation fall on ears too sophisticated to buy into his hokum and wild malapropisms. The novel unfolds in the historical period when Belgium granted independence and Dwight Eisenhower ordered the assassination of the newly elected leader and financing of a civil war. Missionaries and most other whites were evacuated as violence against non-African's escalated. The preacher decided to stay, with dire ramifications for the whole family. Withall, a powerful testament, a brilliant historical piece, a profoundly moving personal tale of belief, loss, discovery and love. Killer-diller."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is one of the handful of contempory fiction books that makes it to my top 10 list. I avoided this book for a while because the premise -- a missionary family from Georgia in the Belgian Congo -- just didn't appeal to me. I don't know what compelled me to pick the book up and give it a try, but I am so happy that I did. Once I picked this novel up I could barely put it down.

I particularly liked her alternating narrators and was awed by the way this ordinary family's life deteriorated, and then by the survival of the mother and daughters. &quot;Our Father,&quot; as Adah calls her earthly fundamentalist father, is one of the most memorably drawn characters I've ever encountered. Every mother out there will want to grab him and shake him. It's possible that some Christian fundamentalists will take issue with his portrayal, but as Christian myself, I found a great deal to ponder in this book. I knew Barbara Kingsolver was a very good writer, but never knew she was a writer of this magnitude. Five stars aren't nearly enough."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Kingsolver has done a marvelous job of researching her choice of setting. The jungle of Africa comes marvelously alive for the reader, and while I have no personal experience by which to compare her descriptions, still the landscape and its people are painted vividly and memorably. The author also does very well distinguishing four first-person narratives, which in itself is a daunting task. While the plot does seem to crumble (and drag on endlessly) in the last hundred pages or so, the momentum from the first two-thirds managed to propel me through to the end. I was most disappointed to find her treatment of religion and missionary work in general, to be surprisingly superficial. There are few (perhaps no) redeeming qualities in the characater of the father. His superficial (indeed, often cartoonish) characterization did detract slightly from my overall enjoyment of the book. On the whole, however, its an engaging read."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I was disappointed by this book. I agree with other reviewers that the use of different voices for narration is at first interesting but becomes tedious and confusing. I was particularly dismayed that after 40 years the oldest daughter had not grown and spoke in the voice of a 16 year old girl from Georgia, yet she had lived in Africa for 40 years and certainly had experienced and witnessed enough things to have made her grow and develop as a person. She was a successful business woman for heaven's sake.I also understand that Ms. Kingsolver has a particular political agenda and I could overlook some key errors, like Mobutu's coup (which occurred in 1965) and his background. He was a bad guy so for the purpose of this book it isn't necessary to paint him as anything other than the second worst villain (following Nathan Price) in this book. But her treatment of Angola and the Republic of Congo was shocking! The idiot elder sister who was an unrepentant racist settled in the Republic of Congo and it was depicted as a stable French colony. In fact it had an equally turbulent history and was ruled as a Marxist dictatorship for over 40 years. Angola, the utopia that one of the twins settled in was brutal, unstable and as violent as Zaire. But because they were both Marxist/Communist dictatorships their brutality and wars were not worth mentioning, except when she could blame the conflict on the U.S. (in the case of Angola). The Republic of Congo got a complete pass.Finally, her treatment of President Eisenhower I found completely disturbing. Even the UN and the Belgium investigations absolve the President of being involved in the death of Lumumba and the coup. It is true the U.S. was interested in removing him but they did not participate and in fact Lumumba was deposed by the President of the Dem. Rep. of the Congo Kasa-Vubu. Lumumba tried to depose Kasa-Vubu but he lost in that battle and through a whole series of events he eventually lost his life. Regrettable, yes. But the history of most African countries is complicated and regrettable and I am afraid that most people who read this book will walk away with a one sided, inaccurate picture of that history. Yes, the U.S. has made mistakes in foreign policy, as have the Portuguese, British, French, Germans, Belgians, etc. But to absolve the \\"noble savage\\" of any responsibility for the condition they find themselves in and to blame all the problems on the West is ignorance and self-loathing at its best (or worst).If somebody wants to take creative license to tell a story then they shouldn't use real names and present things as facts which are opinions or simplified one sided versions of events. This is not history, it is fiction and should be read as such."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible by Barbara Kingsolver is a book that is guaranteed to become a classic. I really connected with this book and the reason I did so is the characters. The narratives of all four women draw you in and do not let go of you until the final words~ and even then, there is still a connection while you sit back and ponder. The reader feels firsthand the despair, pain, and the small triumphs these four feel as they learn to cope in a strange new world. The fanatical preoccupation of Nathan Price is enough to make the reader want to reach out and strangle him~ in this way, Kingsolver achieves something that is hard to do: she makes the characters real. It is incredibly easy for the reader to believe that these characters were once alive. The other thing I enjoyed about this book was it's historical information. Instead of glorifying the USA and other European powers, Kingsolver points out the bitter cold truth about what really happened in the Belgian Congo after they achieved independence. In short, this book is one to be savored~ and not just once, but over and over again..."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I agree wholeheartedly with the reviewers from Southern Indiana. Also a strong Kingsolver fan, this novel needed more time to be written. Although I'm very glad I read it, it was sometimes an ordeal. Chief among its stylistic flaws was the dreadful job done with the grammatical and stylistic eccentricities of the 'thought prose' of various characters at various ages. Granted, tracking the changes in grammar &amp; style of five different women across a range of years presents an awesome challenge,~ but why take the challenge on if it cannot be met? Also, as some professional reviews have noted, some of the puns and other wordplay in that prose was excruciatingly self-indulgent. intelligence, backbone, and wit of her various women characters. Where her men appear intended to be 'good guys', they nonethless simply serve to dress up the scenery around the women characters. Perhaps Kingsolver is trying to demonstrate how tiresome any form of sexism is. f so, she has succeeded admirably.Sadly, this novel reinforces a recurring pattern in current American writing, art, and film, a pattern in which artists approach greatness but, evidently for the sake of getting things done quickly, fall short."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"As an African Christian English teacher, I found this novel to be a very entertaining and challenging read. However, I take objection to the way-too simplistic treatment of the Gospel of Jesus Christ in Africa. First of all, what Baptist preacher anywhere in the world would put the Apocrypha on the same level as the protestant Bible? That's highly improbable. Second of all, where are any of the myriads of positive conversions to Christ all over the African continent, including Zaire/Congo, despite the despicable excesses, hypocrisies and distortions of too many of the European/American missionaries? Where are the miraculous healings and transformations of human life? Where are the indegenous missionaries who absolutely refuse to equate Christianity with western civilization? Where is any reference at all to the presence of the Gospel on the continent hundreds and hundreds of years even before the coming of the European missionaries to Africa ? Where is the historical Jesus in all of this?(And by the way, there is no evidence whatsoever that Christians &quot;invented&quot; the story of the Feeding of the Five Thousand. To state that flatly without so much as a question is a clear indication that the author is as dogmatic in her disbelief as Nathan is in his belief.) Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe is far more realistic and fair in its treatment of Christianity in Africa as it exposes the abuses of the Bible at the hands of the European missionaries. Finally, born and raised in West Africa where driver ants marching through houses and devouring everything in their path was not an uncommon occurence outside the city, I never once saw or heard of whole villages being submerged under a massive army of ants. I may be wrong about the Congo, but I do wonder whether or not that has ever happened even there."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Kingsolver's &quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot; is a gripping, well-written novel. The perspectives of the different characters at varying ages add tremendous depth to the story (though I did find the character of Rachel too consistently shallow to be believable). However, I could not help but be saddened throughout the book by the superficial and fairly ignorant treatment of the heart and motive of true Christian missionary work. From the bibliography, it appears that the author did a fine job of researching the history, geography, and people of Africa, but skimmed over the book's all-too-peripheral subject of Christianity. Real-life missionary stories (Elisabeth Elliot's &quot;Through Gates of Splendor&quot; and Bruce Olson's &quot;Bruchko,&quot; to name a few) are packed with more emotion, more action, more tragedy, and ultimately, more hope than Kingsolver could ever dream up."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"A very ambitious book, indeed, in which Kingsolver tells the story from five different viewpoints, five unique voices. And she tackles Africa, attempting to tell a story about the Congo/Zaire that will relate to us, her First-World readers. It's ironic, then, that Kingsolver, while trying to write a book on Africa, actually writes about book about the United States.The first part of \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\" is an interesting narrative as told by the four Price daughters of a Baptist missionary family adapting - or failing to adapt - to the culture and climate of a Congolese jungle village in the 1960s. The four girls each have a distinct voice, representing four distinct types - from Rachel, the spoiled American teenager, to Leah, the intelligent achiever who ends up \\"going native.\\"But the book quickly turns political. Kingsolver has the Prices in the Congo through independence, Lumumba's election and subsequent assassination financed by the CIA, and the unpleasant aftermath of civil war and chaos. The different girls soon devolve into political allegories. Rachel's spoiled teen act devolves into the racist, ignorant pro-American persona that is ultimately responsible in Kingsolver's world for the subjugation of African democracy and prosperity. Leah, the achiever, remains in Africa and becomes a kind of heroic figure of opposition to American power and culture, renouncing material comforts to ally herself with the New Africa. Kingsolver's tone gets preachy, and the complex problems of the African subcontinent get simplified into a single palatable message: the West is keeping Africa down.I don't doubt Kingsolver's resolve, her beliefs, and I'm not questioning her research or sources one bit. Her depiction of Africa feels real. But like so many other books about Africa written by outsiders (\\"A Bend in the River,\\" \\"Heart of Darkness,\\" etc.), \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\" really describes and characterizes its author and her culture more than it does Africa. In this book, we are treated to a distinctly American depiction of travel, of prosperity, and of culture.In this book, Kingsolver implies through the voice of Leah, that Africa was once a primal Arcadia until European explorers \\"discovered\\" the continent and enslaved its people and apportioned the land into colonies. African's inability to adapt to Western culture and technology - according to Kingsolver -- has to do with the intractability of the land, and the belief system created by thousands of years' of tribal tradition and culture. Westerners only sully or contaminate Africa's ideals and \\"natural\\" systems of government. Ideas shared, ironically, by the original European visitors to Africa.Also, Kingsolver indicts America's over-prosperous culture. Leah upon returning to Georgia after living in Africa, finds her cheap student housing overly oppressive. So much so that she has to move back to Africa as soon as possible. Which is a truly typical American reaction to prosperity: what other culture's people would spurn comfort and plenty and return to poverty and misery - for an idea? America is chock full of such self-abnegating or dangerous ideals and past-times: vegetarianism, eating disorders, weight-loss programs, Buddhist retreats, long-distance hikers, extreme sports.I don't wish to excoriate Kingsolver for these ideals. This nave optimism is the main reason I love my country, the United States. This belief that there is an ideal to aspire to, to sacrifice for. That there can be a perfect society built on Earth. That someone should, in fact, try to do so.However, at times her book deals clumsily with these issues. Characters lose their complexity when they begin to stand for an ideal. Rachel, for example, becomes uniformly bad, and loses all trace of humanity. She's easy to hate. As such, she may be an effective tool to denigrate a political view, a propaganda tool, but she ceases to be a quality literary device. She tells us nothing about the human character.Though the writing is at times brilliant, and the first part of the book was engrossing, overall \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\" succumbs to its flaws."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Barbara Kingsolver's Poisonwood Bible. I did not expect to from the synopsis provided, but I became absolutely absorbed in the lives of her characters. I was also struck by the author's brave decision to break so many American societal taboos. Criticizing the American government in its treatment of Africa and Africans, highlighting the hypocrisy and irony of American disdain for Africa, pointing out the egregiously bad treatment of blacks in America during the period and finally indulging in the final sin, a happy interracial marriage! My only criticism is the neatness of the conclusion. Evolved members of the family went forth to prosper and find peace. Father Nathan, who never changed his view of the world, and Rachel who refused to believe her looks would not solve everything, came to grief. If only the real world could achieve such justice. Reading some of the previously posted reviews I was not surprised to find some of the readers were condemnatory, or even irate. People raised to ignore or deny racial injustice and the patronizing interference of America in Third World countries would find this story hard to bear. Too much truth can sting!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"While this book was a hard starter,(it took nearly 140 pages until I seriously cared what came next) I have to say it is definitely worth it. The story of a missionary family going to the Congo during a turbulent period in history was extremely interesting. One of the fascinating aspects to the whole story is that it makes you look at &quot;wants and needs&quot; in life with a completely different perspective from each character in the novel, and then in one's own life. It takes you into the lives of the native Congolese people in a small village,their everyday needs and how they view the missionary families. Each of the characters has such a different perspective on what is going on, it is like piecing a puzzle together, and ending up with a picture that wasn't like the one on the box. Very interesting,very compelling. Not a quick read obviously, but very well worth your time."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I read Kingsolver's earlier &quot;Pigs in Heaven&quot; and &quot;Bean Trees.&quot; I picked up &quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot; on impluse to read while on vacation. Once I started reading it, I found it hard to put down.I have never had much interest in African history, but this book made me want to find out more. Her characters, as in her earlier books, are very well realized and fascinating. The story begins with the arrival in the Belgian Congo of Nathan Price, fire and brimstone Baptist preacher, and his reluctant family. The family's story is told by Nathan's wife, Orleanna, and their five daughters - shallow teen-age Rachel, twins Leah and Adah, and five-year-old Ruth May. The voices of the characters are authentic and believable.Other reviewers are correct in their assessment that this is, in a sense, two books. The first is about Nathan's clumsy and ill-advised attempts to fit Africa to his fundamentalist beliefs, and the family's attempts to fit their lives to Africa. The second is about the way a family tragedy marks its survivors and the different ways events in Africa mark them as well. I don't agree that Kingsolver should have &quot;stopped writing&quot; at the end of the first part.I was absolutely spellbound by the way the voices changed and the way they stayed the same from the first to the last of the book. One believes in the characters, they change and grow as the book progresses. Other reviewers found Rachel grating, but I think that was the point. Her shallowness brought home the points that Kingsolver was making even more effectively than the earnest preaching by Leah. I got the sense that in her own way, Rachel understood the events perfectly well, but that she did not care.I felt very complete when I finished the book. It was a satisfying experience."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"At the time of this writing, there are 488 customer reviews posted. It seems you either love this book or hate it. I loved this book.It is the story of a family that goes to the Belgian Congo to perform Christian missionary work in the 1950's. It is told in the first person by the wife of the minister, and his daugthers. Its point of view would of course be feminine, but not necessarily feminist.While some reviewers seem personally offended at the author's treatment of the father, Nathan, I find him sympathetic. And, without him, there is no story. Nathan's soul is tortured. Through a quirck of fate, he misses a battle of WWII where his entire unit is lost. He never deals with it and he is changed forever. When he met his wife at a Christian revival meeting, he was kind and committed to Chirst. When he returns home from the service, we find that he has become a rigid, self righteous bible thumping preacher. He despises wife for his own perceived sin... he physically desires her. He barely tolerates his daugthers, as he takes the entire family to the Belgian Congo to pursue what he believes is his calling from God. The hierarchy of his own church does not think that he is suited for missionary work, and will not send him, but he manages to go anyway. The family is ill prepared for the Congo and this predictably has tragic consequences.Once in the Congo Nathan antagonizes the few western missionaries he has contact with. And, in the end he fails in his effort to save the souls of the natives. There is racism in the 1950's attitudes toward the villagers... their souls need to be saved, but their lives are relatively unimportant. They can pray together, but not eat at the same table. When independence come, the other western missionaries flee, fearing for their lives. But Nathan stays and he will not allow his family to leave with the others.There is the mother, who is trying to please her husband, to be a good minister's wife, and to be good mother to her four daugthers. She cannot do it all. There are the 4 girls, one a teenager who hates being uprooted from her friends, twins (one with a deformity), and a pre schooler. Their experience in the Congo changes forever who they are, and they do not all return.The constancy is found in the lives of the African villagers who have suffered much worse, than these missionaries. There is the expected culture clash between the chief, the shaman, and Nathan.Every great novel has characters who grow and change. Nathan's change took place in the Pacific in WWII. He does not change again and grow beyond that point. While he expects the Africans to change into Christians, they are constant in their own culture. That leaves it to the women of the Poisonwood Bible to change and grow. And, they do not disappoint us. Like other readers, I found the first 100 or so pages slow going. I almost put it down. But I am so glad I persisted. I highly recommend the Poisonwood Bible, and hope that there is enough that is unique in the above to justify posting a 489th review."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver is finally receiving the attention she deserves for her impressive novel The Poisonwood Bible. I read this book last year because I'd just returned from spending five weeks in East Africa and missed the people and the country.This novel tells the engrossing story of quirky, feverish Baptist preacher Nathan Price who hauls his family off on a mission to the Belgian Congo in 1959. The story's narration is shared by his wife Orleanna and their four daughters, ages 5 - 15, who seem much too tender and naive to survive the trials of harsh conditions, poor housing, language barriers, cultural clashes, and natural antagonists. What results is an absorbing story set against the backdrop of political and religious upheaval.Kingsolver's writing in this book proves what can happen when a writer continues to pursue her craft. The work is impressively mature compared to earlier cute novels like The Bean Trees and shows her flare and passion and growth as a writer. The narrative voices are distinct and engaging except for 15 year old Rachel's whose heartsickness for American pop culture is somewhat irritating because of the stretches the writer makes to show Rachel's shallow nature. For example, at first Rachel's malaprops are entertaining, but read against the seriousness of several occurences, the writing sounds forced. Nevertheless, Kingsolver's narrators are living voices most readers will very much enjoy.I loved this book in spite of its flaws--the characterization of Rachel, the plausibility of some of the Congolese people's actions, and Kingsolver's political analysis/overview. The last fifth of the book is laborious as the writer strives to incorporate Congolese political history, and such writing is not where Kingsolver's strengths are. She is a craftsperson, a creative writer--one who loves the poetics and muscle of English--not a political analyst. Readers should begin this book knowing this because the heart of it is wrought with passion, Biblical double entendres, and enjoyable characters in a fantastic and important setting. Kingsolver's ambitious research has produced an important novel with more strengths than weaknesses as she's given deserved focus to precious central Africa--as the world should have and should be doing now."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"As a 60-year-old, upper middle-class African-American woman, I lament the fact that I know precious little about Africa. After reading this book, I feel as if I know more, at least about one section of that continent. Kingsolver, with her ingenious biblical format, manages to help this American - who has always been pretty much self-absorbed and was certainly, as a young college music major, oblivious to the Congolese fight for independence - understand that the way we westerners, Americans in particular, think things should be done, and what we think should be believed might just be open to question.The sisters' account of their life in the Congo is chilling. But I do have to wonder how Kingsolver expects the reader to believe that two people as different at Leah and Rachel could be from the same planet, much less the same family. Rachel seems more like a caricature than a real person. But we have her to thank for what little humor is contained in a story that is, in many ways, one of unremitting sadness.I am not politically savvy enough to judge the correctness of Ms. Kingsolver's political conclusions, but they seem plausible in terms of what I know about capitalism, racism, imperialism and self-aggrandizement.Would I recommend the book? Yes, with certain reservations. It's a long read. As I neared the end I found myself thinking, &quot;Enough, already!&quot; But I'm glad I stuck it out. The last chapter is worth the trip. I would recommend it to females, especially, and to other African-Americans like me who, in the manner of most Americans of any ethnic background, would prefer not to trouble ourselves with thoughts of the struggling, mysterious &quot;dark&quot; continent."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I have read the posted bad reviews (or as many as there were through the 220th review) and they did not convince me that this is a book not worth reading. This is a book to be cherished and discussed because it is a work of literature.I had the pleasure of hearing Barbara Kingsolver on her book tour promoting &quot;Prodigal Summer&quot;. Most of the questions from the audience were about Poisonwood, and Kingsolver expained her writing style. She starts with a theme, then comes up with a question that the story must address. After that she decides what voices are needed to explore and resolve the theme and the question. This book started out with four narrators, but she realized that four points of view were not enough, so one character split into two, the twins Adah and Leah. The theme of this book is redemption, and the question posed is how can we redeem ourselves after we have made mistakes. All kinds of mistakes are made in this book by all of the main characters, and they are all seeking redemption, whether they know it or not. Some do not find it, some stop looking, others do find it. It is an epic journey spanning 30 years, and a story to be savored by her readers.There are a couple of posted reviews saying she needed to research this book more. She researched this book for 20 years! She had file cabinets full of information that she collected over the years; so much so that she referred to this book as 'The Damn Africa Book'. She told a story of standing for hours in a zoo waiting for a green mamba snake to open its mouth so she could put it in this book. She wrote every scene in this book from all five narrators' perspectives so that we could distinguish their voices without seeing the name at the beginning of the chapter. It is her magnum opus, and readers who do not understand it are not serious readers of literature; they just don't get it.This is a book to be read, and re-read, and discussed, and studied, by readers of serious fiction. It is not a light-hearted read, and it is not for everyone. But for those of us who get it, we are in awe."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I have read all of Barbara Kingsolver's novels and, in my opinion, this one is her best. Five different female perspectives are given of a family's Baptist missionary conquest in the Belgian Congo. Their experience in a remote African village affects the characters, all in different ways, for the rest of their lives. Generally their accounts are dark and somewhat frightening but cleverly Kingsolver uses the voice of Rachel, the eldest daugther, to provide satirical comic relief.The Poisonwood Bible has been frequently criticized for evolving from a well developed and interesting story into a political diatribe. I thought, however, that perhaps Kingsolver was attempting to draw parallels between the actions of one man's religious mission and the intrusion of global superpowers in Africa. Both were manipulative, self serving, and had calamitous results. I believe Kingsolver's intention was to describe the effects of foreign interference on a small scale to illustrate what a disasterous impact western influence has upon Africa on a macro level.Kingsolver was able to combine a powerful fictious story and use it to help the reader understand the travesty of what much of Africa is presently enduring and why. The read is engaging and exciting while, at the same time, informative and enlightening."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The first thing most any Kingsolver fan (as I am) usually says about the Poisonwood Bible is &quot;It's different from the others.&quot; But don't dismiss it for that, or you will be losing out on a profound read.. Kingsolver's other books had a unifiedness: they pretty much revolved around the Southwest, were often about single moms, and were in the comfy 300-ish page range. In contrast, Poisonwood Bible is set in Africa, and is of epic length and scope. A rich, textured, challenging book, the story is about a heavy-handed Baptist missionary who takes his wife and family of four girls to be missionaries in the Belgion Congo in 1960, the period of the Congo's unanticipated independence. In her author's foreword, Kingsolver tells us that she too was taken to the Congo as a child, although her parents were health providers, not missionaries, and &quot;different in every way&quot; from the Poisonwood parents. Like a movie camera slowly circling its actors, Poisonwood's point of view is passed off from one narrator to another, a technique going back to William Faulker's Sound and the Fury (and perhaps elsewhere), and which I've been noticing has been in vogue lately. Sometimes we're seeing from the first person eyes of the spunky youngest girl; sometimes the poetic obstruse and otherworldly handicapped twin; sometimes the Ugly American oldest girl, her voice simultaneously appalling and engaging. Parts hypnotic, parts historical, parts beautifully psychological. By the end of the 543-page tome, I really felt as though I'd climbed inside the psyche of this family. And perhaps most importantly, I definitely feel I've a better sense of and sympathy for Africa than I did before. This book has taken several very American vantage points into Africa, and as the young protagonists grow and learn about this country and culture so hidden and misperceived by *this* country and culture, so too do we readers. I definitely recommended this mesmerizing novel."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I spent 8 years('62-'70)on a mission station in Zimbabwe and this book brought back memories of Africa. Barbara Kingsolver has captured Africa, the cultural clashes and the Americans who try to bring America with them. One reader complained that there was &quot;very little contact&quot; between the Africans and the Americans; the whites and blacks lived very different lives there, even on a mission station. I lived in Africa for 8 years and never learned the local language. I played mostly with other missionary kids, not the African children. My brother, who was younger (like Ruth Ann) interacted best with the local children. Another complaint I read was this: where was Nathan while his family starved? Africa is full of remote villages and many missionaries spent a lot of time away from their families travelling to these villages. Things happened while they were gone. Most of the criticism I read about this novel seems to be by Americans making assumptions about life in Africa and complaining because this book didn't live up to what they expected. I've been there and this book describes it all: the land, the people (Americans, Africans and &quot;Europeans&quot; or white Africans),the cultural misunderstandings and the political turmoil perfectly. I knew all the characters in this book. They were my family, my friends, my neighbors. As for the complaints about a political slant, she writes as it was: Communism and Socialism sound different in a country where very few (white people) have it all and very many (black people) have nothing, and democracy is hollow when democratic countries back the enemy.A must-read for anyone who has lived in Africa."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"As others have said, this is really a book of two parts. The first half details the family's struggle as Congo missionaries. This is an engrossing and tragic story of an enormous clash of Western and African cultures told in multiple voices. I could not put the book down as I felt the useless pain being inflicted on so many people. While the literary devices Kingslover uses to separate the daughters' voices do get a little irritating at times, the perspectives are genuinely separate and add much richness to the story.The second half of the novel, which follows the three surviving daughters for the next 30 years, is more problematic. While the account of Anton and Leah's interracial and cultural marriage is deeply moving, Leah does not seem to care that she is sacrificing her children's health to her and her husband's obsession with Africa--just as her father did to her. In addition, while I am generally on Africa's side, Leah's views change from refreshing to outrageous as the novel progresses. For example, Leah judges those Africans who enslaved others by local 15th century morals while she judges the western enslavers by modern standards. Also, in Leah's numerous speeches, the U.S. takes 100% of the blame hits for the Cold War meddling that tragically hurt Africa; even with my very limited knowledge of African history, I know that the USSR killed plenty of Africans and had a horrible effect on many African economies. Since Kingslover has Leah, a very sympathetic character, utter some extreme distortions without any challenge, I have to strongly doubt other historical and cultural facts she presents--rightly so according to some critics. Rachel, who a better novelist could have used to provide some thought provoking challenges to Leah's views, becomes an irritating mouthpiece for white supremacy and lacks any redeeming qualities. By the end of the novel, I had had more than enough of both Leah and Rachael! Since Kingslover has no realistic vision for positive change in Africa (Adah's thoughts about going back to subsistence agriculture are ridiculous given the huge population Africa now has to support), the second half of the novel basically is a highly biased political tract that has only one redeeming factor--the moving intercultural family story."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"While this book was a hard starter,(it took nearly 140 pages until I seriously cared what came next) I have to say it is definitely worth it.

Unfortunately, this book did not wrestle with this question. The style (different voices for the 5 female characters) leaves you feeling as though you are reading 5 separate books; and the chapters by Rachel are unreadable due to the author's attempt to make her nearly illiterate.I finally quit half-way through the book (and the other reviews suggest that the first half was the best part!) If you are interested in the basic question of sending missionaries to new places, read Mary Doria Russell's &quot;The Sparrow&quot; instead of this book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"There is no doubt that Kingsolver can write, and certain descriptions of Africa and the world are quite excellent.However, she has the canny ability to show her political views with every character--a view that not all her readers may share.All the far-lefts are warm and friendly people while the far-rights are cold and unbending.I do not like the flatness of characters produced in doing so.There are bad and good democrats just as there are bad and good republicans.Adah, one of the daughters, is portrayed wonderfully. Definitely a perk of the book.I think this book is worth it in the end but I wouldn't read any thing else by Kingsolver from now on."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I am only on page 40 of this book--but it's taken a week just to read that. I just can't seem to get into the story. I've read several books that keep me going and I'll stay up all night trying to read as much as possible. Maybe I prefer more suspenseful and action filled books. So far Poisonwood has been a yawn!! I guess I give it a chance --it did have good reviews."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"this book was just plain lousy. I have no idea what message she is trying to convey about missionaries or foreigner arrogance in the midst of the 'natives.' The only message that came across is that the missionaries are psychotic and the natives stupid, hardly a message worth reading about. The characters were two dimensional, especially the 'natives'. The setting was not fully realized and the plot never played through to a believable conclusion."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I was exited to read this book. The minute I started that excitement disappeared. I tried to read this book several times and I made it about halfway through before completely giving up. I was so disappointed I wanted to return the book and get my money back. I couldn't read another boring word."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Poisenwood Bible is a must read for everyone. I hope it has been translated into every written language and that it becomes required reading in every institute of higher education."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I received my order from this seller in a timely matter of 3-4 business days and the book is in PERFECT condition. I highly recommend this seller to anyone who is interested in purchasing high quality used books."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is one of the best books that I have read in a long time; however, it was probably 1 or 2 chapters too long. The details were so vivid that I felt the need to pull out a bible and a book related to the history of the Congo."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"What an amazing walk through the Congo is this book! From start to finish, Barbara Kingsolver's riveting descriptions and distinct &quot;voices&quot; make this a difficult book to put down. Told from five different viewpoints and five different well-developed characters, this book takes you into the jungles of Africa and into the jungles of the complex characters involved. A powerful piece of female fiction told in a strong and vivid manner, this book is sensational, never losing the interest of the reader."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"i found this delightful kingsolver book at times hilarious because of the pompous nathan (the dad and missionary). what a fun read. kingsolver does it again."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book has some great controversial statements regarding viruses and their role in the ecosystem near the end of the book. These comments create a great spring board for a class debate in biology courses. The book in a matter of a few paragraphs cover everything from overpopulation, the important role of viruses in the biosphere, how diseases are spread, how using antibiotics and vaccines has unbalanced the natural selection process, how our modern world enables super epidemics to occur, how scientists can love viruses, etc. You can get a lot of discussion and thinking going with just a few pages of this book plus the whole time students are debating or agreeing with a fictional character so the debate can remain more calm as no particular person or group of people are being attacked. The teacher can even express both sides of the issue in a neutral way to help students make up their own opinions.The entire novel is also good, but as a whole is not very applicable to the science classroom. The novel is also a bit too long for the average high school to read. Plus, there are religious undertones that may bring up more controversy than it is worth at the public school setting. However I do feel that is a significant book for private Christian schools to include in their curriculum. This book could be the foundation for an entire thematic unit. It really deals with the issues of being a missionary in another culture/country and how that can go terribly wrong if you enter those relationships thinking you are superior in any way instead of taking the true Christian viewpoint that we are all equal in God's sight. So the novel taps into topics in biology and environmental science, world history, missions, and literature as well as bringing up issues of debate and controversy so students can learn to think for themselves. That is why I feel it would be a good book for a thematic unit at a Christian school.I gave my book 4 stars because my copy arrived with a crease down the entire front cover. Amazon should not have sold this book as BRAND NEW with such a defect. Amazon needs to improves its quality control."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Borrowed this book from a local library years ago. I still remember it well. Very individualistic, well-done characters, living in an area of the world, and a time period, many of us may not be familiar with. African countries do tend to be ignored by my own. I am old enough to remember when Patrice Lubumba (?) was branded a Communist and enemy of the Free World and conveniently ended up dead. Just a great mixture of politics, history, real people, and fictional characters, with an ending impossible to forget.I may break down and buy my own copy, LOL."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book was a labor of love. It was a little slow in the beginning. The main characters are all reprehensible in their own way. And what makes them reprehensible is what makes them uncomfortably relatable and familiar. In harsh contrast to the villagers they live with, these people all try to bring their \\"1st World\\" pieces of America and use them in Africa (from cake mix to gardening to Christianity to democracy). They come to find that such amenities must either adapt to Africa, or be lost. As many reviews will say, this book addresses large variety of social issues. But more importantly, this book not only makes a reader question these issues objectively, but really feel them for the issues that they are. I loved this book; it not only grew on me but became a small part of me. DO NOT PASS THIS UP!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Ordered a book from Village Books, everything is fine arrived on time.... The main reason I am writing this is because of the personal \\"hand written\\" short note at the bottom of the invoice that comes with the book. I had a thank you using my name and was signed by Jenna! I thank you, good customer service is a must, and I will remember Village Books and the personal note! Priscilla"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"An avid reader, I have hardly ever read a book more than once.I'm now on my third run through and enjoying it as much as the first time."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Loved this book. Couldn't put it down! At first I wasn't so sure I wanted to ready about a Baptist preacher/ missionary in Africa with his wife and 4 daughters. But after the first few pages I was totally entranced with the story.You really get to know the characters and they were so relatable, except for the father.This is a must read for anyone!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Price family was forced by their husband/father to move from their Georgia home to the Congo in 1959. Orleanna Price and her four daughters give voice to the 30 year journey this family takes acting as unwilling and unwelcome Baptist missionaries in Africa during a period of violent political unrest.I very much enjoyed the structure, with each chapter narrated by a different character. Kingsolver does a great job of establishing and maintaining a very different voice for each character and I found myself particularly looking forward to Adah's and Leah's chapters. I found Rachel to be a bit unbelievable, so extreme was her vanity and selfishness, even to the end. I was unsure of Kingsolver's decision to leave out Nathan Price's narration, but in retrospect, I think it was a good call. His voice is absent from the book, just as he was absent from the Price family. I would have liked to hear more from Orleanna. The foreshadowing was enough to keep me interested in reading to find out how certain events unfold.Many of Kingsolver's descriptions of life in the Congo are beautiful, but unsettling, and paint a vivid picture of life in the Congo in the 1960's. Unfortunately, they are also sometimes long winded and drag depressingly on. Some say \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\" goes on too long after the climax, but for me it just took too many pages to get going. A bit more editing in the beginning would surely cut down the number of people that don't make it past page 100 or so.For me, historical fiction has done its job if I am intrigued enough to investigate further the events described and I was. I knew very little of the US involvement in Africa during the 60's and I found myself Googling Patrice Lumumba and other events in the book. I also found myself pondering questions of racism, colonialism, and religious intolerance. I would give it 3.5 stars."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I'll keep it brief because there are a lot of other reviews here. This is an excellent book that you'll want to read again and again. A friend lent this to me 10+ years ago, and I've never returned it. Every time I've read this book (about once every 3 years), I'm left with a feeling of awe. This is truly the kind of book that transports you to another place and time, and I'm so glad my friend hasn't asked for it back yet!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible is not the type of book I usually read. Generally, most of my reading is escapist - where the world is exciting and people are having a more interesting life than I am, and I want to switch places with them. (I assume they'd probably want to switch places with me too, since they don't know that they're in a book and everything's going to be okay at the end.)I would definitely not want to switch places with Orleanna Price or any of her four daughters. The Poisonwood Bible follows Nathan Price, a zealous and uncompromising Baptist missionary who drags his wife and daughters to the Belgian Congo. They are totally unprepared for what that means, and all sorts of unpleasant surprises ensue. Most of this arises from Nathan's total refusal to let Africa bend him to her will (as he thinks of it - I'd call it being adaptable.) In addition, the Congo is in the midst of gaining independence from Belgium, and major world powers are very interested in controlling the valuable resources of the fledgling new nation.This book is definitely going to stay with me for a while. I think Kingsolver did an excellent job of depicting life in Africa, although you should take that with a few grains of salt since I've never been there. It did ring true, though. All the characters - Orleanna, Adah, Leah, Rachel and Ruth May also seemed like real people, and all very different. I didn't have to look at the chapter headings to see whose viewpoint it was. Ruth May was charming in the way she reported things without understanding what the meant, Adah made a lot of sense as the \\"crippled\\" girl that was actually the keenest learner, Leah's devotion to her father was pretty heartbreaking and Rachel was also believable, although I didn't really like her from the start.I identified most with Adah - her limp, her palindrome poems and her quirky but organised mind made a lot of sense to me.I didn't know very much about the history of the Congo/Zaire, so the background of the book was fascinating. However, Leah and Rachel seemed to embody extremes on the political spectrum, and although I liked the contrast, I wouldn't take either of their opinions as fact. (I think that they are plausible opinions for the characters, though.) I've seen criticisms that the author was being preachy, but I think it was just Leah's character being preachy and Rachel being a little underdeveloped at the end. I kept hoping that Rachel would redeem herself, but she didn't ever seem to.There is no neat little bow of an ending, and the characters remain flawed in the end, even though they grow up noticeably. That's why I don't read books like this (general award/prize winning books) often - even though I appreciate them and I think they are masterfully done, they leave me very sad. Please note that I don't mean to insult The Poisonwood Bible by lumping it into an arbitrary category - I think it was unique."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"How do we get this book as required reading in American schools?! Impressive material!!! Great writing style!!!If an author captivates you in a story so much that you want to do addtional research on her subject matter even after you've finally closed the book for the final time, she has done her job and then some.Fasinating story! Even better written, told through the personalities of each of the main characters, not all of whom we would be proud to be represented by.While it is clear that she didn't like all of the characters she wrote about, she told the story from her perspective, it's her artistic right not to like a character and to write in such a way that the reader also dislikes them.Loved it! Would like to think that I am a changed and better person after having read it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is by far the best book I have read in a long, long time. Kingsolver has outdone herself. It just bowled me over. This is an incredible story that haunts you long after the last page is read.It's like watching a car crash in slow motion. Disaster looms ahead plain to see, getting closer and closer and finally it hits with awesome power. And then hits again. Chaos and disaster are seldom written with such compassion - or wit. I laughed in even some of the most horrible moments. As always with Kingsolver's stories, the human spirit triumphs.This book starts slow. Think malaria, think the haze of jungle heat. Think of ghosts. In this modern day and age we are accustomed to our entertainment starting off with big explosions and fighting. Not here. Be still and let the jungle creep in on you with vines and fungus. Let this story invade you. It picks up as you read on.This book is like two books really. Some say this is bad writing. In truth, it is two books. And that's how it has to be. There is a before and there is an after. I found it very effective storytelling. The shockwaves of the central tragedy continue to ripple through the characters' lives as they go their separate ways.This book stays with you long after you finish it. Kingsolver delights flipping your ideas of what is good and what is evil, what is disgusting and what is noble. Here, even snakes have their place in the universe. Biblical notions of justice meet up with modern-day politics, medicine, and private lives. Very provocative.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I walked into this novel thinking that it would be an utter waste of my time, since I had to read it for summer AP English work. Having finished it, I've realized that I was completly wrong. This book was amazing! So many words of praise come to mind when I think of this novel. It placed me in the center of a bitter-sweet experience that not only affects the lives of the characters but also that of the reader. The Poisonwood Bible was touching in every sense of the word and it was definitely worth the hours I put into reading it. Kingsolver's characters were believeable and extremely well-developed. The plot was unique and intriguing and I found it virtually impossible to put down. The beauty and majesty of this novel are hard for me to express, after having found myself drowning in such words and such a story. I am exceedingly pleased that Oprah has placed it on her Book Club list for June and I would whole-heartedly recommend it to anyone. Enjoy this mesmerizingly wondeful experience!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barabra Kingsolver is one of the best novelists writing today. With the Poisonwood Bible, she has surpassed even her own high standards. It is a journey into daily life in the Congo of the mid-twentieth century and onward, a journey that we should all take. I appreciate the depth to which she explores the characters, even with the most challenging of persons and circumstances. I learned through this book about an Africa I never knew, and it changed my life."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Wow! What an amazing book. The charcaters are absorbing, the attention to detail is fabulous. This is one of those rare books where even weeks after finishing it, I find myself thinking, &quot;I wonder what so-and-so is up to now?&quot; I miss these characters! (OK, I don't miss Our Father, but I miss the rest of them.) If only there was a sequel..."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The book starts with the description of many things, including each of the characters. After about two weeks of reading this book, (which is quite unusual for someone who can read 600 pages in two days) I am nearly at the end of this book. I have enjoyed the entire thing, thinking that everything has been added for some certain reason. From the descriptions of Nathan Price, i have come to hate him. I long to reach out and strangle him. But I find it obsurd that the Price Girls didn't just up and leave after he stopped caring about his wife and children. This adds to the book, but it made me hate him all the more. I think my favorite character would have to be Adah. On the outside she is supposed to be stupid, disfigured and useless. But if her family would look at what she could do, what she thinks of, they would see her as what she truly is. Magnificent. Ruth May was next. She captured my heart the way she rambled on about things that should not be said. But she said them anyway. She was brave through it all. Leah was next. At first I dispised her. But as she grew away from her father, and to see what exactly he was doing to their family, I like her even more. They way she stood up to him, and did what she wanted to do, inspite the fact of being a girl, inspired me. Even Rachel at some points I liked. Not for her beauty, or her selfishness ofcourse. But because she was so lost, in the wrong place at the wrong time. Barbara Kingslover writes a wonderful book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This the best new book that I've read in a couple of years. The characters are wonderful and so well portrayed that I felt as if I knew them personally. As a visual person, I immensely enjoyed all of the word pictures and symbols that Kingsolver used to make Africa come alive for me. If the last third wasn't as good as the first two thirds of the book, it still remains a truly great book that haunted me and that I will carry around for some time to come."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I opened this book with trepidation, having talked to someone recently who wasn't overly happy with it. It is a wonderful, heartfelt, and too real picture of the quintessential evangelical hyper-religious family. A beautiful portrayal of Africa, too. My only qualm, and this is a minor one, is that like a fantastic Beethoven Symphony (pick your favorite) the plot is developed, the characters are rich and complex, the setting perfect, every note, in fact, brilliant, and then the ending is dimmed by a too-long farewell. It seemed to end. Then end again, and again. But &quot;the girls&quot; who tell the story deserve the attention: they are the brilliance sparkling through the red dust of Africa. I own and love all of Kingsolver's works, and will no doubt read this one again. It is so precise in voice and tone and characterization it could be used as a text book in a writing class. Truly inspiring to those of us who also try to write."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I read this wonderful book as soon as it came out and thought it was fabulous. My husband had not read it and we purchased the unabridged &quot;books on tape&quot; for our road trip to Yosemite! What a brilliant idea it was! We were captivated by the language and appreciate the beauty of the parables and analgoies. I HIGHLY recommend the audio version of this great book!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I could not put down this book at all! I loved every minute of it. The contrasting accounts given by the main characters in the book hold your attention. I have recommended it to all of my friends and co-workers."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I've enjoyed Barbara Kingsolver's earlier novels, but in comparison to The Poisonwood Bible, they are enjoyable but slight, a pleasure to read, but hardly the stuff of the best American literature. The Poisonwood Bible is different. Here, we experience the life of a river village in what was the Belgian Congo and then the larger &quot;independent&quot; Zaire in the 60s, 70s, and 80s through the senses of the wife and four daughters of one Nathan Price, missionary preacher from Georgia. Arriving in the Congo in 1959, the family is not so different from other white Southerners of their time. Yet while Kingsolver could easily have made them static stereotypes, each of the female narrators moves with the course of the historical, social, and political events they encounter, growing and differentiating as individuals. In the process of telling their stories, they make it clear that we all have choices, and that these choices have both roots in the choices others have made before us and consequences for those choices we will make later. Kingsolver's characters help us reflect on the ethics of our choices and the threat that if we do not respond to and change with the conditions of our human community, we will stagnate. The Poisonwood Bible is grounded in the realities of history, including United States policies that supported the brutal Mobutu dictatorship andt further plundered the country beyond the point of European exploitation of the early part of the century. With this historical backdrop, the novel and its main characters leave us asking, &quot;How do the advantaged of the world live with a history that has not lived up to our own ideals?&quot; and &quot;How can we, as individuals, lead moral lives when our governments do evil with our money and in our name?&quot; The Poisonwood Bible does not answer these questions, but they are woven into the fabric of the high-drama plot. This is not a perfect novel - whatever that is - but it is the kind of novel we need more of - thoughtful and thought-provoking, with the capacity to introduce readers to a time, place, and public-policy context that most white, middle-class, educated Americans know little about."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I loved Animal Dreams, but this book comes across as a mean-spirited tirade against missionaries and the Bible.This book is a story of a missionary family, and their inability to fit into the culture of Africa... or rather, mold African culture to fit them. This is a potentially rich basis for a book. The story goes aground, however, in it's unrelenting ridicule of the father, who is a very poorly developed character in the book. Kingsolver adopts the device of telling each story from the point-of-view of one of the family members, with the exception of the missionary father. By ommitting the father's perspective, she avoids having to explicate the most interesting part of this story: the struggle of imperfect people to act on what they see as spiritual truth. Graham Greene wrote masterfully on this topic in 'The Power and the Glory'. If the father's perspective had been given, then we might have some sympathy with his personal pain and humanity, which is clearly not the author's political objective with this book.Ultimately, Kingsolver attempts too much in this book. She derides American cultural imperialism, capitalism, the Bible and traditional Christian traditions, &amp; European and American political exploitation of Africa from Angola to South Africa. All this heavy-handed lecturing weighs down the story. Very little attempt is made to balance the narrative by introducing fully developed, &quot;good&quot; white people. And after 500+ pages, the story ends with all the major characters cynical and disillusioned (or dead).Hopefully most readers will realize that most missionary men do not beat their wives, or have contempt for the people they serve. This isn't true today, and I don't believe it was generally true in 1960 either."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Reading other reviewers celebrating all they &quot;learned&quot; about Africa from this work of fiction is distressing. I lived in the region for 8 years and find this book inaccurate in many ways. Perhaps Ms. Kingsolver shares the attitude that Farley Mowat expressed when he said that he &quot;never lets facts get in the way of the truth&quot;. Kingsolver's relativist &quot;truth&quot; is politically leftist and anti-religious, and she is apparently, like Mowat, not prepared to let facts get in her way.Just to name a few points:-The rebels that are portrayed kindly in this story, presumably because they were anti-western and anti-capitalist, were in truth bloodthirsty terrorists of the worst kind. They killed the father of a friend of mine, a doctor in Stanleyville (Kisangani) for no reason, in cold blood. They murdered thousands of their own countrymen as well.-The migrations of the army ants are not at like they are described in this book.-To paraphrase Lloyd Bentsen, &quot;I knew missionaries in Congo. Missionaries in Congo were friends of mine. Ms. Kingsolver, your characters are NOT missionaries in Congo.&quot; The main anti-hero in this story may or may not be plausible as a fictional character, but I am certain that no real character even remotely like him ever made it to Congo. What is the sense of talking about &quot;learning&quot; anything true about Africa from a fantasy?"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I picked up The Poisonwood Bible hoping that it would be a good old-fashioned historical epic. While it started out rich and interesting, the five-person narration soon grew wearying. The characters are not fully developed at all, and except for their annoying tics, seem to blend into one another. We never figure out what motivates them, why they move in such different paths.When the novel begins to stretch out over the span of decades, it stretches thin. With all the political commentary, it becomes a mere &quot;and then this happened.&quot; While I believe that there is room for political commentary in novels, I don't believe it should be there at the expense of a sound structure, coherent storyline, likable and realistic characters. I learned only a little about Africa because it was framed in such long, factual paragraphs which read like news broadcasts. I wanted more from this novel. I wanted to understand how this family found a way to integrate their African experiences into their personalities even after their horrible ordeals. Instead, I was mostly glad that they managed to escape. In this book, Africa reverted back the stereotypical &quot;dark continent&quot; or Conrad's novels..."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"My reading club suggested the book so I read it. I found some of the charachter's interesting but I couldn't understand why the mother or the daughters ever loved their preacher father. The oldest daughter seemed like a character from \\"Clueless\\" but without money or brains. Families can be weird but these characters didn't seem to belong together.I was interested in the book because our parish priest had \\"Survived\\" the Belgian Congo. He came back from the Belgiam Congo in the 1960s with the ability to speak several languages.Except for the characters in the book I had never heard of a Missionary going to another country without training or support. The only Missionaries I ever met worked at a school or hospital or worked on another community service such as building homes or digging wells. The only Missionaries I've ever met whether Catholic, Protestants or no religion at all received training in languages and culture, even in the 1960's. The Poisonwood story just doesn't ring true.On a religious note: I never met Baptists who preach from texts that are not in the King James Bible, that is from texts in the \\"apocypha\\" such as Bel and the Dragon from the Book of Daniel. I never met Baptists who are hyperfocused on Baptism in the River instead of Salvation.Then when Orleanna finally decides to save her daughters she sends her oldest daughter on a plane with a \\"Slimey\\" older man who obviously intends to live with the girl. Also, this teenage daughter is okay with it?? Too weird."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The concept sounded promising: The life of an American missionary family in the heart of Africa in the early 60s. The fact that the preacher is a lunatic also helps. Eventually we find out that the book is really not about religion or missionaries, but about fairness. Or even better: the lack of it.A few things caught my attention. The politics were quite interesting. I didn't know anything about the independence of Congo and how America helped to kill the country's ambitions to perpetuate one of the most corrupted dictatorships in the 20th century. I also enjoyed the development of the story until more or less the last 150 pages.The problem is that from the beginning, the author had the tendency to be redundant and prolix. Sometimes even some stream of consciousness. Very often I didn't care. I read those words as just words to fill pages. But since the topics were engaging, I kept reading and turning the pages.The last act lost its steam. Eventually the negatives surpassed the positives and the story just dragged. The characters just mumbled the same old, same old. There were some new perspectives here and there, but it felt short in justifying the number of pages dedicated to the last act.In the end it is a mixed bag. I recommend only if you really want to know more about the life in Africa and don't care if it's told by - sorry for the word - boring people."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Fantastic story line, dynamic characters, and life issues we all deal with. Great depiction of the human condition, including the intricacies of family, convictions, and faith. All in highly readable prose that draws you in and makes you hunger for more."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book was written so wonderfully. The characters are realistic and you can't help but get attached to them. The book is very realistic, albeit a bit dark and moody. Still, the progression of the character's through their lives and their associated journeys is amazing. I enjoyed this book immensely."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I loved it. I went into it without expectations, yet it was not what I expected. I really liked the different voices in which the story unfolded. She told it from the point of view of the wife and each of the four daughters. Caution, it is not a Christian book. The father of the family took his wife and four daughters to the Belgian Congo in 1959. He was very rigid in his teaching and unbending in his approach to the people and the culture. The girls tell what happened to them as a result of their father's interactions with their new neighbors and of just being so unprepared for the new culture and for the politics of the day. A good story."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible is beautifully written and uniquely so. The vantage points of five strong females fuels a story about guilt, religiosity, spirituality, innocence, cultural differences, and forgiveness. I am in awe of Kingsolver's interpretation of Adah and Orleanna in particular - the beauty of these passages is unparalleled in modern literature. I was moved, inspired, self-reflective and encouraged as a result of reading this book. It will be a cherished addition to my personal favorites and I encourage any and all to read it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is the first book that I have read that has been featured on Oprah's Book club. It is a good book (definitely not great) and very entertaining in parts. If I am going to read books because of their accolades, then I probably am better of sticking with the classics, the Nobels, Pulitzers and other critical award winners. The two major short comings in my humble opinion are:1. Simplified characters. You have the bigoted, ultra-evangelical, ignorant father (no problem with that - we need to have books with all kinds of characters, good, sympathetic, unsympathetic etc), but we only see him as a 2-D character. We do not know what makes him tick directly from his actions or from his behavior, only that he is a stereotype - a Jerry Falwell type Christian whose comeuppance is all too eagerly awaited by the reader. What we do know about his inner workings is through editorializing (see point 2.).Similarly his two daughters, the intelligent, liberal that suffers from white guilt and questions her faith; and the dumb blonde that is ignorant to the point of being racist are stereotypical. Both observe the same crushing circumstances of Africa but have vastly different yet stereotypical reactions.The mother's character, her motivations and her reactions seem most fertile for development since she devoid of stereotypes. Her character shows a great range of emotions upon being thrust into Africa (shock, discomfort, acceptance, misery, desperation, courage) without ever becoming either a bigot or being swathed in \\"white-guilt\\". However her perspective is almost discounted.2. We all know that every Author has an agenda from Dostoevsky to Flaubert to Crichton, however the great ones let their character and plot advance the agenda rather than the narrator (the book is written in a 1st person with 5 voices - 4 daughters and mother). The book suffers from too much editorializing, which unfortunately adds to the page count. This book could have been shorter and sweeter."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver's book, The Poisonwood Bible, presented a story line much better than I ever expected. People had told me it was good, but they warned me it was long and may not be something I wanted to read in a month for school. I decided to read the first page and see if I got hooked or not...I got hooked. So I read this amazing book and loved it. Barbara Kingsolver did a beautiful job in creating a realistic plot of a crazed Vietnam War veteran/Free Will Baptist minister who drags his poor family to the Congo of Africa. This father, Nathan Price, shows the epitome of a male-dominated family of all women. The mother never has a chance to say anything and the daughters are assigned to copy 100 verses of the Bible if they do anything remotely &quot;ungogly&quot;. I loved the story being told by each daughters' and mother's point of views. It provided a unique story of teenage girls growing up in Africa, giving the opportunity to see each girl's reaction to this foreign land and all the changes one encounters when all the everyday comforts are taken away. The girls were different in every aspect: Rachel being the &quot;princess&quot;, Leah the wanna be daddy's girl, Adah the silent and limping twin of Leah, and Ruth May the baby. Adah was by far my favorite character because she chose what she wanted to do and how she would do it on her own. She read forwards and backwards because she &quot;learned in a whole new way&quot;. She took the time and had the patience to listen and see things everyone else had missed. Nathan gave you a character you loved to hate. He was hung up on the past and wouldn't get over it. He ignored his family who constantly had to fight various diseases and were warned to go back to America several times. He feels he has to suffer because he didn't die with the rest of his troop in Vietnam. But basically he's just a punk. This book has become one of my favorites, for no particular reason at all. It was just a good book that ended with a great feeling."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I finished this book in three working days because I had difficulty putting it down. The characters are well developed and the story takes place in an unfamiliar country that makes you feel like you're right there, and an interesting view of missionary life. These elements made my reading hours worthwhile. It might take a little while to get into the narrative but it's worth it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Kingsolver's book, &quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot; is worth reading. However, the books suffers from the style that she uses to tell the story.The story is primarily told by three fictional daughters of a missionary to Africa. At times, the accounts of the daughters are disjointed, rambling, and even a bit tedious. Kingsolver deliberately makes some statements of the daughters hard to understand, to emphasize their age and worldview, I believe. But its a chore for the reader to try and interpret what is being said.The second major criticism I have of the book is that Kingsolver paints a very simplistic view of the politics and turmoil in the Congo from its independence in 1960 until present. She seems to believe that the inhabitants of the Congo were victims of Belgian and than, later, American &quot;imperialists&quot; following independence. It seems clear from the way the characters tell the story that Kingsolver believes that if the Congolese people had simply been allowed to decide their own fate--without foreign intervention--than events in the Congo would have taken a much more favorable course. This is part of the tired argument that all of Africa's problems can be traced to foreigners, colonialism, and slavery. Surely, these factors have caused problems, but foreigners and colonialism left behind an economic infrastructure including roads, schools, ports, airports, and farms when the countries became independent. Those who seek an explanation for Africa's backwardness must also look to tribalism, geographic isolation from much of the world, disease, and a harsh climate.Having said that, the story does introduce readers to the tragic history of a nation deep in the heart of the jungles. It gives us interesting characters, such as the crazy missionary, Nathan Price, and the nationalistic school teacher, Anatole, to ponder. It gives a good description of how the Congo passed from the Belgians through its first elected government and into the hands of a military dictator, Mobutu. It also sets the stage and helps explain the recent turmoil there involved Laurent Kabila who was recently assassinated. It describes the interactions of three daughters who pursue very different pathways in life and what becomes of them.Its a mixed bag, but on the whole it was worth reading."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"i received this as a gift, and was quickly drawn into the characters. this book is more of an experience than just reading. the author uses five different voices to tell the story, and it is truly fascinating. given, it is a different sort of book, but it was a welcome change from my regular reading."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Definitely one of the best books I've ever read. I think three people got it from me as Christmas presents. The story is compelling in and of itself, but Kingsolver's use of the local African culture and mysticism is amazing. I also think she did an excellent job on character development with the three girls and the mom. They had such distinct personalities, opinions and voices and the emotional and intellectual development of the girls (with the exception of the eldest, of course)was so realistic. I would love to read other novels that Kingsolver would write, although I understand that mostly she has written essays."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I must say, I was a bit intimidated by the size at first, but some how I managed to jump in. Once I started, though, I just could not put this book down! It was just so realistic, you could really understand all the characters, it was like living five lives at once! Although a bit predictable in parts, it still kept you wondering what the other characters thought about one event or another. I really was amazed at the realistic points of view."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"All stories based in Africa deal with survival under extreme conditions (war, drought, floods, famine, disease, and infestations).This novel, however, is about overcoming the challenges that we find within ourselves. The extreme conditions of African village life are simply a backdrop to the internal struggles of a missionary family, the Price family, as each is transformed forever by the experience of life in Africa."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver's prose sounds remarkably like poetry in many places in this novel. Her sweeping phrases carry the reader to heights and depths of emotions while reading about the Price family. Nathan, the patriarch, takes his family to the Congo in the late 1950's against the advice of his church and his friends. He is obsessed with the idea of saving souls in a land of which he has no understanding. His misguided religious fervor blinds him to the perils to which he has exposed his family. He rules his family with the hand of a tyrant, using Bible verses as punishment and criticism of his wife and four daughters. Each chapter is narrated in turn by the five Price women. They all have distinct personalities and each views the events in their lives in a different way. Kingsolver compares their struggle for independence with that of the Congo. She compares the tyranny of Nathan with that of despotic leaders of the Congo. Her political views are very apparent, but this does not detract from the power of this book. Oprah recommends it and so do I."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I do not wish to share with you here my explicit feelings on Kingsworthy's writing ability, or give you a factual accounting of the plot of this book, but would like to share the indelible mark it left on my emotions.Throughout the first half of this powerful novel I felt my blood boiling from the tyranny, stubborness, calousness, and ignorance of Nathan Price, the central male character in the story. He is at once noble and pitiful in his righteousness. My jaw would clench and my brow furrow in a reader's fury over being powerless to step into the story and change what was readily identifiable as a crash course towards disaster for the Price family at this man's hands.During the middle portion of the book, I felt apprehension mount as the awful, gut wrenching climax approached. As a parent, I could not help but feel sympathy, sorrow, and anquish for what Orleana Price and her daughters went through either at the hands of Nathan or because of his indifference towards his family. When the fatal strike came, I was left in tears.Towards the end of the book, I was boored with the political commentary, but yet ached to see the surviving characters blossom and grow, to give me the reader a sense of hope amidst despair.Alas, all I truly walked away from the story with was profound sorrow from the oft dwelt upon guilt felt at the loss of an innocent child. Perhaps, as a father, I was too disappointed in the shortcomings of Nathan Price, or maybe I too readily imagined the pain at losing one of my own children.I feel sorrow for the lives of the other children lost in the story, but the eternal quest of Orleana for forgiveness from her lost child cuts too close to the bone and leaves me longing to hold my own forever close to me."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is a truly excellent book. I would recommend it to anyone who has tender feelings about life and the desires for happiness. As I read the book I could not believe that every thing I was reading was not exactly true. It is very easy to believe and is very touching; I will never forget. Isn't that often the real test? How long do you remember the book? I'll remember the Poisonwood Bible a very long time."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible, a historical fiction novel by Barbara Kingsolver, is a powerful novel about the unraveling of a family and individual souls' paths to moral justification and redemption. Kingsolver, an accomplished biologist turned successful author, weaves an unforgettable tale about the evangelical Baptist Price family and their mission to the Belgian Congo in 1959. Kingsolver's travels through Africa and her extensive knowledge of the Congo's political turmoil gave her an edge in accurately describing life as it truly would have been for the Price family. This is a powerful, gripping novel that leaves the reader with a sense of having lived in Africa as well, along with possibly a deeper sense of the workings of his or her own heart.Reverend Nathan Price, determined to baptize all of Africa into the Christian faith, drags his wife and four daughters from their home in Georgia into a completely foreign village in the Congo, with somewhat disastrous results. Completely absorbed in converting \\"heathens,\\" Reverend Price fails to notice the needs of his own family. The story is told from the perspective of Mrs. Orleanna Price and her four daughters; Rachel, Leah, Adah, and Ruth May. Kingsolver accurately and vividly paints the town of Kilanga, where the Price family resides, in a way that causes the reader to feel that he or she were another, unspoken member of the Price family, viewing and experiencing every brilliant twist of the plot right along with the rest of the Prices.Kingsolver effectively proves many points in her novel through the tribulations of a single family trying desperately to survive in an alien country while yet not sure of how to withstand each other. This book is a definite success, and Kingsolver's outstanding execution of the story leaves any reader gasping for breath once the plot unfolds, proving that love can endure even the most trying ordeals, betrayal can disintegrate nations and a single heart, and that forgiveness is one of the hardest yet most satisfying gifts to give and receive."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver creates a work of art in her latest novel, The Poisonwood Bible. Kingsolver truly succeeds in opening the eyes of the reader to a new perspective on: important events in history, religion, culture, and several other uncomfortable issues such as racism, which many authors tend to shy away from. All of these issues revolve around the Price family - Nathan and Orleanna, and their daughters, Rachel, Leah, Adah, and Ruth May, who move to the Congo in the 1960s. The book covers their trials and experiences, and the results of their time spent in Africa.To understand the book completely, one has to know a little background information about this time in history. The political scene in Africa was chaotic, with the ending of Belgian rule and the debate as to who would govern the newly independent country. Also, outside politics joined in the creation of the new government. This was the time of the Cold War, when the U.S. and the Soviet Union fought their battles in foreign lands and lent assistance and military aid to groups thought to be sympathetic to their interests. In effect, they wrought more trouble and misery for the Congolese people, just because of their petty disputes, which should have stayed in their own countries. This is the atmosphere in which the Price family landed and fought to survive in.The main themes Kingsolver touches upon are: religion, foreign intrusion, and racism. Religion is a key element in this novel - as one can see from the title. The imposed Christian religion is not depicted as a positive feature to the African culture, but rather a nuisance. Religion destroys Reverend Price because of his determination to convert the natives to Christianity, which made absolutely no sense to them whatsoever. Because of his persistence, a few children drowned or were eaten by crocodiles as he tipped over a boat in his never-ceasing attempt to baptize them in the river. This is the overall effect Christianity brought to Africa - destruction. Along with the missionaries came new governments and different cultures which were unwilling to adapt or accept the natives' way of life. Through Adah, Kingsolver tries to explain the impact of foreign intrusion. For example, when she is thinking about the foreigners who came to help the Africans raise the standards of their living conditions, even though they meant well, they ultimately did not help the natives' situation. \\"He meant to save every child, thinking how Africa would then learn how to have fewer children. But when families have spent a million years making nine in the hope of saving one, they cannot stop having nine. Culture is a slingshot moved by the force of its past. . .Overpopulation has now deforested of Africa. . .\\"(528). This quote fits the impact foreigners had on the Congo perfectly. Racism also plays a key role in this novel, which correlates to the time period it is set in. Leah marries Anatole, a native, and it seems wherever they go, either one or the other is facing the fact of what color their skin is. Anatole receives strange looks in Georgia, and Leah gets the same treatment in Africa, although partially for different reasons. \\"Never having known a white person before, they assume I must know Mobotu and all important Americans personally. In spite of my protests, I think they worry I'll report to someone that they had an orange to spare.\\"(501) This is the reason why Leah is singled out and avoided - because the natives are not sure they can trust her. These issues of racism, foreign intrusion, and religion are the main themes where most of the weight of the book is carried.One area I thought was not covered very much was the happenings in America and the Soviet Union at this time. This might have made the book more effective in explaining the politics aspect, but it is understandable why she does not include this. She probably left this information out because she wanted to focus mainly on events taking place in Africa. This is partially why this book is so unique - it is so different than the history books one reads in a classroom. It tells the tale of these events from the inhabitants' point of view. Also, the use of several narrators instead of one is very distinctive from the average book which is written in standard form and follows the rules of literature. One reason why this novel is so convincing and effective is Kingsolver's utilization of tone. Because she portrays the story through five dissimilar characters' eyes, the tone changes continuously from person to person, which makes an interesting read. The tone of sarcasm is connected to Adah, desperation to Orleanna, and doubt to Leah. Tones such as these toy with the reader's emotions, and therefore makes a larger impact overall upon the reader. I love how each character is completely different from the next and each has their own language and attitude. Ruth May is the innocent little girl who talks in incomplete sentences with grammatical errors. Rachel is the girly teenager who talks like a valley girl and does not get the bigger picture - other than herself in the mirror. Adah is the half-brained sister who is mad at the world and pessimistic, yet sees the truth when no one else does. Orleanna is the desperate mother, trying to keep her family from falling to pieces, and her husband, Nathan, is the dominant, self-righteous male who hides behind his religion. Each character is different, but adds contrasts and twists to the story.Overall, this book is amazing. The Poisonwood Bible contains scandalous, untraditional ideas, which are actually very truthful. I liked this book, partially because I agree with most of her points she touches on. I would definitely recommend this book to those who are free thinkers and do not believe in everything they are told. This book unquestionably has balls! I'd give it 5 stars!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver's The Poisonwood Bible is an excellent novel which deals with issues of culture, race, religion, family, and politics in an engaging, heartfelt, funny and moving manner. The five narrators, each with a different personality and voice (Kingsolver is especially talented in this area), are easy to care about, and are fully realized as opposed to 'mouthpieces', as some have claimed. The last half of the novel does tend to be more straightforward with its political leanings, but the issue is complicated, and requires maximum explanation (Kingsolver, I thought, did a great job of not keeping it &quot;too political&quot; anyway). Why do people resist politics in literature? Art is meant to entertain, yes, but also to enlighten, inform, bring about change. If Alice Walker or Richard Wright--two great writers, among many others, whose politics are evident in their work--had refused to be political, we wouldn't have the wonderful body of work we now have about the black experience. Subtlety, which for some reason is sacred in literature, is way overrated. I like and respect Kingsolver's ability to craft a wonderful novel not ashamed of it's partly-political nature. Aside from that, her prose itself is worth reading the book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"With 1105 other customer reviews here as I write this, there is really little more to say about this excellent book that hasn't already been said, just want to add my 5 star vote.Two stories are told, first of all it is a women's story, a fanatic Baptist preacher gone mad takes his wife and 4 daughters with him to the Congo to save the souls of the &quot;children of Ham&quot;, the Price family will never be the same again. The part of this novel that impresses though is the overview of the Congo's colonial history and a more detailed examination of U.S. involvement in this region during the 20th century. Some reviewers have criticized Barbara Kingsolver for &quot;pushing her political views onto her readers&quot; and &quot;having an agenda&quot;. You bet there's an agenda here, and it's a great one, this kind of story needs to be told.I recommend this highly for western readers wishing to know more about Africa, colonialism, and/or U.S. foreign involvement."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"There are many ways to read this novel. I'd probably describe it as a family history, a historical analysis, an essay on cultural diplomacy, and at times an epic poem all rolled into one.I won't go into the plot, because plenty of other reviewers will as well, except to say that the first half pretty much goes day by day, while the last rushes through 30 years. This particular style was appreciated in that it made the book shorter (and the book is a little long) but on the other hand, the latter half left me feeling a little deprived. I liked the daily adjustments that the young daughters were making to their lives in Africa - Kingsolver's rushing the reader through the later years meant that you didn't get to experience their thoughts and observations in the same intimate manner, and it is during the latter half, when the family goes their separate ways, that the comparisons between them get really interesting, as one returns to western life, and the other two make very different choices in their new adopted home.Much has been said in the other reader's reviews about the emphasis on the differences between the Prices and their African neighbors in the Congo. But this is also a book about family. I would imagine that some readers will see a little of their own relationship with their sisters in the relationships between Leah, Adah, Rachel, and Ruth May. The ways that they communicate to each other, their resentments, jealousies and the common bond between them (basically, their nutty father) set against the Congo background is what, for me, made this a really entertaining novel.A must read if you're a fan of Kingsolver. If you're new to Kingsolver, you may want to take on a less ambitious work of hers, like The Bean Trees, so that you won't be too surprised at her takes on Western culture and values as compared to those of more land-based, native cultures. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I am not a reviewist per se, other than I very much liked how the book was written, what the story told and especially the characters on both sides of the story. You could certainly feel yourself trying to experience every single thing the characters did. It was breath-taking and wonderous. How easy you find yourself hating one character to only change your mind again and again. I think the book was brilliant and have personally recommended it to all my friends, as well as loaned my copy out."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is a brilliant book, beautifully written, that keeps you entertained as well as intellectually stimulated. One of my favorite aspects of the book is the way it is written - told by five very different women of one family. This style gives an innovative perspective into the lives of people you might otherwise resent or despise greatly, and makes one think about how we perceive people and how mistaken we might be about who they really are inside.In addition, you learn first hand how different cultures are, reflected, among other things, through different languages. Who can read the book and forget the infamous, &quot;Tata Jesus is Bangala&quot;? Do yourself a favor - take the time to sit down and read this book. It is worth every second."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is one of the better novels I have read as of late. The story begins when Nathan Price, a missionary, drags his wife and four daughters to the Belgian Congo in order to &quot;save&quot; the natives from eternal damnation by baptizing them in the river. The problem is, they do not want to be saved and even fear the river due to the crocodile situation. Meanwhile, the story is narrated by five different characters, the wife and each of her four daughters. The amazing thing about the book is that it works at all. You would think it would be tough to follow and confusing since it involves five different points of view, but Ms. Kingsolver pulls it off beautifully. The story flows almost effortlessly from one character to another without a break in the telling of the plot. She always seems to choose the right words to make the story work.I also must praise the research done on this novel in order to get the historical facts about the history of the Congo so right on the money. This is like a history lesson on the Congo except it is not revisionist history. It tells the truth and it is not always so flattering to the US. This novel took a lot of courage to write and publish, thanks to the First Amendment."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I loved this book. The characters are wonderful and the history is interwoven magically. Barbara Kingsolver is one of my favorite authors. This book tops Animal Dreams, which, for those of you who liked Poisonwood Bible, is highly recommended, although completely different."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I enjoyed The Poisonwood Bible very much, although the story would have been more effective, in my opinion, if it had ended earlier. The last 150 pages, while interesting and informative about the Congo's history, detracted impact from the story. I began to care less about the girls because much of the drama had gone out of the story. After a climax, a story should tie up lose ends, not continue for 200 more pages!!! It is hard to conecntrate on deep meanings when all that you want if to be done with the book. However, I might be biased because I was reading for a school deadline. Also, near the end, I felt that Kingsolver was trying so hard to be &quot;profound&quot; that she lost some of the truth that was so evident earlier in the story.The best part of the book was the way that Kingsolver made her characters come alive. Each person had a distinct personality, including the Congo, and this made the story seem real. Like a documentary that really happened, yet still interesting. I could identify with each of the girls, imagining how I would react if I were put in their place. Also, the story really made me think about values and life in general. While Adah did not value human life or really care much about others, Leah felt too deeply the hurt that humans can perpetrate upon one another. The Poisonwood Bible made me think, even if I felt at times that it was trying too hard."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book manages to open the door to a new world - a painful, fascinating, different, colored, multifaceted one. While I cannot tell if Kingsolver is historically accurate, I realize that the Poisonwood bible create its own world and its own history. You will want to keep this book, and read it again.Amazingly, each of the five voices evocated by the book become as real as your own family members - how did one person, the author, manage this tour de force? being one and five at the same time? All the while depicting a sixth person, Nathan Price, central figure and yet so shallow and voiceless."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book was probably the best I have read in the past few years! Though long, it was difficult to put down. I found the beginning sections humorous (sometimes in a sad way). The middle to end chapters moved me to tears frequently - I needed to put the book down a few times in order to recover from the emotional impact. The writing from the perspective of each main character (except the missionary? ) was fascinating, amusing, and informing. I can't put more into words, except that I absolutely loved this book. For anyone who has a little child (as I do), be prepared to be moved very deeply."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"How could Kingsolver have ruined her book with such an obvious error? Nathan is a strident paper doll that flattens the whole story. Just as bad, the author has all the narrators using the same ironic tone to describe him, deadening their voices as well. At the same time, Kingsolver doesn't have the guts to show him doing something trully terrible. I don't trust an author who can't let the reader make up his own mind, and as a consequence I couldn't trust her views about ANYTHING in the story. I'm giving this two stars for her descriptions of the African landscape, and that is all."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Besides being a wonderfully absorbing story (tho it took about 50 pages to grab me)..this is one of those books that changed me a little...made me look at myself from a different angle..and peaked a formerly nonexistant fascination with African history. Kingsolver's characters are rich with beauty and ugliness and familiarity. This book is a new experience..a story to be read slowly and absorbed, tasted. There's unbelievably dysfunctional family relationships, the gentlest of love, breathtaking danger and hardship in everyday life, fascinating insite into a remote culture, conflicts in religion, atrocities by the leaders.. all set in the Congo..and you are there seeing it and feeling it in a way never before possible. This is a delicious book. Read it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolvr has eloquently crafted a marvel here. In the Poisonwood Bible, she relates the story of fiery, self-righteous Baptist minister Nathan Price, who drags his wife and four daughters into the Congo in 1959 for missinoary work. Settling in the village Kilanga, on the Kwilu River, adventure soon unfolds.Told from the point of view of all five female characters, the story is related very differently. Rachel, the teenager, the adolescent twins Adah and Leah, the child Ruth May, and the mother, Orleanna make up this tale.While this delivery in tale is unorthodox and rewarding, the characters all have their flaws. Rachel's self-centeredness and misplaced priorities are frustrating--she genuinely cries over a hole in her favorite dress while children starve outside--as well as her inability to use correct phrasing (a &quot;tapestry of justice&quot;). Ruth May is childly simplistic in her delivery (look for her speech on segregation in the first part of the book), and Orleanna's Earth Mother, wandering style grows tedious in the lengthy middle section.Leah and Adah are the most interesting, and I gravitated to Adah, with her disability and scorn for mankind. She is clearly brilliant, but ignored by all, especially by her smugly self-righteous (to the pointof being insufferable) father.The Poisonwood Bible is at first a slow read, for the first 150 pages, but it soon picks up as the tension rises and falls...characters like Tata Ndu, Brother Fowles, and Anatole onlyh add to the excitement, as does the revelation of what became of each of the wayward sisters as the book ends around 1998.A fiction that dips into politics, the Poisonwood Bible is an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is a book I never would have taken off the library shelf except that it was chosen for our book discusion gruop....and am I glad! I had a difficult time putting it down as I waited anxiously to see what was going to happen next. I am glad I was unable to obtain the book from my library as I might have had difficulty reading it with all the forgein names and wording. The book on tape made it quite easy to grasp as it is spoken well and all the characters had a different voice inflection. In spite of a few times being confused with who was speaking I was absolutly mesmerized. I found myself asking the same questions..&quot;Where was I when when all this was happening?&quot; While they were busy gathering wood and boiling water all day, I was busy with raising my own brood and had my own distractions. I recognized names but was not familar with the history. This was an eye opening history lesson for me even though it was a work of fiction. It is obvious the author put in a great deal of reaserch. A must read or a must listen."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"One of the hardest things for some preachers to do is to discern their context. Nathan Price is quite literally 'blinded by the light'. His understanding of call and mission and God's revelation blind him to reality: he has no sense of the danger he has placed his family in and he cannot understand that the Word preached without attention to his context is poisonwood. Kingsolver's delicate and marvelous technique in telling the story through the eyes of a wife and four daughters is what keeps a person with this novel. The voices are real and distinct. In PB there is a primary difference between the female and male Price's. It is one of discernment and context. The women make a steady progression towards understanding the Congo-lese people, their context and God's revelation to them. Nathan never does. The way the girls see their alien world is pure truth at many times. And although we fastforward thru their adult lives - the ending of the Poisonwood Bible, is the most powerful statment of love and truth I have read in a long time."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"If you want to learn about history, travel around the world, do character studies, or heighten your senses,reading Barbara Kingsolver's Poisonwood Bible will allow you to do these things and more. She is to be commended on researching the politics,the wars,the inhabitants, the food, smells and strifes of a bygone Belgian Congo and the missionaries sent to change it all by coversion to Christianity as we know it. You are sure to identify with one character as much as you will dislike another. The journey into the heart of the story is slow but well worth the ride."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible was an amazing book. Little plot--that is, there's no climax visible at first, but it makes up for everything in the way it is told. Beautiful. Each of the narrating women seemed to be alive. Looking at the book days after I'd finished it, I marveled that the characters were only words on paper. This was a book that I could not, really could not, put down. I slogged through the first hundred or so pages to meet my reading quota for the week (the book was a school assignment), but once I'd made it that far, I found I had to keep going. I spent all of one weekend devouring it. It's the kind of book you don't want to read again after you finish it, an exausting read. But it grows on you, and you'll pick it up again. Don't miss this. God, I loved that book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"My previous review (sent less than an hour ago) contained the statement.&quot;What Baptist preacher anywhere in the world...&quot; I would like to qualify that with one single word to say, &quot;What fundamentalist Baptist preacher...&quot; The word, &quot;fundamentalist&quot; is essential."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Poisonwood is one of my all-time favorite books. I enjoyed Kingsolver's other novels, but this surpasses most everything else I've read. I love the symbolism used and the particular voices of the 5 women involved."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Our book club of 7 high school and college classmates (hence our name, XX Libris) liked this book a lot and lament that it was missed by the major award-giving bodies. Ms. Kingswood's style of differentiated viewpoints and moving from the current to retrospect worked. There was also lots of humor despite its complex themes. Some of us didn't even expect to like this book, but we were pleasantly surprised to find it compelling and rich in insight. It's not easy to find the book here though, so we actually lent our copies to our friends from another book club in the Philippines"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I highly recommend the Poisonwood Bible. As I read it, I found that it was very easy to become engrossed in Barbara Kingsolver's clever use of literary devices. Through symbolism, Kingsolver depicts many elements of the plot, and enhances the reader's views on many of the issues that are discussed.The Poisonwood Bible is a political allegory. Through the book, the reader obtains a view of the Congo, and what America did to it in the early 1960s. The book is narrated through the five main characters in the book. By alternating the narration between characters, Kingsolver gives us the first person narration and view points for each of the five characters. Through each character, Kingsolver also teaches us about the consequences of guilt, and the theme of pantheism as a superior form of religion. The many biblical references that Kingsolver presents give the book a solid tone, and support many of the points that the author makes.I would recommend this book to people that are willing to read very closely, as many important elements of the plot are missed by careless readers. I would also like to add that this novel is absolutely amazing. Kingsolver not only presents us with an abundance of literary devices, but also with an amazing plot that completely absorbs the reader."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I thought this book was interesting. it was really really really long, but it was also very good. I liked the way it was written through many peoples eyes and how each character was made so dynamic through their actions and personalities. I thought this book was a good read if you have a lot of time on your hands."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book was compelling and absorbing - until the final 100 pages or so. Having already read and enjoyed &quot;Prodigal Summer&quot;, I did have a good idea of what I was getting into with Kingsolver, but I had hoped for a bit less preaching. The way that the story was told, by employing alternating characters giving their oral histories, was interesting and kept things moving. And there is no doubt that Kingsolver is a very gifted storyteller and story artist. But I got the point already! The author didn't trust that her story was &quot;telling the story&quot; -- she had to ram it down the readers throat.I was also dismayed that there was absolutely no saving grace given to the Christians in the novel. Brother Fowles was a sympathetic character, but the author didn't really give him enough space. In other words, Christianity was definitely the antagonist in this novel, and portrayed as evil and poisonous.Very one-sided viewpoints put forth in this novel, and that's a shame, because it really does attempt to tell an important story."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I loved this book - raw, elegant, poignant, humourous - real. This book has it all and is honest. This book is for people who like to think and feel. A must read."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"A fine book. This is one woman's view told through 5 different voices. Certainly some witty and creative writing. However, I found that it became too preachy by the end. The author over-explains the lesson that she wants you to learn. As a result, I'm not anxious to read another of her novels."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Readers of the Bean Tree and Pigs and heaven will recognize her as an enjoyable read and a potrayer of characters you could believe actually existed and whom you love. You will not recognize her as a critically acclaimed writer whose book will touch a part of your sole you never thought you had. This is the book we should have been waiting for her to produce. It took her 30 years and I am so glad she took her time.The book is written in 5 voices, those of a mother and her four daughters. These women have traveled with their father/husband to the French Congo to become missionaries for a year. This is the story of how it changed their lives forever. A must read for everyone."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible is an enthralling tale of a family in Africa. Nathan Price, a man filled with with remorse and a passion for religion, is quite the character. The whole time I really questioned him for moving his wife and four daughters to Africa, but it makes for a good story. Rachel is the eldest daughter and feels being in Africa is the worst thing that could ever happen to anybody. Leah and Adah are twins who seem very alike but as the book goes on the author thoughtfully gives them personalities of their own. Ruth May is just your classic sweet little sister. The book is all about these characters, and some others, who are very interesting but sometimes focusing just on them makes the plot very slow. Kingsolver writes the book wonderfully, though and it is definitely recommended."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I enjoyed this epic so much; I read it twice and very well may read it again. I must admit that the first time I picked up Poisonwood Bible I was interrupted a few times and couldn't keep straight all the voices. (Kingsolver tells the tale of a missionary family's experience in the in the mid-20th century Congo in five voices: a mother, and her four daughters.) But once these colorfully drawn characters embedded themselves into my mind, it was to hell with the interruptions! Each character is unique and propels the story forward--the history of the village and the country's fight for independence unfolds. I couldn't put it down. Kingsolver is a master at her craft and this effort ranks in my favorite top-ten books of all time. I can't think of a higher recommendation than that.Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood bible, set in the troubled Congo of the 1960s and spanning thirty-five years, is the story of fire-and-brimstone Baptist minister, Nathan Price, his wife, the emotinally distant Orleanna and their four daughters, the self-indulgent Rachel, the tomboy Leah and her bitter and twisted twin Adah, and the curious and adventurous Ruth May. The story is told from the point-of-view of the women in the family. It encompasses a brilliant and fascinating premise that was almost completey destroyed with poor execution and storytelling. From the opening sentence, all credibility and belief in the characters is destroyed. Orleanna, not educated beyond high school, who calls herself simply, &quot;a housewife from Georgia,&quot; speaks like a Georgia housewife yet thinks in prose that would rival the musings of Michael Ondaatje. Rachel is even worse. Attempts to portray her as not-too-smart fail on all counts. Her malaproprisms quickly become tiresome and grating. What's worse, if accepted, they would reveal a brilliant mind rather than one that was lacking. Ruth May, an otherwise engaging five-year-old is also troublesome. At times her thoughts seem to be those of a typical five-year-old; at other times she sounds more like thirty. (At one point, Ruth May says, &quot;Rachel was Miss Priss, now she's a freak of nature.&quot; I have never met any five-year-old that could understand, much less make, that comparison.) Each voice is so overly distinctive that the entire book feels forced and contrived, two elements really good prose always avoids. The author also never lets us forget we are reading a book. This problem begins immediately when Ruth May says, &quot;My name is Ruth May.&quot; This is almost as bad as the archaic, &quot;Dear Reader.&quot; There are other problems with the book, the most evident being Adah's deus ex machina &quot;miraculous&quot; cure and the fact that the narration continues long after the story is really over. I was going to give this book three stars because the events in the lives of the Price family are interesting and well worth telling, but upon further reflection I decided to reduce my rating to one star instead. I just couldn't get past all the mistakes."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I lived in eastern Congo as a missionary, not far from Kisangani, off and on over 10 years.The Poisonwood Gospel can be divided into three sections. The first, involving the initial adaptation to the culture was hilarious and typical, not just of missionary experience, but anyone's experience of radical cultural adjustment.The second involves an excruciating buildup of tension to a surprise denouement, a real page turner.The book should have ended there. Unfortunately, the third part is a political tract. It is interesting in detail and gave me some new understanding from a point of view I was not accustomed to. Unfortunately, it was a bore.Factual problems. The Congo village described seems to be a composite African village. It seems to exist simultaneously in the savanna and the forest! Since I assume that Kingfisher is promising a forest ecosystem around the village, here are the savanna intrusions that I found:Lions do not exist in the forest. Kingfisher should have used leopards, which are far more dangerous to and feared by humans.Poinsettias do not exist in the forest. They are abundant, but exotic, to eastern Africa cities like Nairobi. There are trees with red tip leaves in the forest that remind me of poinsettias, but they hardly make any show of color that would be remarkable.African sleeping sickness does not exist in the forest.Most offensive to Congo people today: they do not stink. In fact, they wash frequently when not out in their fields. I, with my Nairobi-purchased polyester-mix fabrics, stunk more than they did with their second hand local market-purchased cotton clothing! Again, I would guess that Kingfisher was relating her experience with people in a big African city like Nairobi where people buy their polyester clothes new.Dust is more typical of savanna than of forest areas. So are wet and dry seasons. Where I lived, we had two seasons: wet and wetter.Finally, the driver ant invasion strikes me as a tall tale. Driver ants can invade a house or two, but a whole village?

Although it is a work of fiction, Kingsolver sets it firmly against the real life history and culture of the Congo that left me wanted more.I think that for the first time I got a emotional understanding of the the devastation that Africa has endured by the hands of her greedy suitors. I was embarrassed by my lack of knowledge on the region and the level of involvment of the USA and Western Europe in the bloodshed.After I finished the book I quickly snapped up KING LEOPOLD'S GHOST and AFRICA: BIOGRAPHY OF A CONTINENT and I'm still reading!I highly recommend this book and although I realize this a departure from Kingsolver's usual genre, I look forward to reading more of her heartfelt prose."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The two other Kingsolver books I read were easy reads and kept me interested so I picked up this book not expecting anything amazing. But, I was surprised. The characters and story were much more intricate and engrossing. The only complaint I have was the last 150 pages were basically unnecessary and drawn out. I feel the story should have ended much sooner after the climax. Of course I kept reading hoping for something more, but I walked away thinking mostly about the first 400 pages. The historical background is very interesting but, warning, it can be a very political book and you have to dig deep for it not too seem one sided."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible raises Barbara Kingsolver's writings to a new level from her previous books, as she weaves a powerful story of a missionary family going to the Congo in 1960 with the trials of survival, a domineering and crazy father, and ultimately the realities of the United States in international politics. Finally Kingsolver even includes philosophy about the human presence on the earth and environmental politics. Yet all of this is done through a compelling story of the mother and four daughters, all affected in very different ways through their experience in Africa \`of old' and Africa after \`independence'. This is a MUST READ for individuals who like a good story woven with history in a sensitive way. The story never suffers for the history, philosophy, or environmental aspects. But I came away thinking very seriously about each of these."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbra Kingsolver will capture your heart and move your soul. The Poisonwood Bible digs deep into the interrelationships of a family struggling with personal failures and their fight for religious beliefs in a country torn apart by war and racism. The book is stimulating and thought provoking. You will come away with a new perspective on the ways of the Congo."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver, already regarded as one of Americas finest authors, has written a book worthy of the highest literary priase called \\"The Poisonwood Bible.\\" The book is written in journal form, each section an entry written by one of four daughters whose father has taken them to the Congo in 1958 as he is a missionary with the intent of bringing the love of Christ to the \\"savages\\" of the jungle in Kilanga, Congo. In four important moments of the book, we hear from the mother who writes at the end of her life - after thought, the benefit of retrospect - while the four daughters unfold the story in their own words and style ranging in age from sixteen to six years of age.This book is a Bible for a number of reasons but largely because it's epic tale is one that can be seen as highly spiritual and should be re-read many times. The meaning of the book is different each time one reads it as our own lives unfold before us. We learn about sin; we learn about love and guilt; we learn about obsession and we are forced to look at the differences between the Ten Commandments and the intentions of Reverand Price (who is \\"any man\\" really) as he struggles with his new congregation and begins to seperate not only from his family and his \\"flock\\" but from reality itself, almost as though his own God has forsaken him.\\"The Poisonwood Bible' is simply the finest book written in the past fifty years. Barbara Kingsolver will be remembered with Dickens, Jackson, Emerson, Ibsen and Shakespeare. If you've not read any of her work, this is the book with which you should begin. Not one of us can read this book and then say, \\"It wasn't worth it.\\" Not only is it highly entertaining, it will move you spiritually so much that, like all holy books, you will return to it time and again."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bibleis a novel which commences with a concept which would sell any publisher: a guilt-filled WW II white-southern-veteran turned pastor takes his wife and four early-in-the-road baby boomer daughters out of the vibrant South and into the Belgian Congo - before Civil Rights here, before revolution there, and when things were much more simple. The time period: 1959-1964, with additional accounts in the last 150 pages.And, then the story begins. As the pages turn, the girls reach adolescence, and wish to be free from the confines of the pastor, free of the confines of a village with no amenities, and free of the world in which they live. Like most anyone, let alone a teenage girl, they want to return to the luxuries of American life in the 1960's. They don't.As they age, father's disfavor grows. \\"He noticed the children less and less. He was hardly a father, except in the vocational sense, as potter with clay to be molded. . . He never saw how Adah chose her own exile; how Rachel was dying for a normal life of slumber parties and record albums she was missing. And poor Leah. Leah followed him around like an underpaid waitress hoping for a tip.\\"Rachel, his eldest, flees. Twins Leah and Adah respectively stay and leave. Adah, who was mute and crippled in Africa and before, becomes voiced and without ailment when treated in the United States. Their mother, after enduring the wrath of her husband, is a ruined woman. In fact, she falls into depression while there and retreats to a life in her room. Her husband's response was not pleasant. \\"He forged ahead with his mission work, leaving the three older girls in charge of the hearth and home for days on end while he sallied out to visit unsaved, or to meet with Anatole about imposing Bible classes upon boys of tender years.\\"The girls eventually had to give up. They could never please him. \\"It's just lucky for Father he never had any sons. He might have been forced to respect them.\\" And, after he died, no tears are shed, but they had to acknowledge, \\"He was our daddy. I think you [Leah] always put up with him better than any of us. But he was as mean as a snake. There's nothing he got that he didn't deserve.\\" So much for the eulogy.Cleverly written in diary form, the book is split up into five parts. Those by the mother, Oleanna, eldest daughter Rachel, the twins Leah and Adah, and cute parts by the youngest, Ruth.Although this report may seem to be about a book written with a morose backdrop of struggle and family dysfunction, it is more embracing than such may seem. The personalities of the girls resonate with their autobiographical style of journal entries, and the crossing of topics helps to give the reader each party's respective perception of the major events which confronted this white family in the middle of the black Belgian Congo - today's Zaire."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"From 1972 through 1974 I lived in Zaire working on the Inga-Shaba power line. In addition to being a really entertaining read, this book was thought and memory provoking - providing new perspective for the political strings controlling my world, which I see more clearly with age. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Let me start by saying, I finished this book. It took 12 years, buying different verisons of it, and a student telling me that since I made him read Kingsolver, I owed it to him to read this book. In his words, at the end of the book I knew these girls. Well, as a deep follower of Kingsolver, I knew it was time to read. And I did that in a week and will never be the same person again. I've read other reviews about how it gets too political, the flaws of Rachel's characterization, but I've come away with a simple message that rings through all of Kingsolver's works, \\"Look at what horrible things we humans do to one another.\\" It needs to stop. Really, the core theme to all of her novels is the root and the depth of motherhood. We create life, but yet we throw it away if we don't understand it. We live our cozy American lives, buy our children too many toys, and when tragedy hits us, feel the world is against us. Yet, with each book, Kingsolver encourages us to get out of our \\"plastic\\" Rachel-like cocoon and see the world, and make it a better place. I always tell my students and my daughter that it takes only one person to make a change and while this novel may have some structural flaws it is an accomplishment and should shape us as Americans to stand up and make a change. Even a small one is good. It also teaches us the importance of being informed and getting our collective American heads out of the sand. So, I thank my student for making me read this, and I thank Kingsolver for writing it. This epic story will stay with me for a long time. And so today, I step forward to make a change because even a small one is a start."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"It took me a little longer than usual to finish this book for two reasons: its length and its pace. Being an English major, naturally I love reading all kinds of books, but my main diet outside of class consists of Stephen King novels. Where it normally takes me about three days to finish a King novel, this one took me about two weeks, but don't get me wrong; it wasn't boring or sluggish. In fact, it was so rich and chockfull of information that I had to read it bit by bit in order to digest it properly. Don't you just hate rushing to finish your books? Well, this one is captivating enough that it would hold your attention till the end, but it isn't too nerve-wrecking that you just HAVE to read it through the night... and end up looking like a panda the next day. So what else can I say? Grab a hot cup of tea, curl up on the sofa, and get ready to be thrown into the world of the endearingly crazy Price family while they battle the forces of the untamed Congo."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The story which Kingsolver composes in the Poisonwood Bible is rich and vibrant. Taking place deep in the Congo, she tells a highly plausable tale of a fundamentalist Southern Baptist preacher and his family (wife and four daughters) as they acclimate to the challenges presented in Africa.Kingsolver demonstrates a remarkable amount of versatility in her storytelling in that she switches perspective between each of the female characters throughout the course of the novel. Generally, these accounts maintain a chronological progression (they go from event to event) but every now and then, the characters tell different versions of the same story - a tactic which I find intriguing and which definitely adds variety to the usual chronological drone.If I could, I would change two things about this story. First, I would make the father a little less one-dimensional. Even feminist authors need to cut the main male characters a little bit of slack. Nathan, the father, is presented as tryannical, abusive, bullying and a general lout. The five women in the story (actually four, since Ruth May is too young to count here) spend virtually their entire time recovering from his mistreatments (well into their adulthoods). I found his characterization a little too blunt to be ultimately believable.Second, I would greatly reduce the malapropisms used by Rachel, the oldest daughter. She occasionally uses the wrong words in figures of speech when trying to sound grown-up and sophisticated, but the point gets overdone very quickly.Ultimately though, the drawbacks are almost negligible and certainly pale in comparison to the rich descriptions of interactions between the people, the governments (on the local, national and supranational levels), the environments (maybe it was because I read the book while on vacation in Cambodia, but the image of the hard red laterite soil stuck with me especially) and the rich jungle life. This book is a treasure and should be read not only for the political lessons but for a glimpse into a world completely unknown to the majority of westerners."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"A fictional novel and a New York Times Bestseller, the Poisonwood Bible tells a story of the Price family. Nathan, Orleanna,and their four daughters Rachel, Leah, Adah, and Ruth May are all on a journey to the Belgain Congo from their home in Bethlehem, Georgia. The year is 1965. Nathan, a Baptist missionary and &quot;soldier of God&quot; has set out to transfer his family and himself from their ingenuous Bethlehem, Georgia to the African jungle. The purpose of the move is for Nathan to preach the Word of God to the people of the Belgain Congo. Even from the moment that the family steps off of the plane in Africa, interventions, obstacles, and encroachments seem to interrupt the missionary work that is intended to be done. Some of these obstacles include: King Leopold, the democratic elections, a military coup, and the interests of the wealthy Westerners. Although these things stand in his way, Nathan will stop at nothing to pursue his intended mission. &quot;We came from Bethlehem, Georgia bearing Betty Crocker cake mixes into the jungle.&quot; This statement spoken by Orleanna forshadows the events that will later occur and that more is in store for the Price family than just cake.Nathan is an immodest, sanctimonious man of God. He tends to look upon the Price women shamefaced and feels these women are insignificant &quot;hens&quot; in the way of his mission. Although he's the central character of the novel, he never narrates. Everything is written through the views of the Price women. The chapters are arranged in order to show the wide variety of personalities and perspectives of each of the Price women.Orleanna is the most patient, has longativity, and fortitude. She often tells the reader of her expectations. She is also very secluded and is &quot;bitterly wise.&quot;Rachel is the eldest daughter of the four. She is overly concerned with her appearance and oftentimes imagines herself a beauty queen. Her biggest worry is surviving the jungle on her sixteenth birthday where no boys or records exist. The Congo isn't somewhere she prefers to be.Leah is strong and proud as her father. She idolizes and imitates his ways. She is fourteen years old and has a twin sister, Adah.Adah is a quite different character from the others. She was born with a disease called hemiplegia. Her brillant mind and constant anger show through her &quot;uneven, braun body.&quot;Ruth May is the baby of the family. She is all sweetness and curls on the exterior, but is very determined and defiant for a five year old girl.Kingsolver's brillant masterpiece has a mission of its own to take on. Her work is set to show writers that being firm in moral or political beliefs is important to writing. The carefully crafted characters are a wonderful contribution to the book and each person is sculpted with differing qualities. Orleanna is shown through her unanswered questions and striken losses. Leah is shown to embrace Africa the entire course of the book contradictory to the other Price family members. Adah is seen as the &quot;darker presence&quot; seeing all the horrors of the Congo. Kingsolver releases her inner pains and the complexity of her life because of disease. She sees the world through palindromes. Rachel is the vain, contemptious girl who is filled with humerous malaproprisms. She is captured in her &quot;feminine tuition&quot; and materialistic possessions. Ruth May is described by Kingsolver as the typical child, innocent and adventurous. Leah is resolved to be simply idealistic. Lastly, Nathan is shown to be shaped by the traumatic effects of World War II that the reader learns that he was in. The multiple voices that Kingsolver constructs is done to convey the &quot;enormity&quot; and &quot;complexity&quot; of the journey.An interesting point that should be mentioned is as follows: Barbara Kingsolver, herself went through an experience like the one she writes about. At age seven, her family moved to the Congo. Here, she learned ethnicity and discrimination because of her skin color. This novel of post-colonial Africa brings all to observe what Kingsolver saw and came to understand as an adult. The vulnerable humanity is revealed in this novel and she keeps a keen eye for the details to describe life in its most intricate aspects.This well crafted and interesting literary work is definitely grounds for a bestseller list (as it already has been). Kingsolver's endless explanation of every complex subject and vivid detail of the atmosphere and characters was well worth the wait to the ending of the novel. The most beautifully crafted work is done when the writer themself has seen their story in living color. Barbara Kingsolver's New York Times Bestseller The Poisonwood Bible is one of the most enthralling, entertaining novels that has come to life in a long time. The picturesque scenes and words through which the story is told will forever live in the mind of the reader penetrating down to the last impulse"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The first three-quarters of this book were truly outstanding.The author skilfully conveyed the different characters within the family and I really felt sympathetic towards their problems.Throughout there were beautiful descriptions of Congo.The problem I had with the book was that after the family's exodus the author goes on to describe what happened to each person during the next 30 years or so.I think this is unnecessary and I would have preferred to have imagined the family's future.The exodus itself was so dramatic and moving that it would be a perfect ending.This aside,I recommend you read this-the characters will stay in your mind for a long time."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I knew as soon as I started this book I would love it. It is by far my favorite of her novels. The story brilliant alternates between the sisters, each with her own voice and view of their world. The snapshot of a time period and place are wonderful, but the ability of Kingsolver to describe this same time and place several different ways at once is impressive."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I started reading this book on the train on my way to and from work and I looked forward to it all day. In my opinion, Barbara Kingsolver used each of the characters (Rachel, Leah, Adah and Orleanna) to exemplify different ways that people deal with tragedy. Although Ms. Kingsolver may have used the book as a sounding board for her views of the political history of Africa, I see nothing wrong with that - I believe the book may have encouraged people (such as myself) to learn more about Africa's history and people. All in all, I would highly recommed it to anyone who enjoys good literature - but be careful if you read it while you're on the train; you may miss your stop!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible is a good book written by a capable writer. I enjoyed this work of fiction very much. Ms. Kingsolver does an excellent job creating imagery, emotion, and characters. Her book is well crafted and helps the reader see the people of Africa and their culture in a different light. However, there are some serious flaws in her novel. First, her understanding of Baptist Mission Work in general. Ms. Kingsolver would have done well to contact Southern Baptists to consult about how missionaries are appointed, trained, sponsored and supported. Second, Ms. Kingsolver has the Rev. and daughters frequently quoting from the Apocroypha. This is totally out of character for Baptists, as these are a set of writings that most protestant demonations (and I suppose especially Baptists) do not view as inspired and are nearly totally unfamiliar with. The characterization of Rev. Price as a disturbed man, cruel and wicked, is a stereotype, and one we see far too often in modern writings. The novel would have had just as much power, perhaps even more, if he had been portrayed as an honorable, righteous, loving man who was so fixated on his mission that he did not notice the needs of his family. The portrayal of his cruelty and abusive nature hurts the story. Finally, I wonder, if Ms. Kingsolver's research was so seriously flawed in regards to the items I have already mentioned, I wonder how flawed her research on the Congo, the culture of the people, and the conflict she writes so well about might also be. Next time, Ms. Kingsolver writes a novel, I think she needs to research it a bit deeper."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Kingslover jumps around in the book letting characters tell the story. This could be confusing, but it is done in a very careful way and you don't get lost. I was afraid that this book would be overrated but I was enchanted. I had just traveled to Africa and found her depictions accurate and thoughtful. I also appreciated the insight into a missionary's mind -- a curiosity of mine. I would strongly recoommend this book to anyone who loves fiction."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The whole idea of an American missionary family going to the Congo to save lost souls, only to put their own in danger, fascinated me. What really interested me was why would anybody feel compelled to do so? Was it out of a real zealousness for the Word of God or was it borderline fanaticism that made Nathan Price drag his family into the heart of Africa? This novel answers these questions using the voices of Nathan Price's wife and four daughters in a prose that is wonderful and mesmerizing.However, I had to be patient with this novel, because it took me 100 pages to get into it, and truly enjoy the language. Also, the ending was very anticlimatic, and I think this book could've ended 150 pages sooner. I did give it four stars because I really enjoyed the middle, and I believe that part is worth reading."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"As an avid reader of Kingsolver's books I was already prepared to like the book. I was not prepared for the subject matter. I was the same age as one of the daughters in the novel and could relate to the times. My own church had missionaries in the Belgian Congo at that time and I could relate to the situation. I was completely captured by the rather unusual personalities of each main character. Ms. Kingsolver, as usual, left out the father as a speaker in the novel. I would like to read his thoughts. I was swept up in the action and absorbed in the descriptions. I no longer thought of my life as sparce. It is so completely rich after reading about what the girls had. It was an excellent read and my book club agreed."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I love Barbara Kingsolver's other books and I admire her politics. Unlike other reviewers I appreciate the history and politics in this book. Besides being a great story it inspired me to learn more about the Congo/Zaire, Patrice Lamumba, colonialism,and Mbuto, which in turn had me reading about Rwanda,South Africa,Uganda,Ebola, the CIA, Mountain Gorillas,consumerism and Belgium. I love a book that makes me want to learn more and this book certainly did. Besides that, it's entertaining, good fiction! The character's are amazing. I read constantly and this book it one of the few that I wanted to start again as soon as I was finished. If you liked it I'd recommend reading &quot;King Leopold's Ghost&quot; by Adam Hochschild for more history of the Congo."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Just when I had written off Kingsolver as a sentimental minor writer, she pulls off the Poisonwood Bible, a wonderful study of a missionary family which goes to Africa to redeem the primitives and are instead absorbed by them. Rev. Price is an egomaniacal man with a mission, a mission which does not in anyway fit the people he has decided to save. Even though he is wrongheaded and fanatical, he remains a sympathetic, rather tragic character, ultimately far more fragile than his wife and her four daughters who mostly and in different styles manage to coexist and survive in Africa through plagues, famines, and storms. The Africans come across as entire human beings for a change which makes the characters telling the story, the mother (from a distance of many years) and the four daughters (concurrently with their life in Africa) also more well-rounded. Leah and Adah are twins, one extroverted, the other so deeply introverted she does not talk, Rachel is the crass materialistic egotistical daughter, while doomed Ruth May actually seems to have a full life in Africa until she is bitten by a mamba and becomes a spirit overlooking the living, like a mamba herself, an invisible presence among the trees. I read this book without putting it down. Kingsolver also looks at the politics of the situation in Africa which, first flayed by colonialism is then carved up, its wealth made off with wholesale by the superpowers (especially the U.S. in its wrongheaded righteous attempt to stamp out Communism while giving corporate predators free rein), leaving the Africans to continue their endless struggle just to get through one day at a time. Perhaps that is after all a better way to live than to live like termites eating through the substance of the world."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I have to say, first off, that I loved Kingsolver's earlier novels. But this diatribe, masquerading as a novel, left me cold and bored. I didn't think the characters ever evolved--instead, they came upon right and wrong answers in completely predictable ways. Yes, the politic ideology is mine. But I don't want to have it parading around in the guise of a story. I felt Kingsolver's complete disinterest in Reverend Price was disheartening, at best. He was no more than a pasteboard Bogeyman. And her grasp of Baptist religious rites was woefully inadequate. Why would a Baptist minister quote the Apocrypha? And why would he be interested in baptizing children? The lower churches, like the Baptists, consider baptizing only an external mark of an internal conversion--and therefore unnecessary for &quot;eternal life.&quot; Furthermore, the last three books of her novel, once the Rev. Price is missing, devolve into a hideous set of &quot;tellings.&quot; I am constantly told &quot;what has happened,&quot; not allowed to experience it as an upfront narrative. I simply felt that Kingsolver may have believed she has outgrown the need for a good editor. Someone needed to bring a sharp pair of pruning sheers and a good sense of narrative development to the project."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I was given this book as a gift from a dear friend for my 21st birthday, and it was several months before I actually picked it up to read because I'm not a religious zealot and thought that this book would try to \\"convert\\" me into something I didn't want. Boy, was I wrong!I cannot begin to describe how complete I felt after finishing the book. It made me feel... alive, I suppose. There are people in this world who do things because they fear the wrath of God, there are still others who do things because they fear the wrath of their husbands, and further still there are those who do things out of fear for consequences of their actions. This novel covered all of those aspects, and then some.I was left with a better understand of what life was like for this family and the hardships they endured in order to simply survive.Very well written, and highly recommended to anyone, no matter whether you are religios or not."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"A few years ago I had to read this book as part of my summer reading program. Usually I would dread the list of books given to me, but this time I fell in love with the book I chose. You guessed it, it was The Poisonwood Bible. It was hard to put this book down and I would highly reccomend it to anyone who loves to read, or more specifically, loves stories that focus their attention upon the characters internal struggles. Though the format of the book was new to me, I enjoyed it thoroughly and am planning on reading this book again sometime!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This was a very difficult read for me & not because of the politics. I already knew the history & already shared the author's view of the impact of Western \\"civilization\\" on Africa. I found much of the writing in this book to be lyrical & beautiful - so much so that the large portions of the book that were frankly pretty pedestrian were incredibly disappointing.I appreciated that Kingsolver was able to write such distinctive female characters & disappointed that she seemed to blow past both of her story's antagonists - the father & the CIA pilot. Where her female characters had real life both of these characters were essentially caricatures & that blunted the force of some of her arguments as well as the dynamic in her storytelling.I also think this book deserved an edit. I was about 200 or so pages in before I got interested. The final bit of the book - a sort of freeflowing \\"Where Are They Now?\\" thing - seemed tacked on - as if Kingsolver couldn't decide what to do once she'd reached the denouement that pushed everyone out of the African village one way or the other.It's also unclear to me why the mother in the story gets almost no opportunity to speak when the bits that are written in her voice are among the most fleshed out. She's certainly a more \\"real\\" character (even in her silence) than is Rachel, the older sister who is prone to malaprorisms of one kind or another. I really wish that piece of gimmickry had been left out - without it Rachel would've been another interesting voice, but the visible technique of the device (like seeing the man behind the curtain) took me out of the story every time.Despite these criticisms, this is a book worth reading, if only for the very last chapter which is in the voice of my favorite character, Ruth May. That along with many moments of beautiful physical description scattered throughout the book make it a worthwhile read, if one that is sometimes incredibly frustrating."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is a superbly lyrical, multifaceted, psychologically and sociologically astute masterwork treating a white Christian missionary family's awkwardly tragic attempt to evangelize part of black Africa. Maybe part of my high appreciation for this novel derives from my wife's and my Christian missionary years as well as my later chairmanship of a large African languages department in the Washington DC area.Kingsolver's academic background in biology allows her to describe African flora and fauna with graceful power. Her descriptions of intercultural-understanding ineptitude, of political and economic upheavals, of rapidly shifting economic actions and reactions, are amazing. Here is just one example of her ability to reach depths of insight with quite simple words: \\"That's where I was cast ashore, on the riptide of my husband's ambition and the undertow of my children's needs.\\"I think women find this book fascinating because the story is told, each chapter in the voice of one of the females: the mother, then one of her daughters, then another daughter, then another, and so on, each chapter carrying the vocabulary and language style of its author. Because of the variety of ages represented by the five females, five different viewpoints carry the story along. The preacher-husband, though a principal character, never writes or speaks -- he is only described by each of the five females.I find that I recommend this book more often than any other novel I've ever read."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is a fantastic book. More than anything else, Barbara Kingsolver's characterization is amazing. At first, I wasn't sure how effective her multiple first-person point-of-view account would be, but her characterization was so unique, detailed, and consistent that the characters felt like real people.Kingsolver does a great job developing the plot, and really illustrating the culture clash between the Americans and the Congolese. She also does a great job developing the internal conflicts of the Price family. As time passes in the novel, the characters grow, change, and adapt, maintaining credibility.I had only two real problems with this book:1 - I felt like the novel truly ended when the Price women left Africa. The last hundred or so pages were tedious and unnecessary, and added nothing to the overall plot or message of the story. In fact, it seemed to undermine the story by sending the characters and the plotlines off in a ton of different directions.2 - It grew too political at times. It didn't seem at the beginning this was Kingsolver's intention, but by those last few hundred pages, the writing was about 97% blatant political propaganda and 3% novel.Other than that, a page-turning, enjoyable read. I highly recommend this book, as well as Kingsolver's other novels."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book is intense, historically accurate, carefully written, and really worth reading. Written from the perspectives of 5 girls/women from children in the 50s to adults in the 90s, it is impressive how their story(ies) unfold(s) from each of their viewpoints. Their delusioned father/husband preacher who is just whacked out nuts from WWII and his personal rendition of the gospel (the poisonwood version) contrasts with the spirituality of Africa and others who had attempted to convert the natives. The whacky blind allegiance of a mother who doesn't follow her initial gut instincts and ends up with her biggest fears becoming a reality, and her children who must live with the consequences of their parents' decisions.It's as refreshing as it is disturbing to learn history from fictionalized eye-witness accounts of the truth. The huge difference between the truth and the American media is here too, it helps me understand how we allowed such things to happen (well, mostly b/c they didn't give a flying fig about people of a different complexion)...the trust factor involved...as Uncle Sam's mask unveils a completely different face from what the majority of the characters first experience. Wow. I think Kingsolver put her heart and soul into this book, along with a number of people who helped her out."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"When I picked up Kingsolver's novel, I didn't know exactly what the story was about. When I discovered it was about a missionary family caught in the turbulent political and social upheavals of Africa, I knew I'd have to pay close attention.Kingsolver deftly and with extraordinary prose tells the story of the Price family from each of its members' points of view. I found this to be useful not only to gain insight into each character, but also because each character offered a unique perception of the world and events unfolding around them.I have to be honest here. As educated as I'm lucky to be, I really had no knowledge of the history of Africa and the Congo. As I read the book, I absorbed the various points of view and became sympathetic to many of the characters' political and social views. I was astonished to find that they weren't necessarily the \\"American\\" historical perception with regard to international politics. But having learned history (in the context of a novel) with a clean slate gave me a unique and unbiased view of another country's struggle for peace and independence.The Price family members, though thrown together into this new and chaotic African landscape, are different and often offer contrasting insights into their situations. Each is thoughtful and searching for the truth but they tend to find that truth through various and sometimes conflicting means, illustrating that many paths make up this life.The Poisonwood Bible is a thoughtful and interesting read, written beautifully and skillfully by Barbara Kingsolver. The characters have stayed with me since I put down the book, as has my new exposure to a unique part of the world."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I've loved Barbara Kinsolver's previous novels, but this new one tops all the others. A new category for Kinsolver, historical novel. Characters of the children were very full and deep, written in a novel journalistic style. This book peaked my interest in learning and understanding more about the Congo, and the people of that era, as well as the present."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"One day in 1994 I was bored, and a friend invited me to a bookstore to hear an author give a reading. I had no idea who this Barbara King-something was. Standing in a courtyard outsite the store in jeans and red high-top tennis shoes Ms. Kingsolver read a few pages from the Bean Trees, and I was mesmerized. Rarely does a writer have the ability to combine such wit, humor, keen observation and literary talent. Since that day, I have read each of her novels, her poems and essays. I waited hopefully - even a little fearfully for The Poisonwood Bible. Could this be as good as the rest? No... It's better. She brings the congo alive in the reader's eye. As in her other books, she creates characters who are real and multidimensional - each with a distinct voice. While Ms. Kingsolver tackles issues far beyond those of day-to-day life, her depiction of daily life draws you in. From the mouths of her characters spring deep wisdom in the form of the simplest truths, &quot;Watching my father, I've seen how you can't learn anything when you're trying to be the smartest person in the room.&quot; I recommend this book to everyone. Buy it. Buy it now."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I was disappointed in this book. Barbara Kingsolver's other novels are some of my favorites, and I was disappointed that this didn't meet up to her regular standards. True, it was a very different type of book than her others. I hope she can return to her past successful style while still incorporating her new ideas and visions."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"My wife and I have read all of Kingsolver's works and loved them all - this is the best! Thank you, Barbara, for a fascinating tale."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I, like many other Kingsolver fans, was a little surprised and unsure what to think of this new style that she was testing out. but once I started reading, the poetry and depth of her words as well as the trapping interest of her story won me over. I could not get over how well researched and complete her story was. And I will agree that while this was the first of her books where some of the main characters are genuinely unsympathetic, a writer can not just write the same type of stories for her entire career. everyone loves taylor, turtle, loyd and kodi but the price family tells a different and very urgent story. i did not love everyone in the book as i did with all her others but i loved the story itself every bit as much. this goes right on my bookshelf of MUST-READS after i pass it on to everyone i know."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I read the other customer reviews and noticed that none of them mentioned that this book is based on fact. The people in the Belgian Congo are described so realistically, I felt I was there; their customs and occurrences in the village are factual. In fact, at the end of the book, a comprehensive list of reference materials used to write the book is listed.The story of the American family there and what happened to them was very realistic also. As a child, I've been an American in another country and I could relate to how the story was told and how the family dealt with their situation.The book was wonderful. My only problem with it now is that I don't want to lend my friends my first edition and will have to buy more copies!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I'm a big Kingsolver fan and will read whatever she writes next. The Poisonwood Bible was a disappointment. An ambitious but failed effort. You could tell that she was trying very hard, had her heart in the right place, and was very well meaning. But for me, using the different voices as &quot;books&quot; of this bible didn't work because they didn't seem real and the book was disjointed. I liked her descriptions of the Congo, but actually expected more politics, especially after reading some of the reviews. Unlike her other books, this one felt forced, like she knew it wasn't working and just kept writing and writing hoping it would get better. I kept reading and reading, feeling the same way."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I am a big Kingsolver fan, so as soon as I heard she had a new book out I ran right out and bought it. It was a shock to discover that, unlike her previous books, Kingsolver had tackled missionary life in the Congo. I found it fascinating reading, despite the author's tendency to do almost as much preaching as the tyrannical Nathan Price himself. Kingsolver's strong point is her characters, and the Price women, Nathan Price, who has no voice, but whom we still get to know very well, and the Congolese who surround them are all brilliantly painted. The reader is drawn into the heart of darkness via the eyes of mother Orleanna and her daughters: blonde, vacuuous Rachel, &quot;gifted&quot; Leah and her dyslexic and birth defective twin Adah, and toddler Ruth May. Together they are thrust into a whirlpool from which they will never entirely escape. As they spiral towards the point of no return, they are reborn, but not at all as their Baptist father had envisioned when they left Bethlehem, Georgia. It is a bit disappointing that Kingsolver has her characters speak a message that might have been revealed to her readers through actions and events. Perhaps to do so would have added another couple of hundred pages to an already voluminous work, but I think it would have been worth it. Certainly readers who know her well are intelligent enough to draw their own conclusions about the sinister side of U.S. and European foreign policy. However, the book's redeeming qualities far outweigh this minor consideration; I found it moving, delightful, informative and above all, provocative."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I enjoyed this novel a lot, but I don't think it holds up to careful consideration. The descriptions of Congo village life are excellent, and, I assume, accurate. But the relationships among the characters are never fully developed and the father remains a mystery. All the characters are just described and remain the same throughout. The last 100 pages or so are boring, especially Leah's political viewpoint. Yet the book made me laugh and cry and kept my interest. I don't think it's a great book, but it is one of the best of the less-than-great, popular books."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"What a richly shared tale of love and dysfunction, politics and spirit. At night I savored each character's &quot;journal&quot; entry, getting to know them, becoming familiar with an unfamiliar world until I was traveling alongside. In the end, I'm left with plenty to ponder, and better for the trip."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This powerful novel by Barbara Kingsolver charts the lives of a missionary family and portrays the interplay of good intentions and motives warped by dogma. One ends up with an aching wonder ... what was changed, by whom and who or what prevailed!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Simply wonderful reading. I could kick myself for not paying enough attention to my wife's recommendation several years ago, but she was exactly right: this is a story well worth the amount of time in your life you sacrifice to read it. In fact, it is many stories interwoven and they each grow as a vine of their own before interlacing themselves through each other. For me, most good books take quite a few pages before the hook is set but the author had me with the first paragraph."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I found this book very good. A few of the reviews put me off a tad but I decided to read it anyway. It was great! I was the same age in the 60's as one of the daughters and it was unbelievable to think of leaving the comforts of home to be plucked into a remote village in Africa.I wish I had gone to the back of the book and read the \\"Writing the DAB\\" (damed African book) by the author first. It really gives insight into her research and insights. I plan on recommending this book to my book club."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Wonderful book... so well written and engaging. I thoroughly enjoyed how the author got into the head of each of the daughters to present their unique views along the way."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is not a book I would have chosen on my own. My book club chose to read it and discuss. I'm glad I read it. I did not like that each chapter was written from a different character's point of view. It did not make for a smooth timeline."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I read Poisonwood Bible years ago, a gift from my daughter. i couldn't put it down. it is so beautifully written, as are All of Kingsolver's books. she is so thorough in her settings, as it is within her field of study, nature. it so haunted me that i had to share it with everyone who hadn't experienced it, so everytime i'm asked for a recommendation or it's time to make a gift, this is the book that i offer. i hope it is never made into a film as i doubt they can capture the magic and beauty of this amazing story and may ruin it with typical hollywood casting. i've read everything of kingsolver's, this is the best!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I have always been a big fan of Barbara Kingsolver, but I wasn't thrilled with Prodigal Summer. However, this one blew me away. I can't believe I waited this long to read it! The story is very interesting, but it is the narration that makes this book special. Kingsolver tells the story through five different narrators with five distinctive voices and personalities. Sometimes the narration can transform what would otherwise be a dull scene into a hilarious story. The Poisonwood Bible is the story of the Price family -- a missionary, his wife and four daughters -- as they travel to Africa. Each family member reacts to the lifestyle change in various ways. Self-discovery is the theme in the novel. None of the main characters will be the same when the book is over.Barbara Kingslover does a wonderful job with the narration. It is difficult to write a novel with multiple points of view, but Kingslover makes it seem effortless. This novel enthralled me. I couldn't recommend The Poisonwood Bible enough."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible was a fantastic book and I would reccomend it to everyone. The book starts out with a family who don't really know themseleves and don't know what they are capable of until almost the end. The women in this book have a lot of courage throughout the book although if you read it you may find as I did that I didn't like some of the characters. But in the end they all grew up and changed for the better and for the worse. But you don't have to take my word for it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Language:It seems that the language depends on the Character that is portraying the situation. There are five different individuals speaking their mind, thoughts, opinions, and it shows their individual view throughout the entire book. The language is quite easily understood, the language being used by all five characters is not very complicated.Style:The style that the author used seemed to work well with the context of the book. The book was used as a journal for all five characters. They had admitted their thoughts and exerts of their life. It was interesting how they all seemed to find the meaning of the Poisonwood Bible.Characters:The characters, which were all very different from each other, worked together for the book to come together. The fact she used five different peoples perspectives had given the book five diversely different dimensions. They were five different ingredients or flavors, all mixed together to make the final dish, the book. However they were all tied together by there one factor in common, and that is that they are connected by blood.Plot:The plot had been very scattered. So many things had happened in the book, one couldn't seem to keep them all strait. The setting of the Congo throughout the book had been a common thread in all the characters, and it was an interesting place to be. However there had been so many mishaps or events that had occurred that hearing about the Congo as much as we had, been tiresome."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Book summery:Bob BadmanStyle: The stile of writing that Barbara Kingsolver used in the book The Poisonwood Bible was a type of journal almost. It switched around from each persons point of view except for the father. I found this way of writing very interesting, the reader could really get a sense of the characters whose opinions were expressed.Language: The language varied depending on who was speaking. But besides that it seemed pretty much ordinary beside that fact that foul language was taken a little more seriously then today in the prices house. There was some Congolese that took a while to get use toCharacter: There were five main characters in the book. The mother of the family who's name was ______. She was unhappy for most of the book. She didn't like the marriage that she was in and wanted to leave the Congo. The father who's name was Nathan. He was a priest who could do no wrong and could see all evil. He was busy converting the African people to Christianity. The oldest daughter was named Rachel. She was obsessed with her looks. And hated it in the Congo. The twines came next they were very different. The first one was named Leah. She loved her father for most of the book and in the end just felt sorry for him. Adah was a cripple for most of the book that couldn't talk and only wrote her opinions down. She hated her father and had a more real outlook on life the any of them. The lasts one's name in Ruth May she dies half way through from a snake bite, before this happened she was a fun character who loved pretty much everything.Plot: The plot is a family that travels to the Congo to do missionary work with an African tribe. They come back completely change in every way. I liked the book a lot."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is a novel about reverend Nathan Price, who takes his family to the Belgian Congo in 1959. Having been severely traumatized during World War II, he is left with massive feelings of guilt which he is only able to keep from drawing him into complete psychosis by adopting and cultivating an extremely rigid, bigoted missionary zeal. His wife and four daughters never seem to stop whining and complaining about the (African) situation Nathan has got them into. They never seem to empathise with Nathan's terrible plight. Oh yes, they would, once in a while, mumble something about the war, but, no, this never leads to any sympathy with the reverend, nor to any search for some form of dialogue, not even of the house-and-kitchen-psychotherapy kind. There's no point, they think. The reverend is too stubborn, he will not listen, whatever we say or do. We're just poor little victims, you know, women, trembling as we do before His all-powerful, almighty male nastyness. Unsurprisingly, the family thus heads for catastrophy. Now, not many readers may agree with my reading of Kingsolver's novel. However, having gradually become fed up with the novel's unusually large reservoir of clich&eacute;s on gender relations and (post)colonialism (&quot;ooh-my-look-at-us-poor-little-female-victims-and-wouldn't-you-agree-we-are-morally-superior-to-them-nasty-men-who-only-know-how-to-destroy-us-and-Africa-alike&quot;), I kind of started to grow some sympathy for the reverend who, despised and discarded by practically everyone, and with almost nobody really being interested in the hows and whys of his agonizing, terrible personal drama, ends up in flames. Great novels know how to avoid clich&eacute;s. At least they know how to bring them with some nuance, and with some sense of/for ambivalence, because they know why and how to cherish the insight that life is a little more complicated than what clich&eacute;s -simple truisms at best; a pack of lies and sheer nonsense at worst, and most often- would suggest. In that sense, I don't think Kingsolver's novel is a great one. It's a damn good one, though. Kingsolver really does how to jot words on a page. Let me admit that. She knows how to speak with the voice of a 5 year old, a teenager, an African bush-intellectual, a women-eternal-victim, a patriarch-approaching-madness. She does it with superb verve and with amazing writing skill. I agree with the person who recommended the book to me : this is a good, a very good, a damn good pageturner."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I've just spent my vacation reading this book. The characters are each given a voice in each chapter. I loved the changing perspectives of the situations which each chapter brought.My only problem with the book was the ending. I felt that the author might have ended the book sooner; the book seemed to carry on forever in the very end. I felt that there was also too much space devoted to politics. All in all, however, this book is on the scale of The Thorn Birds, one of my favorites."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I recently read half of \\"The Poisonwood Bible,\\" which is on the top of the best seller lists and purports to be \\"literature.\\" I had hopes of gaining real insight into African culture, and to experience a well-written female narrative (like the voices of Atwood and others). For the first time in 35 years of reading, I couldn't finish a book. Barbara Kingsolver's blathering feelings-oriented tome was, well, tedious, neurotic and sleep-inducing. By the middle of the book, I was hoping the Congolese would strangle the four female protagonists -- to put them out of their misery, for being such stupid pitiful \\"victims.\\" The only victim, alas, was me the reader. The characters were one dimensional, and the tale of shoe-horned Western-Civ gone wrong too often told. Do yourself a favor, and skip this one."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I eat, sleep and dream this book. Each chapter reveals new thoughts and insights of the characters in a way that makes them a part of your life. Its definitely one of the best stories I've read in months. Read it!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I read this book on flights to and from Europe and throughout my visit there, so my reading was more disjointed than usual. I found it difficult eventually to follow the Congo politics, which may have been due to sleep deprivation and my own sensory overload. I did enjoy the characterization of the zealot Baptist father - surely there is no more fervent advocate of the way things should be done than a Baptist missionary - and his long-suffering family with their myriad perceptions of the Congo. I was particularly touched by Leah, the idealist, whose belief in her father dissolved with agonizing insights into his true character. Kingsolver did an excellent job of allowing us to understand how these parents evolved into the people they became. The entire family's naivete about the father's &quot;mission&quot; and their evolving part in African life had far-reaching consequences that are well portrayed."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I was absolutely enralled with the book however I was left with a big question that left me hanging. Each chapter was titled with the name of the Price family member that &quot;wrote&quot; it. However, towards the end of the book, Ms. Kingsolver titled each chapter with the first and last name of the storyteller which included her current married name. However, the last entry by Leah no longer contained her full last name (her married name). I kept reading the book over and over again to try to figure out why her married name was dropped but I could not. Was this just an oversight (which I doubt) or was Ms. Kingsolver making a point that I failed to get? Leah seemed to be the most passionate about her marriage and its political plight and I could not understand why her last chapter did not contain her married last name.However, this book was fascinating and invigorating. It appears to be a story of well-intentioned moral obligation without any exploration as to the necessity of such an obligation. It is the story of someone trying to save civilization without any thought as to who or what needs saving. A lovely book with some very profound conclusions. We would all love to &quot;save the world&quot; but how many of us want to take the time to figure out what really needs to be done. A real eye-opener."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"From the moment I opened this book, I could not set it down. This was a fascinating story that made me feel like I was really there experiencing everything that happened right along with them. I highly recommend this novel to anyone...I hope that you loved it as much as I did!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I don't completely buy into the hype surrounding this novel. Each character exists merely to make a cultural or political point, and read pretty much any book on African history for a more real take on the Congo's political figures. Examples of distortions of the politics include giving the U.S. and not Belgium the primary blame for encouraging the coup (a Belgian commission concluded they were the primary supporters of the coup--and the army of the Congo was lead by Belgian officers), pretending Lumumba was more Afro-centric than Mobutu (in 1971, Mobutu banner giving Christian names [5 year sentences for violations], Western clothing was banned, the country was renamed Zaire and foreign property was seized.) Politically he didn't fight the West, but culturally he was far more Afrocentric than the moderate Lumumba. Lumumba also was beginning to alienate other tribes and illegally arrested his more left-wing vice president before the coup. (the vice president was kept in jail by Mobutu.) This is the biggest problem, like many novels on history, people may think they don't need to read any non-fiction books on this important topic forgetting this is fiction, not non-fiction."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Plot: A family of six: a mother, missionary father and their four daughters spend several years in the Congo and experience the unsettling political climate firsthand. After a tragedy, the mother returns home to the United States with only one of her children.. As they mature, the daughters who stayed behind struggle to deal with their past trauma and the still volatile political climate, while the third returns to the US and becomes a doctor. All of them, including the mother, come to realize that their time in the Congo stamped them indelibly and that they will never be fully free of the trauma they suffered there.Pros: The language is evocative and often beautiful. Kingsolver makes it easy for the reader to picture the Congo and its people. The experience of having an abusive patriarch and having to walk on eggshells was well portrayed. The first half or so of the novel was absorbing and themajority of the characters (with the exception of the stereotyped father) interesting.Cons: Kingsolver may have been too fond of her characters, at least the female ones, and not wanted to end the book. It goes on and on and on, and even if you like the characters, you may eventually find yourself wishing that the author would wrap up her book. The author also treats her readers like slow children - character traits are mentioned repeatedly (Rachel is vain; Adah is lame; etc.) and the symbolism (everything but a plague of locusts befalls this family) is also hammered home. At times, the tone of the four daughters is not that of a child or a teenager, but an adult trying hard to sound like a young person. Also, the climax (which happened after 300 pages or so) occurred after my interest had waned."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I must say this book is simply amazing. Barbara Kingsolver has really outdone herself. Nathan Price, the overzealous baptist on a mission to the Congo, dragging his family along. The plot thickens as Nathan tries to bring Christianity around to the Congolese. Leah, wanting to be just like her father, slowly loses faith and begins to rebel. After a year of being in the Congo, Nathan will not allow them to leave. Ruth May falls ill and dies from a snake bite. Leah focuses on her crush Anatole, whom she later marries. Rachel and Adah also become successful. The characters change and mature over time. It's a great book and entertaining to see the growth and change in opinions. The book has you going from beginning to end."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"One of the best books I have read, After living in africa I could understand where the story came from."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"In a perfect world in which time could be snoozed and speed reading could be doubled down with an espresso and fudge brownie I would re-read Barbara Kingsolver's Poisonwood Bible every year. Probably in February. Because, like an annual pilgrimage into the perfumed inner sanctum of exotic earthiness and fecund humanity, it stretches us almost to the point of no return. But at the last minute we break free and come drifting home, slightly battered, and already planning for our next adventure. Read with abandon. Often! (BTW, if you've reread One Hundred Years of Solitude or The Moor's Last Sigh, you'll reread The Poisonwood Bible. I'd be willing to wager on it!)"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I was so happy to get this book for my kindle at a reduced price because I lost my paper copy years ago. I loved this story from start to finish and am excited to read it again after many years. It is by far my favorite book by Barbara Kingsolver. Each characters voice is distinct and offers a different point of view of this story of life, death and salvation. If you have not read this book pick it up and settle in for a story you will not soon forget."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"A memorable book, well crafted. Barbara Kingsolver's books are always well written and speak to the basic condition of the human race."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"A very engaging story with well developed characters. It'll intrigue you from the start and you won't be able to put it down."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I love every word she writes, but Poisonwood Bible is still a stellar work, in my opinion. Her very best."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Really enjoyed reading this book from the point of each character! Made me feel I was there! Would definitely recommend it to other readers."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I loved the Poisonwood Bible. My favorite Barbara Kingsolver novel although The Lacuna is a close second. A bit long for some people, but well worth the read."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The first half of the book was entertaining, but the second half really dragged on. Over all, an interesting book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I would have given this book five stars except for the fact that her book &#34;The Lacuna&#34; left me with such a high standard few other books could have reached. She continues her research on how misguided government policies affect individuals, in this case, the murder of Patric Lumumba, elected in the first election held in the Republic of Congo, and it's affect on an American missionary and his family. Again, she softens the devastating story of the Congo with dialogue that is so rich and, at times, so humorous, she keeps you going with a story so sad that, if you don't smile, you'd have to cry. Ms Kingsolver is an American treasure."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book is enlightening to what happened to Africa back in the fifties. It also says something about do-gooder missionaries who went there to help out and lost out. I think mature young readers would appreciate this as a good novel to read."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is my all time absolute favorite book!!! I've read it over and over again and it never ceases to leave me in awe. It is written beautifully and creatively, telling the stories of each member of a missionary family that has traveled to Africa. This book will make you think, laugh, and cry- all the things that make a great novel! Most profoundly, it will make you open your eyes and look at the world with new found sight. I truly cannot recommend it enough, I absolutely love this book, in fact, all of Barbara Kingsolver's novels are wonderful! It is a must read!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"this book has all of the things i love in a book - characters with purpose, a fantastic setting and stunning language. it had its flaws, but ultimately, The Poisonwood Bible was an excellent read and i'm looking forward to more from Kingsolver.Nathan Price is a fierce Baptist minister who brings his wife and four daughters to the small village of Kilanga in the Congo during the late 1950's. his intentions to bring salvation are mighty, but he seems to be trying to over-fulfill his obligations by force-feeding his beliefs to the natives, nearly as much as his family seems to be trying to force their southern Georgia lives to fit into a Congolese way of life.\\"So determined he is to win or force or drag them over to the Way of the Cross.\\"as the political situation in the country becomes dangerous, the family is urged to leave, but Nathan stubbornly refuses and, despite being cut off from their monthly stipend which leaves them penniless, he persists. the family dynamic becomes obviously brittle and for the second half of the book we follow the various lives of each member for the next several decades.the story is told from the perspective of the mother, Orleanna, and each of the daughters, the eldest Rachel, the twins Leah and Adah, and the youngest Ruth May. each is distinctly different in their voice and this was probably the most accomplished component of the novel. of the daughters, Leah was by far the most entertaining to me. she was quick witted and intelligent, and as a child, fiercely and honorably loyal to her father, despite his misgivings. but, i loved the sections that were devoted to Orleanna! she was the most competent at displaying the emotions and choices in her life and this invoked an unbelievable sadness in me. her narratives read in a way that made me so sympathetic to her situation.\\"I had washed up there on the riptide of my husband's confidence and the undertow of my children's needs. That's my excuse, yet none of them really needed me all that much.\\"the Congo was depicted as a harsh and magestic place, much as i imagine that it is, even today. although i haven't read any other fiction set in Africa, this has definitely sparked an interest in me to read more. the landscape, as depicted by Kingsolver, was cruel and heartless - malaria killed nearly half of the children in the village - but it was also lush and thriving with the passion of the people and their cultures. really, if this book had been set anywhere else, i don't know that it would have been as powerful as it was.in the end, though, it was the language that made me absolutely love this book. there were so many amazing lines that just made me stop, take a deep breath and read them again. i went highlighter happy (thankfully it was on my kindle) and had hundreds of quotes by the time i was finished. if you are a fan of beautiful language, you will most likely love this book. although the story was a little slow at times, and although the first half was stronger than the second, in my opinion, i would recommend to anyone who loves a patient, yet intense, read."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I read this book several years ago, and I still remember it vividly. It's a great view into colonialism in Africa in the 1960's and a family of white people trying to deal with the fact that they're pretty much cut off from the world as they settle into an African village because the father (Nathan Price) is such a religious fanatic and thinks that it's just fine to uproot his entire family and place them at risk (and several tragedies do occur)The descriptions of the family's reactions (told from the mom and the 4 daughters in their own POV's) especially bring the story to life as each person tells their own view of things and their reactions and interactions with the villagers as well as their tyrannical, authoritarian father (or in Mom's case, husband). I don't want to say too much else, in risk of spoiling the story, but it definitely has some nice twists and turns, as well as a bittersweet and mostly satisfying (but very realistic ending. Definitely a great book and not one to be missed."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Beautiful descriptions of a Garden of Eden-esque setting which refuses to be tamed, and furthermore refuses to yield, teaching it's inhabitants harsh survival lessons. Thought provoking, lyrical and poetic, a book that reminds us of our own place on Earth and the things we take for granted. A gem."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"It is re-assuring to see so many positive reviews of a wonderful book. But disappointing to see many readers were unhappy, especially with the second part of the book. All the comments made about part one give a true reflection of the quality of the author's work. So we need to concentrate on the other part.It is true that the second part is written in a very different style, but then the context has changed. For me there are some wonderful aspects in the second part. The way these are handled demonstrates not only the depth of research done by the author, but her understanding of the complexities where different cultures meet. Those readers that see the book as two separate novels are actually missing the point- the second part is a result of what happened in the first part.For instance, it was fascinating to read how the children, who had all gone through the same experience in the Congo, ended up being so different. Leah the daughter who absorbed and appreciated so much of the local African culture decided to stay in Africa and become fully integrated. The eldest daughter, Rachel, who remained absorbed in her European upbringing, lived to benefit from having money and enjoying a lifestyle, as if still in colonial Africa. The third daughter, Adah, was not really able to settle into any of the cultural worlds she had experienced. But when she was back in America, she was a still a part of the her African past.This is a wonderful book for those who want to understand the complexities of different cultures making contact, and the intricate interweaving of religious, political, and economic as well as cultural factors.It is a must."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I ordered this book from Amazon and was very pleased on the quick shipment and packaging for delivery. This is a wonderful book that is a must read. I loved it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book is a portrait of a missionary family who leave their middle-American home in Bethlehem, Georgia for the dark and fobidding rainforest of deepest Africa. The Price family led by their Hell and brimstone Evangelical minister, Nathan Price, are dragged into a life which they are totally unprepared for, bringing along their Betty Crocker cake mixes, packets of seeds for Big Boy tomatoes and gardening tools. The story is told from 5 different points of view, as we hear from the mother, Orleanna and 4 daughters. This definitely adds a greater dimension of depth to an otherwise beautifully told story. With dramatic imagery, you enter the jungles of Africa and can hear the sounds, feel the heavy humid air on your skin and see the magnificent greenery of the jungle.I see some reviewers here were not impressed with this book, which I really do not understand. From the beginning, Kingsolver casts a spell on the reader and you are swept up into her world of Africa. She gives authentic characterizations of the land, its people, the conflicts and struggles for survival in day-to-day life in the Congo. I believe this struggle for survival is the main theme of the book and how people are changed by their surroundings. For example, Orleanna has been sheltered most of her life in Mississippi until she marries Nathan. Soon after she finds she has entered a loveless union with a broken man who is not able to show any compassion or even kindness to his wife. After having 4 children, she can only blindly follow his lead, ending up in Africa. Later on Kingsolver shows how events in AFrica, including some of the worst possible disasters, make a change in Orleanna. However, with Nathan and RAchel, the oldest daughter, there is little that changes in their basic characters.I really enjoyed this novel with all the adventure and drama that only AFrica could provide. At times it is even humorous with the native men in AFrica wearing red trousers with holes in the bottom or when the women danced at the tribal celebration being naked to the waist, much to Nathan Price's chagrin."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"As an ex-Peace Corps volunteer who spent two years in rural Africa, this novel has passages within it that are so true, so authentic, I kept thinking, \\"She knows! She really understands this!\\" as I read.Kingsolver allows the plot and characters to evolve beyond the African jungles in an attempt to establish a connection to readers who have never experienced life in Africa.A great read!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Oh, I enjoyed this book MUCH more than I thought I would. Africa as a setting does not particularly grab my attention and a missionary family would not typically be the types of characters to intrigue me. Yet, I loved this book. Intricate, detailed and immaculately woven together, it is a delightfully layered novel. I loved how each woman's voice was strong and uniquely her own - I especially enjoyed the \\"errors\\" made in Rachel and Ruthie May's chapters, not to mention the palindromes in Adah's sections. The plot, too, was solid and entertaining and though it really could have ended sooner, I was glad that the book kept going throughout their lives as long as it did. I am definitely going to be keeping an eye out for her other books!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book is not only artistically well written, it provides a wonderful glimpse into Africa from 1959-1990s. Of the six characters in the book -- Preacher Nathan Price, wife Orleanna, and daughters Rachel, Leah, Adah and Ruth May -- five narrate the story. The reader knows almost from the beginning that one of the daughters will die; Kingsolver does an excellent job of building the suspense, as each of the four children seem in some kind of danger at one point or another. But the suspense is not melodramatic; as the family tries to adjust to the Congo, their previous values and expectations fall by the wayside, and for some of the characters, danger lurks all around. Kingsolver captures perfectly the lack of Western understanding of Africa; Nathan Price is determined to 'save' the natives, whether they like it or not. His refusal to examine the natives on their own terms brings tragic results, and turns the village of Kilanga -- as well as the women in his own family -- against him. The characters are drawn beautifully, and added to the narrative is a powerful analysis of the role of the US in Africa and the self-destruction the Congo went through (and is still going through today, as the Congo has become &quot; Zaire&quot;, then Congo again, etc). An excellent book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book is one of the most impactful I have read in the last few years. Barbara Kingsolver captured my attention by presenting different characters with their respective personalities and dialogue about the experiences of a family far away from home. It is at the same time humorous and extremely thought-provoking. The Poisonwood Bible brought to light economic and cultural realities of Africa in a way that I will never forget. Don't miss this story!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This wonderful story written from the perspective of a mother and her daughters is a must read! As a reader who only has the time to read books in bits and pieces, this story was easy to &quot;keep up with&quot; despite its thickness and finding places to bookmark for a later date was easy (no having to bookmark in the middle of a long chapter)."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I only opened this book based on the recommendation of a trusted source. I was immediately hooked. Kingsolver is an amazing storyteller. The Poisonwood Bible is a gem."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Fantastic! Once I started it I couldn't put it down. A great description of life in the Congo and, at the same time, great insights on people's minds and reactions to events. Not boring at all!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Having served as a missionary physician in a small hospital in NE Zaire in 1980, this excellent book really came alive to me. The bloody history of Zaire was expertly woven through 26 years of the lives of this tragic fictional family. The unabridged audio tapes were very well done, capturing the rhythms of Ada's poetry, the impudence of Rachael, and the languages of the Congo itself. I was never offended by the subject matter, as a former mission doc, and recommend this beautiful book without reservation."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I thought the book was great. The Rev. reminded me so much of my own father. He was a very stern task master. Growing up I never could quite understand why my dear mother stood for his harshness and evilness. It wasn't until I became grown and after a few bad relationships of my own that I began to undersand. Also you have to take into account the time in which this story took place. Before Oprah reccommend it I wanted to somehow get to her to ask her to read it. I thought it was one of the most thought provoking novel's I'd read since I know this much is true, by Wally Lamb. I did think the author however got a bit off track with the politics of what she felt was happening in the Congo at the time, but that aside it was a good read. I found myself missing them when I finished the book"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"No, this is not a new age verion of the Good Book. This is a story of a southern Baptist (white) family who travels to the Congo in the '40s and '50s on a missionary trip. The story follows the tribulations of being white, unwelcome, and unprepared while Belgium was controlling everything including the diamond trade. It is a very intelligent book, extremely well written and fully deserves all the praise it has been getting. It is mostly a story of the disintegration of a family -- 4 daughters, a tired mother, and a preacher father -- but is politically controversial enough to keep any reader interested."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I thought Barbara Kingsolver's epic story of the Price family's journey through the heart of darkness in the 1960s was an amazing commentary on the tyrannies of world politics and the reality of the brutalness of the African continent. The gripping story of a Baptist minister and his family as told through it's female members was made more vivid by Kingsolver's poetic and innovative use of English, French and Kikongo languages. Her botannical and scientific knowledge was put to good use in her amazingly lush descriptions of African vegetation and wildlife. While her account of the political situation the Congo was and continues to be put through was greatly oversimplified and romanticized, the basics of her message was startling and at the core of truth.Kingsolver is amazing in her insights into the African continent and its people. She opens our eyes to the fact that this great land will not be subdued despite the men who try, and its people are those that stare death daily in an effort to simply exist. Kingsolver offers so much in this novel to every kind of reader: social commentary, political history, religious debate, poetic description, and at the core a story to which we all as humans can relate."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver is half Alex Garland, half Maeve Binchy. &quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot;is a romantic adventure story at heart and is a very addictive read even though it is an enormous book. Don't be scared off by the size...it's well worth the time and effort."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I won't bother repeating what's been said in the other billion reviews of this book, but my one comment is that I adored this book and might have potentially rated it a 5* (rare for me) if not for the last two chapters, which dragged and ruined the great reading experience I was having. I'd still highly recommend it just for the pleasure of the storyline, the charming and interesting characters, and the flowing writing style. Then rush through the ending just to finish what is otherwise a great book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I was fascinated by this book from start to finish. The story of the family moved me, I worried about snakes and hunger and bacterias in the Congolese jungle, like the mother. I delighted in the nature and people of Africa like some of the daughters. I could even sometimes feel the loneliness and craziness of the overreligious father. And as I was captivated, the story about Africa en the independance of the Congo slowly crept up on me, the same as the characters who were only half aware at first what they were in the middle of. It offered me a lot to think about.I recently also reviewed 'How to be good' by Nick Hornby. There are not many parallels between these two books, only that both deal with the complexities of being good in a seemingly bad world. In Hornby's book I found this message obvious and annoying, but Kingsolver seduced me with her beautiful language into accepting her message. Thank you, Barbara Kingsolver!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"A southern missionary family plunges naively into deepest Congo to bring the shining light to the natives in the 1960's, told in plucky short though somewhat predictable chapters by Mom and the various daughters. The various characters are well developed and all bring very different perspectives to life in the family and the politics of Africa; Kingsolver weaves them together well and is admirably non-judgmental in letting the story tell itself. In my straw polls of friends &amp; family I've noticed a polarity between those who love her earlier book \`animal dreams', vs those who love \`the bean trees' (..and nobody likes \`pigs in heaven'...); 'Poisonwood' is a more ambitious and complex story then the earlier works, however it is also not quite so compellingly and beautifully composed. And I note the same people tend to polarize again in preferring either the first half or the second half of \`Poisonwood'. Bottom line: worth the read, but unless you're pulled by the african setting you might start liking kingsolver better with 'animal dreams' or 'bean trees'."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book had been recommended to me by so many friends that I began to suspect a conspiracy. Now I thank them all. I have read many books on travels in Africa, but none rival The Poisonwood Bible. Kingsolver weaves an intricate quilt that overlaps politics, religion, personal sacrifice, and a test of wills. I was getting ready for a New Year's Eve party and was late because I kept taking breaks to read more of the book! I inhaled the last two-thirds of it all in one day because I could not put it down. Kingsolver's talent enraptures you as you are pulled in by the intricacy of each character, while realizing the relative commonality of the Price family's struggle. As a recovering Catholic, I particularly appreciated the delicate way in which she challenges the tenets of Christianity. This a work of fiction that is so rooted in actual fact, it not only becomes completely believable, but it haunts your thinking. Escape to this reality-based entertainment and you will not regret it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I absolutely LOVED the characters and the story of this book. My only (slight) complaint is the book bogs down a little when they leave Africa. Their time as missionaries was absolutely enthralling, and Kingsolver continues to write in a poetic, entertaining fashion.This is a MUST read--absolutely fantastic."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Well, at first I thought there is no way I am getting through this 500 page plus book that seemed incredibly boring. However, about a third through I got really into it. It is wonderful. My only problem was that I thought it was a little far fetched. I mean how much torture could one person take before running home to the US. However, it gave me a better understanding of the politics of Africa and the plight of its people. Very rewarding. I would highly recommend it for people who don't need that draw early on and are willing to give it some time."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Powerful characters and an enthralling text make up for a slow start in what might be the novel of the year! Once you get into it you'll find it hard to put down. The story may appear dull at first blush, but it will run you through the gamut of emotions. It's a great book for Kingsolver's fans, or someone who'd like to be one. You'll see how the world-view of these Americans gets completely changed in their brand new situation in the Congo. It's completely gripping."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The book was highly recommended by a friend. Unfortunately after several attempts to read the book I gave up. At no time was I able to develop an interest in the story or the characters. Ophrah and my friend enjoyed it. As for me -- as far as this book is concerned I chose poorly."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Poisonwood was my book club selection this month and our group will surely have mixed reviews. I found it compelling and am indeed sorry to finish it. To get more of Africa, I searched my old National Geographics for &quot;real&quot; pictures of the Congo. Kingsolver is the master of the metaphors ( &quot;I had washed up there [Africa} on the riptide of my husband's confidence and the undertow of my children's needs&quot;) The riptide of my husband's confidence! I'm hooked. Told through the eyes of the girls, the story grows as they do, their voices distinct from one another. By telling this tragedy through 4 lenses, Kingsolver paints a much richer picture of the Congo. Her sympathies surface, but by the time they do, I am captured, and want to know her truth. Who could possible say the world had done right by Africa? With &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;, way back in college, for who has read it since, we knew the game was to save Africa from herself. As Kingsolver describes, we are &quot;Exploitive and condescending, in the name of steering her clear of the moral decline inevitable to her nature.&quot; With this work she has brought what she knows and woven it into a beautifully tragic story that will linger with the reader long after the last page."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible is by far the best book i have ever read. The title is what caught my attention and then once I started reading it I couldn't stop. The story takes the reader into Africa and fills you with it's adventurous, funny, and emotional plot. While you reading it you feel a certain connection with the characters and you feel that you know each one. This book is impossible to put down and you don't want it to ever end. The Poisonwood Bible is definetely worth your time to read."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book had some promise. It could have been good but I did not feel part of the story. The author was just telling the reader what happened. I like to know what the characters are experiencing inside as well as out. I lost interest in the first quarter of the book. I gave more than one star because the premise was good and the characters at least potentially were interesting."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I read this book several years ago and re-read some of it recently when my teenage daughter read it for a class. Folks, it doesn't get better than this book. I am an avid reader and have read other Kingsolver books, this is by far her best and simply one of my all-time favorite books. The ending still makes me shiver....a transformational experience, not to be missed!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book's title drew me to it. I don't know why but I was not disappointed! This book just compels the reader to keep on reading! You never know what is going to happen to this missionary family that ends up traveling to Africa, but you sure enjoy the ride! Some parts fill you with sorrow, others make you laugh out loud, but most of all you end up feeling like you want to meet all of the characters in person. This book was my first Barbara Kingsolver read and I have since read every novel she has ever written, and will continue to do so. Her writing is top notch, don't miss out on this one!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is a modern masterpiece. Kingsolver has captured with exquisite sensitivity and nuance life in Africa. Her ability to move from character to character and capture the \\"voice\\" of each person is masterful and memorable. I wish I could do what she does here."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Being poor takes on a whole different meaning in this novel. I thought I had it bad? Nope, not even close; the depth of these characters, and their trials as well as their triumphs, make this book a great read. It really brought home what I take for granted, every day of my life."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I loved this book--not only because of the controversy, but also the style of writing. Kingsolver creates lyrical sentences that really draw you into the story. This book really makes you think. (In a good way!!)"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Originally Reviewed on October 31, 2003This book was hard to get into, but once hooked on the story of this family in Africa in the 50's &amp; 60's I couldn't put it down. Beautiful writing and interesting perspectives to have the story told from. Bravo!!Michael Duranko, Bootism: a shoe religionwww.bootism.com"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poison Wood Bible was a great book. The characters were wonderfully put together. Adah was my favorite character. Even though she was viewed as an outcast by her family, she was the only person who knew who she truly was. The worst part of the book was the plot. It tended to drag on and was hard to follow at times. In conclusion, The Poison Wood Bible is a great book to read if you want to think."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I'm an author (BABY CATCHER: Chronicles of a Modern Midwife), and I also teach writing classes. I appreciate all of Kingsolver's books for different reasons, but this one is a particular triumph in her ability to write in the very distinctive voices of several different characters. You have only to open the book at random and read 2 or 3 lines to know exactly which character is telling her part of the story. A tour de force.The story concerns the family of Nathan Price, a self-righteousness religious fanatic who drags them all off to the Congo to save souls. Disaster is inevitable, and disaster is what happens. The story is told mostly by the four daughters: the malaprop and clich&eacute;-ridden vapid eldest daughter, the intelligent and sincerely adoring 2nd child, the schrewd, watchful and mute 3rd child, and the youngest, a 5yo. Beyond the story of just this family, however, Kingsolver carefully spoon-feeds us a lesson in brutal nationalistic rule of the Belgian Congo, racial genocide, the CIA's involvement in some of the horrors that engulfed Africa, and exploitation of poor countries by rich ones.Top notch book by one of the US's top notch writers."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is my favorite novel of all time. I couldn't put it down! The characters are amazing. I found myself crying more than once while reading this wonderful novel. I highly recommend it to anyone!!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I found the story very hard to get into and then I had to force myself to finish it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Book was in excellent condition.

I couldn't buy into any of the characters. They had no substance. And the wife, move on already!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Despite universal acclaim, I found the characters cartoonish and predictable. The world of men are bad and women endure and prevail does not represent a fictional world I'd like to enter nor the real world where I live. Dear old crazy dad, we made it despite him or because of him, but we couldn't, didn't, don't love him."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Nuff said about it. I thought it was depressing (as are all of Oprah's picks). Doesn't she like to read anything upbeat?"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I have recently read the book, \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\" by Barbara Kingsolver. A Southern Baptist family from Bethlehem, Georgia embark on a dangerous mission trip to the African Congo with father Reverend Nathan Price leading the way. There are four daughters, Rachel, the oldest, Adah and Leah, the twins, and Ruth May, the youngest. Set in the year 1959, the mother Orleanna Price is the primiary caretaker of the four girls, while her radical Baptist husband attempts to spread the word of God.The first thing you have to know about this book is that it is very religious. If you are not of a Christian religion, I would strongly advist you not to read this book. It is hard to follow if you do not know the Bible. Throughout the story, there is made reference to the Bible and how it applies to everyday life and so forth. Nathan Price's ultimate mission on this trip is to baptize every person in the village of Kilanga in a nearby river. When told that the river is infested with crocodiles and alligators, Nathan loses his cool.You must also understand politics to be able to follow this book. At this point in history, the Congo is declaring their independence from Belgium, and it causes many issue. This is the part of the book I did not understand. There were too many people to keep track of, and too much history to grasp.Another point about this book was that it had five different points of view from which it was told. Each daughter, (and occasionally Orleanna) told parts of the story. Rachel has the \\"I don't want to be here\\" attitude, while Ruth May is just the opposite. She sees the world of the Congo as one big game, constantly exploring new things. The twins, Adah and Leah, are like nigh and day. Leah wants to follow in her fathers footsteps, while Adah is the quiet, poetic type. Adah is the \\"special\\" characters in this story, becauase the left side of her body does not function like her right side does. She rarely talks, and is virtually ignored by her three sisters.My opinino on this book was that it wasn't the best I've ever read. Like I mentioned before, it was too political for my taste, and too hard to understand. Ruth May was my favorite characters because I found it funny how she saw everything from a child-like point of view. Adah's parts of the book were definitely the hardest to understand, because she plays word games with herself, and writes poems backwards. I would only reccomend this book to someone who knew much about their religion and enjoyed reading about political matters.Abby, 13, KY"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"ugh. the facts were fascinating but it was very hard to get into and just because of that I forced myself to finish it.

I adored the book, even the parts at the end which most other reviewers found did not work for them.The technique of story telling is second to none and the different voices BK invents for the mother and four daughters who present the events from their own point of view are very convincing.The characters are all well portrayed, American, Belgian and African. I liked Anatole and felt ready to listen to all he said and sympathised deeply with his convictions. He seemed to be the missionary - rather than the mentally scarred and fatally flawed Reverend Price. BK seems to find it hard to include any ordinary male characters though; they are all extremes.The women in the story are wonderfully depicted : such strong characters, so memorable, so complete....The style of the book is superb and there is not an ill-judged moment in all the very long story.Although (!) I am a man, I cried on many occasions throughout the book. I do not think this emotion is reserved for women, and I do not share the opinion of another reviewer who thinks that BK's fans are likely to be largely women. I thoroughly recommend The Poisonwood Bible - excellently researched, beautifully written, challenging, realistic... and a huge success.Easily a five-star experience; I intend to read TPB again!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"in many ways this book is transcendent. very complex and pleasing imagery and symbolism. complex characters that force you to understand them. at page 365 a very significant event occurs, and it is described in one of the most moving passages i have ever experienced.unfortunately after this the author shifts gears. instead of wrapping it up and letting a divine story rest on its laurels she meanders for 150 pages of very unsatisfactory and preachy epilogue. someone should have intervened in an editorial capacity, because as of page 365 this book could stand peerless. unfortunately that potential is squandered leaving the sum total as only very good."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver's command of languages, especially English, is stupendous. I loved looking at the sentences, the palindromes, the onomatopoeia, the way she makes a sentence sing.Four sister and a mother are taken single file to the Congo by a father and husband, Nathan, to be missionaries to the savages. This cruel, legalistic man instead only turns people away from his gospel in utter fear. He takes the gospel and uses it to punish his daughters and wife and then the Congolese.\\"Away down below now, single file on the path, comes a woman with four girls in tow, all of them in shirtwaist dresses. Seen from above this way they are pale , doomed blossoms, bound to appeal to your sympathies. Be careful. Later on you'll have to decide what sympathy they deserve. The mother especially- watch how she leads them on, pale-eyed, deliberate. Her dark hair is tied in a ragged lace handkerchief, and her curved jawbone is lit with large, false-pearl earrings, as if these headlamps from another world might show the way. The daughters march behind her , four girls compressed bodies as tight as bowstrings, each one tensed to fire off a woman's heart on a different path to glory or damnation...\\"The story is told chapter by chapter through the eyes of one of the daughters and less frequently by Nathan's wife, Orleanna.The story is sad and complex. One man's desire to seek his own glory claiming it as glory for God and in the he end destroys everyone he thought he'd save, including himself."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I had to read this book for school, so I honestly wasn't expecting much. However, I was pleasently suprised. I enjoyed reading a lot of the book. I loved the plot in the first half. I really connected with the characters - they were all realistic with their own motivations and problems. I found myself cheering on some characters and scorning others. They all felt like real people. The author also does a good job of introducing a world most Americans like myself never really knew about. I loved reading about the Congo, and I found myself glued to the book as the characters faced real-life problems like illness or lack of food.The reason I rate this book three stars is because of the length. After the climax in the Congo, the book continues on for almost 200 pages detailing exactly how the characters live out the remainder of their lives. I think a simple epilogue would have done it, honestly.Basically, the first, say, 300 pages or so are pretty good, but after that, it just drags."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Each of us has his own idea of the perfect novel. Crime and Punishment is mine. On the other hand, perfection is nigh on to impossible.In The Poisonwood Bible, Barbara Kingsolver has given us a novel to be reckoned with. As Browning said of Andrea del Sarto, his \\"perfect\\" painter, \\"Less is more.\\" He meant that del Sarto would have been a better painter if he hadn't tried to cover each and every base. That was my main problem with this absorbing novel. Kingsolver goes on and on. By the time you reach page 400 you are exhausted and there are still more than 100 pages to go.That said, Poisonwood is a momentous and memorable achievement. One may not agree with all her choices, all her voices, but the larger canvas she paints of Africa despoiled by those professing to \\"civilize\\" her, is clear and affecting."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Every time I read a well written book about Africa I want to go there. This book is awesome! I enjoyed the character development, the stories, the education on a way of life I'm totally unfamiliar with. I especially enjoyed the social lessons. I have long suspected that missionaries do more harm than good especially if they harbor the assumption that people are ignorant because they don't subscribe to their views or way of life.I felt like these characters were real people and couldn't wait to get back to the book to see what they were up to. I especially liked that the author continued the story beyond resolving the initial problem of getting out of there. She did not leave me hanging looking for resolution to the problems these people had after her perfect character development.I will read everything Barbara Kingsolver has written and I don't know whey I haven't read her books previously.When I finished this book I wanted to immediately start it over because I didn't want the story to end."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"i finally got around to reading this novel that so many had recommended to me (including my wife). the painful story of a fundamentalist missionary family to the belgian congo, the poisonwood bible is narrated, in turns, by each of four (very different) daughters of fiery (and culturally clueless) bull of a father and a reluctant, conflicted mother (who takes occasional turns at narration also, but from a more current place of retirement, reflecting back). sweeping and epic, the books covers multiple decades, and plays out the implications in the four mostly divergent stories of the daughters, who all respond in wildly disparate ways (though none, unfortunately, seem to hold onto anything of a christian faith). the book is both inviting story and a broad-stroke piece of biting commentary on the kind of colonial mentality that has often been the lousy gift of americans in cross-cultural contexts (missionary or government or business), overtly in times past, and more subtly these days. i almost envision this book as a narrative primer to dave livermore's important non-fiction book, cultural intelligence."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Finely crafted and cleverly unique, this book of superbly developed characters and vivid settings touches a place deep within the reader's soul. Nathan Price, a self-righteous, oppressive missionary and equally tyrannical husband and father, takes his family into the deepest reaches of Congo. Their adventures are fascinating, but the interaction of personalities is mesmerizing. This book is a gem and each word is so carefully chosen that it oftentimes reads like poetry. Filled with compassion and love and forgiveness, this book is one-of-a-kind."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver has written an exciting novel, I call a \\"page turner\\". The plot and story line are gripping. I especially enjoyed reading this book through the eyes of the children in this missionary family. In one sense it is historical because of events involving African rulers and their countries, well publicized around the world. The author has managed to develop each character into people one can easily relate to and understand. For example, I didn't much care for Nathan Price, the father of this family so you can see what a marvelous talent she has for character development. He was indeed a misguided soul in his religious concepts and his attitude towards his wife and family. The story is told in a chronological order divided between the characters and their ongoing thoughts and reactions to each situation. They arrive in this native village in the Belgian Congo almost totally without missionary support because they were warned not to go. Nathan has brought with him all types of seeds to plant to show these natives how to make a garden. His seeds produce huge vines and leaves, but no fruit. They are unsuitable to African soil and climate. When he is planting he refuses the suggestions of one of the African women to plant in hills rather than level rows, the result of which, rains come and wash everything away. Nathan is just so convinced that he knows so much more than these African people about everything. His big focus is on getting the African children baptized in the river. The natives absolutely will not allow this. They've already lost children to the crocodiles when they wandered too close to the water. This book will keep you reading long after you need to sleep."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"\\"Beto nki tutasala? What are we doing?\\" quote from Page 523......and...I asked myself that question throughout the book as the Price Family continued with their missionary work and all the hardships and heartache the family endured.The Price Family...Father Nathan, Mother Orleanna, and their four daughters pack for their mission in the Congo trying to figure out what they should take...not knowing that most of the things they take will be useless and not knowing what is in store for them in terms of day-to-day living. While they are there, the country fights for its independence from Belgium.Nathan Price is a very controlling, mean person....he treats his wife and his daughters like second-class citizens while he preaches to the people of the Congo. He is oblivious to what he is putting his family through. The family endures the hardships of a third world country while enduring the abuse from Nathan.It was interesting to see how the people in the Congo live. I definitely wouldn't want to live there for even a day....no niceties of life at all. I know the book was about more than the family's living arrangements and treatment of them by Nathan Price, but that encompassed all of it for me. :)I enjoyed the Price family...all except the father...the daughters made some life decisions that definitely had their father's influence.The book is superbly written......you won't want to put it down. You also learn that your childhood and what you learn does follow you throughout your entire life, influences your decisions about career and spouse, and that you are like your parents no matter how much you may not want to admit it.A definite must read...it will haunt you long after you have completed the last page"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This powerful story of one family's experience as white missionaries during the terrible days of the Congo's independence struggle with Belgium, is at once both a wonderfully engrossing tale of the character's struggles to survive on the edge of the jungle and a strong indictment of the hubris of western efforts to graft its own values onto an incompatible culture.The story is told from the points of view of the wife and children (3 daughters) of the American missionary (Southern Baptist) who has come to the Congo to spread the 'word of God' among the heathens. What this man doesn't know - about the culture he is dealing with, the land he must live in, the politics that will ultimately control his family's future - is legion. He takes the view that if he is sincere in his work, then 'God will provide.' While Alexander Campbell said that a Christian should be 'a fool for God', missionary Nathan Price is a fool in every other way as well. He blindly endangers his own life and that of his wife and children by his refuseal to learn even the simplest aspects of what any sane person should know in dealing with an unfamiliar land and culture. Tragedy, of course, follows. Nathan, perhaps, deserves it. But the suffering that is felt most strongly is that of his family, and each tells their unforgetable story in a unique, personal voice.Kingsolver's prose is perfect for the job. The language, by turns, is beautifully lush or painfully spare. There is humor to relieve the inevitable trauma(s) to come and a great descriptive passages that breathe life into the story's setting. The weakest character is Nathan, because he doesn't have a voice of his own, except the actions and words reported by his family - each of whom comes to fear or despise him as it is more and more clear that he is living in a fantasy world.This is a painful and emotionally heavy book, but also a very beautiful and significant piece of work. The ending will seem too muted and subdued for those wanting a solid wrap up, but it is perfect for a novel that looks back across a whole lifetime at events many years in the past."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Reading this book I was reminded of E.M Forsters words in preface to Howard's End &quot;Only connect..&quot; I felt that Barbara Kingsolver has poured her heart and soul into this book and in the process she has connected with the lives of the people it describes. The result for me is the most unputdownable read I have had in many a year. I can understand why some Americans and perhaps more particularly some religious zealots don't like this book but to me it seems to ring so true -the CIA involvement in African politics, the religious fanaticism, the humanity, the fraught lives of people in desperation. Yes I found some minor annoyances in Rachel's malapropisms and Ada's semi-miraculous healing but the story is powerful enough to overcome them and the beauty of the author's writing is quite breath-taking."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I loved this book. The writing is beautiful, and I enjoyed the use of different voices for each character. Some passages were breath-takingly poignant(the children's spontaneous &quot;Mah dah mey I?&quot; tribute to Ruth May)and stayed with me long after I finished the book. My perception of Africa has changed, colored by Kingsolver's vivid details about the landscape and people of the Congo. I learned alot about the political climate and history of the Congo,for which I was grateful, and didn't resent in the least. It's been disappointing to read reviews by people whining about political correctness, &quot;diatribes&quot;, and the &quot;bashing&quot; of men, whites, americans, etc. I really appreciated a different kind of perspective for a change, and the chance to examine american biases and assumptions."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"How can an overstuffed American not be affected by this novel? My toddler son threw away half his lunch yesterday (and most days). My infant daughter has more clothes than most Africans will have in a lifetime. The house is full of toys and more are waiting in closets for the holidays. Some parents here CHOOSE not to vaccinate their children when African children die of preventable diseases by the boatload. Toys, clothes, vaccines, food - how much we all take for granted. Although I loved the first half of the novel for its characters and its plot, I love the second half for reminding me that we are a wasteful, shallow people. I want to have Adah's intensity, Leah's passion, but, despite thinking about the world's problems from time to time, I feel more like Rachel. Thank you Barbara Kingsolver for this wonderful book and thank you for &quot;wearing your politics on your sleeve&quot;."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I agree with another reader; that we didn't get to know Nathan Price really. I did hate him. For his ignorance, his self-rightousness and his unwillingness to get to know the very people he was trying to &quot;save&quot;. I suppose his motives were admirable, didn't he leave all the comforts of home as well? But what motivated him? What was he like at home in Georgia? What really happened to him? As a mother, I was frustrated with Orleanna for not getting her children out of there, no matter the risk or cost. But, I loved the chapters of Orleanna's. Barbara Kinsolver made you feel as though you were in her very shoes. My favorite character was Adah. I looked forward to her chapters, and her backward writing. I was a little disappointed when she was &quot;cured&quot;. Rachel was too self-absorbed to be real. Leah had honorable motives, except that she was willing to starve her children for them. I loved Ruth May. I recommend this book AND I am a Christian who admires honest missionary work. But as in EVERY religion, we see fanatics. We must not judge an entire race or religion based on a few nuts. And there are more than a few."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible is the most captivating book I've read all year. Kingsolver makes you fall in love with her characters, who are so lifelike that you know the intricate details of their personalities. It is an impressive work, and it is brilliantly and intelligently written. I could not put it down until I finished it, and then I was sad it was over."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"When a book is equally riveting the second time it is read, that's a good book. The range of voices, plain and mysterious, captivated me. I have been to the sad state of the former Zaire as a peace corp mother. Because of Kingsolver's descriptions, I could see the heat, the soil, the indigenous people so very different from us in the states. I remembered again how powerful the influence of the natural world was on the way we moved thru the time (several weeks) as we moved thru the jungle, then the savannah land. But it was the people's forbearance at that time that the author of Poisonwood Bible put into words for me. Kingsolver's knowledge of the culture and political situations indicated some serious research; I was glad that Mobutu was labeled correctly in her writing and that the U.S. collusion was identified. Quite brave of her. We were not allowed to discuss politics during our visit although it was quite obvious the nation's infrastructure was disintegrating."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This was one of the best, most all consuming stories I have ever read. From the beginning I was drawn into this astonishing recount of a family's torrid affair with the Congo. The descriptions of the jungle and those who inhabit same were articulate and wonderfully captured the sense of place and time. What made this book so exceptional, in my opinion, is that it was the telling of a fictional family against a factual backdrop - if nothing else, an extremely interesting history lesson - but in reality so much more. I cannot believe anyone could read this book and not be moved to tears or have utter compassion for the events that take place. I have loved past Kingsolver novels, but this is surely my favorite - an extraordinary tale."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver has written another enthralling character study/adventure that takes us into the depths of the Belgian Congo, through the horrors of civil war, and finally into a sense of redemption for the characters if not for the Congo(Zaire) itself. The Poisonwood Bible is a three generation tale, which begins with a zealous, if unrealistic and wrathful Baptist preacher, his wife and four daughters, who come to the Congo against all advice seeking to &quot;save&quot; the heathen from their pagan and primitive ways. Nathan Price, the preacher, is an increasingly hateful and vengeful man whose dreams of converting the natives only bring him ridicule and distrust. In contrast to &quot;the darkest of Africa&quot; Nathan is the one who is in the dark as he stubbornly refuses to understand and to love his would be congregation. While he is alienating the natives, his family becomes more and more distant as well, despite his firey punishments and evil dispensations. The story is told alternately by his wife and the four daughters, all with distinctly different personalities and perspectives on their mutual situation. Through them aa narrators, we come to understand the culture and its people, and are able to see the reality that exists. Besides the daily rigors of living in an extremely dangerous and primitive tropical environment, the characters are forced to live through the terror of civil war and the accompanying atrocities that follow in the new so-called democratic government. Kingsolver presents a well-researched chronicle of the Congo's struggle to attain autonomy along with the international politics that have caused betrayal and heartbreak for much of Africa. Finally, we see in the attitudes of two opposing men of God the damage as well as the good that can be done in undeveloped countries. We also see their individual beliefs played out in the daughters' lives as they find their place as adults whose lives have been strongly influenced by a partial childhood in the depths of Africa. This is a good book, both for its characterization and its plot. There is much food for thought here, not only for those living in primitive cultures, but for those of us here who can influence what may occur in those cultures."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I began with &quot;The Bean Trees&quot; not long after it was published, and I've been a devotee of Barbara Kingsolver ever since -- even &quot;High Tide in Tucson.&quot; &quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot; is a quantum leap -- in language, in complexity of characters and setting and story, in depth of theme. It's a BIG book, and it took control of my mind, my imagination for nearly a week. The story of a Free Will Baptist preacher and family who go to the Congo in 1959 for a missionary year driven by the father's towering obsession and blinding ignorance, the novel is a series of overlapping monologues/soliloquies by the missionary's wife and her four daughters. What I always find compelling about Barbara Kingsolver is the depth of her truth-telling about human lives and incidents both minute and earthshaking. In &quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot; she has stretched her truth-telling even further, to profound themes of contact/conflict/otherness; social justice issues of race, poverty, colonialism, greed, and ignorance; and the ways our lives interconnect across time and space. It's brilliant -- something like a cross between &quot;As I Lay Dying&quot; and Dostoevsky, with some Nabokov for flavoring. The language is intoxicating, and the spell continues."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"It was the best book I ever read.

I'm sure the Congo material was meticulously reseached and honestly come by, but couldn't Kingsolver have made a trip to Atlanta if she's going to write about it? Agriculture at Emory University? I had to laugh. No, you must go to UGA or Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College. And in the days cited, married students were housed, not in a ramshackle wooden building, but a large, sturdy stucco one that matched the rest of the campus buildings. EU had no formal entrance exams in the 1960s--unless she was referring to the SATs. I was there. And Sandy Springs in the country? Well, maybe 50 years ago. That's where I live, and there aren't many wide open spaces here.

I found it to be tedious, repetetive and boring. The only good parts of the book in my opinion were the beginning and the last 30 pages or so. The entire in-between was GRUELING! I felt the need to get to the end of Poisonwood because my past experiences with other Kingsolver books have been so great and she is such a talented writer. Reading &quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot; was almost as arduous a task as getting out of bed very early on a rainy, icky, cold Sunday morning because it's raining on your bed.

The reader would then understand the slanted views of the World and Africa presented in this book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Rachel Price says that \\"Leah always has an answer for everything\\" concerning Africa and the Congo. Well substitute Barbara Kingsolver's name for Leah and add \\"in the form of propaganda\\" after \\"answer\\" (or substitute \\"opinion\\" for \\"answer\\") and you have a fairly good idea of what sort of novel you are in for. Let me expain in further detail.1. RELIGION. Kingsolver lets us know right off the bat that she thinks Christianity is bad for the world and that we would all be better off without it. Just to underline that belief, she makes Nathan Price into a culturally ignorance, wife (and child) beater, my-way-is-the-only-way-right, tyrannical minister. Yes, I am sure that these types of ministers do exist, but Kingsolver is so determined to demonize Christianity, that she actually makes the reader (or, at least, me) sympathic to Nathan.She does have some good religious people. For example, Brother Fowles, but she waters the good religious people's views down to the point where they no longer resemble being Catholic or Baptist but rather New Agey and Hippie.2. COMMUNISM/ ANTI-AMERICANISM. Now, there is nothing wrong with Communism, and certainly America does need to have its bit of criticism, but Kingsolver so continually criticizes the United States and Capitalism that is gets tiresome. By her point of view, all things evil in this world (and in particular what happened in the Congo) happens because the United States exists and because we have a Capitalist system. She totally igores the long histories of Europe and Asia and Africa before the United States became a nation, and basically and solely blames us for the evils of the world.The book is uneven at best. When Kingsolver isn't propagandizing, her descriptions of the Congo and its culture are quite interesting. However, she kills off the characterization. Orleanna and Leah \\"carry\\" the burden and extreme guilt that are they white. Rachel is made into a racist. Ruth May becomes the symbol for the Lost Independence of the Congo. All this is made very obvious. There is no symbolism. Particularly it is made clear in the last 150 pages when we are treated to lectures infinitum.Also, the religious theology is not at all convincing. Kingsolver meshes the Baptist and Catholic theologies until it becomes laughable, until there is no difference at all. Having grown up in a background of both those religions, let me assure you that there are some differences.For example, Nathan revels in the Apocryphal, which Baptists don't believe in. Perhaps he does so so that way when Brother Fowles comes for a visit the two can have a War of The Verses.Also, reciting Psalms and verses is not considered saying prayers by the Baptist Church, but the characters are continually shown doing that. And NOWHERE in the Bible is there a verse about being loyal to one's race (i.e. to believe that your race is superior to another's)And Baptists don't believe that baptism alone will mean that you will get to heaven. First, you have to be saved through faith, then later maybe you will have a baptism.I loved Kingsolver's BEAN TREES, but this book, I just wanted to pitch into the trashcan. Maybe read PEONY by P.S. Buck if you want a great novel about the religious and social differences between cultures, and there is that classic book HEART OF DARKNESS by Joseph Conrad that will always be a classic long after POISONWOOD BIBLE is forgotten."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Many people have responded that it is an inaccurate view of Africa. Well, I'm greatly disappointed with her handling of scripture and bible stories. Right from the beginning, her story of Susannah and the prophet Daniel saving her life.....never happened and not evidenced in the bible. Had to quit reading the book knowing that she had no idea or basis to write a novel centered around a preacher (who gives Christianity a bad name, by the way), with no or little knowledge of what is in the bible."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver is one of the greatest living writers. Her writing is superb and so moving.The book is abit long but I took my time and relished reading it. Ofcourse, my favorite is The Lacuna, one of my favorites in my life. Don't miss her work."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Wonderful prose and story. I read this about one year after coming to live in (West) Africa. I've now spent 7 years here (remote areas, not capitals) working for non-profits, not missionary work, and this is the book I recommend to anyone to get a taste and feel of true village life in Africa. It captures it better than any guide book or non-fiction work I've read and I have read a lot of Africa travel narratives and memoirs and fiction. (Other books to get a good feel include anything by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie and Aminata Forna.)It was surreal to be in a similar type of village while reading it. It made me laugh at times when reading descriptions of the local characters because many similar ones populate my life, right outside my house and the villages around here. I also fully empathised with their limited food choices and having to cook on a wood fire. At one point our town had no gas and I was cooking over a coal pot for 2 weeks and thanked god when the gas came back to town. But you make do. The story did nail it.There was a tattered copy being passed around all the visitors that came through our place at one point and everyone agreed it was their best Africa book as well. Many bought their own copy at home.The thing is, Africa is not what you see on TV or in the media, generally. It has been done a great disservice by the media.I found myself nodding and fully agreeing with the comments made in the review \\"Been there, done that\\":\\"I lived in Africa for 8 years and never learned the local language. I played mostly with other missionary kids, not the African children. My brother, who was younger (like Ruth Ann) interacted best with the local children. Another complaint I read was this: where was Nathan while his family starved? Africa is full of remote villages and many missionaries spent a lot of time away from their families travelling to these villages. Things happened while they were gone. Most of the criticism I read about this novel seems to be by Americans making assumptions about life in Africa and complaining because this book didn't live up to what they expected. I've been there and this book describes it all: the land, the people (Americans, Africans and \\"Europeans\\" or white Africans),the cultural misunderstandings and the political turmoil perfectly. I knew all the characters in this book. They were my family, my friends, my neighbors. As for the complaints about a political slant, she writes as it was: Communism and Socialism sound different in a country where very few (white people) have it all and very many (black people) have nothing, and democracy is hollow when democratic countries back the enemy.\\"I have also read complaints here and elsewhere, but never from anyone who's lived or worked in Africa. They do seem to be from those who rely on television for their version of Africa.While their circumstances were extreme, it's not too much of a stretch to imagine running out of food in remote areas (like where I live) in a bad season. It's hard enough to get the basics even today in a steady W African country, let alone steady food if you don't have money.We actually had an African grey parrot and they really do remember everything and capture your voice, its pitch, accent, everything perfectly. I even did dance practice and it mimicked the sounds of instruments used. I taught it different languages. We had to refrain from letting it hear certain sounds least it repeat them in polite company because he was a veritable sound bite library for about the past 10 years of his life.I've suffered from malaria countless times and truly empathised and felt how it is to be in the position they were in back then, fictionally, when the drugs were not as good as they are now.In terms of understanding the damage western governments and, to an extent, missionaries have inflicted on Africa, it gives one of the best insights I've read. Each of the four main characters represents a point of view in relation to the attitude of foreigners/gov to Africa and I think Kingslover did a brilliant job of exploring that.I live in a place where Christianity, Islam and traditional beliefs sit happily together and there is actually no religious conflict here--amazing. However, the Bible is invoked for all sorts of situations requiring judgment, including justifying beating children in school (violently) with canes. I challenged teachers over it and they quoted parts of the Bible...spare the rod, spoil the child...etc. People are taught that if they do not give as much money as possible to their pastors, they will be less favoured on judgment day in heaven than those who give more. Today. Now, every Sunday all over this country and I presume the Christian parts of Africa since I've heard similar stories from friends living elsewhere.Why do you beat children? I asked. Because our colonial masters told us that's the right thing to do in the classroom...How do you argue with that? Do you say, well, they were wrong now you do it like you used to without canes?The novel is fiction, but it is also seems to be much-needed representation of reality, I think, based on the responses that seem to think it's not realistic.If you want to begin a journey of understanding part of why things are as they are today, 2012, in Africa, and the terrible impact of foreign policy (and war and assassinations) on African nations by foreign nations, and how that trickles down to the individuals, like the characters in this story who as real as many of the people I meet and work with every day, this is a good place to start."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Loved it!I have recommended it to everyone that I know.

If you are just looking for a cheap book that is worth reading this would be it. At the same time if this book is on a list of books to read for your highschool or college reading class I would highly recommend it.

Not saying some guys might not like it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"than my summer reading list. My daughter was given this colorful, interesting, approachable book to read for her senior year. I had Joseph Conrad's &#34;Heart of Darkness&#34;, along with a list of five other books to get ready for the school year. Say it with me, &#34;The horror!&#34;This story is much more approachable. The play on words brings humor. The oldest sister's poor word choices, making her sentences mean something other than intended are priceless. We have a family member who does that, and we will laugh for hours over the reactions some of her choices have brought her when aired to the public. (Family just knew what she wanted to say and translated for her.)Some of Adah's special verses will be forever remembered for religious services. 'amen enema' will probably be my favorite for years to come and should be usefull for the longwinded sermonizer as well as the composer who wrote the choir the 57 fold amen to close the service."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"i have read and reread this amazing book many times and enjoy it more each read. kingsolver does an amazing job to portray each and every character down to the finest detail. this book is forever one of my favs"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I love this book. I read it several years ago and still often think about the characters. Extremely well researched. I don't know how Barbara does it. Each of her books delve into completely new territory but this, this is the best."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible is set in a yore, but is an enjoyable narrative. In the book the author describes how a father brought his family to an austere environment that tested the family's faith. In addition, the book also gives an interesting synopsis of the government of Patrice Lummba, a snapshot of the independence movement of the Congo.The book also shows how the Belgian government had an inchoate picture of the Congo, many of the stereotypes of the people were simply were not true. More importantly, it reveals how the Belgians absconded with the treasures of the country, such as gold and Cobalt, while leaving the Congolese with nothing. Furthermore, the matriarch of the family refused to capitulate his beliefs even after losing a child in the Congo. Finally, I read this book because several people gave it such high approbation. Yet, they did not mention the author introduces the story of Ham from the Bible to suggest that Africans have been cursed. Furthermore, Christian missionaries used a similar argument to justify American slavery. In that sense, the book resurrects ideas that have been used demean Africans."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I really loved this book. The thing I would say that was difficult was the extensive political history but that was still very good."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The child of medical and public health workers, Barbara Kingsolver spent a year in the Congo as a child. She kept a file of notes, research, character sketches, and scenes for over ten years, but was afraid to write the novel she referred to as that \\"Damned Africa Book\\". She finally began to write it when her husband encouraged her, offering to take her back to the Congo to do it.The book is about an African missionary, Nathan Price, who takes his wife and four daughters to the Congo to save souls. The problem was he had little respect for his congregation. When he planted a garden he ignored his housekeeper's efforts to show him how, only relenting when floods wiped out his vegetables more than once. He touched the Poisonwood tree, despite being warned. He insisted on baptizing the natives in the river, not realizing that crocodiles were lying in wait. The wife and daughters go through many trials and tribulations, including a \\"driver\\" ant invasion that destroys everything they have. Nathan Price provokes the wrath of the local chief and the witchdoctor who uses the \\"green mamba\\" in an especially dastardly way.This is a historical novel of sorts, in that the Prices arrive in the Congo just as the country is winning its independence from Belgium; the new president is Patrice Lumumba who has communist ties. She relied on Jonathan Kwitny's ENDLESS ENEMIES to describe his eventual demise, claiming through Leah, one of the daughters, that Eisenhower and the United States was behind the assassination. Later Leah claims the U.S. also supported a rebel faction to oppose the independence movement in Angola.The novel is character based in that the four girls and the mother take turns telling the story. Rachel, is the Barbie doll oldest girl who hates Africa and feels she's been ill-treated in being forced to live there. Leah and Adah are twins, both considered extremely intelligent, although Adah doesn't talk. Adah was born missing part of her brain, but the other side compensated, despite her being crippled on one side. Ruth May is the youngest and bossiest of the foursome, teaching the African children to play \\"Mother May I.\\" Her biggest ambition is to become a green mamba, used to great effect later in the story.There is some humor in the book, most of it provided by Rachel's malaprops and her lack of any empathy for others whatsoever. When she experiences a drawback it's \\"a complete tapestry of justice.\\" Referring to the African children she says, \\"Normally they clamber around me until I feel like Gulliver among the Lepidopterans.\\"In her addendums, Kingsolver reveals that she got some criticism from Christians regarding her portrayal of a Baptist minister, but there's another missionary family in the book, and they embrace the African people and respect their civilization."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I loved this book! The story, written through the eyes of four daughters and their unbelievable times growing up in the Congo, was entertaining, thought provoking and quite an adventure! Although the author did get a little caught up in her own political agenda in the second half, the story still remained interesting and left the reader anxious to see what was going to happen next to these amazing characters! I loved the writing, loved the characters, and was caught up in the troubled history and story of the Congo. It was a great read; when I hear a story about Africa in the future, I will surely think of this book!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is the first book I have read by Barbara Kingsolver *BUT* plan on reading others.I found this book difficult to get into in the beginning of the book. As time went on and I continued reading the book did grab me and I found the story very interesting.Nathan Price, takes his wife and four daughters to Africa to be missionaries. The book explains all that they went through while in Africa and how it came about that some of the family left and left family members behind. The book is wrote by Mrs. Price and the four daughters. Can be a real page turner once you get into the story."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"An avid Kingsolver fan, I found this book disappointing. I didn't love anyone in the book. Everyone was pathetic. Her agendas are quite clear about Christianity, the United States and men. That's okay, it's good to be constructively critical. But it wasn't convincing. Like another reviewer wrote, not one character becomes anyone I admire. It's a dark book with no hope. No hope for the Africans, no hope for the four women. No hope for the father. I had to plow through the middle of it just so I could breathe...looking for some hope. I don't want a pollyanna ending. But really, there are a lot better novels out there about women, Africa, missionaries and their effect on other cultures and visa versa..."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Kingsolver, after the successful Bean Trees, shifts gear to conquer a little piece of the unknown in this 1998 best seller, set in a Congo struggling for, then with its new identity. Caught in the dramatic events such as Kantaga's secession, mysterious death of Congo's first prime minister, and CIA entanglement, is a disillusioned Georgia family, tyrannized by a devout evangelical Baptist father against the backdrop of a dazed Black Africa. The first half of Poisonwood Bible dedicates itself to description of a serene village called Kilanga, where Nathan Price rooted his family, which remains superficially unchanged as the world around it changes faces. Despite the banality of fanatical preachers we have had in this half of the century, Kingsolver approaches the racist, supremacist, chauvinistic Father Price with an uneasy tenderness revealed in narration by his pessimistic and neurotic wife Oreleanna as well as their four daughters, who come to represent the different extremities that are to ail and be ailed by Congo. As Nathan becomes possessed with the religious fervor that pushes his family closer to the pit of ignorance and death, the natives prove themselves true kindred spirits and save the family despite Nathan's attempt to force Kilanga into marriage with Christianity. The first half ends in an exodus, which is only one of many vivid biblical allusions pervading this bible. The soothing tone of voice takes a sudden turn as readers are forced to draw attention away from the life and the people; the main weakness of this novel is indeed Kingsolver's intense intellectual storm in the second half that forces the reader to swallow history. There is an awkwardness in the transition that provides no continuity in the natural progress of the four sisters and the mother: frank but shallow Rachel, competitive but dogmatic Leah, philosophical but morbid Adah, and young but so very young Ruth May, and an ailing mother too scarred by the devastation of Congo's burgeoning aberration as a young independent country under Western shadow still. Almost similar to War and Peace except, Tolstoy was brilliant at picking up the thread, Kingsolver devotes the second half to reflections of her own political views through voices of different characters, that the magnitude of ideas and opinions come as an astounding force to push the unique intimacy established previously between the readers and characters completely away.But despite its faults as an almost propagandized political novel, The Poisonwood Bible is a great read for what it evokes in you. Arrays of characters come fusing into the grand panaroma of Congo, to help shape a fragile yet stern frame of the human resilience. Do overlook Kingsolver's effort to &quot;re-educate&quot;, Leah's defense of communism may seem tiresome at the end but one thing is certain that lurks behind every single line: Kingsolver's great love for a country, whose birth and growth are hindered by what Westerners continue to regard as phenomena. Her clear focus never did become hazy despite the verbose offence her latter half hastes to thrash upon Western Imperialism and expansionism. Perhaps Africa is a matter that demands far more folds, then Kingsolver does achieve an impressive balance to capture the very essence of struggle at least. Just like disabled twin Adah says in the book, &quot;The Congo is only a long path that takes you from one hidden place to another,&quot; yield to the beautiful language and rhythm to be guided and questioned. History wise, read an encyclopedia for more accurate details."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"How could Kingsolver have ruined her book with such an obvious error? Nathan is a strident paper doll that flattens the whole story. Just as bad, the author has all the narrators using the same ironic tone to decribe him, deadening their voices as well. At the same time, Kingsolver doesn't have the guts to show him doing something trully terrible. I don't trust an author who can't let the reader make up his own mind, and as a consequence I couldn't trust her views about ANYTHING in the story. I'm giving this two stars for her descriptions of the African landscape, and that is all."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The phrase ''heart of darkness'' occurs only once, as far as I can tell, in Barbara Kingsolver's haunting new novel, ''The Poisonwood Bible.'' When it does, it falls from the mouth of Orleanna Price, a Baptist missionary's wife who uses it to describe not the Belgian Congo, where she, her husband and their four daughters were posted in 1959, but the state of her marriage in those days and the condition of what she calls ''the country once known as Orleanna Wharton,'' wholly occupied back then by Nathan Price, aforesaid husband and man of God.Joseph Conrad's great novella flickers behind her use of that phrase, and yet it doesn't. Orleanna is not a quoting woman, and for the quoting man in the family, her strident husband, there can be only one source -- the Bible, unambiguous and entire, even in a land that demonstrates daily the suppleness of language. ''Tata Jesus is bangala!''he shouts during his African sermons. It never occurs to him that in Kikongo, a language in which meaning hangs on intonation, bangala may mean '''precious and dear,'' but it also means the poisonwood tree -- a virulent local plant -- when spoken in the flat accent of an American zealot.The Prices are Nathan and Orleanna and their daughters: Ruth May, the youngest; Rachel, the oldest, a pale blond Mrs. Malaprop of a teen-ager; and the twins, Leah and Adah. Both twins are gifted, but Adah suffers from hemiplegia, which leaves her limping and nearly speechless. The female members of the family narrate ''The Poisonwood Bible'' in turn. Orleanna does so in retrospect, from her later years on Sanderling Island, off the coast of Georgia. The girls, however, tell their story from the Congo as it happens, on the precipice of events, like an epistolary novel written from a place with no postal service and no hope of pen pals.Nathan Price narrates nothing. And yet his certitude -- and the literal-minded ferocity with which he expresses it -- is the altar around which these women arrange themselves. We already know his story, Kingsolver implies. Most of what we have always heard, she suggests, are stories told by men like him. ''The Poisonwood Bible'' thus belongs to the women, and it is a story about the loss of one faith and the discovery of another, for each woman according to her kind. As Adah, so bright, so willing to torque the mother tongue, puts it, ''One god draws in the breath of life and rises; another god expires.''The Congo permeates ''The Poisonwood Bible,'' and yet this is a novel that is just as much about America, a portrait, in absentia, of the nation that sent the Prices to save the souls of a people for whom it felt only contempt, people who already, in the words of a more experienced missionary, ''have a world of God's grace in their lives, along with a dose of hardship that can kill a person entirely.'' The Congolese are not savages who need saving, the Price women find, and there is nothing passive in their tolerance of missionaries. They take the Americans' message literally -- elections are good, Jesus too -- and expose its contradictions by holding an election in church to decide whether or not Jesus shall be the personal god of Kilanga. Jesus loses.And yet, for all its portraiture of place, its reflexive political vitriol, its passionate condemnation of Nathan Price, ''The Poisonwood Bible'' is ultimately a novel of character, a narrative shaped by keen-eyed women contemplating themselves and one another and a village whose familiarity it takes a tragedy to discover. Rachel is the epitome of America's material culture, a cunning, brainless girl who parodies television commercials and says of Eeben Axelroot, ''I'm willing to be a philanderist for peace, but a lady can only go so far where perspiration odor is concerned.'' Ruth May, the baby, is the innocent whose words betray the guilty; she is the catalyst that splits the Price family apart. ''The Poisonwood Bible'' turns on several axes, and one of them is Leah's struggle to rebalance herself morally when she finally realizes exactly who her father is. Once she had said, ''My father wears his faith like the bronze breastplate of God's foot soldiers, while our mother's is more like a good cloth coat with a secondhand fit.'' But when the armor fell, she saw that Nathan Price's ''blue eyes with their left-sided squint, weakened by the war, had a vacant look. His large reddish ears repelled me. My father was a simple, ugly man.''All the Prices adapt to the Congo, in their way, but Adah and Leah are carried farthest in their adaptation. Rachel accomplishes this by not adapting at all. ''The way I see Africa,'' she says, ''you don't have to like it but you sure have to admit it's out there. You have your way of thinking and it has its, and never the train ye shall meet!'' For Adah, adaptation comes in the form of unforgiving self-discovery, the realization that ''even the crooked girl believed her own life was precious.''"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"While reading, &quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot; I became even more aware of the faults and prejudices of Man. America's influence on the world in the 1950's and the result that took place in the Congo was mind-boggling. As a 17-year old High School student i recommend this book for all ages."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The author of the magnificent books, 'The Bean Trees', and 'Pigs in Heaven', leaves her protagonists Turtle and her mother in the Southwest and puts us in Africa, the Congo, Kilanga, in 1959. This stunning book is the tale of the family (of girls) of a Baptist preacher who moves them to a Congolese village to convert the heathens. The story is told through the voices of the girls: Rachel, Leah, Ruth May, Adah, Rebecca, and their mother, Orleanna Price. Their father's ignorance and somewhat violent tendencies, the sheer poverty and simpleness of the village, and the vast differences in their lives for these girls from Georgia are expressed by all of them. Their personalities, their strengths, their needs and their confusion are evident by their every word and their complex thoughts. Kingsolver, who is a brilliant writer anyway, brings a fascinating perspective to her imaginary family in the Poisonwood Bible - as she, the daughter of public health care workers who spent time in the Congo when she was very young, &quot;waited thirty years for the wisdom and maturity to write this book.&quot; A powerful story, an excellent read."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"What a read! Years ago I went to a Fundamental-Independent Baptist Church and one of the hot items was being a missionary or doing mission work. It was treated as giving out candy in the name of doing the Lord's work. I believe in missionary related work but I think there are many, many Christians going out to lands unknown like the Father in Poisionwood. This read was so interesting and humbling to realize what we really need and what we don't. Great book to read right before the 'I want this' season. I hate the materialistic nature of our country. We are going to spend ourselves out of existance - money and greed are our 'green mambas.'"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I don't normally write Amazon.com reviews, but I was shocked by the praise heaped upon this book and had to comment. I found it an utter disappointment. I have read much of the acclaimed literature to come out in the last few years - The Corrections, Empire Falls, The Human Stain - and these books leave Poisonwood Bible in the dust. I am part of a book club that is a diverse group of people and NONE of them found this a satisfying read.I should say, first, that I was initially quite fascinated by the book. I think Barbara Kingsoliver has a beautiful writing style and the premise was interesting and had much potential. The first half of the book I enjoyed. Ms. Kingsoliver should have stopped while she was ahead. I found the rest of the book self-righteous, unrealistic (not in a suspension of disbelief kind of way - I have no problem with imagination - but in a way that I found the characters acted in ways that were contrary to their character) and boring. I had to force myself to finish it. ..."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book was such a well written story, I made my husband read it after I finished. It is still up there on my list of favorites. Afterwards I sought other books by Barbara Kingslover and picked up The Prodigal Summer which took me a while to get into and was written differently, but also became a favorite. Kingsolver has a way of making me want to go to the places that she writes about so I can see it for myself. I feel what she writes very strongly."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Kingsolver in my view is one of the most thoughtful and daring of modern writers.This feisty opus from her is set against one of the most dramatic political chronicles of recent times: Congo's fight for freedom from Belgium, the gruesome murder of its first prime minister, the CIA coup to install his replacement, and the sordid progress of a world economic order that robs the fledgling African nation of its autonomy.Sound familiar?That engaging backdrop alone is reason enough for me to recommend this treat of a read. The narrator's first person voice is fascinating and indelibly colored by her own losses and unanswerable questions. Also narrating the story, by turns, are her four sharply observant daughters, each of whom must strike her own separate path to salvation, a path paved with moral risk and personal responsibility.For its audacity in setting up a fascinating literary scaffolding (with the intertwined narratives) or for its politically charged backdrop, or for the sheer worldly wisdom packed within its many pages, The Poisonwood Bible offers twin pleasures of being a dark comedy of human failings as well as the breathtaking possibilities of human hope.I couldn't recommend this book highly enough."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This was an excellent book. As someone who has lived in third world countries, I felt it did a fairly good job describing life under such circumstances."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I read The Bean Trees in high school and, though I enjoyed it, I found it forgettable. When I read Animal Dreams, I was struck by the poetry and wonder with which Barbara Kingsolver writes America. She brings a child-like hope to the adult reality of her story, which impressed upon me an optimism which is atypical on a big-city college campus.The Poisonwood Bible is, in my opinion, Kingsolver's masterpiece. Everything that I loved about Animal Dreams reaches its heart-shaking zenith within these pages. It reads like a dream, capturing my imagination and my breath every time I pick it up. Though it is set in Africa, it is a vivid portrait of the American family. Part of her gift is her ability to transform the typical (characters like an overbearing father, a vapid teenager, a mother struggling to control her inner strength) and make it magical, moving, and profound. This novel was a joy to read. I've recommeded it a dozen times, partly out of the self-centered desire to discuss it with others. You won't regret time spent ingesting this book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"It was a truly different reading experience. Learning about history of the African Congo from 1959 through to the 80's through 5 distinctly different perspectives. I could feel all of them pulling from my emotions, as a mother, as an angry tomboy, as a spoiled brat, an abstract intellectual, and as a innocent child. It was challenging to read and I find myself comparing it's content to current day events and viewing everything differently. It's a masterpiece of work from my perspective."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible was really well written. I liked how the book was written by each member of the family, as if it were a diary, and how they viewed the situations that were going on. This book deals a lot with family problems, death, religion, and political dilemma. The book portrays, the hardships of the Southern Baptists in The Belgian Congo, and Barbara Kingsolver sets up an image for you. For most parts I liked the book, &quot;but&quot; there are parts in the book that are very hard to read for the fact that it goes by rather slow. There are also good parts to this book, and you read through it very quickly because it is so captivating. I would definitely recommend this book, but watch out because it is rather long, 649 pages long."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I know I'm probably the last person in the world to read this book, but until recently it hasn't interested me enough to pick it up. I think my aversion was due to it being an Oprah pick. I read a long with some of the books in the beginning, but they were all so depressingly sad that I had to stop.I dived through most of Poisonwood in one day and I'm pleased to say that I liked it more then I thought I would. The characters are interesting, and I love how Kingsolver tells the story in each family member's distinctively different voice. Seeing the characters through each others eyes made me realize how off our thinking can be about one another. One small act can make you think a parent doesn't like you, when all actuality they could be trying to protect you.Now with this book under my belt I think I can tackle some of the other Oprah picks still sitting on my shelf."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I thought the book had a thick plot, not too complicated but it kept you reading, many things happened, that kept you reading yet the idea of it all taking place in one area, dragged on and sometimes got boring.I thought the characters, were great, I hated most of them but later I realized that it wasn't the particular character that i hated but that the charcter was meant to be that way to draw me closer to the book. After getting through the book I realy got a feel for each character and could feel like I knew this person.I felt the themes of this book were its best part, I will definitely say that the book drags on and can relly annoy you at times, but you'll keep reading and the variety of themes, such as religion, politics, death are what make the characters interesting and keep you into the book. The best part is how the charaters react to the situations, and different themes that are put in from of them.Its a pretty good book!Peace on earth and much love dudes, party hard!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible is, overall, a very good read. There are few points at which one truly wishes it would end, and the writing is always perfectly decent and at times quite beautiful. The chapters the crippled Adah narrates are especially fun to read. They make you look at language in a way not often explored outside books specifically about wordplay and other such linguistic frivolities. They are also at times very poignant and insightful, though usually not in ways that are particularly earth-shattering: she gets the point across, and does it in an often hilariously cynical way, but if she didn't connect the dots for you it wouldn't exactly be that hard to come to the same conclusion. These chapters make up a bit more than a fifth of the book. The rest of it is written in turn by each of her three sisters, and occasionally her mother takes a stab at narration. The book follows the Price family from 1950s America to the Congo and then, in the weakest part of the 600-plus-page novel, each female member as they go their separate ways. There are several flaws in these last 150 pages or so, after the mother leads them out from the wrathful (mis)guidance of Nathan, the fanatical missionary man of the family. First and foremost among them are a few ridiculously meaningless coincidences and pseudo-surreal passages. A woman they don't know in a market randomly gives the mother an object of sentimental value to her but which would be purely ornamental to anyone else. A dead girl's dream of becoming a snake is realized in a nicely written but really rather hypocritical way. Another problem is a long passage of not-that-great writing which takes the long way round showing something that could easily have been demonstrated with a paragraph or two, or even just thought on paper by the concerned party. There are some very contrived but still funny mispronunciations, and a few other little things that in retrospect needn't really be there. Overall, though, it was really quite enjoyable, at times informative, and occasionally deep. Not truly great literature, but definitely worth the time."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book sent me on a journey for knowledge because it made me realize how little I know about my government and the evils it has perpetrated overseas. I just finished reading \\"King Leopold's Ghost\\" by Adam Hochfeld, which is the nonfiction account of King Leopold II of Belgium who was the original rapist of the Congo. It was his greed that set in motion the events in \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\" almost 100 years later. Those who have accused Kingsolver of being too political should \\"King Leopold's Ghost\\" because everything she says is true. I was shocked to find that so many Congolese people had died since its discovery and very few people know about it (10 million, Hochfeld estimates.) Leah's story and her embracing of the Congo motivated me to learn more and broaden my knowledge about the history of the Congo as well as other places in the world where the US government has meddled (guess I could just read the newspaper). An author can't ask more of her work than to do so and Kingsolver has succeeded admirably. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This was extraordinary work from Ms. Kingsolver."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"As a long-time Barbara Kingsolver fan, I looked forward to this new release.

I must be on a totally different page than the people who raved about this book. The premise was good, but the novel just didn't work for me. Having heard the reviews of this book on Public Radio, I really looked forwrad to it, but as far as I am concerned, it was a total disappointment."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book does have an interesting story line and parts of it show signs of promise, but surely the people of the Congo, their leaders in the 50s & 60s and the missionaries who gave their lives there deserve a better interpretation than this. The story is about a missionary family (five daughters and their parents) who go to the Congo in the late 50s/early 60s. Each of the daughters and the mother have a voice in this story. One by one they narrate a chapter. The father has no voice in the story; he never tells his side of things as the others do. The daughters and the mother each take take turns denigrating the father. He is an over zealous baptist missionary, who preaches from the apocrypha (incredibly unlikely). The families story is so twisted and unbelievable, that the credibility of the rest of the book is also doubtful. As in any tall tale, there are bits of truth. It raises a lot of questions as to what really happened between the political leaders of the Congo and Belgium and the USA, but again a rather one sided simplistic description leaves one asking what really happened."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Good story. I did enjoy it, but not enough for 5 stars. I hope my ant problem does not get as bad as hers (read the book).Oprah book club, female author, mom raising daughters, bad/insane dad... I felt this book was stacked against my gender. I still liked it, but it felt a little feminist.A better book, and non-fiction, about growing up female in Africa is Beryl Markham's West with the Night."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I found The Poisonwood Bible to be an enjoyable, though dark and intense novel. Its portrayal of the Congolese culture was quite interesting. However, factual inaccuracies in the political history of the Congo and the nature of Baptist missionary work in Africa detracted from the overall experience. Although the book is a work of fiction, it is presented in a historical context, and the author should have maintained contextual accuracy."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I bought this book as part of a &quot;book study&quot; group at my church. It was not my idea, but I went along. And since I paid an astronnomical price for it, my Depression mentality required that I read it anyway. What a mistake.My background has colored and biased my views towards the book, the author and each of the principal characters, Especially Nathan Price. I have cousins and Baptists at that, who went off as missionaries to darkest Indonesia during this same time frame, late 1950's and were they ever a bunch of screw-ups like Nathan.Of all the &quot;off-brand&quot; religious dimwittery to foist off on people, the SOuthern Baptist brand has got to be the antithesis of that which is good about the United States, then or now. The damage these people did to the host peoples and to the United States is probably incalculable. But what is done, is done. We may hope to make amends either here or in the next existence, but amends must be made.I was born and reared in the Deep South and have the requisite Confederate ancestors and accent. I must say that this is a terrible book. It exposes too much truth. I am reminded of William Faulkner for he always &quot;talked out of school&quot; in much the same way that Kingsolver does in the &quot;Poisonwood Bible&quot;. The title is certainly appropriate.Read this work, if you must, but do not say I did not warn you."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"All set for a great book, I was very disappointed with The Poisonwood Bible. It was full of predictable characters and a long drawn out storyline. The only interesting aspect was the historical value. Borrow it at the library before you spend a dime on this book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I heard such great reviews concerning this book that I was rather disappointed when I finally got through it. I found it to be slow moving, dry and too long. The book really did not leave me with anything."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This story absolutely filled me with emotions! At 543 pages or so long, I never wanted to put it down, I took it everywhere with me, I made mes amis read some of the especially good parts, and I want you to read it too!! You Will LOVE It!! :):)"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I was glued to this book *both* times that I read it. It was absolutely fantastic. I'm sure that I'll read it a third time."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book hooked me in and kept me focused throughout the 543 pages. I cheered for the mother and daughters and cursed the father. I wept for the loss of Ruth May. If this book has one flaw, it becomes confusing with the wide range of years toward the end. I found myself having to turn back to see how many years had past since the last narative. I deeply enjoyed this book, and am almost sadden by coming to the end. I will recommend this to all my friends."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I found Poisonwood to be somewhat of a let-down. While Kingsolver's prose is ebulliant and her characterization unfailing, the story disintegrates three quarters of the way through the novel. The Price family's hellish adventures in Africa are narrated alternately by the four sisters and their mother. The first three quarters of the book span approximately two years' time and the narratives of different Price women overlap and contrast to great effect. Kingsolver then unsuccessfully gambled in switching her style, dispersing the narrators' accounts throughout the next thirty years. These diluted remains of the younger Price girls deliver essentially 140 pages of epilogue. In short, the book dies with Ruth May."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver explores many issues in this wonderful novel. Though some might take issue with the various threads, I wallowed in the intricate structure (5 viewpoints) and the detailed backgroud given to the setting. The political involvement of the U.S. is sure to be a hot button with some readers, but the research rings true--It really opened my eyes to &quot;contemporary&quot; political objectives. Though the characters are sacrificed somewhat to the theme as the book progresses, it remains engrossing to the end."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I read this book at the beginning of the summer (I had been looking forward to it for a year or so, but hadn't had time to read it during my first year of High School). I expected the Poisonwood Bible to be a tale of the downfall of a family as they brave the dangers of Africa. And, happily, the beginning was written in the poetic (but realistic) voice of To Kill a Mockingbird. It seemed, however, that the author got tired of writing after a while and either subconsciously or consciously began to write sloppily, as if she only wanted to finish the book. She wrote too little that had anything to do with the actual plot (I began to forget what it was, anyway), and too much about the &quot;plight of the Congolese&quot;.That would be a great topic for a book, but it really didn't seem to fit in with the first part. This book just kept going and going, when I believe it would have suited the theme of the book more to finish it about half to three-quarters of the way through."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Wonderful coming-of-age tale of 3 missionary children set in Africa. At times, Kingsolver loses her characters as she becomes too pedantic and &quot;politically correct.&quot; She skims the surface of the dark side of Africa, but exposes every blemish of the missionaries and whites. The novel was very satisfying and easy to read, but not as workthwhile as her other ones."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Yes, I agree that The Poisonwood Bible is a much richer read than Kingsolver's previous works. However, when one utilizes the first person narrative form, one should aim for realistic and age appropriate narration. Pre-adolescent children do not tell their stories out of their frame of reference and gender. In short, the daughters' tales were unreliable due to the maturity and vocabulary bestowed upon them. I think it would be very interesting if Kingsolver attempted the third person narrative. She is a wonderful writer, although the constant self-importance of her political line tends to grate after 200 or so pages. There are many politics, many cultures, many people, many points of view. It would be interesting if other ideas and ideals were allowed to crop up in her work."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I have read all of Kingsolver's other novels and enjoyed them, but I was not prepared for the sheer brillaince of Poisonwood Bible. I thoroughly enjoyed the story and her writing is for lack of a better word, brilliant, and on so many levels. The book is narrated by five distinct voices, not unlike the Bible, and when you put them together, you realize you still don't have the whole truth on what happened. One of Kingsolver's messages is that story telling is difficult, words are difficult, and that even actual experience will not allow you to know all that is happening around you. It is the writer's dilemna in novel form. So much is happening in Poisonwood, in so many ways. It's a novel about sisters, about families, about Africa, about religion, about truth, about stories and ultimately, about love."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver introduces us to the Congo, teaches us language which the family must learn to exist there. This missionary family, who has no concept of what they are about to encounter, goes from being powerless to powerful. We experience disintegration, heartbreak, rebuilding. Never can they or we be the same again."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is a book that suffers from the journalist's predicament, flat emotions in emotional situations. There seem to be a couple of reasons why that is so. One of them is the question, what is Barbara Kingsolver attempting to do in this novel? Is she telling a missionary story? Is she telling the story of the CIA's involvement in the overthrow of the newly independent Congo? Or what? It is hard to answer this question. Secondly, her method seemed appealing at first, telling the story of a family unprepared for mission work yet driven by an unsympathetic father, Nathan Price, to the Congo in 1959 when the Congo is being exploited by Belgium, telling that story from the perspective of his four daughters. Each of them has her own peculiar take on their situation; yet each increasing comes to seem disembodied, floating above the people and emotions and reality of their own lives."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"If you don't like to study history or politics but wish you were more conversant in both, this is a good read. This is one of those excellent fictions that leave you wanting to know more. After reading this story set in Africa, I found myself picking up Time magazine and the Kansas City Star and devouring any information available on African policitics."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"A fantastic book. You won't be dissapointed."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The real mystery about this book is how it ever got published in this day and age, much less make it on Oprah!?!-I have suspicions that some cheering Ms. Kingsolver on haven't read much of her writing.-It's too good to be so popular! The last American novel this poetic and difficult for those not attuned to the music of words that made it big and, in fact, bears a certain resemblence to Ms. Kingsolver's work is The Sound and The Fury, by none other than Willy Faulkner. There are echoes of other works as well. One reviewer has already mentioned The Mosquito Coast by Theroux. There's also the short story &quot;Rain&quot; by W.S. Maugham. Even though Kingsolver has her characters actually mention The Heart of Darkness in the book, the themes are so different that I don't think there's much of a comparison between the works. Conrad's work is focussed so exclusively on Man, Kurtz or Marlowe, while Kingsolver takes in everything under the sun and moon and stars.-But let me return, how can any book that has quotes like this from the deformed genius Adah (much resembling the clairvoyant Benji in The Sound and The Fury) be so popular!?! &quot;Presentiment-is that long Shadow-on the Lawn- Indicative that Suns go down- The Notice to the startled Grass That Darkness-is about to pass- Pity the poor dumb startled grass, I do. Ssap ot tuoba. I am fond of Miss Emily Dickinson: No snikcidy lime, a contrary name with a sourgreen taste. Reading her secrets and poite small cruelties of her heart, I believe she enjoyed taking the dumb grass by surprise in her poem...she makes small scratching sounds with her pen, covering with nightfall all creatures that really should know what to expect by now, but don't...&quot; The book is chock-full of philosophical and poetic reflections of this sort. But I don't see people rushing out to buy new copies of Miss Dickinson's poetry, or books of palindromes for that matter!----Oh, Never mind how such a delightful book gained popularity and publication....Let us be thankful!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This wonderful story touched my heart in so many ways...as a southerner, as a baptist, as a woman, as a sister..as a human.

I put this on my Top 5 Favorites of ALL time!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I haven't finished yet and already I am really enjoying this book. Kingsolver has given the characters 4 distinct voices that keep you involved and interested in the story. I would pass this along to my friends and family members."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I was captivated by the book at first, but the last third should have been cut. Kingsolver hurts the story by descending into a politically correct preachiness that doesn't suit her characters. In addition, the turns that the plot takes toward the end don't ring true. (I did not, for example, for a moment believe that the mother, after gathering the strength to make her big move in the story, would let her family fall apart so easily.)But this is the same rut Kingsolver has been in since she started publishing novels. She's quite good at devising imaginative situations and creating interesting characters, but her endings are always weak. She doesn't trust her characters; the people that seem so real and warm at the beginning of her novels become at the end little more than propaganda-spouting robots for Kingsolver's social views. I was sad to see that this book falls into that tired rut. I doubt that I'll read any of her future books because I'm sick of her pontificating. Truly gifted novelists are subtle; Kingsolver is just shrill."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Yes, it's slow.I thought I'd finish this book in 5-6 days, like I have many other books of this length. But, to my surprise, it has taken me over 2 months. Ironically, I've added it to my list of &quot;All-time-favorites.&quot; BUY THIS BOOK. IT WILL TAKE A WHILE TO READ, BUT, FINISH IT.IT WILL DEFINITELY BE WORTH IT."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I enjoyed this book. Very different from her earlier books, &quot;The Bean Trees&quot; and &quot;Pigs in Heavan&quot;. The book is told from the point of view of the girls and their mother, and begins slow, but it picks up and is interesting to follow the girls as they live their lives. I was not sure I would finish it but am sure glad I did. Some sad parts."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is a riveting, intellectual book that reaches out on several levels. It was impossible to put down!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The merit of this book is that while reading it, you realize the many things in your life that you take for granted. It's the THINGS that the family didn't take, the THINGS they wish they had, and the THINGS they lose that becomes engrossing.When you read about Ruth and her mother laying her on the table, if you are a woman, you will be moved to tears at how this mother, so far removed from everything she felt comfortable with prepares Ruth's body for viewing. I felt so much compassion for her but at the same time I was so angry with her for staying there so long with her girls. Why did she stay so long?When she left her husband I was both glad and sad.When I finished reading the book, I knew that I would do something I very rarely do-read a book over again."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Let me start by saying that I found The Poisonwood Bible an excellent book. Kingsolver wrote using the voices of five very different female narrators, all plunged into the Belgian Congo, because Nathan Price, and evangelical Baptist, takes his wife and four daughters during a time of war and confusion for the country. Kingsolver does not give Nathan a voice in the book. The voices the reader hears are those of his wife Orleanna, and their four daughters: Rachel, Leah, Adah, and Ruth May. The book takes you through their journey together as a family and also through their own lives as they figure out who they are and what they want.The book was hard to put down, as with every page something new happens to one of the narrators. Using different voices to tell the story makes it extra rich in detail. Take for example Ruth May, she is the youngest Price, about six to eight. She has a slightly comical approach to bad happenings. \\"My name is Ruth May and I hate the Devil. For the longest time I thought my name was Sugar...\\" By using simple sentences, Kingsolver lets the reader see how Ruth May's mind is thinking of several thoughts at once, and Ruth May just says whatever comes first.The children of the Price family talk more than their mother, who tells her story later on back home in the United States. As she remembers bits and pieces, you get the feeling that her life in the Congo was probably the hardest of all the narrators' lives. \\"Strange to say, when it [leaving Nathan in the Congo] came I felt as if I'd been waiting for it my whole married life. Waiting for that ax to fall so I could walk away with no forgiveness in my heart.\\" You can hear and feel the hurt in her voice as she tells her story. It is incredible the way Kingsolver uses different voices to get inside the reader so we can feel what the narrator feels and see what she sees.I noticed that other reviewers saw the book as Kingsolver's way to get her views of politics across, and I would have to disagree. I saw the politics side of the story as necessary to complete the story and impossible not to mention. The Independence of the Congo from Belgian rule and the way it played out had an affect on each narrator and needed to be in the book, because the story took place during this war between differences. For example Leah, one of the twins and the second oldest of the Price family, took the war as confusion. Being the one daughter who practically worshipped her father, she did not seem to understand how the war affected her family and especially her beloved father. As time goes on though, Leah begins to see that her father is not what he seems, and that he is not going to give up his demented view that he can change the villagers into Christians.The book goes on in wonderful detail in each narrator's voice to finish out the story and to tell some of the after-story. Although I can say that the book does leave you hanging, I find that interesting. Kingsolver leaves the reader on the edge throughout the whole book, and then you get to the end, and you're still on the edge; you never see the other side or what is below that edge. I felt that the book was horrifying yet powerful and incredibly hard to put down. I could see however where one might get lost through the maze of stories and the imagination of each narrator, but that maze and those imaginations are what kept the book going for me. The Poisonwood Bible is a Sunday read, although it is a little long; you will enjoy it and be glad you took time to read it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"A toughtful,moving epic that drags you down into the heart and wonder of life in Congo. Sent to Africa on a spiritual mission to bring Christianity to the Congolese this family finds a life where people see life as somthing totally different then we do, giving worth to those who most Americans would discard as unworthy of a normal life. In Congo Orleanna Price, her husband ,Nathan Price, and there four children learn about true spiritual love and acceptance and how to actually do a good days work(some take the lesson better then others). And so the \\"Bible\\" tells of what they lost in the Congo, what they gained, and what will always haunt them about what they did there. This masterfully written book still manages to have a certain degree of humor while teaching life lessons. I am not a grat follower of the Christian religion and therefor cannot totally relate with what it might be like to realize that your religion wouldn't help Congolese one bit, as the Price family learns in this novel, but I can still say with utmost truthfullness...that this book is one of the best I have ever read(I have read quite a few)and you will definately be missing out if you do not read it...YOU WILL CRY WHEN READING THIS BOOK"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I thought this was an absolutely brilliant book, and it touched me on many different levels. In the first place it touched me as a reader. I loved Ms Kingsolver's style. I think she is a brilliantly, creative, intelligent and witty author. I was amazed at how believable she managed to narrate the story from so many perspectives.Secondly the novel spoke to me as a mother. I enjoyed the little parental truths that she slipped into the novel like&quot;It was brief, I can promise that much, for although it's been many years now since my children ruled my life, am mother recalls the measure of the silences.&quot; [p 7]and&quot;But the last one: the baby who trails her scent like a flag of surrender though your life when there will be no more coming after - oh, that's love by a different name. She is the babe you hold in your arms for an hour after she's gone to sleep. If you put her down in the crib, she might wake up changed and fly away. So instead you rock by the window, drinking the light from her skin, breathing her exhaled dreams. Your heart bays to the double crescent moons of closed lashes on her new cheeks. She's the one you can't put down. &quot;[p 434]The book touched me as a sister. I loved discovering the relationships from the different perspectives and I enjoyed to see how different they all experienced the same life. I thought the character development was executed brilliantly. Of all four daughters Leah seemed to have changed most. In some ways I was surprised with where she ended.Lastly it spoke to me as an African. I found her views on Africa fascinating and enlightening.&quot;I look at my four boys, who are the colours of silt, loam, dust, and clay, an infinite palette for children of their own, and I understand that time erases whiteness altogether&quot; [p 595]&quot;He meant to save every child, thinking Africa would then learn how to have fewer children. But when families have spent a million years making nine in the hope of saving one, they cannot stop making nine.&quot; [p597]&quot;I thought you said the Congolese don't believe in keeping the riches to themselves,&quot; I told Anatole once, inclined towards an argument.But he just laughed. &quot;Who, Mobutu? He is not even African now.&quot; [p515]Anatole continues to explain how the Congo had more riches than what were good for her.This is a common trend in Africa. The rulers of the country living in extreme wealth, while the rest of the country are starving. But even though the poor have nothing, they will look after each other.I have to wonder, does wealth grow greed. It certainly seems that way in Africa."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I have heard it said that this is Barbara Kingsolver's most ambitious work, and without a doubt, it is true.

Being the child of a missionary family whose father dragged her mother and siblings to the 'mission field', with his religious zeal, I felt many times I was in the place of the daughter narrating the story at the moment. From trying to bring Jesus and Christianity into the life of the 'heathen' without giving a second thought to the ways and traditions the people already lived by, the arrogant assumption that Christianity was far superior to what they had and we are there to save them, to the slow realization that perhaps your previous beliefs simply are not the right ones for this place and peoples, and the slow transformation to an abandonment of your childhood religion and belief system to adopting that of those around you who seem to live their lives without the hypocrisy you see in your parents or other religious leaders."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver's The Poinsonwood Bible is one of the best books I've read recently. Told from the point of view of five different women, this book has so much to offer. The author has such a unique style I almost felt as if I knew these girls when I was done reading. This book has everything from a revoultion, to a love story. You won't be able to put it down!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I almost gave up on this book a few times. I didn't like some of the characters or the way they narrated their chapters, but by the end of the book, I felt I had learned not only some very interesting history, but also how to look at Africa from different points of view. I read it last summer on a trip to Africa and still think about it often. Yes, the author's viewpoints don't always jive with popular beliefs, but that is what I think she was trying to do -- open our minds to the way others see the world and maybe try to understand why the Congo and its people think the way they do"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book is so much more than some dumb women's feel-good bookclub garbage. From a purely literary standpoint, Poisonwood Bible is an exquisitely sculpted masterpiece. Each chapter is from a different person's point of view, and each one is written flawlessly--when the characters speak, they use their own dialect, vocabulary, and euphemisms, along with their own greatly differing points of view on what is happening to them; enough so that the chapter titles which tell you the character's name are almost irrelevant.I have never read a book with such completely and fully developed characters. Each daughter and their mother is complete, distinct unto themselves. They are fully human, making mistakes and even being unlikable at frequent intervals, yet since you are seing their failures through their own eyes, you cannot help but love them for it and become intimately invested in them and their story.Let me also add that anyone who loves puzzles will be delighted by Adah's chapters. The backwards poems are worth the price of the book in and of themselves!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I was also required to read this novel in school and I think it is the most powerful book I have ever read. I am definitely going to read more of Kingsolver's works. This is, without question, a novel I will continue to cherish for many, many years. I recommend this to anyone and everyone. Don't rob yourself of such a wonderful story!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I remember when Poisonwood got powerful reviews and I didn't think I was sophisicated enough to read such a book. I was a novice reader and skimming through the first few pages scared the wits out of me. Years later, I finally read the book and it is indeed a highly mature novel. Most books take a few chapters before I am entyced, but Poisonwood took well over half the book! While I usually get into countless hours of reading and can often finish a book in a few days, I found myself putting the book aside after each chapter and not quite excited enough to keep the dust off the cover. But if you bought this book and find yourself in a similar feeling, do keep reading because it somehow does a complete turn.It is the story of a Baptist minister and his family's missionary voyage to a Congo village - being told by five narrators: his wife and fours daughters. Each narrator takes such different views and tones that although Kingsolver provides an introduction each time, it is entirely unneccessary. Through their story telling, they each take on such strong individual characteristics that you wonder if Kingsolver went through a multi-personality phase while writing this book. Even as decades and life changing events pass, you follow the evolution of each family member but can still identify their everlasting roots. From the comical innocence of Ruth May, to the deep dark twisted sarcasm of Adah, with a balance of simple self indulged wits of Rachel and the complex truth seeking Leah - it is only right to top off with a powerful Southern mother who relies on her instinct and maternal will to survive the Congo in spite of her obsessed and imminent insanity of her minister husband. This balance is much needed as some characters are so intense while others lack the oomph to last an entire novel.This book will have you question its factual possibilities and can easily be mistaken as a memoir or collection of confessions. It will make you want to learn more about the Congo and its pre-indendepent natives. You will feel a whirl of emotions - anger, guilt, fear, hope - to finally, contentment.1 out of every 10 paragraphs are pointless and boring, but the other 9 are so capturing that you resolve Kingsolver's intent is a delicate balance."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Illustrates how mean people can be to one another.

The novel kept my attention so well that I finished it in three days, but left me with a feeling of sadness and frustration. Perhaps that was Kingsolver's intention, for this was a sad period in the history of so many places in Africa...Chrissy K. McVayauthor of 'Souls of the North Wind'"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is one of my all-time favourite books. I first read it a few years ago, and have never gotten the villages of the Congo out of my mind. I think about the bounty to which I am so privileged every time I walk into a grocery store. I often think of the villagers' lack of transportation when we complain about the price of gas for our luxury cars. I think about the missionaries who just wanted to do something good, and how they thought the solution for food would be as simple as planting seeds. The seeds grow into unruly gnarled plants which intensify the already dark jungle. Cattle...why don't they just get some cattle? Tsetse flies kill them! Instead of the missionaries from America teaching the villagers how to live, the villagers taught the missionaries how to survive. I've read other books and articles written by scholars on the politics of the Congo at that time, and it seems Mrs. Kingsolver has masterfully researched this aspect as well.This is a book that will be talked about half a century from now, and that would, I believe, make it a classic! If you have not read it, I cannot stress strongly enough how much you've missed."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is the first and only book I have read by Kingsolver and one of the first 'modern literature' books I have read in a couple of years. I was very impressed with with the power of this tragic novel.Each chapter is narrated by a different character in their own voice and that voice changes as the characters mature during the course of the book. I often think of this as a bit of a literary tool meant only to challenge the reader, but adding little to the overall impact of the novel. But in this case, Kingsolver does a masteful job of character development so that the reader cannot help but become invested in the characters.Add to this the very descriptive and fluid writing style, a strong plot, a setting in a country that most people will never visit and in a time that was pivotal to the political development of that country and one is forced to admit this is a very, very well written novel. A Modern Classic!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book has a lot going for it. It's smart. It's well written. And it makes you care.That being said...it's also really really long. I would have been perfectly content if the story had ended with the girls' escape from the congo, but then, I like to be able to imagine what happens to my favorite charectors, and barbera kingsolver didn't leave much room for imagination. Be sure you know what you're getting into when you start this book, 'cause it's really heavy too...very biblical, and very political. I don't agree that you have to be christian (or even well versed biblically) to enjoy this book. I'm not and had no trouble understanding the references or the not-so-subtle symbolism. I do think though, that is would have been helpfull if I had a more solid grounding in the history of africa. There's an awfull lot of politcal name dropping (admittedly there for a reason) that gets pretty confusing after a while. Still, get it used or at the library, because it's definatly worth at least one read. While the preacher Nathen inspires nothing but a nasty taste in the back of my mouth, Orleanna, his wife is wonderfull. You feel for her, especially after the explanation of how she came to be shacked up with a self-rightous, narrow minded, religious fanatic. It makes sense, and when she finally stands up for herself and her children you want to help her, heal her, and find her a nice man who she can grow old with. I know my mother would have done the same, fiercely protecting her children at all costs, I think most moms would...it adds a bit of touching humanism to a book that has a tendancy to get bogged down in it's own self importance."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The poisonwood Bible is an interesting novel by Barbara Kingsolver, born on April 8, 1955, in Annapolis, Maryland, which is set in the Congolese jungle in the 1950's and 60's. As the story goes, a Baptist preacher named Nathan Price travels to Africa on a mission to save Congolese souls, taking his wife and four kids with him, but things don't work out as well as Nathan planned.The story is told through the eyes of the four daughters (Ruth May, Adah, Leah and Rachel) and their mother (Orleanna), but mostly through the four daughters. Each daughter has her own fully developed personality and the level at which Barbara Kingsolver makes them unique and so seemingly humanly real is amazing, which proves that Kingsolver is skilled at writing stories such as these. The writing style is not only unique, but it's good too - it flows well.The storyline rarely gets boring, either. It can a bit, considering its length, but not often. All the events are wonderfully connected and seem to flow very well. All the messages and morals (and believe me, there are a good amount of them in this book) all come together and really mean something as far as the book goes.The book is mostly a serious one, being dramatic from time to time, but it has plenty of it's own humorous moments (and you'll find some of the characters make what's going on pretty much amusing most of the time they're there), and this balances out nicely in the book.Overall, the book is pretty well-written, and pretty interesting, if nothing else. I think everybody should at least check such a book out."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Congo is brutal and merciless. It will eat you alive-or destroy your family as it did to the Price family in The Poisonwood Bible. Nathan and Orleanna Price leave for the Belgian Congo in 1959 as Baptist missionaries-carrying their way of life on their backs. A remote village deep in the jungle became the Price family's new home, and is no place to raise a young family used to American culture.Barbara Kingsolver wrote the novel through the voice of the four young Price girls, who are trying to please their overbearing father and quiet mother. Kingsolver masterfully differentiates the four girls' voices and after initial confusion as to who the girls were, it worked well in the end. The task of authoring a novel from four distinct perspectives is a technical undertaking that Kingsolver delivered on a silver platter. She incorporated beautiful lyrical prose through the voice of her poet child, Adah, who can't communicate orally but remains a bona fide genius her entire life.The novel's main theme evolves from Orleanna. This docile but caring mother supported her husband through the daring decision to move to Africa-but couldn't stand up to the Mr. Darling-type familial dictator when the Belgian Congo became obviously too dangerous for the family. Orleanna needed to make sacrifices, stand up and protect her children while the window for survival still was open. After the revolution, the Price family had no chance. The four daughters escaped Africa through being carried, buried, ferried and married: desperate options for a desperate mother. The point that Kingsolver made is that parents, especially mothers must have the courage to do what is the best for the children, not for themselves. Selfishness breeds children's destruction; sacrifice springs enrichment. Orleanna and Nathan Price were primarily selfish characters. When Orleanna escaped Nathan and Africa, she didn't have the needs and lives of her children before her own well-being. When she started walking away from Kilanga, she didn't even gather her children behind her and take them along. She simply walked and her three surviving kids followed by their own desire. She made no real effort to help them escape Africa, and only one did. Her and Nathan's selfishness destroyed their family.Kingsolver's biases are evident in the plot and characters of The Poisonwood Bible. She wears her politics on her shirtsleeve, and it interferes with the progression of the novel. Because she turns Leah into her mouthpiece, she feels necessary to extend the book 150 pages past what it should have been so Leah could evidence all of the evils that the American government committed in the Congo. The reader must remember that Barbara is no historian, but a novelist-writing fiction, not fact. Although the stage of the Congolese revolution was perfect for the novel, it ultimately distracted the familial theme of providing an emotional nest of comfort for one's offspring.Nathan Price is much too one-dimensional. Kingsolver makes no effort to develop him any more than a ruthless, overbearing father who is planning and living his own penitence at the expense of his children. His motivations and his internal struggle, unlike Orleanna, are anything but transparent. On that note, it seems that any novel these days that involves Christian missionaries is also one-sided. Kingsolver makes too many expositions that Christian proselytizing is trivial in non-Christian cultures. As a two-year foreign Christian missionary in impoverished and impecunious locations, I thought that Kingsolver's personal anti-proselyte bias bled through the pages. If that was an intended theme of the book, she did it by telling only one side of the story by not developing Nathan."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I had heard so much about this book that I think that colored my reading of it. The reason I was so disappointed is because it became very tedious to finish reading it. Initially,I was intrigued and interested in reading about the Price family, but it became too laborious and wordy in the final 200 pages. If you want to read Kingsolver at her best, read the Bean Trees - very delightful and certainly not so long that interest is lost in the characters!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Writing a good book is like sewing a tailored suit. All of the pieces have to exactly fit together or the whole thing will fall apart. Barbara Kingsolver's The Poisonwood Bible is a perfect fit.Preacher Nathan Price takes his family into the jungles of the Belgian Congo in 1959 to bring Christianity to the Africans. Told through the eyes of his wife and daughters, the story becomes a complex web of events, which leads to the eventual redemption of the Price family, but not the father.Heading for the jungle, the Price family takes its version of life's necessities, like instant cakes and sewing shears. The Congo unravels the Price's perfect plan and family members have to reconstruct their lives around the rules of Kilanga, the village where they live.Kingsolver crafts a careful story and shifts easily from the narration of Orleanna Price to her daughters. Rachel is the oldest and is consumed more with herself than with any problem that might occur in her family or in the village. Next in line are her two twin sisters, Leah and Adah. Leah is the adventurous tomboy and Adah is a bookworm and near-mute who has been crippled since birth. The youngest daughter is Ruth May, and her preciously innocent acceptance of the Congo provides a dear point of view about the country.Especially funny is the take each of the Price woman has on her father. It is with a dark comic edge that the daughters recount the woes Nathan Price experiences trying to spread the Lord's word.First Price, who does not speak Kilanga's native tongue of Kikongo, tries to baptize the village's children in the river. Years before, an alligator ate a child in the river and the villagers are sure that Price plans to have their children eaten. Price pathetically attempts to learn the people's language, but pronounces the words wrong so that the meaning of everything he tries to say dramatically becomes altered. When Price tries to praise Jesus and says Jesus is the savior, he pronounces the Kikongo word incorrectly and says Jesus is poisonwood, a plant that grows in the Congo and causes itching. Naturally, the villagers don't feel too crazy about Price's Jesus.Kingsolver describes the Congo with such clarity that it becomes a living and breathing character of The Poisonwood Bible. The colors and the smells become integral parts of the story. She describes villagers with frankness and celebrates their differences from Americans without making their ways of life seem inferior.Also an integral part of The Poisonwood Bible is African politics during the '60s. Without overwhelming the story line, Kingsolver weaves the dramatic political turmoil of the Congo into the plot so that it is easily understood.As with finishing a suit, the end of a book can destroy a story. A careful hem can keep a fabric from coming undone, and stories need equally careful craftsmanship. Kingsolver adeptly avoids this problem by ending the story naturally and neatly tying up loose ends."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"As a parent of 3 distinctly different children, I found the voices of Rachel,Adah,Leah,and Ruth May captivating. I appreciated the attention to life's details that reminded me of childhood. This novel made me aware of my own ignorance of African political history and geography. Although a serious book about complicated topics, it had plenty of funny moments (cursing parrot, Bobbsey Twins in the snow envy, and big chief with glasses frames) I have enjoyed other Kingsolver novels more during the reading, but this one leaves a much deeper feeling of having been in another place, time and person."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible is at its best when the descriptive language brings Africa to life. The voices of Leah, Rachael, Adah, Ruth May and Orleanna are really the voices of Africa trying to survive the poverty, the weather extremes, the natural calamities,and the political,cultural,and religious turmoil that was the essence of the Congo in the Sixties. The imagery and detail that Kingsolver brings to this novel is amazing. Africa lives and becomes the real main character. Africa is the beautiful heroine who is at the core of this wonderful novel."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver's The Poisonwood Bible is the finest historical novel I have read. It is a masterpiece of fiction set against regrettable events that are called to our conscience by the power of the written word, and inevitable and intertwined life and death. It embraces passion, humanity, religion, nature, greed, pathos, and a liberal dose of reality. It is a \\"must\\" read for all those concerned about the relationship between human beings and nature, and among human beings. Two excerpts:\\"On the day of the hunt I came to know in the slick center of my bones this one thing: all animals kill to survive, and we are animals. The lion kills the baboon; the baboon kills fat grasshoppers. The elephant rears up living trees, dragging their precious roots from the dirt they love. The hungry antelope's shadow passes over the startled grass. And we, even if we had no meat or even grass to gnaw, still boil our water to kill the invisible creatures that would like to kill us first. And swallow quinine pills. The death of something living is the price of our own survival, and we pay it again and again. We have no choice. It is the one solemn promise every life on earth is born and bound to keep.\\" [Page 347]\\"Africa has a thousand ways of cleansing itself. Driver ants, Ebola virus, acquired immune deficiency syndrome: all these are brooms devised by nature to sweep a small clearing very well. Not one of them can cross a river by itself. And none can survive past the death of its host. A parasite of humans that extinguished us altogether, you see, would quickly be laid to rest in human graves.\\" [Page 529]The final five pages are sheer poetry, and must be read only after embracing the entire work."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"My friends kept telling me to read this book, and I finally did. In the beginning, the story was slow as each daughter took turns telling the story of living with their strict father and weak mother in the Congo. But that doesn't mean it isn't good. But once the family began to leave the Congo, boy, was I compelled!! I could NOT put down the book!! I'm a college student, and the book was on my mind during classes! I have never read anything like this - the Congo is described in great detail, as if it was told from an African living there. But no, a plain regular white woman wrote this! I actually felt like flying out there and seeing it for myself. It is also as if Kingsolver was actually there with the family as well! The title doesn't seem much but you know the famous quote: &quot;Never judge a book by its cover.&quot; This is the perfect book to go with that quote! IT IS A MUST-READ FOR EVERYONE!!!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"An enormous story that grabs you by the collar and won't leave you alone - regardless if you favor the politics of the author or know zip about missionaries or the Belgian Congo. Kingsolver offers 5 distinct female characters who build and drive this tale of spiritual and cultural purgatory. Unfortunately, the evangelical father (he drags the Georgia family to a primitive village mission) remains a bit of a mystery. Like the wind, you see his damage, but you don't entirely understand where he's coming from."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Kingsovler shows the world her exacting and provocative insight into developmental issues, both historical and contemporary. The issues that she raises and examines in this beautiful work of fiction are so closely tied to actual events and issues that one may mistakenly assume the work to be non-fiction. Without disagreeing with or supporting her portrayal of the Christian faith, I will say that she uses scripture and common missionary reasoning and 'arrogance (for lack of a better word)to show some of the reasons why the development agenda in Africa through the last half of the twentieth century has only marginalized the continent more so. Her use of four characters (all of them sisters, and occasionally the mother) to tell the story of their family's venture from Georgia to the Congo and their lives afterwards gives the reader an excellent insight into their situation. The book is an easy read and an insightful and provocative one to those who wish to learn more on the subject of African marginalization, development (or lack of it), and cultural reality. I came across this book as required reading in a World Development Geography class in my sophomore year of university (International Relations and Development Program)."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"It is not necessary to go on and on and debate the merits of how this story is told and what meaning is emphasized at the expense of other meanings. It is enough that this is a really good book and a really good story. It is worth reading from so many angles and dimensions. It is captivating. It is tough to put down. History learned and viewpoints expressed are bonuses."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is one of the great books of our generation. It can be read quickly like a Grisham novel, but I guarantee that a thoughtful read will challenge your beliefs. I have taught junior high Social Studies for many years, but Barbara Kinsolving has managed to make me rethink a lot of what I took for granted in this brilliant novel.The story begins slowly, but stay with it because the payoff is incredible. An evangelical minister takes his wife and four daughters to central Africa for one year. Political events cause the family to stay much longer.The book can be a page turner if that's all you're looking for...but if you read it carefully, you'll learn a lot about Africa, about America, and about yourself.TATA JESUS IS BANGALA! I can see the handsome face of the young Nathan Price shouting his faith in the voice of Charleston Heston, and the old Nathan still believeing and not understanding why he was unable to communicate his stern fundimentalist god to the people of the Congo.I will lend my copy to many friends. After that, it will hold an honored place on my bookshelf.Mike Dowling[URL]"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I found this to be one of the most important books I have ever read. It is extremely well written, and more importantly well researched. I was amazed at how many fundamental but emotional topics that kingsolver tackled. Life, Death and the balance and struggle between humans and the earth. Although we all may know that hunger, disease, corruption, greed, ecological distress, and more exist in the world, this book allows you to live it for awhile. I came away realizing that even as a lower middle class young parent struggling from check to check, I am still rich in the eyes of the world. And I can't walk down the street downtown without seeing how much food is thrown out after lunch, or turn on the faucet without thinking about hauling it, or read a story about a premature child saved by medical technology without thinking about the full term children that will starve to death or die of disease. And most of all I can't help questioning our state of excess here in the U.S. and the tragedy it has brought. Perhaps if children's health was not taken for granted our rates of abuse and neglect and even daycare would be lower. Perhaps if we had to grow our own food we would not waste so much and we would not suffer the effects of pesticide residues, and the creatures of the earth would not face those same toxins. For better or for worse this book will make you see the world as a whole. It is truly a brilliant book and a wonderful gift of truth."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Kingsolver's writing is beautiful, and her character development is extraordinary. The narration from several different characters gives the book a great flow, and the story is mesmerizing."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book felt like a living, breathing representation of life as a missionary in the Congo. I enjoyed how the story was told through all the daughters eyes, not just from one perspective. It made the story richer and more intricately woven, showing how an event in a families life can be translated differently by each individual. A must read."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Bean Trees and the Animal Dreams just consume the reader, the Poisonwood Bible just confuses the reader. In all her other book I cared about the main characters, but she has not managed to carry that wonderful writing to this book. With the poisonwood bible, I am finishing the book solely because I started it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"It was written very accurately as a depiction of African cultural. The author has a vivid and unique form of giving words a picture. Would not recommend to the light reader."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Kingsolver herself has written, in the introduction to the 2001 volume of Best American Short Stories (which she guest-edited), that she abandons any book or story which gets wrong basic facts and settings. Under her own analysis, Poisonwood Bible is a waste of time. Kingsolver has absolutely no ear for the dialogue of either teenagers or little children. The chapters written in the voices of the oldest and youngest daughter are painful to read -- full of forced malapropisms and an excruciatingly exaggerated take on Zappa-esque Valley Doll-speak. These glaringly contrived and unrealistic voices are so intrusive, and so grating, that they forced me to abandon the novel halfway through, which I rarely do. Too bad, because otherwise the book was relatively enjoyable. As for the reviews that rave about it being the best American novel of this century or whatever, all I can say is this: if you read those reviews, how many of them display basic competence with grammar and English vocabulary?"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Somewhere in the middle of these 550 pages is a wonderful story of about 250 pages trying to burst forth. However, slogging through the muck and mire of these pitiful preachers of political correctness and philosophical nihilism was not worth finding the diamond in the rough. The narrative was hopelessly broken by the use of too many voices. The word games that are to help define each character are unconvincing and self indulgent. Nevertheless, the worst sin of this Bible is endless navel gazing. African history was interesting. The plot was interesting. These women were not interesting. Pitiful - pit is full - lluf si tip. The heart of this novel began too late and ended too early. Out of respect for their time, it will not be recommended reading for my friends, family and co-workers."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver tries to sound important, while her work contains so little interesting elements that its almost a chore to read the book. Her plot is non-existant and her characters are semi interesting but still, not quite &quot;real.&quot; Perhaps if Kinglsover took some classes in plot development then the book would have a half way decent and coherent story. Bad stuff all around, stay away from this book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Ms. Kingsolver obviously has an agenda to bash evangelicals, most men and American conservatives while whitewashing the virtues of Marxism,animism and anticolonialism. Granted that some men have probably sacrificed their families in the pursuit of saving their own souls, as she had the pathetic Nathan Price portrayed, but I find it impossible to believe that anyone could be dedicated to serving humanity and God to the absolutely total exclusion of any feelings or concerns for his family as had Mr. Price. She was very impressive with her knowledge of the Congo and world politics, but I would point out that smallpox was eradicated from the world in the mid 1970's' while the book depicts the disease as having been present in Angola in the mid 1980's. The story was very fascinating when told from the perspectives of the different women in the Price family (I guess the message is that men don't have feelings that matter since there were no first person narratives except of women). A very interesting, even exciting but distorted and unrealistic."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"What a disappointment! This is a throw away book - first across the room, then either outside or in the trash. I hung in there and read the whole thing...a total waste of time, but friends recommended it highly so I continued to read with an optimistic attitude. Beeg mistake! The author writes beautifully but the story goes nowhere. I was hoping to learn more about the Congo and its independence movement. Why is.... attracted to books like this??? Read &quot;King Leopold's Ghost&quot; for an excellent history of the horrors the Congolese people suffered under Belgian rule."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is a great effort but becomes exasperating half-way through. The techniques the author uses to distinguish one woman from the other become increasingly annoying after they've gotten the point across(Rachel's malapropisms; Adah's private language...)Also, the dialogue among the characters in order to forward the political exposition is very stilted; it didn't sound at all like true conversation but just the author trying to hammer home her belief. I'd give this book 4 stars for concept but only 2 for follow-through. Try a library copy before buying!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Despite being highly recommended by my favorite person on Earth at the time it was published, I kept it at my bedside because it was very easy to fall asleep reading it.Now, I have written and researched a lot about the Congo and was once about to introduce and edit an edition of Lamumba's writings, but I have never been able to finish this book. The world of this novel is so artificially and formally contrived around the points the author wants to make. The personalities and description of her characters nature is so predetermined to end up exactly where they end up, that they aren't very interesting to me. I don't feel reality is being discussed or described, let alone explored.I find it very hard to believe the lack of racial attitude on the part of the family, particularly coming from Georgia during those years. Moreover, the stupidity--the stock Ugly American dumb male--of the father in the story is not mitigated by anything. All of the characters are what we would call flat characters.John Garnder once wrote in his immortal book _On Moral Fiction_, about the weakness of Steinbeck's _Grapes of Wrath_. He notes Steinback never finds the humanity within his bad guys, never finds the realities that twist good people into doing bad things, or vice versa, and in the end Gardner believes Steinbeck's fiction fails as fiction whatever its value as propoganda. This advice can be truly applied to this book. Kingsolver tends to smooth out reality to make things fit into her message rather than using her novels as a method to explore reality.However, I would love it if she approaches the novel like Naipaul or Joyce Oates or Toni Morrison as a journey into what we don't know about humanity.What we have here is the self-absorbed white liberal's collapse into a very stick figured view of life in Africa, and an even more stick figured view of white Americans in America and Africa.Asked about the book by a friend and embarassed to tell her that the book put me to sleep, I replied, I prefer reading books about Africa by Africans. Good advice.I find it distressing that in North America rather mediocre books a bout Africa by North Americans and Europeans and about North Americans and Europeans in Africa have broad circulation, but the fine literature about Africans in African produced by the growing ranks of African writers of international recognition are ignored!I would add that for the same reasons I prefer reading works of Southern White authors about Southern Whites because they tend to portray them as aspects of the complexity of humanity, not stick figures to throw easy stones at."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Wow!

It is not light reading. Sad and difficult at times, but well worth reading. I love all this author's work."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Four women, four voices, four experiences of four decades in the history of Africa. From the first paragraph describing the Congolese jungle, this book slithered out and wrapped itself around me and I didn't want it to ever let me go. The language is exquisite, the characters riveting and the plot dramatic in the best sense of the word. That Kingsolver also manages to pack in a complex lesson on the history of imperialism on top of all that is simply mind-boggling.The setting is Africa, but events like those in this book have happened many times all over the world. Unfortunately, citizens of imperialist nations, including the U.S., are privileged to \\"sail through from cradle to grave with a conscience clean as snow,\\" as Kingsolver says in the first chapter. Having lived in Chile, I understand far too well what U.S. foreign policy is capable of doing. So I found the story of what happened to the Congo under first Belgian direct rule and then U.S. indirect rule depressingly familiar. Yet it is a story that needs to be heard over and over until the citizens of the \\"first world\\" finally hold our own governments accountable for the misery we have caused in the \\"third world.\\"I found this to be a truly masterful depiction of imperialism and its effects on entire nations, as told through the stories of four American women.

The work of a genius. Overpowering. In the upper echelon of any list of classics.As life-changing, heart-wrenching, and memorable as Uncle Tom's Cabin, The Kite Runner, The Good Earth, The Help, The Grapes of Wrath, et al.Infinitely more than a story about a preacher's family in Africa. It is gorged with symbolism, bejeweled by poetry, boiling with justifiable moral outrage.An unflinching exposition and enduring indictment of humans at their worst. A testament to our indomitable will to survive, an irresistible imperative to become our best.Setting aside the masterful story -- just the language alone is more than worth the journey.I am forever transformed after reading it.I will be reading every scrap of paper ever published by Kingsolver -- two more books of hers are on the way to my doorstep as we speak, minutes after I finished this one."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Now I understand why I found this book on lists of must-read, influential novels. It is long, but every page was like a gift - filled with poignant, heartbreaking events, wonderful humor, and an engrossing look at the relationships of four young sisters and their mother who all accompany their Baptist missionary father, Nathan Price, to the heart of the Belgian Congo in 1959, where it seems he is ardently committed to changing the world beginning with the Congolese and their children. He is initially very offended when they will not take their children to the river to be baptized, completely ignorant of the fact there are crocodiles waiting for just such a happy event.The culture shock of plucking five women from the normalcy of Atlanta, GA and dropping them into the middle of the Congo is stunning and revealed with amazing narrative. I normally object to a lot of narrative, but this was so insightful and so beautiful, I read it gratefully.The story is told, chronologically, from the prospective of each of the girls and their mother. It was quite an accomplishment of the author to write each chapter with the steady 'voice' of each of these women. Twins, Adah and Leah, figured prominently, but the others were equally represented. Oldest sister, Rachel, at fifteen, was a little bit over the top, but also contributed much of the humor so you could always look forward to her take on things. One of my favorite Rachel quotes from later in the book: \\"If I'd known what marriage was going to be like, well, heck, I probably would have tied all those hope-chest linens together into a rope and hung myself from a tree!\\" See what I mean.When the Congo is about to erupt in a war for independence from Belgium, other countries, including America are involving themselves to affect the outcome. Nathan Price is advised to leave immediately and take his family home to safety. He refuses, even when their already meager stipend is cut off. Eventually his wife and daughters see him for the abusive, zealous man he is and their mother, Orleanna, reaches a breaking point. The family is splintered, but the story of the women and Africa continues on - fascinating and immensely engaging to the very last page."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I had put off reading this book for over a decade.

Sometimes I would just sit in the driveway to get to the end of a chapter. I appreciated the audiobook because there are a few words in another language that I would be unable to pronounce correctly myself.I will admit that the book starts slowly. The first chapter is from the perspective of the mother. You do not find out until much later why it seems to move so slowly. In spite of that, the book is an excellent study in adaptability. Because of the various ages of the family, we can see how well each handles change. It ranges from utter refusal to complete acceptance of the culture that the family thrust themselves into. The book pulls you in slowly and does not let go.One reviewer doubts the historicity of the novel. I must admit that I don't care about the accuracy of the history. It is after all a work of fiction. Therefore one should not depend upon it for the history of Africa. If it is inaccurate, (again, I don't care) it does not detract from the story. I enjoyed the story of Leah and her family because you continue to see how her age affected the way she eventually adapted to the culture. She considered life as it would have been back home, but ultimately she was \\"raised\\" or came of age in Africa. It was therefore her home.I was amazed at how much I enjoyed this book. I have since bought and passed it to all of my sisters"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I read and loved this book when I first read it 10 years ago and was delighted when our book club selected it as their choice to discuss last month. The Poisonwood Bible is a powerful story about a domineering, patriarchal and manic Baptist minister who tries to convert the small populace of a poverty stricken town in the Congo. Told in the voices of his four daughters and wife we get to observe the inner lives of these women whose insights into their circumstances brings a welcome freshness to what otherwise might be a depressing tale of hopelessness. Their clear voices, unique and thoughtful, give expression to the psychological and physical landscape in which they live. There is valley-girl perspective of the eldest, Rachel (whom soon became my favorite); the twins Leah and Adah: one perfect and bright, the other deformed and brilliant; Ruth May, the baby of the family with a gift for relating to the children of the village; and Orleanna the submissive wife and mother who is unable to protect her beloved children and who simultaneously loves and hates her husband. I loved this book even more on a second reading, the writing and story holding me spellbound throughout."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Hard to find a book with characters that feel like close friends, a story line that transports you to a real unknown land, learning history while walking around sacred life questions and a page turner; yet The Poisonwood Bible accomplishes all and so much more. Some books change you forever sometimes because it retells parts of your own story helping you understand your life in new ways tenderly probing values and choices. Mostly I am sorry I have finished the book I already miss Leah."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"After living in West Africa for many years, this book details the conflicts and struggles that are present for both natives and foreigners. The historical aspect of the book is eye-opening for the younger generations who are unaware of the crisis in the DRC. This book is definitely worth a read and you won't be able to put it down!!!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Nick Price drags a family of 6 deep into the Belgian Congo, during a time where misunderstanding between races and cultures burned stronger than the African sun, all to begin his Baptist teachings of the \`poisonwood Bible'. Barbara Kingsolver digs into every crack in the Price family, in her epic and page-turning novel, The Poisonwood Bible. Known most popularly (or condemningly) as a feature of \`Oprah's Book Club', it has topped bestseller lists in the past and still gains acclaim for its moving message. Poisonwood tells the story of Reverend Nick and wife Orleanna Price and their four daughters as they enter into the volatile and war torn Congo, located deep in the heart of Africa. Nick's extremist efforts to spread his version of the Gospel soon crumble, and so does his family does under \\"Our Fathers\\" controlling will. This novel brings an influential, powerful, and well written message of the relevance of religion and the potency of racism; once highlighted by Kingsolver, it is impossible to ignore these prevalent issues that still plague the world today.The Belgian Congo became torn apart over control of its diamond mines and other valuable resources. As fight by the Congolese began, and independence occurred in the 1960's began, the United States and Belgian joined in corrupting the fragile government and to date, the extent of the secretive actions of the United States is still unknown, and the Congo remains unstable. The Price family arrived \\"for a twelve month mission\\"(13) in the middle of the turmoil unaware of the war around them, and were soon advised to leave the danger.War however is only a backdrop in the lives of the Price girls. Kingsolver uses varying point-of-view between the Price children to narrate, this gives the novel authenticity as all walk away from the Congo touched in different ways. Each child's different personality reflects upon the page in a different way. Rachel is the eldest daughter, immature and self-centered. She is most shocked by the culture of the Congolese and is disgusted by her surroundings. Next is Leah, a beautiful intelligent and inquisitive teenager. She finds a home in Africa, but never quite finds happiness because of the guilt she endures over the twin sister, Adah. Adah is crippled; an accident in the womb caused her to lose the ability to control the left half of her body. \\"Through Adah eyes, the world is a-boggle\\"(30). She pretends to be mute, however she is considered a genius. In Africa Adah finds acceptance for the first time, in a place where disabilities are commonplace and language is not needed to communicate. Ruth May is the youngest, sweet independent and functions without boundaries of race or gender. The girls narrate about their experience in Africa, beginning with their voyage, then the overwhelmingness of it, the capturing powers it has over the soul and finally, the impression it leaves.Kingsolver makes many statements about the issues that stretch to two continents. Her goal was to highlight the history of the Congo, while narrating the smaller plight of the Price family, and all the issues as the Congo and family interact. As this Baptist family encounters a primal community; issues of racism, religion, gender and cultural superiority are continually called into question. Racism is approached from a different angle; the Price family looks down upon the Congolese, viewing them as a savage country that is in desperate need of saving. \\"I realized hand I held was not my mothers, but the thick brown claw of a strangers!\\"(23). The Congolese, in turn, despise the white supremacists, who are now taking over their town along with their country. As time goes on both sides open, at least partially to each other, and acceptance of differences of human beings occurs. \\"We were different\\", says Rachel \\"not just because we were white and had our vaccinations, but because we were simply a much, much luckier kind of person\\"(367).Kingsolver uses the setting of the Congo to the fullest. The Congo is everything in this novel. Its borders circle all peace, war, death, and life. Another tool of Kingsolver is point-of-view; this controls much of the emotion in the novel and brings authenticity. As each of the Price girls leaves Congo with a different emotion toward it, Kingsolver allows the reader to identify with whichever of the girls they connect with. This is a brilliant method of exploring the questions the Congo unveils, because in the end there is not right answer. A family dissected, and left out on the pages, for the reader to make their own judgments regarding it. Kingsolver is a mastermind in the depths of her novel however one critique of the novel is: the prior knowledge required of Congo, because the Price family is thrown into the middle of the Congo, so is the reader. At times, the information can be difficult to digest. Also the political statement made by Kingsolver is too intermixed with the more personal themes she tries to install. Names of political leaders and facts can overwhelm, because the overall implications of political upheaval are felt in the tone, and not needed in specifics as they are presented.The Poisonwood Bible leaves a lasting impression and boldly brings attention to pressing issues of today, especially racism and religion. The questions The Poisonwood Bible stirs in the readers mind, the imagery and lasting memories from it 543 pages are the true purpose of literature. Magnify, describe, question, and leave the reader dwindling on the last page trembling with the burden of analyzing such a powerful message."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I though The Poisonwood Bible was one of the best books I have ever read. After reading a couple of other books by Barbara Kingsolver, which I happened to love, I decided to read this novel. This book is incredibly intense and has so many meanings. I am a sophomore in high school and for a research paper, I am comparing this book with Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe. Kingsolver actually used Achebe's novel for research for her own. While The Poisonwood Bible describes the infiltration of African villages by Christian missionaries through the eyes of the missionary's family who is forced to travel with him to the Congo, Things Fall Apart describes this invasion through the eyes of a powerful African man in his village. These books primarily preserve the culture and religions of Africa before Africa was colonized and the culture was influenced by outsiders.My personal favorite character is Adah, a hemiplegic twin sister, who is very cynical but is able to view the world impartially. Writing in her backward ways, Adah prevails throughout the novel, finally accepting religion and herself.I strongly recommend The Poisonwood Bible to anyone who is unaware of the exceptional African culture and the conspiracies leading to disruption in the normally peaceful country. Though I once thought of Africa as a primitive country, I now realize how exceptional their ancient customs are and truly appreciate their extraordinary languages and unusual religions."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book will reshape the way you think about Africa and the western world's interference in their way of life and customs.I strongly disagree with some reviewers that her book is anti-American. Kingsolver is not condemning good American values, but is simply speaking out against the bad things that some American policies and people partake in. We must all realize that no country and no individual can be right all of the time.As far as the accusation that the book is anti-Christian goes, the book does not condemn Christianity amongst the willing. It merely discourages impelling unwilling peoples to be submitted to harassment by less than altruistic Christian missionaries. Her story highlights the tradition, culture and skills of the peoples of Africa, which are often belittled by American and European culture, as some people still look on the African way of life as \\"savage.\\" Kingsolver struggles to illustrate that the world is a diverse place where everyone should have the right to practice their own religion and culture.Kingsolver's characters are extremely diverse and inciteful. They serve as a means of relating the story through vastly different viewpoints. The shifting of voices keeps the reader enthralled, as does the exciting storyline.This book literally changed my mother's life, and it is through this book that one of my friends first gained a interest in reading. He has been reading voraciously ever since. Please do not skip this chance to read a masterpiece of cultural awareness and human character."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is simply one of the best books I have ever read--and I read every day. It will be a classic. Get it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I wouldn't have bought this one for myself, but it was a gift so I gave it a try. I've lost a lot of sleep reading it, and then layed awake several more hours thinking about the religious metaphors and hidden messages in the book. Kingsolver is a brilliant writer and obviously schooled in African history and the bible (I'm NOT by the way). The framework is in an interesting fashion with each character telling a part of the story (without Nathan), which gives it a biblical feel, except these chapters are all by WOMEN! The girls face their own demons in the story and their faith is tested in every possible way. The title, the characters and the setting were more thought provoking than anything I've read in a while. Its also surprisingly funny.For those who either didn't like it or thought it had no plot, I truly don't understand the complaints. Its a very complex book, so don't read it if you are looking for a casual distraction-- It deserves your full attention. I gave it 4 stars because the historical and political diatribe in the second part of the book (mostly from Leah and Ada) gets really, really old. Otherwise, I'd say the book is about as perfect as it can get."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Ok, so I've now \\"tried\\" Barbara Kingsolver. I'm an avowed reader with diverse taste. When I was at a loss as to what to read next, someone suggested this author. With the exception of maybe Prodigal Summer, to me Barbara Kingsolver at best is ho hum. Out of the 4 or 5 books of hers that I have now read, this was about the most BORING book I have ever read, period. It was painfully long, preachy, and had the same major flaw I saw with the other Kingsolver books I've read, severely lacking a point. I'm still at a loss as to what the deal was with the father in this book, but maybe more important, I don't care.I enjoy good story telling about strong people and families, despite any faults they may have. Kingsolver has the ability to tell a story with good visuals, but her character building is consistanty weak. I've finished most of her books not caring about any of her characters, wishing there was less PC and preaching,more character building, and wondering why I wasted my time. While Bean Trees etc. were cute, \\"light and happy\\" stories, Poisonwood Bible was just overly heavy and never ending. I was proud of myself just for sticking it out to the end.I REALLY WANTED TO LIKE THIS AUTHOR!!!! I have now given Barbara Kingsolver a fair shot. I think I'll move on."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I had pre-conceived ideas about this book which turned out to be completely wrong. This is a wonderfully crafted story which got better and better as it unfolded. When Nathan takes his wife and four daughters to the Congo in the late 1950s to undertake missionary work, they have no real comprehension of what is in store for them. There are some obvious obstacles that confront them and many that they cannot have envisioned. After a major event occurs (which should not be revealed until the reader reaches that stage of the book), their family structure and future drastically changes and for me this heralded the most fascinating part of the book. A great deal of cross-analysis with the Bible can be made, but don't let that deter you. Even without a detailed knowledge of the Bible, the reader can still thoroughly enjoy this book and gain a great deal from it. Having enjoyed The Poisonwood Bible so much, I will go on to Barbara Kingsolver's other works without hesitation."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Truly remarkable. Kingsolver uses a brilliant writing style to tell the story of an American family on mission to the Belgian Congo. Each chapter is told from the perspective of a different character (a woman and her four daughters. Even though this novel peaks two-thirds of the way through, it is marvelous to the last page. Kingsolver takes her characters far beyond the mission trip, elongating the story to several decades! Political overtones run high in this story, but do not necessarily overshadow it! Brilliant story, brilliant writing = BRILLIANT NOVEL!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible begins with the Price family, a missionary family headed to Congo in the 1960s during a time of great upheaval in that country. The family is unsure of what to expect but they set off to the country with hope and life.The character development of the fascinating group of people in this book, from the determined mother, and the strange father, to the spoiled Rachel is so well-executed you feel like you are experiencing this adventure first hand with them.The book is so engrossing that you sometimes forget where you are... You can hear the sounds of the Congo, feel the itch of the mosquitos, smell the food. The book weaves a heartbreaking tale that will leave you flipping the pages furiously in order to find out what happens next. You will be surprised at the metamorphosis of this family and the transition each one of them makes on the Congo.This is one you can pick up in hardcover, because it is one that you will want to keep forever."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Beautifully written. The characters are described in such depth that I felt like a part of this dysfunctional family.I will be reading more of Barbara Kingsolver!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book sat on my bookshelf for years when I was working and too busy to read much fiction. Now I am retired and I picked it up recently with no expectations but once I started to read it I couldn't put it down. Like so many other reviewers have commented, Barbara Kingsolver uses words like Monet used paint to create a stunning vision that is both real, beautifully crafted and unique.Her story begins in 1960, a time when not only were missionary families traveling the world to bring the message of Christianity to underdeveloped cultures, but so were American Peace Corps Volunteers (I served in Chile 1964 to 1966) and US AID personnel traveling the world to spread the religion of democracy as a the salvation to nations less fortunate than ourselves with little regard to the cultures that evolved and existed for centuries before we \\"discovered\\" them. (We had, however, discovered the value of the diamonds, colbalt and other minerals that we were mining and shipping out of the country.)In Kingsolver's book, the Belgians then the Americans entered into the life of Africa with the same kind of zeal that the minister, \\"Our Father\\" as his daughter called him, had shown bringing his religious salvation to the people of the remote African town his family landed in...uninvited and unwanted but welcomed nevertheless by the Africans. The total disregard for the native people, their beliefs and customs and their system of governing is mirrored by Kingsolvers portrayal of the Baptist minister and in the background, the grandfatherly Ike Eisenhower, who orders the murder of Patrice Lumumba, the first democratically elected president of the Congo, after its independence, only 80 days into his government's creation as evidenced in the Church Commission's review of America's role in what became Zaire.The wife and daughters are, like so many Americans, following the lead of the family patriarch, until they realize that it is insane, misguided, and not in their interest nor the interest of the people they are there to \\"save\\". The price they each pay is terrible and the family is destroyed by the experience, after they realize that the \\"One Size Fits All\\" approach to religion and governing doesn't work and the price of that ignorance is senseless and meaningless. In retrospect it mirrors the history of so many foreign wars America has been involved in since 1960 that seemed to be important but in hindsight are viewed by history as terrible and unnecessary loss of life and purpose with very little benefit to anyone.The women in the Price family lose thier faith in thier husband/father, in God and in the America they once believed in. They are wiser but lost to each other by the ways they each adapt to their African experience and the lessons that resulted. Like so many brave soldiers who have marched off to foreign lands believing in a just cause, they return scarred and changed in ways that they never anticipated and never really recover from.I think this book is a classic of American Literature that is as important in 2013 as it was when it was written. It provides a look backward and forward at ourselves and the roles we take both as Americans in the world and in our families. There are so many lessons to be learned as we contemplate the questions raised in this beautifully crafted book. I am so grateful that I have lived long enough to have read it and to have been able to reflect on the powerful story it tells from each character's perspective. This book, like Monet's paintings, is one that will stand the test of time. It is a classic piece of American literary art."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Reading a novel set in a real world circumstance, one can forget that the story is nonetheless ficticious. And this might just be what Barbara Kingsolver intended on happening in her novel \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\". The story is a wonderful and complex character study set in the exotic land of Congo in the late 1950's and extending until the 80's (where the book storyline ends). The book's explores injustice at various levels but most poigniantly as it occurs from the emulated figure of Nathan Price- who represents the kind of personal, painful, domestic and religious antagonist that we both hate and pity. Kingsolver is intent on demonising the Baptist missionary as preacher, husband, father and human being with a subordinate purpose of political preaching on the part of the author. Don't get me wrong, I found the book to be very well written and very accurate of some Christian leaders across history. The arrogance and insensitivity portrayed through Nathan Price typifies what most Christians (let alone people) despise about religion- that within it's ranks are voices more harmful than healing.But the author fails to place a voice of reason within the scope of the story that can represent the missionary vocation as anything good. The other missionaries explored in the story are either white snobs who profit and exploit the country and its riches or protestants who convert to Catholicism in the course of their mission. Kingsolver does not give us a realistic contrast to Nathan's evil and we are left with a darkness that reveals truth but grows to expose the author's own prejudices. We can believe a man can be as arrogant and unkind as Nathan Price, and that his family can survive (at least partially) from his influence- but we are left feeling like the story was artificially built against the man rather than just naturally revealed as part of the narrative.That said, \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\" is excellent writing with vivid characters, undulating dialog that feels absolutely real, exotic settings to be explored and real life, joy and pain to be experienced. Kingsolver is brilliant as a novelist, making situations feel like real motion. And when things are interuppted, by pain, joy or surprise, the reader is given space to feel the experience through her vivid prose. One chapter especially had me nearly in tears- as a young child dies and a painful, haunting day as lived by the family members is recounted.This novel is a story, but it is a good story and it does teach us something of moral value. The lesson are not contrived, even if the platform is occasionally stolen for political stumping about American imperialism and European colonialism. The life and gift of this work is its characters, its setting and its revelation about human character in its strain to indoctrinate others into a system of belief. The author uses multiple points of view to tell the story- a mother and her four children are the voices of this prose. The father (our antagonist) is never given his own voice. As a man, I think this was a wise choice of the author- since it allows the reader to interpret the mind of Nathan Price simply by his speach and actions. And it is this kind of judgment that his family members must make about him as well- and they do.This is a very good novel by an exceptional writer- if you like character built stories, this is a good choice."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible may turn out to be one of the most memorable books I have read. Friends have been telling me I would like it. Why did I wait? KIngsolver handles so many of the most important issues in life - religion, ecology, predjudice, and many more. I am left with the question of my own values and a most uncomfortable feeling that I am not sure what is right or moral."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"An interesting book! A Baptist preacher (over zealous with spirit) moves his family of wife and four daughters to Africa, determined to convert and baptise all. The book is written as seen by each of the five girls/women, and deals with a very turbulent time in Africa. I certainly learned a lot about the history of Africa, and found the book made me squirm more than a bit about the way America treated the African nation and the African people."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"When I got to 7% on my Kindle, I was thinking of writing a review saying, This is the worst book I have ever read, and I have read a lot. I went online and read about 100 of the most critical reviews, including one that said, \\"Do yourself a favor and don't waste any time on this book,\\" However i was intrigued and continued. My early impression was that Ms Kingsolver knew nothing about Africa or writing and certainly knew nothing about missionaries or the Christian message. My final conclusion is that she does know something about Africa and although not to my liking, her writing skills are excellent. She also is very well versed in the Bible, especially the Apocrypha, but with all her knowledge, she did miss the core of the Christian message. She took all the bad traits of hundreds of evangelical missionaries and lumped them all together in the horrible character of the missionary Price. As others have said, fundamentalist Baptist missionaries don't accept the Apocrypha and are not sent out with no intercultural training, however Kingsolver makes it clear that he was an anomaly as far as Baptists go in his attachment to the Apocrypha, and he overrode his Baptist Missions Board by insisting on going to Africa with his whole family against their advice and without their training or blessing. He was a horrible character but was created by Ms Kingsolver for her purpose of discrediting missionaries, Christianity, white people, the USA as well as Europe, all civilization and medical science as well.Contrary to the opinions of some, she did a great job of character development, but Rachel, a self centered, despicable character, turns out to be an epitome of an ugly American even though she never returns to the USA. She is not as bad as the terrible South African pilot, however. Leah, the most likable character from my point of view, ends up a communist. Whatever personal agenda this author might have had, it appears to be the glorification of paganism, anti Christianity, and Communism. My curiosity drove me on to finish the book, but perhaps the other reviewer was correct when he said, \\"Do yourself a favor, and don't read this book.\\" Now I am going to have to spend time researching African history of the 1960's."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"An exciting story about a fanatical missionary and the impact he and Africa have on his family.

The women from a family of a self-righteous Baptist missionary find themselves in the Congo at the start of that country's struggle to release itself from Belgium's control. The struggle of a mother and her 4 daughters parallels that of the country to which they will become inexorably bound. Each female narrates her own story and the voices, each distinctive and revealing, ultimately blend harmoniously to create a classic apology. The writing is sheer poetry and the narrative, while dark and complex, is compelling. A book which blends the historic with the personal in a marvelous way. It is a story that will stay with the reader for a very long time."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"It was a very difficult book for me to get into but yet i did find myself completing the book.

I appreciate her new influence and am grateful to learn of her knowledge of the Congo."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This was the first book of Barbara Kingsolver I ever read thanks to amazon.com's recomendations and its slightly controversial reader's comments. People either loved it dearly or found it horrible according to the evaluation stars. I am joining the group of readers who loved it mainly because I am thinking that it is a superb piece of literature and not just a pageturner. The author's trick of telling the story using five different voices gives you the ability to evaluate the things that happen from different angles. Many readers critize that one main character, Nathan Prize, hasn't been given the opportunity to express his own point of view. I found that not so disturbing as to my understanding of the novel he is the only member of the family who does not want to understand or is not capable of it what is really going on among the people he fervently wants to baptize. For me, each of the characters stands for a posible alternative of western people to deal with such a different culture as of the native people living in a remote village in the Congo. Therefore I think that the third part of the novel which counts the further lives of the characters after their two dramatic years in the jungle is really important as is fans out various choices about how to deal with such events, either ignoring them (as Rachel does who adopts a more or less colonial way of life, only remembering with horrors the ordeals they went though in the jungle) or being overwhelmed by the richness of African life (as Leah does who marries the native teacher who gets deeply involved in politics). An other thing I loved about the book was its construction. Each part of the novel is framed by a biblical quotation that contains the essence of the events to happen next. As a conclusion, I highly recommend this novel as one of the books that really gives you a lot to think about."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This novel is sylistically light years beyond her previous &quot;Arizona&quot; novels. If Kingsolver wears her politics on her sleeve a little too prominenetly, one is inclined to forgive her given the depth of her characters and the revelation of the wonderful/terrible world of the Congo in the 1960s. The prose was perfect. I simply could not put this book down. Although the ending seemed a little too neat and complascent, I was so emotionally exhausted when I got there that I really did not mind."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"As a huge fan of Kingsolver, I eagerly anticipated this novel. It did not disappoint. It is very different from her previous books, and the writing style (moving from character to character) does take some getting used to. Once you adjust, however, you can't wait to hear from the next character.As someone who does not have a great deal of knoweldge about the history of the Congo, I found the book fascinating from a puesdo-historical perspective too.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Kingsolver has surpassed her previous excellence in this extraordinay historical novel of suspense, spirituality, death, redemption, and love. With good humor but acerbic wit and searing honesty, she explores the misguided missionary zeal that disregards the spirituality, culture, and family units of the Congo in the 1960's. Her writing is exquisite. The first paragraph grabbed me and I was on my way. She weaves the history of Africa, the Price family, and the people of Kilinga into a masterful story. The big question of how we all might be responsible in the conquest and destruction of an entire way of life lingers on. It also explores the arrogance of Christian missionaries in their misguided attempts to coerce and bully people with their own beliefs. I loved this book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver is the only author I read while clenching (and liberally using) a yellow highlighter in my right hand. First The Bean Trees, then Pigs in Heaven, now The Poisonwood Bible. She always touches me with her words and makes me want to be a better writer. She says what I wish I could. And, with my passion for Africa, this book is spot on for me. I loved letting the characters be developed for us in their own voices. I loved Adah's language. I wish we had heard from the woefully misguided father as well. I indulged myself and read it all in one week. But I so hated it to end. More, please, Ms. Kingsolver. Hurry and write another!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book was very highly recommended by a friend, so I figured I'd read it. I actually gave up on it, but she told me to keep at it, that she put it down 3 times before finally finishing it.It got better about 200 pages into the book, but I still am not thrilled by the story.However, it gives a unique perspective on American and World history. Another interesting thing it will show you is about consumption. Americans and Brits use five to ten times more of the world's resources than people in third world countries. This is painfully obvious in the Poisonwood Bible. I was considering this book as part of a World History curriculum, but decided it was too much for freshmen to get into.I suggest you keep plugging through if you find it difficult to read."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Great novel. Kingsolver is an insightful writer. I loved the fact that she did research about the people and the culture. As an African, I was very sceptical to read a novel written by a white American woman whom I believed would never fully understand the culture and psychology of the people she was writing about but she did a great job. Characters are well developed and the plot is also engaging. I recommend this book for all."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I absolutely loved this book...I don't know why I hesitated so long before buying it...also I just recently learned it was one of Hillary Clinton's favorite novels & that it reminded her ''that every women faces unique challenges & choices, and that all too often women find themselves trapped by their circumstances.'' I agree, this epic novel, narrated by four sisters and their mother dissects three decades of a family's life starting in 1959. It is filled with tender & tragic love, evil patriarchal tyranny and strong religious & political conflicts.I was moved by each fictional narrator's profound insight...I had to remind myself that this was not a true story, even though the story within the story was based on real historical figures and actual political struggles in the Congo.Expertly crafted, the author renders a passionate, touching and even at times sinister tale.Kingsolver has written such a complex, powerful yet utterly warm and unforgettable novel, for a couple of days it captivated my time, my thoughts and my whole life...Bravo!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I actually cried real tears during parts of this book &amp; I've never done that before. I'm not going to go into the plot of the book because so many other reviewers have already done that, but I'll tell you this book is worth all the time you can muster to read &amp; read &amp; read until your eyes can no longer focus. I was so engrossed I could hardly put it down - especially the first 2/3 of the book.I thought the subtle way the author changed the voices of the girls with time was perfectly tuned. I had no problem keeping up with the 25 or 30 year time span, as other reviewers have mentioned was a problem. By the end of the novel I felt extremely comfortable with each of the characters, like I'd personally known them since children. I found the mother, Orleanna, and one of the daughters, Adah, to be some of Barbara Kingsolver's most compelling characters, and Our Father, Nathan Price, is quite odious as the judgmental &quot;hypoChristian.&quot; I also love some the foreshadowing, but I won't ruin it for everybody who hasn't read the book!Barbara Kingsolver can be a politically-minded individual and I had no illusions that a book about post-colonial Belgian Congo/Zaire/Rep. of Congo would have anything less than a few references to politics. It seems naive to imagine otherwise."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"It's been a long time since a book left me speechless by the end. Historical fiction is especially hard to pull off, and Kingsolver nails it on every level: lyrical writing, incredible detail, mesmerizing characters and compelling themes. Believe the hype -- this is a fabulous novel."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Having been on many short-term foreign mission trips and aspiring to one day have a more permanent position in the mission field, I found The Poisonwood Bible a thought- provoking journey that caused me to search my heart for truth. I was not so much a reader as I was a traveler journeying with Kingsolver to the Congo in this fictional, but bitingly real experience. Rich, vivid words are masterfully used to pull the reader into the world of senses where one can taste, hear, feel, and smell the intensity of Africa. For example:\\"The trees are columns of slick, brindled bark like muscular animals overgrown beyond all reason. Every space is filled with life: delicate, poisonous frogs war-painted like skeletons, clutched in copulation, secreting their precious eggs onto dripping leaves. Vines strangling their own kin in the everlasting wrestle for sunlight. The breathing of monkeys. The glide of a snake belly on a branch. A single-file army of ants biting a mammoth tree into the uniform grains and hauling it down to the dark for their ravenous queen. And, in reply, a choir of seedlings arching their necks out of the rotted tree stumps, sucking life out of death. The forest eats itself and lives forever.\\"Even as I am drawn in to experience nature's intensity, I am introduced to the Congolese people, challenged to know them, and if I dare... embrace them. Kingsolver not only displays a portrait of these people but allows me to step into their world:\\"The usual bypasser is woman sauntering slowly down the road with bundles balanced on her head. These women are pillars of wonder, defying gravity while wearing the hohum aspect of perfect tedium. They can sit, stand, talk, shake a stick at a drunk man, reach around their backs to fetch forth a baby to nurse, all without dropping their piled-high bundles. They are like ballet dancers entirely unaware they are on a stage. I cannot take my eyes from them.\\"I need to issue a warning, to be fair to those who are only seeking a tourist's adventure in this voyage, that Kingsolver's reality is the painful, sometimes unforgiving, clash between different worlds, cultures, and religious beliefs. As an American born and raised, and a Christian by belief, my heart was torn in a deep and mysterious way as I found myself relating to both sides of the battle and in some instances even turning from the people I claim as my own to embrace the needs and truth of the unfamiliar. This journey left me searching for balance. It also left me with an understanding that when people are forceful and aggressive, imposing personal beliefs upon a culture, a people, and a way of life they do not understand, they unknowingly abort any chance of bringing a positive impact to that place. Kingsolver focuses sympathy on the African woman, not on the missionary in this passage:\\"Then he stopped, just froze perfectly still. With one of his huge hands he reached out to the congregation, pulling them in. With the other he pointed at a woman near the fire. Her big long breasts lay flat on her chest like they'd been pressed down with an iron, but she did seem heedless of it. She was toting a long-legged child all straddly on her hip, and with her free hand was scratching at her short hair. She looked around nervously, for every pair of eyes in the place had followed Father's accusing gaze straight to her nakedness.\\"More than ever, I am stirred through The Poisonwood Bible to realize that appreciation, compassion, and love are the very gifts that will build the bridge between different worlds, peoples, and beliefs. As these gifts are presented and exchanged, both worlds can be stronger. Kingsolver brings us not only food for thought, but a feast for the mind, heart, and soul. It is up to voyager if he will pull up a chair and eat or bypass a chance to be changed."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"American World War II veteran Nathan Pierce, a fire-and-brimstone preacher and tyrannical parent and husband, decides to take his family on a mission to the Congo on the eve of that country's independence from Belgium. His teenage daughters and his wife are less than enthusiastic.The book takes us from the Pierce's initial landing in the Congo to the girls' adulthood. Each daughter takes a very different path. None of the five Pierce women are unaffected or even necessarily whole after the mission. Their lives and their ideals are changed profoundly by their experiences.The oldest daughter, Rachel, turns fifteen at the beginning of the mission. Her mind is fully absorbed with boys, clothes, makeup, and the other typical interests of a middle-class American teenage girl in 1959. Of course, without running water or even recognizable food in the heart of the Congo, lipstick and school dances are unequivocally out of the question. She counts the days until she can leave.The twins, Adah and Leah, are thirteen when the mission begins. Leah adores her father and has decided to make the best of the situation. She shadows him and ultimately becomes the truest missionary in the family, although not in a religious sense. Mute Adah, who due to a birth defect sees herself as so different as sometimes not even as a part of the world, is brilliant, creative, and critical of her fanatical father.Ruth May, the baby of the family, is along for the ride but unexpectedly comes to \\"move the cheese\\" for her mother, who is probably looking for it in another place anyway. The girls' mother, Orleanna, is trapped in her marriage and in the Congo, subject to the whims and passions of her unbalanced husband and the demands of giving her daughters a sense of \\"normalcy\\" in spite of the bizarre events and primitive living conditions she encounters in Africa.Political transition swirls around the family, touching them in ways that they cannot even imagine in the beginning. The interplay between the various members of the Pierce family and the Congolese comes to define the women and their destinies. Their reactions to the depredations and horror they survive further defines them and breathes life into them.The book is told in the voices of the five female Pierces. Each voice is unique. The individual characters are well-developed and consistent. Adah's voice is deep, rich and poetic, even giving us insight to her insights at the end when she rereads her childhood diary entries. Rachel is predictable in her shallow, materialistic way. That predictability is, in my humble opinion, a necessary aspect of her character. She is consistently egocentric and the most like her father. Leah is open and accepting and giving and loving. She comes to see her white skin as a disgrace to be overcome in light of the abuses of colonial and foreign powers. At five, Ruth May is the funniest and also the canniest. The mother, Orleanna, is the saddest and weakest of the women. Her character development is also the weakest, but I think that is more because the book is really about the older daughters and their father, not about Orleanna. Orleanna has an important role but is not a primary protagonist.We cry for Orleanna, we rant against Nathan's unfairness, we pound the cover of the book at how dense Nathan's skull is. We limp in resignation and terror with Adah and we admire her wordplay and philosophy. We approve of Leah's integrity. We long to stroke Ruth May's fevered forehead when she falls ill with malaria. We believe Nathan is not the brightest light in the night sky despite his intentions of bringing \\"Christian truth\\" to the natives of Africa. We snicker when we realize that he calls Jesus a poisonwood tree in each and every church service he holds -- not intentionally but because he either cannot or does not attempt to master his command of the local language.Nathan's bullheaded wrongness reverberates throughout the book. He is not sympathetic to the native way of life in the jungle. He is told that the villagers won't go to the river for baptism because crocodiles have eaten native children who have gotten too close to the water, yet he maintains a dream of river baptism as the only real way to save all of those African souls. He never learns the language of the people he has chosen to live among. He dominates his family physically, mentally and emotionally. To punish his three older daughters, he is fond of \\"Giving the Verse,\\" or citing a verse of the Bible and requiring the girls to count back from it 100 verses, then write them all. His intention is to get them to understand where their thinking is wrong. Especially with Adah, though, his plan backfires. Nathan Pierce's children and wife are afraid of him. Eventually they are scornful of him.As independence threatens, the Pierces are advised to leave the Congo. Violence and even war are expected by those who know the region and its politics. Nathan stubbornly refuses to go despite pleas from his wife and daughters. When the Republic of Zaire is born the Pierce family is trapped in their mission by assassinations, rebel guerillas, hunger, poverty, and Nathan's inexhaustable missionary zeal. The futures of the five Pierce women are impacted more by Nathan's refusal to leave than by the decision to go to the Congo in the first place.The only thing missing from the book is how the father's voice might have sounded. I would like to have seen him live through his own symbolic Getting of The Verse and hear his (probably psychotic) reaction to it -- although Adah's references to \\"Our Father,\\" Leah's descriptions, and the conversations and insights of all of the girls and Orleanna give us a great deal of insight into the workings of his warped and stubborn mind. Like Rachel, Nathan would not have been able to shift his paradigm to accommodate the alien nature of that small village in the Congo. He was not capable of empathy with the objects of his mission.The Poisonwood Bible is beautifully written. Adah's voice is my favorite. She is brilliant, unlike her older sister Rachel who is shallow and somewhat stupid. She is the antithesis of her father. She has the best sense of the irony of the family's situation and the best understanding of the way the minds of the others work.Kingsolver's own brilliance as a writer comes through in this book, which is meticulously researched. She uses four languages to explain her characters and their points of view, and uses them beautifully. The history she recalls is not the dry stuff of textbooks but the living hardships and uncertainties of the people affected by it. History is incidental to the story, but the political and social atmosphere of the time and place are essential to it.I highly recommend this book to anyone, male or female. Despite being told by women, this is a book about a time and a place and a society. Those of us of Western European heritage will realize how little we appreciate or even know about the Dark Continent when we read this masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"at first, i had trouble getting into the book, being a southerner, i found the dialect (which mostly consisted of throwing in southern-esque phrases in very un-southern ways) a little off, especially in the little girl, Ruth May's, case and the eldest daughter, Rachel. but i found that the farther into the book, the less obvious and the book became stunning.through the entire first two thirds of the book i was enthralled. it was captivating and breathtaking and very well written. it was realistic and believable, which i appreciate.but then towards the end, after the exodus from africa and the father, the book seemed to lose focus. where before it had been riveting because the characters were struggling with life and death while trying to find out who they were and how their father's extremism affected them, now it seemed to veer off. the last part was interesting and thought-provoking, but seemed to be tying up loose ends that didn't particularly need to be tied up. the characters changed in ways that were infathomable and unnecessary.but i will say that, just for the beauty of the language and the force of conviction, this book is definitely worth a good reading or two."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is one of the most interesting books I have ever read. It really caused me to think about how different life can and is in other parts of the world. It also reminded me that happiness does not lie in god, your possessions, or even where you live, but happiness comes from within. When we help other countries, we need to look at what they need and not what WE want to give. It was one that I could not put down. I recommend it to everyone who loves to read, male or female. No one has been disappointed yet!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This story wonderfully demonstrates how misguided the best intentions are. Faith is a wonderful thing and it's shown how it's best served. External pressure for faith is examined with its unexpected results. The depth of faith is also shown in the main characters. I loved how each told their story from their perspective. Don't let your faith, or lack of, prevent learning from the many aspects of this book. The views and actions of this Country are also brought to light. While the ending seemed a bit too long, this book comes highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Kingsolver has written a true masterpiece. It is part history, part novel, part sociological study, a large part poetry - and all of it is saturated in a truth that is too seldom spoken. All of the viewpoints presented (the mother's and each of the daughters') ring true, and one wonders how one author's mind could have entered so convincingly into each of those beings. Kingsolver's great understanding of Africa in general - and specifically the Congo - puts all other studies in the shade. I feel my own understanding is greatly enlarged for having read it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"From one who has been there and done that, (My parents were Missionaries to Congo.) I can attest that Ms. Kingsolver has done her homework and put human faces on the global issue of neo - economic colonialism. and done it very well. I could not put the book down."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I just finished reading this book a few weeks ago and thought that it was interesting and educating, but could cause me to become bored more than a few times. It seemed as if nothing was going to come to somewhat of a resolution. It was great in the fact that it really got me fired up because their father was such a nut and that angered me that someone could be that passionate about their work, and create such chaos in the family at the same time. I would recommend it simply because of the knowledge you gain about the situations in Africa in the time of the story. I also like the level of character development. You become one with the girls and their mother."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"An incredible read: the kind of book you hope to pick up, but rarely do. A book to read slowly, to relish the wonderful language and insights. A book you don't want to end, that stays with you, so you want to get back to it to see where it is going, to be with the wonderful participants in the story. It rings so true. The unusually accurate voice of childhood, of thoughts and feelings long forgotten. It brought me insights into some of my own feelings and beliefs, in addition to a marvelous portral of Africa.I've read it flat on my back, recovering from surgery. It totally carried me away from my own pains, except when it moved me to laugh so hard my raw stitches hurt."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Luminous prose. Thought-provoking without being preachy. Never loses sight of the forward momentum of its very compelling narrative. Places Kingsolver in the company of Roth, Delillo, McCarthy, hell, maybe even Faulkner...(Acid test: Can she pull it off again?)"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"My daughter turned me onto the book by saying it was the best book she had read in years. We don't normally share the same taste in books, but I tried it because I had loved Animal Dreams, the only other book I've read of Ms. Kingsolver's. I absolutely loved Poisonwood. It did what a book is supposed to do; it made me want to know more about the subject matter. I found my thoughts returning to the book for days after finishing it. The voices were an engaging and unique way of telling the story. I have a new respect for Barbara Kingsolver's writing, though I don't know how she will top this one."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I was so pleased with &quot;Poinsonwood&quot;. I have read all her other books and can't remember their plots, but this one will be unforgettable, I know. I wasn't able to identify with any of the characters exactly, but I guess most women are somewhere between Leah and Rachel. I liked Rachel best, but thought she would have been a completely different person had she been able to have children so I forgave a lot of her selfishness. I really liked the commentary on motherhood, by the way, which was a very important theme in this book, I felt. I know it has been in all her books, but it seemed to stand out more in this book. I'm going to recommend this book for my bookclub.I have appreciated reading those reviews of people who have lived in the Congo. I hope to see more of them forthcoming."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Thank you Ms. Kingsolver for a moving experience. I know this is just a novel, but I was so moved by the characters and the country and the beauty of the writing, that I won't soon forget the Price family or their African experience. I kept calling my sister long-distance to read her something I just couldn't wait to share."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Kingsolver is ambitious in undertaking a novel of such depth and scope. This book, however, fails to live up to the high expectations I've set for her work. The last hundred pages drag and the interesting tale is lost somewhere along the way."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Kingsolver's latest novel, I feel, is destined to be referred to as a classic. The story, character development and beautiful use of language makes this my favorite novel ever. I've recommended it to many friends who have been equally impressed."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Kingsolver's most powerful and memorable book to date, THE POISONWOOD BIBLE is multi-faceted: intricate layers become a pattern of endurance and survival in a harsh and demanding land. The missionary family of parents and four daughters undertake to bring their Christian message to the Congo. A land that demands respect, Africa is nothing they could ever have imagined. The father becomes ever more rigid in his beliefs, while the mother and daughters attempt to adjust to this environment and learn from it.The story is told primarily from the viewpoints of the four daughters as the inevitable tragedy unfolds, leaving the family stunned in its aftermath, as their time in Africa changes their lives forever. This tale is an indictment of the missionary hubris that disrespected generations grounded in their own history, the belief that the missionaries could bring &quot;The Word&quot; to &quot;savages&quot;. The brutality of everyday existence is juxtaposed with the incomparable beauty of nature and the stunning images of Kingsolver's phrasing: &quot;As long as I kept moving, my grief streamed out behind me like a swimmer's long hair in water&quot;.The only view we aren't told is Nathan's, he of the implacable judgment, stripped hard as stone by his belief in a righteous and angry God, one with no mercy. Nathan is ultimately destroyed by the blind faith of his beliefs, making idolatry of the very Word he wears like a crown, distorting truth to his own ego-driven ambition: the death of the spiritual self in the aggrandizement of ritual. In the end, &quot;Africa swallowed the conqueror's music and sang a new song of her own&quot;."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I was captivated throughout the book. I was sucked in by the vivid and powerful descriptions from the very first paragraph. Although I learned a great deal about African history, and tribal culture, I was most intrigued by the characters. I felt Kingsolver did a remarkable job of telling the story through five very believeable and different perspectives. I couldn't wait to get to the next chapter to find out what one of the other sisters would say. I would highly recommend this book to those who love to get lost in the wonder of an intimately told story about life's triumphs, tragedies, and surprises."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book, for me, was read for a book report, and I can honestly say, it was such a pleasure to read. Though a bit long for one my age, it was worth it. I admit, I ended up spending [dollar amount] for it, and that isn't something I would normally do, but this was quite worth it. I loved the shy, but quick Adah and how I could pretend to despise Rachel. The book has showed how people in general try so hard to hold on to what they are used to when they have to change. You, will be changed by this book as I was. She, Ms. Kingsolver, has become my favorite author even compared to the magical Ms. Rowling. Ms. Kingsolver shows a great amount of diversity in the Price family and shows how people will grow. It was a pleasure to watch that family grow, despite the fact they do not exist. I was captured by the book and thrown into the Congo with that family. I ran from the ants with them; defended myself from diseases; attempted to tolerate Rachel; and pulled through a mental and physical sense of self with Adah. Leah learned to let go, and Ruth May to always stay happy, but most of all, I learned from Orleanna how you can be crushed under someone else's wishes, and not even notice; and from Nathan, not to ever forget your family, because they won't always be there. Please read this book. I learned as much as you will. I treasure it always."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"In my mind, the \\"Poisonwood Bible\\" is probably Barbara Kingsolver's best work. It's a lot deeper than her other literary accomplishments, and it manages to wrap a generally good theme around a half-way decent plot.On the same note, however, that theme is especially tainted. The reader should realize the Kingsolver never visited the Congo and could not fully grasp life under Mobutu's dictatorship, on which she becomes exceedingly vocal. If you intend to read the book, do not read it to get a better insight on African tribalism and political nature, for you will only come away with a Super-PC viewpoint of anti-Western interventionism. Kingsolver fails to incorporate the many successes of Western intervention in Africa, especially in the modern-day context, and even portrays many missionary organizations that were particularily helpful in immunizing children in Africa as \\"agents of the West.\\"Understandably, it is not possible for a fiction book such as this of an \\"Oprah's Book Club\\" caliber to sensibly endeavor in Africa's political system. Although some of her descriptions are justifiably legitimate, her own agenda toward non-intervention is increasingly clear throughout the novel. ..."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Meet the Prices from Bethlehem, Georgia and of Kilanga, Congo. They are a family of 6- Nathan Price is the Father with a mission. Literally. Reverend Price is a preacher with one goal in mind. To save the Congolese from eternal damnation. Preaching fire and brimstone, he is willing to risk just about everything to baptize the local people in the little village of Kilanga in Congo. And he is willing to risk his family and just about everything precious to him to do that. In the process, alienating him from everyone in town, including his own family- and changing their lives forever. But this book isn't told by him. This book isn't about him. Their tragic story is told by Orleanna Price, Nathan's wife and the four daughters- Rachel, Leah, Adah and Ruth May. In their feminine, maternal and sisterly view of their experience in Africa is different from each other as night and day. And their voices are just as different. They all tell of their broken family, tragic losses and new hopes. They unearth the pain that made them who they are in Africa. I loved Orleanna's regretful and aching voice, Leah's poignant and soulful heart, Adah's eclectic thoughts (forwards and backwards) and Rachel's ... well, Rachel is Rachel. And Ruth May's childlike innocence and playfulness in her part of the story. And in the backdrop is the turbulent civil unrest and Congo's fight for their independence that always seemed to be looming in everyone's narration. And through them, I learned more about the Congo independence than I ever did in World History 101. Barbara Kingsolver's writing is amazing and unforgettable. It's magical and powerful the way she is able to weave in 4 different points of views into one book and make them all flow into one novel. It was just perfect.Although, most of the story takes place in Congo with strange sounding names and places... I felt like I was right there. Amidst the strange smells, the poverty stricken shanty neighborhoods and the life of Africa. The Prices are the main characters that reach out to you in such deep and provocative ways. But secondary characters like Nelson, Pascal, Chief Ndo and even Methusalah also stand out and make their mark, too. It's been a while since an Oprah's Pick moved me to tears. I am recommending this book to everyone I know."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"In the Poisonwood Bible Kingsolver has written a many-layered, multiple-themed novel of family relationships. A missionary family leaves mid-America during the '60s and moves to the Congo, with unexpected results. The novel speaks with the voices of the women involved, the mother Orleanna, and her three daughters; Leah, Rachel, and Adah. Kingsolver ably gives voice to each of these women, and shows how each views their experience and the man in their lives (the preacher father, Nathan) differently.The book takes a bit of determination to read, but rewards same with depth of characterization and plot. We follow the various family members over some 30 years of their lives, from the US to the Congo, and back again. Each woman reacts differently to the experience of living in Africa, some reach out and embrace the country and its people, some reject the experience and strive to remain the American girls they once were. The process is fascinating to watch, and it is easy to identify with the characters.The book does bog down a bit from place to place, but by the time it does you're hooked and so slog on to the finish. It's not mind-candy, but it is a rewarding read."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I agree with others who feel that it was a tough read at times and there were problems with the dialogue. I must also add that the ultimate outcome of each daughter seemed trite, and almost predictable. Despite these flaws, I had a hard time putting the book down. Something within the writing kept me going back.Having been brought up in a Catholic household, I can certainly relate to the fictional family unit. Certainly not to that extent, but I can very closesly identify with each facet of the family. Kingsolver brilliantly captured the struggle of a woman torn between the relationships with her husband and children. The subtly in which she addresses the mother's ultimate decision to turn her back on her own faith by turning her back on her husband moved me to tears.It is that which made me find this the perfect Mother's Day gift. I have yet to read a more complex, haunting, and moving account of the relationship between a mother and her family."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I had to read this book for a class in college. It was a performance class where one studied the literature of or about a particular culture, became immersed, then chose a passage to perform for the class. This book lent itself incredibly well to performance. The swift, abrupt switches between characters provided for a more compact and intensified emotional subtext to bleed through in performance.When i read this book for class, I read it in 2 days. I couldn't put it down. I carried it everywhere with me. I found my heart racing as tensions within the family and within the country came to a head. The aftermath, so beautifully depicted (especially in Orleanna's monologues) is almost as affecting as the events leading up to the deluge. Sure, the politics can be a bit ridiculous at times, but I really didn't care.My favorite character, Adah, whom I chose to portray in my final performance, is such a rich, complex tangle of emotional threads, which keep getting broken and mended till they are too strong with their own scar tissue to be broken. Few characters have shattered me like she does.Read this book. It will affect you. I promise."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"A review from the author of DREAMING YOUR REAL SELF: A PERSONAL APPROACH TO DREAM INTERPRETATION; and DREAM BACK YOUR LIFE: A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO DREAMS, DAYDREAMS, AND FANTASIES.I read a lot, but very little fiction. Because so many people who know me well recommended this book, I decided to give it a shot. Once I started it, I didn't want to stop reading. The voices of these characters, their individual development, and the human tragedies brought about by human arrogance haunt me. I find myself thinking about this book and its structure repeatedly. Since my first reading, I've read through all of Kingsolver's other books and this one is her masterpiece (so far). Encompassing environmental and social issues as well as the lives of her individual characters, this book forces us to confront our own defects of character and the consequences blind choices. Having read this book once for story, I plan to read it again for craft. One of the few novels I would call \\"a must read.\\" Multi-layered and challenging."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I am so enamored of this book and have only read the first half. I am afraid to lose these characters and dread what must come next. I grew up in a missionary environment in Asia and knew many first and second generation missionaries from Africa as well. I howled through the Price family's preparations to go to the Congo, their wonderfully funny mistakes in habit and custom. In addition to her wonderful prose, Kingsolver delivers the goods like someone who has been through it all. I know...I've been there and done it! My childhood memories thank her and my adult appreciation of literature has been given a gift."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I loved this book, and spent many moments laughing out loud as I read it. The book tells the story of a Baptist preacher, Nathan Price, who moves his family (wife and four daughters) from the South to the Congo in 1959. The story is told by Orleanna (the wife) and her four daughters, and each woman's voice gives you new insight into their lives.Nathan Price is a committed but arrogant and narrow-minded preacher, and a lot of the humor in this book comes from watching the cultural disconnect between his view of what he is doing and the villagers' view of what he is doing. They don't completely understand him or his goals, and as a result, a lot of his efforts go for naught. A good example - Price spends a lot of time trying to get all the villagers baptized in the river near the village, not realizing that most villagers are afraid of the river because one of the local children was killed there by a crocodile. As time goes by, Price's wife and daughters involve themselves in village life and become more disillusioned with him.I enjoyed the fact that the story is told from the perspective of five different people, and also enjoyed learning about the political conflict in the Congo from the perspective of the people in one village. This book is engrossing, funny & incredibly well-written; it may take a little bit of time to get into, but is well worth it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Considering I was forced to read this book for school, I give my high rating a hightened significance. I have repeatedly loathed reading assigned books but this was a pleasant interruption in the cycle of \\"classics.\\" Don't read the summaries of the book. The story can be about whatever you want it to be. I must concede that this is a chic book, although males with sophisticated taste for literature may appreciate this masterpiece. Overall, it is a smooth read to pass an afternoon while actually pondering real life issues in our tumultuous world."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I've read reviews complaining that this book is Anti-american and pro-communist- how completely wrong! The Price family journeyed to the Congo to \\"save souls\\"- as a non-Christian, I find that entire mindset to be belittling to the people who were perfectly happy before the missionaries came. Instead, I see that Reverend Price marched into a culture about which he knew nothing, tried to force the people to his ways with a rigid, unbending attitude- and worse, endangering his wife and children by doing it.I read this book more than a year ago but some things have stayed with me- the swarm of ants was horrendous, the blind attitude of the missionary dreadful, his treatment of everyone, including a bird was unforgiveable. The strength the girls showed after their father's dissappearance was, to my reading, phenomenal. Each life took a vastly different path, but each person was true to her personality.Anti-American? No- clear on understanding that Americans and US policies are not always good for the people, the US or other nations. Pro-communist- sheesh- that's a silly thought. Africa has been so torn apart since the first white imperialists arrived that each nation struggles to return to a good life for their people- I can't call that Evil Communism."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver's masterpiece tells the story of the Price family from the time they journeyed as missionaries to the Congo in the late-50s when it was a Belgian colony until modern times.The story is told mainly through the eyes of the Price daughters as they deal with their authoritarian and zealous father in their own ways. One daughter is embroiled with teenage concerns and tries her best to evade her father's authority and live a normal teen's life. One daughter tries to follow every one of her father's rules and berates herself for failing to live up to her father's ideal. One has retreated into muteness in order to build her own world outside of her family. And the baby daughter acts as a baby daughter everywhere.Of course, the family's various troubles are all magnified hundreds of times by the trip to the wilds of the Congo, something with which they have no capacity to deal because of their sheltered upbringing. The mother narrates section breaks from the present day--hauntingly foreshadowing the troubles that will befall the country.Needless to say, this brings on disaster. Disaster is compounded as the Congo goes up in flames with independence and CIA and KGB intrigue. The story takes a turn for the worse at this point as Kingsolver blames the U.S. for destroying the Congo without looking at the fact that the Soviet Union was also trying to use the newly-independent African states as pawns in the Cold War and would happily have destabilized a staunchly pro-Western government and that European colonialism in Africa, the arbitrary nation lines, and the sudden thrust of these colonies into independence and the modern world doomed many of them to failure no matter what.Nevertheless, the book is a must read. The writing is beautiful. The disasters that strike the Price family are dramatic and shocking. The girls' attempts to rise up after the disasters are heartbreaking.I strongly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver's The Poisonwood Bible is the most rich, moving and powerful book I have read this year. The Reverend Nathan Price is a Baptist minister from Georgia. In 1959, he decides that there is no better place to sow the seeds of Christianity than the Congo. He packs up his wife and four daughters, and they leave the segregated South for the Congolese jungles. But like the garden seeds Reverend Price brings with him, the jungle is an inhospitable place for both American vegetables and Christianity. Rather than adapt and adjust, Price becomes even more stubborn and arrogant in his determination to bend the Congo to his ways.The key to this story is Price's wife and four daughters, and each chapter is told through their eyes and each with their own voice. The women are left to make most of the preparations for their trip, and they quickly learn that almost everything that they have packed is useless in the jungle. But unlike the rigid Price, they learn to adjust in order to survive. They are able to develop an appreciation for the beauty of the Congo. They also make connections with the locals that the Reverend finds elusive. In doing these things, they come to realize that the self-absorbed, unbending and all-knowing Price might not have all the answers after all.What makes this story even more fascinating is the political events that were happening in the Congo at this time. The Congo was first a colony of Belgium, and whites exploited the Congolese for diamonds, rubber and cobalt. In the middle of their stay, the Belgians give the Congo their independence, and things get very ugly as different groups struggle for control. Even the American government gets involved in some very unsavory shenanigans in trying to influence the outcome. It becomes a dangerous time for the Price family, and their very survival is at stake.The daughter's stories are lyrical and poignant, and their time in the Congo will affect each of the Price women in different ways--even long after they're gone. Kingsolver's spellbinding words and memorable characters will also touch your heart and leave you thinking about this book long after you're done."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"You will need to be open-minded and have at least a bit of knowledge or appreciation, or willingness to learn about Africa, colonialism, international politics or all of the above in order to truly appreciate this book. You also have to be willing to open your mind to the idea that the world is not as it seems and the U.S. is not necessarily the righteous place that most Americans would like to think it is. As an American student studying international politics abroad, I was able to truly appreciate and enjoy this book because the author provides many powerful stories and quite simply has a wonderful and unique understanding and appreciation of the world around us. It is apparent that Kingsolver is very aware of the history of Africa and how their history is so tied and has been so shaped by the economics and politics of imperialist nations (including the U.S.) and knows how misinformed, blind, or simply arrogant American and other world leaders have, and currently are, devastating nations around the world such as Africa. I hope that everyone will give this book a chance because without being didactic it certainly is an extraordinary piece of literature which has a story to tell and a lesson to get across. If you allow it, this book is can be as thought provoking and as unconventional as Adah, as politically and socially aware as Leah, and as objective and passionate as Ruth May. Or, if you fail to open your mind and at least give the points that the author brings across in this book a chance, reading this book could be as dull as Rachael, who carves out a life for herself and never allows her mind to see the world in the same ways as her sisters do and lives out her life in a bubble of ignorance and vanity. Overall, it's a fantastic read, but some background knowledge is recommended and certainly an open mind and willingness to give new ways of seeing things a chance is necessary for the full understanding and appreciation of this work of art."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I had to read this book for an AP English class, and seeing its length, I was honestly not looking forward to it. 500+ pages all intertwined with an African history lesson didn't sound too intriguing. But once I started, I could not put this book down. With some late nights thrown in, I finished this book in a little over two days.Some people might not be too keen on a 16-year-old's opinion, but I thought this book had both a fascinating subject and a beautiful style. I had known vaguely of what happened in the Congo with Lumumba, Mobutu, etc., but the details Kingsolver weaved into her story (with a good deal of political commentary, of course) made me almost sick. One of the themes of the book was the impossiblity of transforming a people's culture into one that may work elsewhere, shown both through the failure of the Baptist missionary work and in that of the Belgian and American attempts to mold the Congo into a perfect, Western culture.But it wasn't only the message that made the book enjoyable. The format and style were captivating as well. A reviewer above didn't like the way Kingsolver switched between the five narrators, but I thought it brought a whole new level to the story, actually getting inside each of their heads rather than having an impartial third party or a sole narrator speculating as to others' thoughts. Plus, the book is formatted using books of the King James Bible (Genesis, Exodus, etc). The title isn't fully explained until Adah's last chapter, but it is another great touch to an already great book. I recommend this book wholeheartedly. It sure takes a lot to actually make summer reading enjoyable. . ."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Little did I realise when I purchased it, The Poisonwood Bible is actually two novels. The first two-thirds is a story about a missionary and his family's life in the wilds of Belgian congo, while the remaining third is basically a post-mortem of this experience. Did I receive a bargain for getting two books for the price of one?The life of the missionary and his family (wife and four daughters) in Belgian Congo is told as an interwoven narrative by all family members with the notable exception of the father. It seems the entire family is subjected to poverty, famine, and disease whilst the old man tries, in vain, to convert the heathen natives to Christianity. This somewhat predictable story is surprisingly engrossing, perhaps due to the author's compassionate feelings towards the hapless-yet-happy natives. Although Kingsolver overdoes the pathos a bit especially in the end, I thought this first two-thirds of The Poisonwood Bible was very enjoyable.The remaining third of The Poisonwood Bible is basically the post-Belgian Congo experience narrative, again told by family members sans papa. The author crams in 30+ years of modern sub-Saharan political history into 170 pages. And this history lesson is extremely skewed by anti-American sentiment (..although undoubtedly some of this is justified). While initially quite interesting, the final 100 pages is very slow reading - as if the author simply didn't know how to end the book.Bottom line: a uneven account of one American family coping with the wilds of the Congo. Worth reading for the 'first novel', with the final 170 pages being best left unread."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I thought this was an excellent, thought-provoking book. Those who want to view our country's foreign policy through rose-colored glasses will certainly object to it, and the reviewer who thought children should have been more &quot;grammatically correct&quot; missed the point...Kingsolver's style of telling her story through five pairs of eyes added greatly to the interest and insight she provided into a part of the world with which few of us are familiar. This was one of the most disturbing and meaningful books I've read, particularly at this time in our nation's history."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"As a high school student, I don't often finish books in under several weeks -- too much work. But with Poisonwood Bible, there was no way I was going to put it down. Every second of free time I had I was completely engrossed in it. Even when I finished, I kept going back to parts I had really enjoyed and rereading them.The novel is written in style a bit like Faulkner's -- eveyone has their own bit to narrate and a different way of telling their bit of the story (although I liked Poisonwood Bible much better than As I Lay Dying). The characters are vibrant and alive, each with a very distinct personality. The writing is beautiful; I found myslef quite often reading a passage (or even a chapter) multiple times just to savor the words.The story follows the lives of each member in the Price family through their experiences as missionaries in a small town in revolutionary Congo. The narrative bits are told by 4 daughters of an evangelical Baptist preacher; his wife introduces each &quot;book of the bible&quot; with a flashback that vaguely tells what the next section is about, but only enough to make you insanely curious as to what she's talking about. The youngest daughter, about 5 when the book starts, has a distinct little-girl way of talking, mistaking much of what is told to her in ways so ludicrous I found myself laughing out loud, which I rarely do when reading. The oldest, Rachel, is about 15 at the beginning and would much rather be home in Georgia going to parties and reading beauty magazines. She the brightest member of the family, often using wrong words in sentences that have a double meaning: explaining the difference between society in Africa and America, she emphasizes that &quot;we have our own system of marriage - it's called monotony.&quot; Her antics, while sometimes painfully pretentious, are amusing. Adah and Leah are identical twins - or supposed to be. Leah is strong and active, while Adah is paralyzed on one side of her body. Both are extremely bright, but use their intelligence in completely different ways. I found myself agreeing with both of them, even though sometimes they had completely opposite opinions on something. Leah was a fun and thought-provoking character. I learned most about politics from her, and enjoyed it. And I'm not much of politics enthusiast. Adah was my favorite character; her thinking, while not traditionally intelligent, was unusual and intriguing. She created palindromes right and left, read books backwards when she finished reading them foreward, was a huge fan of Miss Emily Dickinson (No snikcidy lime, backwards), and left me more enthusiastic about poetry than I usually am.I loved these characters by the end and hated to put the book down. But at the same time, I wanted to tell everyone I knew about it, wanted everyone to read it. When I gave it to my best friend, her reaction was the same as mine. &quot;Didi, I finished the book! Ack! What am I going to do now? I think I'll read it again.&quot; In fact, maybe writing a review for it wasn't such a great idea; I wouldn't mind reading it over instead of working on homework. I could read this book any number of times and not get sick of it. Each time, there is something new to discover and more to understand."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I enjoyed this epic so much; I read it twice and very well may read it again. I must admit that the first time I picked up Poisonwood Bible I was interrupted a few times and couldn't keep straight all the voices. (Kingsolver tells the tale of a missionary family's experience in the in the mid-20th century Congo in five voices: a mother, and her four daughters.) But once these colorfully drawn characters embedded themselves into my mind, it was to hell with the interruptions! Each character is unique and propels the story forward--the history of the village and the country's fight for independence unfolds. I couldn't put it down. Kingsolver is a master at her craft and this effort ranks in my favorite top-ten books of all time. I can't think of a higher recommendation than that.Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"As in many of her works, Ms. Kingsolver displays a descriptive gift that seems to blend scientific examination and poetic exploration of her subject; in this case, this includes the family, the village, the Congo, and the continent.The different members of the family seem to pretty well represent a cross-section of westerners reactions to living in Africa, with each member being well-developed (or as developed as possible), and, even as a westerner who lived in Africa for over a year, I learned quite a bit about African history.Ms. Kingsolver does not make any real mystery of her ideologic leanings, but the book is not meant to be a documentary; none of her books hide her views on politics, life, and people. Even in the rare instance in which I don't agree with her, her views are certainly thought-provoking, and her writing is always fantastic."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Many others have summed the book up better than I could, so I'll just say that this is absolutely the best book I've read all year. Beautifully written, haunting and unforgettable."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I don't read that much fiction, but still, I was very, very impressed. I usually read nonfiction because there is so much I need to learn about the world; (ha) I can't imagine any other book about the Belgian Congo that would have held my interest for over 500 pages. As an ex-pat I can marvel at how seamlessly Kingsolver manages the transition from disgust to everything native to assimilation. And she just writes so well! The village part is the best; after the dispersal of the family I grew tired of Leah (Kingsolver) despising whiteness, and imagining a prewhite, iddylic Africa. Being totally ignorant of Africa, however, I was horrified to read about the CIA and Mobutu and want to find out more now. Another all-to often repeating thing is the family members (except of course for the unfeeling Rachel) carrying around the wounds of their own pasts. Must they remain victims?! On the other hand, she presents the idea that we are all the products of previous generations in a way that's hard to dismiss. There are some big ideas in the book that I'm still chewing on, and I'll never think about Africa the same way again. And I just have to say again, man, can she write!!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"After reading &quot;I dreamed of Africa&quot; I became interesting in more books about Africa. So I picked this one up, and it was an amazing read.The story is told by four daughters and the mother in the Price Family. Their father/husband, is a Baptist minister, who brings the family to the Congo during a tumeltous time in history.The opening offers a foreshadowing of events to come, and when we reach the end, the meaning of it is quite clear. Africa is alive, and can bring the inhabitants to its mercy.The Price family suffer hardship in the Congo, as missionaries trying to bring Christianity to the small village in which the live. The villagers look upon them with curiousity and wonder, and are not intersted in the regilous message they bring.Kingsolver's words brought the Congo alive for me, that I could almost breathe the air. This is an enriching story, and I hope to read future books by Kingsolver."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I had been avoiding picking up this book for a long time, because I tend to shy away from the Oprah choices, because I always thought the book club was gimicky. Several of my friends, though, continued to recommend it to me, and I thought there must be something to their choice if this title kept coming up over and over again.On a broader scale it is the history of Africa over 30 years, and even if you aren't interested in the history of Africa, or even history at all, you can't help but find yourself drawn in because you see the effects that all the political goings on has on Africa's people.On a smaller scale, it is the story of the Price family, missionaries from Georgia landed in a small, remote African village. Nathan Price is a vehement, hard headed minister, bent on saving all of Africa with traditional values and traditional messages. Orleanna, the mother, Rachel, the vain, ill-tempered teenager, Leah and Adah, the genius twins, and Ruth May join him in the new land, and each of the 'chapters' is told from one of their unique perspectives.This book is so beautiful, and learning about life in Africa from each of these different characters is absolutely riveting. I stayed on way too late 2 nights in a row to finish this book, but it was absolutely worth it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Admittedly, I love reading novelists who incorporate real history into their stories. This story of a Missionary's family who goes into the Belgian Congo to spread the Word - told from the various points of view of the women in the family - how they deal with their journey and how it affects their lives after leaving the village is an incredible tale of survival, insanity and a culture that is so very different from our own. Worth every page it is written on!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I was fascinated by this book, except for the last 100 pages or so, which I found miserably boring in comparison with what had come before. It was interesting to find out what happened to the women after leaving the jungle, but did we really need to go into that much detail about it? I found myself losing interest very quickly...other than that, however, the novel was engrossing and suspenseful. I found all of the characters, especially the four daughters, to be well-written and psychologically realistic (I found myself loving Adah, hating Rachel, annoyed/charmed by Ruth May, and ambiguous about Leah...) However, I would have enjoyed hearing some of the story told from Nathan's point of view. I felt that, as it is now, the novel seems overly \\"feminist\\" in that it is told by five women, all of whom feel persecuted by the main male character in the novel. Although I dislike Nathan and do not sympathize with him, I think that allowing him to tell his side of the story would have made him seem more of a realistic, three-dimensional character and would also have strengthened the book as a whole."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I really liked this book... just finished it last night. I'm normally a Stephen King reader, and though King may keep me a little more riveted and make my heart pound a little harder, he's never educated me the way this book has. I learned so much about Africa and the Congo, and about just how easy it is to live in the first world. I never really imagined how hard it could be to actually live with nature, instead of on top of it.There's been complaints amongst reviewers that the book got too political or educational near the end, but I really appreciated that aspect of the novel.Great characters too... Rachel, Axelroot, Orleanna, Adah - they're all so memorable and loveable. I recommend this book!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"One of the few books that I have read latley that kept me interested from start to finish. Despite the frequent bible refrences, I didn't feel inindated with religious rhetoric or feel preached to. The story is easy to get lost in. I couldn't put the book down."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible was a good book which showed how religion can manipulate some people (The Father) I was fascinated by the way the girls portrayed their Father and Mother and how thier lives changed so significantly while living in Africa. This is a definate 'read' book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I have read all of Kingsolver's previous works, including her essays. This book pales in comparison. You knew where the characters and the story were going long before they got there. I wish I could say I enjoyed reading it. This is the first time I have ever put down one of her books without finishing it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"WOW! This is a beautiful book. I could read it several times and still not &quot;get&quot; all of the subtle wordplays and hidden meanings. I agree that towards the end it lost something; another reader said it should have ended with Ruth May's death and I agree. However, it WAS satisfying to know what happened to the characters after they left the Congo - how the experience of 17 months there changed their lives forever. (This would have been the case even if Ruth May hadn't died.) Overall, this was just a terrific read. Can't wait until Ms. Kingsolver writes another one."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"We read this book for July Group and I am shocked and amazed that it has been so popular. Being a person who is not that interested in the Congo and it's historical happenings, I was incredibly disappointed that that was what Kingsolver focused on most. I wanted more character developement, dialogue and interactions between the Price women and Nathan!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I took The Poisonwood Bible on vacation with me to Belize, the former British Honduras. Each day we ventured into the jungle to try to capture some of the original glory of Belizean nature and culture, and at night I read about the incidious influence of missionaries in destroying the diversity that was once existed in humanity and nature. I despise missionaries of every stripe (except medical ones without agendas) and thank Barbara Kingsolver for her rendition of this particular family's experiences. Fortunately, the Congo won in Nathan Price's case. Unfortunately, that is infrequently the case. It was gratifying to see each daughter grow into a life of her own, and to swab the lesions left by Christianity's poisonwood."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Kingsolver seems to have spent so much time attempting to force a narrative through the &quot;distinct&quot; subjective voices of the Price daughers that she winds up with a hollow and didactic story right out of african history 101 surrounded by frequently well-etched but fleshless character studies, rather than people. She leaves her readers without sufficient info to know what drives significant characters, such as Nathan, the prime mover of the novel's story who she's content to depict as a ranting pig-headed bullying wife-beating religion-ignorant bible thumper so familiar from every cliche of '60s southern white racism ever depicted. Even Orleanna, who is made an incoherent mouthpiece of the novel's so-called central message of colonialism, with woman/africa as the jointly colonized victim, merely seems to exist for this purpose. The daughters' voices are unconvincing as attempts to represent different psychological stages girlhood and are usually annoying reminders of the author's artifice. Overall, although there are some well-crafted and memorable scenes or turns of phrase, the book is a trudge to read, doesn't bring any insights into Zaire's stuggle for independence vis a via that of women, and is ultimately a waste of time."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The author seems to be entranced with her own voice. The book could have been much shorter with the assistance of a good editor. I hope that readers understand this is not the typical experience of missionaries in the field, but is exaggerated to suit the author's own agenda. Although the mother and daughters were distinctive in their characterization, I did not find them memorable or even particularly endearing. Rachel's cutesy malaprops became annoying after the first two or three, and Adah's miraculous regeneration seemed contrived. If this book is intended to be an indictment of the work of Christian missionaries, it has probably succeeded very well; but the reader should remember that it is still just a story of a howling mad father who brought his entire family to a place of almost certain death. One wonders why they stayed so long in the face of all the dangers and starvation? Why didn't they just get back on the plane and go home to Georgia? It is difficult to sympathize with fools. The political background is simply that--background for the story of the women, who are led by circumstance with the result that heroism eludes them. In all fairness, this book lacks the flaws in credibility that Kingsolver displays in previous books. But it still needed liposuction to get rid of the fat."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"In The Poisonwood Bible, Barbara Kingsolver demonstrates her ability create a setting and a feeling; in short, she has a true mastery of words. But The Poisonwood Bible just never pulled me in, and looking at other reviews, I can see that I'm in the minority on that note. Maybe I missed something. The story is about a family of missionaries (the parents and their four daughters) who travel to the Congo without a clue about the culture they've gone to live in for a year, and the expectation that it won't differ much from their home in the US. While there, the jungle and the culture and the politics of the Congo change the family, rather than the family causing the change they'd come to create.The way the story is developed is interesting, written much like a bible. Every event is told from the viewpoint of each of the five female characters, interesting, but for that reason, I found the book slow moving and slow to get to the point. It took until about halfway through the book for me to feel any pull to continue to the end, and when I got to the end, it was anticlimactic."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I loved almost every aspect of this books. The chracters made you feel and the story and setting was beautiful. I thought that the authoer did a great job in weaving this tale. Unlike others..I liked the mixing of the politics and thought it was fitting with the story.My only complaint was that sometimes the characters were too stagnant. Rachel for example did not grow from her experience at all....she was so self absorbed it was almost unbelieveable. That made thigns a bit too predictable.But overall an excellent tale. I just picked this book up on a whim, and I was not disappointed. I even reccomended it to many of my friends."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I am breaking my own rule of reviewing a book which I did not completely read, but I felt like going through 350 pages was enough to get the idea it wasn't going anywhere.My main criticism of the book is the lack of any attachment I received with the characters. After 300 pages, I really lost all care for this family trapped in the Congo. The author would reveal a possible plot line every few chapters only to extinguish it or not really tie it with what was going on.The characters I enjoyed the most, or thought were the most compelling, don't even appear often or become fleshed out. The father, good 'ol Reverend Price, is almost the apparent boogey man of the story; he is the source of all the troubles these women are facing. But the author leaves him so one-sided and flat by not letting him express his ideals or opinions or views of the situation.The girls, varying in age, are the ones the story is told through with some rare pages from Orleanna, the mother. The whole scope of the story is told through them, so the most compelling characters always have to be filtered through these different woman's points of view.Doesn't that sound like a pretty neat narrative trick? It does, if it was done right. The journal entries that we get from each woman within the family is contrived, forced, and not realistic. I felt like the author wanted to do the effect for fun, not really to add to the overall narrative.Overall this book wasn't compelling. The themes that were so ripe for the pickin' were just left out and never were engaged. The characters are all contrived and uninteresting except for a few moments, but there experiences hardly add to the overall arch of the whole book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Other people love this book and others say it's slow but stay with it. I got 170 pages in and found I was annoyed at the characters (what did they expect to find in Africa?) and didn't really care anymore about what happened.I know I'm one of the few who didn't like it but I didn't."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Lord, every cliche on earth is in this one. Ms. Kingsolver has grown too comfortable with her success. Blah, blah, blah; it just goes on forever about the mean ol' white Christian father, the morally superior female/black/downtrodden. Yes, we got the point! Now, Ms. K., please say something substantial about the African continent. This was a great topic that could have been done better. The obsequious nod to jailed murderer Mumia in her introduction should have tipped me off that I was in for some indoctrination.I have enjoyed some (not all) of Ms. K's past works. She does know how to do social preaching without dropping an anvil on her reader's head. But this book tried to appeal to the 17-year-old in us, horsewhipping the obvious until I fell asleep. Does she think her readers have gotten stupid? The only thing I really enjoyed was Rachel's sophomoric sarcasm, and even that got cloying after her third appearance.Put away the trite social commentary, Ms. K. You've been in the sun too long. This one's a stinker."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I enjoyed the book up to the point of leaving Africa. Once they had left the husband/father it seemed as if the book would never end. The story from the view of the daughters was good and even handed, however we are left would a few gaps: i.e. Did he actually die in Africa or is he still alive today in Africa?"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I admire Kingsolver's ambition in trying to write a mythic novel of Biblical scope. However, several problems interfere with its realization. First of all, separation of the narration into the five points of view isolates each character, minimizes action, and saps the story of energy. If the characters had a more unique vision or insights, it wouldn't be so bad. Also the novel suffers dramatically as the exposition is very lengthy and the denoument is 150 pages long! You would think that Independence would be a very dramatic event, but after a few hints of its coming, it arrives rather abruptly and the family is too concerned with its own dysfunction to notice much. The central scene of the snake bite is rendered very vaguely, not dramatically.Kingsolver tries to cover these narrative deficiencies with inventive language, but much of the time it is overwrought or gimmicky. The African setting is superficial with very little interaction between the missionaries and the natives. Put this together with a mythic structure that seems contrived and which peters out in the last half of the book along with stereotyped characters, and there isn't much left to maintain interest. Kingsolver reminds me of a straight A student who is smart enough to recognize that Rachel is very shallow, but doesn't see that Leah's tendency to see the world in black and white is just as bad. The author is very talented, but she needs to spend time with a good editor and she needs to temper her own righteousness just as she criticizes Nathan Price for his."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Kingsolver is committed to the cause of the downtrodden and 'unlistened' !! The mistakes made by missionaries all over the world are usually due to the sin of pride."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"And too wordy. And why would any wife go along with the hard life imposed on her family by an unhinged husband who is blinded by his religion? Some (I think few) missionaries had the right approach, balancing existing native beliefs with church teachings, this one didn't."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Grandson had to do a opening school day report on this book.. didn't realize it would take so long to receive it but the book came in good condition and he managed to get in done in the week he had."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"It was truly an interesting read as far as the \\"colorful\\" depiction of life in the Congo. The way she describes the way the people there have to live, made me feel as if I was stepping into the streets of the little village and walking around. Very good descriptions, even if as some reviewers suggest, not true. I absolutely hated the father in this book and thru out the book, I just wanted to shake the mother. Snap out of it lady - get your girls out of there! I can not imagine a Mom not protecting their children from famine and deadly wildlife. All in all, yes, I would recommend it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Nathan Price takes his wife and four daughters to the Congo in 1959 as a Baptist Missionary. They travel despite less than full support of the Church, as times are about to become turbulent in the Congo. With the uneasy election of Patrice Lumumba as Prime Minister, and independence looming, whites are fleeing the country, but Reverend Price is determined to stay on as God's missionary, whatever the cost to his family may be.The novel is told by Orleanna Price, Nathan's wife, and his four daughters. Orleanna is now an old woman looking back at the decisions they made, with tragic consequences in some cases. The daughters each tell their stories in the present tense, starting from when they moved to the Congo up to the present.If there were six stars to give this novel, I would not hesitate to do so. I was hooked right from the start and could see, smell, and feel the red earth of the Congo and the thick, green jungle. The story of the Price family captivated me completely and I stayed up late reading to discover their final fates.

I bought this book for my library. I've read it to two groups and showed it to some of the children who come to the library everyday. I thought they would like it since Carle's other book The Very Quiet Cricket is so enormously popular. Their reaction has been thumbs down. The children like the chirping sound from the cricket book, but the click sound from this beetle book doesn't impress them. The dull &quot;click, click&quot; really pales in comparison to the lilting cricket chirp. We've had our copy of the beetle book for almost three months, and it's only been checked out once.I think a teacher or parent might be able to encourage a child to enjoy the click beetle book by incorporating it into a discussion about bugs. Also, a child who is fascinated with bugs might enjoy it. However, for the average child, I recommend buying The Very Quiet Cricket instead of the Beetle book. For a child who already has and loves the cricket book, I recommend buying Carle's The Very Lonely Firefly, which has fireflies that light up.

He tries to show this new trick to a variety of other critters with no success. The critters encourage him to keep trying.We used this story in class to discuss the importance of persistence and practice to learn something new. This book also sparked a discussion about being kind and respectful, as we talked about how things might have been different if the critters in the story had ridiculed the click beetle for his failure instead of encouraging him.

This one has a clicking noise that comes at a pivotal point of the story (oh man, I hope I didn't just spoil this for any of you). How appropriate for this little click beetle who spends the entire book trying to learn to click and flip (rough life, huh? But, who am I to argue with survival mechanisms?). This book is more than just clicks though. There is a wonderful theme of perseverance running throughout this story, vivid illustrations that make you want to run your fingers over and over them, lots and lots and lots of repetition (yes, even though this can drive adults absolutely CRAZY, kids thrive on it). Also, Carle's books typically include a grammar lesson (shhhh.....don't tell the kids). Here we have so many wonderful verbs introduced by the supporting characters: a turtle who ambles, a snail who slithers, a mouse who scurries. Who else but Carle could make the story of a simple click beetle beautiful and fascinating? Do me a favor. Buy every one of his books and keep them on your bookshelves forever.

I approached this book with an open mind, eager to learn more about being green and was disappointed. The theory seemed outdated and the practical seemed to be already reasonably common practice (at least in Christchurch, New Zealand).

Those readers who are new to Beethoven's music will find this book a guide to his major work. Readers familiar with Beethoven's music and life will find much to learn and enjoy as well. I found this a book to be savored. Reading the book, I think, will encourage the reader to explore further the inexhaustible richness of Beethoven's music.Lookwood concentrates on Beethoven's compositions and on their historical and musical contexts. He does not offer a full biography of Beethoven but rather offers only sufficient broad outline of Beethoven's life to give a sense of the composer and to allow the reader to reflect upon the relationship between the life of Beethoven and his music. Lookwood himself has some interesting things to say on various views of this relationship. (pp 17-21)Lockwood sees Mozart and Bach as Beethoven's primary musical influences. As a young composer, Beethoven both set out to learn from Mozart without becoming an imitator. His early works are greatly influence by Mozart, Lockwood argues, until Beethoven breaks away and finds his own voice in what Lockwood terms Beethoven's second maturity. As Beethoven continued to compose, his work becomes more influenced by the counterpoint of Bach. (Beethoven had played Bach's &quot;well-tempered clavier&quot; as a boy of twelve.) Bach's influence becomes increasingly apparent in the close-textured and fugal works of Beethoven's third maturity.Lockwood basically organizes his book in terms of what he describes as Beethoven's first, second and third maturities of musical development. In each case, he begins with brief details of Beethoven's life, followed by a substantial overview of Beethoven's work and influences in each period, followed by a description of some of the major individual works of the period. For the period of Beethoven's first maturity, Lockwood finds the apex of Beethovens' work in the six opus 18 string quartets.For Beethoven's first and third maturity Loockwood approaches the works chronologically. Interestingly, for the second maturity, Lockwood organizes Beethoven's work by type: the symphonies, concertos, piano sonatas, string quartets, etc, to account for Beethoven's tendency during this time to work on many various compositions simultaneously.Some of the individual works receive little discussion in Lockwood's approach, but this is more than balanced by his excellent overviews of Beethoven's varying styles. Of the early and middle maturity works, Lockwood discusses well Beethoven's third through eighth symphonies, particularly the Eroica. But he does not see Beethoven's work at this time as predominantly &quot;heroic&quot; in tone. Unlike some writers, Lockwood gives good attention to Beethoven's lyrical, melodic, and reflective writing during his second maturity as exemplified by the even-numbered symphonies and by works such as the violin concerto and the cello sonata in A, opus 69. Loockwood emphasies as well the lyrical aspect of Beethoven's writing in his detailed consideration of Beethoven's song-cycle &quot;An Die Ferne Geliebte&quot; (to the distant beloved), opus. 98 (pp.344-46)and in his discussion of Beethoven's songs. (pp 274-279).The compositions of Beethoven's third maturity receive the most individualized and detailed attention in this book. Lookwood considers at some length the Hammerklavier piano sonata and the opus 101 piano sonata (somewhat less attention is given to the final three sonatas), the Missa Solemnis, Diabelli variations, and to each of the five final string quartets and to the great fugue. Lockwood clearly loves this difficult music and impresses its character well upon the reader. But he gives his fullest discussion to Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. Lookwood gives a detailed musical discussion of each of the four movements of this work, not merely its choral finale which sets Schiller's &quot;Ode to Joy&quot;; and he places the work well in its historical situation. He admirably rejects the attempts in some modern writers to policticize or deconstruct this great symphony.In the Ninth, Lockwood shows, Beethoven combined two tendencies which tend to separate in some of his works: his tendency to write works to appeal to a large public on the one hand, and his tendency to write artistically elevated and striving works on the other hand. Lockwood's treatment of the Ninth is one of the highlights of his book.Lockwood has written a basic book, but probably the best overall book that will increase the reader's understanding of Beethoven and his music. May this book lead its readers to explore and to deepen their appreciation of Beethoven's great music"},{"Title":"Beethoven: The Music and the Life","review":"This is a curious book. First, it leaves most of the biographical details (and psychoanalysis) to others, notably Maynard Solomon. This disappointed me, since I think some of Solomon's occasionally reductionist interpretations of Beethoven's behaviour, motivation, etc. could and should be challenged. Given that the composer had such a difficult life, fraught with political, financial and family instability as well as illness and disability, it is very important to understand more about this man of such intense and resolute character in order to more fully appreciate his music.Second, while Lockwood's concentration on the music is interesting and sometimes insightful, it is at times difficult to understand for those without more than a passing knowledge of music theory. Furthermore, Lockwood's analysis is uneven. Some compositions such as the Missa Solemnis, Ninth Symphony and late quartets get substantial coverage, much of it remarkably good at dismissing historical criticism that has mistakenly assigned various political, sexual and other interpretations while more or less ignoring the music itself. Unfortunately, Lockwood does not give the same attention to other major compositions--the five piano concertos and the Violin Concerto among them. This also disappointed me. Given Lockwood's thought-provoking and balanced approach to the later works, it was too bad that he gave other major works more superficial or cursory treatment.Nonetheless, this book is worth reading. Having read numerous books about Beethoven, I have come to the conclusion that no single book could possibly do justice to this complex and fascinating man and the incredible music he produced."},{"Title":"Beethoven: The Music and the Life","review":"Lewis Lockwood's Beethoven: the Music and the Life is a tremendous portrayal of this great composer. Lewis Lockwood is a highly recognized expert on Beethoven and is a Professor of Music at Harvard University. The book was a finalist of the prestigious Pulitzer Prize. In the book, he goes into great detail about almost every one of Beethoven's pieces. He does so in a fashion that encompasses the theoretical aspects of the music, what was occurring in Beethoven's personal life and the political and historical situations at the time of his compositions. The book also includes several illustrations that consist of portions of compositional sketches, handwritten letters, and portraits of influential people in Beethoven's life. With the use of letters, conversations books and sketchings, some of which are over two hundred years old, Lockwood provides an intimate glimpse of Beethoven.The book is divided into four different parts that cover different eras of Beethoven's life. The first discusses Beethoven's childhood up until he moved to Vienna and the other three are about Beethoven's stages (or as Lockwood refers to them, maturities) as a composer. Each part starts with biographical information, but then moves on to the musical descriptions of his Beethoven's pieces, of which Lockwood discusses all known works. I found it surprising that his life could be divided so concisely, but in actuality, this form is tremendously helpful and gives the reader a greater understanding of the evolutionary development of Beethoven. Some have criticized the book for its traditional format and its lack of innovation, but I find the layout of the book fitting and unobtrusive.Seeing Beethoven as both a man and a musician/composer, there is consequently a juxtaposition of these two views and throughout the book, Lockwood flips back and forth in order to keep a sense of chronology. Even within these views, there are several sides to Beethoven that Lockwood expresses. In the book, there are times when Beethoven, as a person, comes off as a lonely bachelor that deeply loved the women in his life but regretfully never was able to maintain a long-lasting relationship. But Lockwood also writes about how Beethoven's cold, strict parenting in effect caused his nephew, Karl, or as Beethoven referred to him as his \\"adopted son\\", to attempt suicide. After which, Karl sought comfort from his mother, whom Beethoven had driven him away from. As a composer, he is shown as both the artist that deserves infinite praise. Yet Lockwood also portrays him as the creator of musical drivel in order to make a profit in exchange for a sense of his own integrity for example when he composed \\"Wellington's Victory\\" (Lockwood 339). These various sides of Beethoven as a man and as an artist seem completely natural for a character as complex as Beethoven's and for music that is so powerful and philosophically deep. At certain points, these two views do get mixed and integrated into each other, which is what I believe that a biography of an artist should be based upon.A reoccurring theme that arises throughout the book (and Beethoven's life for that matter) is the Romantic notion of overcoming adversity. Lockwood accurately sums up the effect on Beethoven from his deafness when he writes, \\"As a man he found himself imprisoned by deafness. As an artist, he broke free, continuing on a trajectory marked by significant acts of renewal and stages of stylistic transformation\\" (122-3). Lockwood wisely avoids playing up the Romantic ideals that embodied Beethoven. Instead he tries to present Beethoven as truthfully and real to life as possible with the sources available. Even though many Romantic artists are glorified by the status as an artist, Lockwood gives praise when it is deserved. The intention of the book is not to worship Beethoven, but it is rather to paint an accurate portrait of Beethoven in the various periods of his life.Another theme that arises throughout the book is the influence of his predecessors, which Lockwood conveys well. It is interesting to see that Beethoven had the same anxiety of influence due to Mozart as just about every future Romantic composer had about Beethoven. In these instances, he comes off as more human than the composing giant he often seems. Personally, I find it much more interesting to identify with a person than to see him from purely an academic standpoint especially in the case of non-fiction reading which can be dry and unappealing if done solely for academic purposes. We, the reader, are also given this window into Beethoven as a person with his depression from the loss of hearing, the struggle of gaining custody of Karl, and his poor attempts at maintaining a normal father-son relationship with him.There is a general bias that pieces from the last maturity are better than everything he wrote before. I think that it is difficult to compare the two because there is such a difference in quantity. Certainly the Ninth Symphony and other late pieces are incredible works of innovations that integrate influence of early composers like Bach and Handel. But I felt that some of the earlier works deserved more focus than they were given. For instance, in Chapter 20 there are thirty pages devoted entirely to the topic of the Ninth Symphony, which covers a political background of the piece, the varying interpretations of the piece in the present day, a look into the composing process and the \\"character\\" of the piece. Meanwhile, the Fifth and Sixth Symphonies are grouped together in one section. Each is given a subsection, which are each about seven pages. These tremendous works of Beethoven's are discussed for about a fourth of the time that the Ninth is. I understand that the Ninth is an incredibly influential symphony that still has effect today, but I don't think that has the power to overshadow his earlier important works.Overall, the book seems to be intended for both the casual reader and the specialist on the topic. Lockwood conveys the intricacies of Beethoven's personal life like his relationship with Haydn, the women of his life, and his family life. Despite how long ago Beethoven's life took place, the preservation of various documents that were actually written by Beethoven allow the reader to almost enter into a conversation with the man. A fairly vague psychological survey seems to emerge from this biographical portion of the text. However, the focus of the book is on the music and the brilliance of his compositional skills. In a sense, he implies this with the title in the ordering of the words \\"music\\" and \\"life\\". At some points, the music theory that the reading entails seems difficult for the less scholarly reader, but Lockwood restrains from using overly technical terms and keeps it at a rudimentary level that if the reader were to listen to the pieces as they read about it, they would be able to establish an understanding of the text. But this goes for just about any writing on music because it much easier to have a clear grasp of a piece of music if the reader listens to it before or after reading about it than if they only read about it."},{"Title":"Beethoven: The Music and the Life","review":"As a college undergrad I took a music course taught by Lockwood many years ago. He was good as a teacher, and I knew he was a LvB scholar, so I always hoped to see a book about LvB's music. After I left college he published not one but at least two such books.This one was written for the general audience, someone who wants to learn about LvB's life as well as his music. Unfortunately, the interweaving leaves the book in the awkward position of fulfilling neither purpose. As a biography it's too brief, and if you were looking for in-depth analysis of LvB's great music you'd be disappointed like myself. I guess one purpose it can serve is as a casual introduction to the background of LvB as a person and as a musician, against the cultural-political backdrop of his times. However, I myself find the coverage too shallow, way too shallow."},{"Title":"Beethoven: The Music and the Life","review":"Two other readers have reviewed this, the first complains that biographical details are subordinated to discussion of the music and also that not all the music is discussed in depth (this would take a multivolume set). The second says that musicians will find nothing new here, but if you are not a professional musician but a layman deeply interested in music, you'll treasure the musical analysis and suggestions for illuminating comparisons between works. The biographical details have been covered amply many times over, not just in Solomon, and they are treated adequately and sensibly here, I think."},{"Title":"Beethoven: The Music and the Life","review":"Ludwig Van Beethoven is no easy man to write about, and his music at times defies description and shrugs off analysis. However, Lockwood has risen to the occasion. With painstaking thoroughness and an eye and ear for detail, he serves as our guide through a life that was filled with obstacles at every turn, and yet out of that, Beethoven was able to create works of enduring genius. Here was a man who shook his fist at the heavens and defied convention. He scorned the ordinary and had no time or patience for niceties. Lockwood misses nothing in this probing, sensitive and very honest account of a difficult man who wrote extraordinary music. At times, we learn more than we might need to, but for the serious reader, this book is both a challenge and a joy. I commend it highly!"},{"Title":"Beethoven: The Music and the Life","review":"This book is an easy, fun read that provides a good introduction to Beethoven. Read on for more!I do find that Lockwood does put a lot of emphasis on Beethoven's later works, but that's not so bad as they are the more famous ones. I wish he had spent more time on some opuses, such as the Piano Concertos, and the Symphonies, some of which only get a passing glance, but it's still a good introduction to the composer and his works. One criticism is that he tends to have sections of political and life events followed by the music composed during them. This is effective, but sometimes a little confusing. He also tends to jump ahead a lot which can sometimes confuse you into thinking Beethoven composed several works of the same title, or confuse you as to when the work was written - luckily, this is easily rectified by the handy appendix containing many of Beethoven's works (and all of his opuses). I also found a few typos, which, to me, are extremely frustrating as it makes me wonder at the scholasticism of the text. To rectify this though, he provides many sources, and other texts on Beethoven. One major advantage, and the reason for my 5 star rating, is that the book is a great read. It reads more like a novel than a history book, which is great. I couldn't put it down at many parts, which caused me to stay up late into the night reading the book. It really is an excellent text, with a few passable mistakes, that provides a great introduction to Beethoven, the music and the life!"},{"Title":"Beethoven: The Music and the Life","review":"Lockwood's Beethoven gives an excellent overview of the great composer's art, life and times.

From the standpointof a present day composer, this is fine new portal into the mind and musicof this giant of giants."},{"Title":"Beethoven: The Music and the Life","review":"Something of a Beethoven connoisseur I picked up this biography in the library, hoped to understand a little more about Beethoven.Stopped reading it after 200 pages, did nothing to excite my imagination, learned nothing but additional inconsequential facts about Beethovens life, received no improved sense of what Beethoven the person was like.Like many music critics Lockwood bashes works that are in fact excellent. One would think The Triple Concerto and the Second Symphony were weak childish works of music if all one knew about them was what Lockwood wrote. Unless you are a composer, and you have done something better, you will usually end up looking foolish being captious towards one of the greatest composers of the early 19th century!Shouldn't good biography should, in most cases, be a little more imaginative? Contain some hypothesis about what allowed the artistic genius of the subject to bloom?The film \\"Copying Beethoven\\" for example, which makes no pretense of historical accuracy, has given me ten times the understanding of Beethoven the man than this or any similarly styled biography could."},{"Title":"White-Tailed Deer","review":"White-Tailed Deer is a highly-informative and wonderful book for everyone who is either familiar with or wants to learn about the white-tailed deer.

Every few months she changes her identity, moves to a new city, and radically alters her appearance. She's become an expert at assuming false identities, never allowing her defenses to slip, and never ever allowing anyone too close. Then she meets Nick Doucet at the restaurant where she waitresses. One glance and she knows he's dangerous, not only because he may be a threat to her physical safety, but also because she knows he can slip past the defenses of her heart. And she's very tired of running away from danger.Nick sees beyond their obvious differences, easily recognizing the similarities he shares with Sara. He wonders if, like him, with every disguise does she leave behind a piece of her true self, or even if she knows who she is anymore. Sara has the ability to give hope that perhaps he hasn't lost his soul after all. He recognizes their kindred spirits, their shared resilience, and their absolute determination to survive impossible circumstances. He's intrigued by the blend of nervous waif and wary combatant. But Nick knows from brutal experience what happens if he lowers his defenses and gets to close to people involved in a case. If he looses his objectivity, people die.The Charmed and Dangerous series by Kylie Brant ends with the thrilling HARD TO TAME, a nail biting, suspenseful romance filled with equal parts of danger to lives and danger to hearts. The series' unifying theme of danger from the menace of a deadly criminal boss reaches a stunning conclusion. Further, Nick is a bigger-than-life hero with a dark past in the Green Berets where he gained the knowledge and skill to hire out to those in need of his services. Sara's street smart, spunky, and his exact opposite. Together they make an explosive team.

This work emerged from the &quot;Friends of God&quot; movement of the fourteenth century within the Catholic Church. It sought to bring man to the life of Christ, following in the example of Christ along with those who have achieved true illumination. The work contrasts these individuals, &quot;the illumined&quot;, with those who merely follow Christ out of desire for reward and with those who follow Christ and therefore believe themselves to be perfect, &quot;the free spirits&quot;. Much of this is in reference to the movement of the &quot;Brothers and Sisters of the Free Spirit&quot; which existed at that time and who interpreted Christ's resurrection as an opportunity to engage in libertine and liscentious acts. The author of this tract responds disapprovingly to this kind of behavior and shows how it deviates from true Christian piety. Thus, we see that those who follow the true light, follow in obedience but do not do so solely out of want of reward; they love God because He is Good and reject the &quot;I, Me, and Mine&quot;. The work explains God's love of Himself as not a selfish form of love; but rather, God loves Himself because He knows He is Good and for that reason alone. In the same manner, should the follower of Christ reject himself and love God solely because He is Good. This is the message of the mystical author.This tract had some influence in the medieval mystical movements and is similar to the mystical writings of the Dominicans Johann Tauler (who Luther at first believed to be the true author, later rejected) and Meister Eckhart. Luther regarded this book as the third most important book he came into contact with, after the Bible and the writings of Saint Augustine. Subsequently, the book had some influence in Protestant theology and orthodox Lutheranism, as well as some interest for Catholic scholars. A must read for all interested in medieval mysticism or for those looking for spiritual fulfillment in the Christ-life."},{"Title":"The Theologia Germanica of Martin Luther (The Classics of Western spirituality)","review":"The Theologia Germanica is a work written by anonymous author probably somewhere around 1350.

Destitute of help and comfort and guidance from man, they took refuge in God, and finding that to them He had proved \`a present help in time of trouble', \`as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land', they tried to bring their fellow-men to believe and partake in a life raised above the troubles of this world...With this aim, like-minded men and women joined themselves together, that by communion of heart and mutual counsel they might strengthen each other in their common efforts to revive the spiritual life of those around them.\\"(19-20) They called themselves Gottesfreunde (Friends of God), and it is one of these Friends that authored this work.In my mind one of the strongest messages espoused here is the razor sharp distinction between the Self and God. So much of this seems to me to be based on two passages from Scripture, to love God with all of our heart, mind, soul, and strength, and that if we wish to follow Christ we must deny the self. \\"God saith, \`I will not give My glory to another.' This is as much as to say, that praise and honour and glory belong to none but to God only. But now, if I call any good thing my own, as if I were it, or of myself had power of did or knew anything, or as if anything were mine or of me, or belonged to me, or were due to me or the like, I take unto myself somewhat of honour and glory, and do two evil things: First, I fall and go astray as aforesaid: Secondly, I touch God in His honour and take unto myself what belongeth to God only. For all that must be called good belongeth to none but to the true eternal Goodness which is God only, and whoso taketh it unto himself, committeth unrighteousness and is against God.\\" (39).I discovered this book after seeing some quotes from it in If Thou Wilt Be Perfect by Oswald Chambers. I have noticed this emphasis - loving God for His sake only without any consideration of myself - often appearing in Chamber's work. This Theologia Germanica might be the source of that influence and certainly contains the essence of that teaching, drawn deeply from the well of Scripture. Martin Luther said \\"Next to the Bible and St. Augustine, no book has ever come into my hands from which I have learnt more of God and Christ, and man and all things that are,\\" and a letter to the translator states that \\"with Luther, I rank this short treatise next to the Bible, but, unlike him, should place it before rather than after St. Augustine.\\" (25)I must wholeheartedly agree. There is so much truth in these pages, a truth that is desperately needed in the world today, particularly in American Christianity in its present state. Perhaps there are similarities between the environment in which this book was written and the one we find ourselves in. This message is just as important now as it was then. It is antithetical to any form of humanism, and consists of pure devotion to the Living God. I will be returning to this work in the future, I am certain of it, and recommend it highly to anyone."},{"Title":"The Theologia Germanica of Martin Luther (The Classics of Western spirituality)","review":"This book is a wonderful antidote to our \\"me\\" centered age. Its theme is that at the heart of human sin is our assertion of \\"I,\\" \\"Me, and \\"Mine,\\" and that if Christ and his will are to live in us then we need to die to all \\"selfdom.\\" It is sometimes labelled \\"mystical,\\" yet its key \\"mystical\\" element is biblical, i.e. that all genuine followers of Christ live in Christ and Christ lives in them. As St Paul writes, \\"It is not longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me.\\"This book is often couched in the language of Neoplatonism, but the content is more biblical than Neoplatonic. It is dualistic, but the dualism is not between matter and spirit as in Platonism, but between God and everything else as in the Christian understanding of creation. Anyone who wants to understand the roots of Luther's theology of the cross, his rejection of the monastic flight from the world in favor of a renewed engagement with the world out of love for one's neighbor, his theology of sanctification, his treatise \\"On the freedom of the Christian,\\" and his understanding of human sin as being curved in on oneself, ought to read this book. It clearly expresses the theology of \\"grace alone\\" that was so important to the Reformer, even though it doesn't articulate his understanding of salvation through faith alone."},{"Title":"The Theologia Germanica of Martin Luther (The Classics of Western spirituality)","review":"This is a good book with lots of insightful spiritual advice which is written in a simple format. Another good thing is that it works for all the major Christian denominations and not just Catholicism.My favorite part was the cover because that guy looks so grumpy!"},{"Title":"Knight Errant (Southern Knights) (Harlequin Silhouette Intimate Moments)","review":"As romances go this one ranked above average even though not in my top ten to read. What I enjoyed most was the flavor of the book. Pappano captures the city and it's less prosporous districts very well. The characters, basically speak as if they do exist and grew up in that area of the city. I would have liked to see a little more of that areas dialect used, but being from that area of the country I know how difficult it would be to write the way that particullar area talks and make the story enjoyable for all readers. The descriptions of that area of New Orleans are very well done and you can actually picture yourself there. Some of the topics in the book are dealt with in a shallow fashion, But all in all this is a good afternoon read. I say thumbs up to the final book in this series and a fond farewell to all the characters."},{"Title":"Knight Errant (Southern Knights) (Harlequin Silhouette Intimate Moments)","review":"The last book in the &quot;Southern Knights&quot; mini-series. A villian in the earlier books, Nicholas Carlucci has just been released from a 5-year prison term. He had hoped that he could have broken Jimmy Falcone's New Orleans crime ring, but all that happened was Falcone walked free and Nick went to prison. Lanie Farrell is an FBI agent sent to protect Nicholas from Falcone's promise to kill him in retribution for his betrayal. Lanie's problem is she can't tell Nicholas the truth, since he doesn't want any protection from anyone, not caring whether he lives or dies. What Lanie doesn't know is Nicholas has a secret motivation for all of his years working as Falcone's crooked attorney. She is supposed to &quot;stick to him like glue,&quot; but neither of them has counted on falling in love.Marilyn Pappano has a good ear for dialog. Her characters sound like real people. I laughed and cried as I watched them struggle through their healing processes: Nicholas to heal his bitterness about his childhood abandonment and pain of losing his first true love, and Lanie to come to terms with her mother's suicide and her father's callousness. I read romance novels to learn better ways for me to be in relationship with people, and how to really connect. What I learned reading &quot;Knight Errant,&quot; is that it is important to never quit loving the people I care about. I also enjoyed vicariously visiting New Orleans. I could visualize &quot;The Quarter,&quot; and almost smell the humidity. After I read this one, I HAD to go and find the rest of the series!"},{"Title":"Red, White, Blue, and Uncle Who?: The Stories Behind Some of America's Patriotic Symbols","review":"The title of &quot;Red, White, Blue, and Uncle Who?: The Stories behind Some of America's Patriotic Symbols&quot; certainly tells you what to expect to find in this book written by Teresa Bateman with illustrations by John O'Brien. The question then is what specific national symbols are included: the Flag, the Eagle, the Great Seal, the Liberty Bell, &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner,&quot; Uncle Sam, the Pledge of Allegiance, the Statue of Liberty, Mount Rushmore, the White House, the Capitol, the National Mall, the Washington Monument, the Lincoln Memorial, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, the Korean War Memorial, and the Thomas Jefferson Memorial (I am not sure why that one came last since it was not the last one chronologically speaking). The stories include not only the origins of each symbol, such as the argument over what should be the national bird (Ben Franklin wanted the wild turkey), but the history of the various symbols and buildings (the Philadelphia City Council wanted to haul away the Liberty Bell as scrap metal). Consequently, Bateman and O'Brien get beyond the standard information to provide some more interesting details (who walks through each of the entrances on the four sides of the White House). Young students should find this book quite informative, depending on how much they know about these various symbols (the struggle to get the Washington Monument built covered a lot of new ground for me) and O'Briens drawings represent a nice balance between reverence and humor. &quot;Red, White, Blue, and Uncle Who?&quot; is not the final word on America's patriotic symbols, but it is a solid introduction to most of the important ones."},{"Title":"Red, White, Blue, and Uncle Who?: The Stories Behind Some of America's Patriotic Symbols","review":"In trying to teach a new generation of patriotic citizen Red, White, Blue, and Uncle Who? The Stories Behind Some of America's Patriotic Symbols By Teresa Bateman and illustrated by John O'Brien is the perfect children's book.Here you will learn of the American Flag. The many designs that were considered.The White House, the people's house, how it was once burned. How there are four entrances at the 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue home. The south door is for high government officials and foreign diplomats. The North entrance is for state visitors, family, and friends. The West door is used by the President and his staff and the East door is used by the public.How our national bird could have been a wild Turkey, champion by Benjamin Franklin. The finally chose the bald eagle because it was native to North America.Red, White, Blue, and Uncle Who? By Teresa Bateman is a fun book for all ages to revisit stories of America."},{"Title":"Conversations with Jesus: Unexpected Answers to Contemporary Questions","review":"I am writing about this book less as a review than as a personal reflection. Throughout this startling look at Jesus and what he said, Harold Fickett writes not about abstract theories, but of what he and I and others have encountered in our own conversations with Jesus as we work out our lives and meet Jesus, as did ordinary individuals in the first century, in the middle of the muck of life. Jesus shocked those with whom he talked and surprised by his astounding love. He offered no tired formulas, no abstract theories, no law but the law of love that fulfilled every law. He offered himself as the answer to the human dilemma.Jesus showed in a profoundly simple way through telling parables, what it means to be loved by God and how that constitutes a real life. &quot;Conversations with Jesus&quot; helped me in my own conversations with Jesus, to see that I am indeed helpless and needy without the help of a God who offers &quot;total help for total need.&quot; I came to see in a brighter, clearer light, by reading this book, the sacredness of asking for and accepting help from God.Near the end of his life, Eric Hoffer, the longshoreman and philosopher, wrote in his journal about forgiveness and reconciliation being what are most important in life. Harold Fickett echoes this in his statement that &quot;forgiveness and reconciliation are the final realities.&quot; In my own life, I moved in the direction of isolation with its accompanying resentment, self-pity, icy egotism and self-righteousness. Time after time I have been upended by my own self, much as Dante was blocked by his own pride. I, too, have seen what an abysmal failure a life built upon compulsive self-will brings.I read the Bible, and the parables of Jesus, in a way that is different today, though I have known the Bible my whole life. The words I read today are living and nourishing, rather than wooden and sterile. I read as one who was lost and now is found. There are answers to spiritual questions that do not answer. Jesus, in the words of the old pop tune, is the answer. I am grateful to the writer of this book for providing fresh evidence to that fact."},{"Title":"Conversations with Jesus: Unexpected Answers to Contemporary Questions","review":"For those of us who are not scholars of biblical history, it may be difficult to appreciate the context and nuances of many of Jesus' parables. Because of differences in cultures and time, we may miss some of the messages embedded in these teachings. Harold Fickett's own spiritual quest led him to explore Jesus' parables in a unique way, seeking a deeper level of meaning. How would a parable be told if Jesus were here today, in our world? In Conversations with Jesus, Fickett has told contemporary stories which play upon the nuances of our culture's customs and prejudices in much the same way that the original audience likely heard Jesus. The stories are woven together with themes of Fickett's own spiritual journey. This is a wonderful book. I recommend it be read slowly, with plenty of time allowed for thought between chapters!"},{"Title":"Conversations with Jesus: Unexpected Answers to Contemporary Questions","review":"Sometimes you can read a book and receive understanding. This is the case with &quot;Conversations With Jesus&quot; by Harold Fickett. Mr. Fickett has paid a high price to gain a relationship with Jesus, thankfully he is willing to share his contemporary parables with us. Each chapter is based on a parable or story that he has written about the present. Each of his stories then is related to a parable or teaching of Jesus. His story writing and insights are a magnifying mirror of Jesus of the gospels. This is an excellent book of spiritual insight."},{"Title":"Hello Gorgeous!: Beauty Products in America '40s-'60s","review":"What a fabulous little bon bon of a book. I laughed, I gasped, I called my mom to ask her if she remembered some of these actresses and then called my daughter to share the trivia. This is a book for every woman of any age- and for anyone interested in the beauty industry and advertising. A treat."},{"Title":"Hello Gorgeous!: Beauty Products in America '40s-'60s","review":"I love this book. It's so much fun and so well researched. The reprints of old advertisements are entertaining in and of themselves, even if you never read a word of the text, and for a few of my older women friends it's been a walk down memory lane (\\"My grandmother had all of these combs in a jar by the mirror in the kitchen of their farmhouse!).I started with a copy for me and one for my best friend, but now that I've had a chance to really look at the book (and see my girlfriend's reaction) I'm going to order more copies to give as gifts to other friends."},{"Title":"Hello Gorgeous!: Beauty Products in America '40s-'60s","review":"Do I want to look years younger? Sure! Although I'm a smart consumer and don't believe the too-good-to-be-true claims of beauty product ads, I hold out enough hope that I scrutinize them all, clinging to the belief that somewhere out there is a lipstick formula that will make all my dreams come true. ;)So I devoured this book. Its highlights are the pages and pages of full-color ads -- for soap, makeup, perfume, shampoo, and products for the \\"feminine finish\\" (\\"Say NO NO to Underarm 'O'\\") -- and bits of trivia on almost every page. It's interesting to see how advertising concepts have changed over the years, and it's fun to laugh at what would never work today (\\"Are you *really* lovely to love?\\").This book is delightful; I'm buying copies for my mother and mother-in-law. I hope the author follows up with one on products from the late '60s and '70s."},{"Title":"Hello Gorgeous!: Beauty Products in America '40s-'60s","review":"I'm an atomic baby, not that I was raised in that era, but am most comfortable with it. I collect Taschen books, and will admit that I initially thought that this was also a Taschen and intended to return it. Then I started flipping through it. There's clever trivia on most pages, sort of like pop up videos. I then looked through the images, which were hilarious, though some were too small to read the print. Finally, I got to the commentary (which in my opinion was the best part of this book). I don't care about cosmetics, other than as to how they relate to popular culture and advertising, but I am in awe of how this author wove so much information from so many generations into this tiny tome. She seems to really know her subject, and more than that- she loves it unapologetically.I am very pleased to have picked up this book by mistake and highly recommend it to anyone interested in pop culture, beauty or advertising."},{"Title":"Hello Gorgeous!: Beauty Products in America '40s-'60s","review":"The best part of this book? everything. It's written well, well researched, funny as hell, poignant, educational and just so sweet.Believe it or not, as much as I loved the ads which were fantastic (Check out Lucille Ball's eyebrows on page 64) I would have prefered fewer ads,larger typeface and much more of the commentary (this author sure can turn a phrase). I have read other books by this publisher, but this was the first one that felt like a book and not just a collection of images. In reading this I feel as though I had a conversation with a stylish girlfriend who knowsn everything about the beauty business. Talk about girlpower, this book was short but empowering and a hoot.I can't wait to read whatever comes next from this author. This is my new stocking stuffer/birthday/any or no occasion gift."},{"Title":"Hello Gorgeous!: Beauty Products in America '40s-'60s","review":"If you like advertising, especially women's ads, from the 40s-60s you will get a kick out of perusing through this book. Anyone actually interested in advertising will find this a treat."},{"Title":"Hello Gorgeous!: Beauty Products in America '40s-'60s","review":"The small size of this book is a disappointment; when another reviewer mentioned the too-small size, I thought the book might be 6 x 8\\" or so. Instead it's about the size of a postcard, and some pages contain multiple advertisements. Also, the small blurbs the author has inserted are sometimes inaccurate. Still, Hello Gorgeous! is a lovely book for anyone interested in nostalgia, cosmetics, consumer culture, or advertising. I enjoyed it a great deal, especially looking at it with my mom, who remembers some of the products. I definitely plan on keeping it for reference, and for fun. Still, if you don't have Kathy Peiss's Beauty in a Jar, I would recommend you buy that book first."},{"Title":"Hello Gorgeous!: Beauty Products in America '40s-'60s","review":"I enjoyed looking thru this book and taking a fun trip into the past. Many of the ads were for products my mom used and with which I grew up. I also felt nostalgia for some great products from the 60s that are no more. It's a neat little colorful package which makes a nice gift for makeup junkies. Now, following are the reasons I gave it only 2 stars.1. Because the book is so small, all the ads have been extremely shrunken down from their original size (magazines were huge back in the 40s,50s, & 60s). Ofcourse, I did not expect full size ads, but if the book were a bit larger one would not need to use a magnafying glass to read much of the text in the ads.2. Too many of the ads were overly repeated within the same chapter and throughout the book. How many ads for Palmolive Soap do we need to see? Please! There were so many other beauty products I remember from the 60s which were not even represented (but Palmolive and Cashmere Bouquet were repeated on every few pages, over and over.3. The major part of the ads mostly covered the 1940s and 1950s. The 1960s were barely represented. The 60s brought us many beauty innovations. The baby boomer generation was more demanding than the previous.I can say alot more, but I will stop here. Over all the book was fun to look at, however, it could have been so much more."},{"Title":"Hello Gorgeous!: Beauty Products in America '40s-'60s","review":"Not only is it the prettiest little coffee table book (it entices you to pick it up every day), but it's filled with cool, entertaining, historical facts.

I loved the historical perspective on the beauty industry -- the retro ads, the trivia, and the idea that beauty is fun (easy to forget in today's society where people will carve themselves up in the name of beauty). I think it'd be a great gift for the bombshell in your life -- including yourself."},{"Title":"Hello Gorgeous!: Beauty Products in America '40s-'60s","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Hello Gorgeous!\\" not only for the memories it brought back of products around our house during my teenage years--soaps, toothpastes, my mother's compacts, powders, lipsticks, etc--and the many more I had seen advertised in the magazines she subscribed to (which I had leafed through for the seductiveness of their intimate-apparel ads), but also for the quality of writing in the book that kept me wanting to read on and the reader-friendly layout--mostly short paragraphs set against photos of women using the various products (including ecstatic-looking women in deodorant ads) and reflecting changing advertising styles over the years--as well as the tips that the author sprinkles in: e.g., that \\"good perfume counters contain a bowl of coffee beans to help neutralize the effects of the heady scents that you've just inhaled, allowing you to process new ones,\\" and a description of which scents most effectively aroused men. In short, I can't imagine a better book on the subject."},{"Title":"Hello Gorgeous!: Beauty Products in America '40s-'60s","review":"OKay, so now I know that the first hairdryer was a modified vacuum cleaner.

I liked all the trivia bubbles on every page and looking at all of the advertisements. It's hard to believe that there was a time when these ads convinced women to buy things though! I'm only disappointed that there wasn't more commentary on the individual ads, I would have been very interested to know what the author thought of more of the ads.The coolest part was the comments by Grace Kelly's bridesmaids!"},{"Title":"Hello Gorgeous!: Beauty Products in America '40s-'60s","review":"What a marvelous little book.

Hello Gorgeous is by turns funny and bittersweet and then it whalops you with a sharp observation on advertising in our own times. I wish there would have been more to read though, as visually stunning as this book is- and it is, I really enjoyed the razor sharp running comments.

Extremely helpful, especially for college level computer courses."},{"Title":"Mastering Unreal Technology: The Art of Level Design","review":"I've programmed and used game level editor tools professionally. The Unreal Ed tool is a bear for anyone without previous knowledge of Unreal's editor. This book tells you half of what you need to know to get going. You'll have to guess and find by trial and error what and where the menus and tools are that the authors tell you about. Be prepared for a lot of frustration. You're probably better off going to the Epic Games site and downloading the same Unreal Runtime editor that is on the CD and accessing their tutorials for non-licensed users. You can also access a free learners edition of Maya.And to add insult to injury, the tutorial files cannot be accessed with the runtime engine on either the CD or the Epic Games site. You'll need a fully licensed version of the Unreal Runtime engine to use the tutorial files. The tutorial files don't work with the free version of the Runtime Engine.It does't say much for QA, if you sell a product that doesn't work out of the package, and this one doesn't. As a former game QA guy, I can't believe the publisher went gold on a CD that crashes the Unreal Runtime Editor, everytime you try to access a tutorial file.

Thus, like the first Gutenberg printing press, it's the best in it's class! In the tutorials the authors assume that you already know as much about the Unreal Editor as they do. If you do not know the in's and out's and idiotsyncrasies of the Unreal Editor(which is why I bought the book in the first place) you will learn new definitions of patience during the first 23 chapters. In the end you will thank the authors for their altruism and capatalistic guile without which this knowledge would not be publicly available. Thank G-d and the great Satan for freedom of information! Thank America for the freedom to say this!"},{"Title":"Mastering Unreal Technology: The Art of Level Design","review":"The book is misleading in that it says you can use the editor supplied with the CD to create the tutorials. YOU NEED UT2004 to create the tutorials.Page 3 of the introduction states\\" the book includes a CD packed with all the necessary assets, the Unreal Runtime Engine demo...\\" This implies that the only thing you need is the book and CD. WRONG!!Also, many of the tutorials have mistakes in them...which are corrected in the 3dBuzz web site forums. Good luck! and lots of patience."},{"Title":"Mastering Unreal Technology: The Art of Level Design","review":"I was a little skeptical before purchasing this book because I already own and watched the Unreal Tournament 2004 Special Edition training videos produced by the same authors as this book. I was afraid that the 60+ hours of content in those videos would cover all the same material as the book. Boy was I wrong.Not only does the Mastering Unreal Technology: The Art of Level Design go into detail far surpassing the training videos, including a surprisingly enlightening (and helpful) section on the theory behind how the Unreal Technology works, but Mr. Busby, Parrish, and Van Eenwyk guide you step-by-step through designing a level. As they begin introducing new, more advanced, features they'll explain - option by option - how the feature works and provide numerous examples of where it would be useful. For a level designer, having a single clear guide of what each of thousands of settings do is an invaluable resource.This book serves as an excellent introduction to Maya reference as well. As I said earlier, having watched through the video tutorials, I was already somewhat familiar with the Maya package. But even for complete novices, the book will quickly bring you upto speed with the basics of the package, and help you learn how to use it to import your own creations (such as static meshes) into your Unreal levels. The Maya content in the book alone, is worth the price of admission.The previous reviewer mentioned that he uses 3DS Max instead of Maya. While I have no doubt that Max is an awesome package, it should not be overlooked that Maya has a free personal learning edition - that ships with Unreal Tournament 2003/4. Consequently, I am very pleased that this package was used instead of Max, because in doing so no initial investment beyond a copy of this book is needed. Heck, they even ship a copy of the Unreal Engine Runtime with the book! This means that people who don't own Unreal Tournament 2004, but wish to learn about level editing, can do so. Overall, I was extremely impressed. :) Way to go."},{"Title":"Mastering Unreal Technology: The Art of Level Design","review":"I read this book cover to cover; it is the best way to start creating levels.

If you are already playing UT2004, you have everything you need and this book will help you find out how they made all those cool things you see in the game.Architecture Visualizing - This book will definitely help you find out how you can take your ideas into a real-time render engine to show your clients. You could get by with the Unreal Runtime engine that comes on the CD with the book. However, in order to fully understand the tutorials, I believe you would need to pick up a copy of UT2004 with this book.3D Artists & Game Developers - If you are already working with other game engines or a 3D animation package and want to look into Unreal, this is the ticket. Like I said before, you do need a copy of UT2004.There were a couple of errors in the book, however they have all been addressed at [...]."},{"Title":"Mastering Unreal Technology: The Art of Level Design","review":"This book is the definitive bible for creating 3d content using Unreal 2.5 Engine. I have been using it a lot for the level, I'm working on. Instead of scouring the web looking for a tutorial on how to do \\"that\\", you can check the index and learn what \\"that\\" does and how to use it in your level.The book covers everything from learning Maya PLE, learning 3dsmax, unwrapping, vehicle modeling, everything that 3D Buzz's team has on their website for download as a video tutorial is in this book, except the information's is right at your finger tips.I was recommended to this book from a friend who works in the gaming industry and even his company uses the book for a quick reference. Jason Busby, Zak Parrish & Joel Van Eenwyk thank you for making one of the best references a level artist could possibly have!"},{"Title":"Mastering Unreal Technology: The Art of Level Design","review":"Wow! This book does a great job at explaining the Unreal Editor in a simple, easy to understand way. When I first opened the editor, I was intimidated by the all the menus and commands, but this book really takes the mystery out of it. It also gives you the confidence you need to succeed in making your own levels in Unreal! The wording is coherent, the text is easy on the eyes, and the images are well organized and inspiring to look at. It even covers character modeling, rigging, and animating in Maya. What a deal! Level editing should be fun and this book does just that."},{"Title":"Mastering Unreal Technology: The Art of Level Design","review":"I was brand new to all aspects of game design, and I had no idea where to start. So I opened up the book preview in the Unreal Tournament folder and saw this book. I went up to borders and bought it a week later. I've had this book for almost 3 weeks now, and Holy Crap! From the start, it explains the history of the Unreal engine and gives you a close up look of all the tools used. It has in-depth tutorials that make designing your first map a breeze. The CD contained in the book also has the May 5 Personal Learning Edition on it. In fact, the CD is my only complaint. This book expects you to use the CD for every texture and static mesh used. Overall, the book is a must buy for any begginner."},{"Title":"Mastering Unreal Technology: The Art of Level Design","review":"I think that as a former QA guy in the game business, you should learn that if you want to use a game editor, you should buy the game. It cost $39.00 when it came out. This book is for those who want to make levels that modify the game. For that it works flawlessly, and explains things masterfully.If you download the Free Unreal Runtime from UDN, yes it will not work, but you cannot make levels for the game with just the RunTime. The RunTime on UDN is to show what the engine can do, not to allow you to make custom content.The tutorials in this book are crisp, well thought out and extremely accurate. It is by far the most comprehensive collection of content for building unreal levels that exists on the market today.If you are looking to purchase this book, please realize that the people who know what they are doing love it, and praise it."},{"Title":"Mastering Unreal Technology: The Art of Level Design","review":"I've used a lot of these types of books for learning Maya and other such programs. While those books tend to be difficult to follow and sometimes inaccurate, I am happy to say that Mastering Unreal Technology is like none of these.If you're looking to learn how to build maps in unreal tournament this book is a must. I've looked on the internet for tutorials for UTE and they are often confusing or simply don't cover what you need to know. In this book you will find just about everything you need to know and it is all presented with tutorials on cd for easy learning. My only complaint is that the book isn't in color. Defiantly recommended."},{"Title":"Mastering Unreal Technology: The Art of Level Design","review":"I bought this book to help use the editor that comes with the UT2004 PC game. It gives an excellent description in the text of how to do the different things you need to do to make a new level. I have found it very helpful and am enjoying the tutorials. It comes with all the files needed for these and you can transfer the files to your computer.The one difficulty I had,and this is a minor point, is that the graphics could be better. They seem to be black and white reproductions of screen shots clipped directly from the game. This means that the pictures of actual perspective views are very dim and that the picutres of viewports showing top or side views are very difficult to use. The top and side viewports in the actual game use colored lines to show shapes and positions of objects. In the book's reproductions, the colors have almost the same gray as the background, and you almost can't see them. I had to use a magnifying glass and study for a while to figure out what they were supposed to show."},{"Title":"Mastering Unreal Technology: The Art of Level Design","review":"I bought this \\"book\\" a few months ago and have been periodically trying to learn the uncanny amount of skills in this 962 page monster. It went into much clearer detail than many of the tutorials i've seen floating around the internet and gave an insight into the ways that most of this program works. It also includes maya and a 100 pages on how to use it which have proved to be very useful to me. For the people complaining about not being able to do the tutorials without having the game, i can only ask them why they want to learn how to make a game that they aren't even willing to pay $25 for.As for its shortcomings, the worst in my opinion is that it seems to be missing small pieces of information which can lead to frustration. Also the fact that the pictures are all in black and white makes some things hard to figure out from them. Also the first time i opened it the spine cracked and now it tries to open to the same page no matter what. that just annoys the hell out of me. Overall, the $30-$40 for this book can easily be justified by its usefullness."},{"Title":"Mastering Unreal Technology: The Art of Level Design","review":"Struggled to find accurate, well-explained tutorials and guides for UnrealEd? Fed up browsing endless forums, only to find no clear explanations for that problem you have with your custom game level in UnrealEd? Don't want to waste yet more precious hours following bad links to useless web pages full of inaccurate tutorials?Mastering Unreal Technology will change all that - for good. Since I got this book, and have been follwoing its tutorials, my experiences with UnrealEd have stopped being confrontational and unresolved, and have become positive, productive and educational. Who knows, at this rate I might even end up releasing a level or two I can be genuinely proud of!The book packs in to it's almost 1000 pages just about every golden nugget of UnrealEd lore there is - from basic level design with UnrealEd to advanced modelling and animation techniques using Maya PLE (included on the CDRom) with UnrealEd. Straight away I was learning how to do stuff that had always baffled me... from curvy corridors to dynamic lighting, from shader making to terrain handling - it's all covered.Best of all, this book is beautifully designed - clear, easy on the eye and illustrated throughout. It has been written in plain English for the artist/designer rather than the programmer and this means everyone, of just about any level, will be able to easily pick up the techniques discussed and follow the many tutorials with ease.ESSENTIAL reading for all budding UnrealEd mod-makers, artists, level designers and machinima makers. 10/10."},{"Title":"Mastering Unreal Technology: The Art of Level Design","review":"I enjoy learning the system, but the directions on the tutorials were somewhat confusing and the picture references are practically no help.

Some pages crinkled a bit but there is no writing or hightlighting in the book."},{"Title":"Mastering Unreal Technology: The Art of Level Design","review":"This was probably a pretty good intro to the Unreal Editor when it came out. Unfortunately, the editor has since gone through at least 2 new versions with many changes making it really hard to follow along or do any of the tutorials. I did learn by mostly having to search through the editor for where things are now, which often introduces you to areas that may not even be mentioned in the book. The tutorial files for UT2 mostly won't open in the more current versions of the software, UT3 and most recently UDK. A third of the book is dedicated to Maya which has gone through at least five or six additional versions since the books release. The Maya tutorials mostly require a plugin which, of course, has not been updated to accommodate newer versions of Unreal or Maya. As such, the Maya portions are OK as basic Maya references, but useless as to it's integration with Unreal in both software's current versions. I gave it a three as it's a decent overview of earlier versions of Unreal. there is some good info in it but I recommend picking up a cheap or used copy if you're thinking about purchasing it purely as a reference."},{"Title":"Mastering Unreal Technology: The Art of Level Design","review":"I was using UnrealEd before I bought this book and I wanted to gain more insight. This book contained almost nothing I didn't already know and I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who has used UnrealEd extensively. It doesn't cover what you would think for 1000 pages. It only covers the basics of everything. But for someone who wants to get into UnrealEd this would be a great book. Don't expect to become an expert with this book, it just teaches the fundamentals, which is still a great start for beginners.Also, one third of the book pertains to 3D modeling, which should be a separate book in itself. Yes, it's great to know about 3D modeling when creating maps but it's an entirely different field."},{"Title":"Mastering Unreal Technology: The Art of Level Design","review":"I just bought this book, and although It seems like it's going to be great, my major problem is finding either Maya PLE 5.0's registration number, or Maya 7.0 PLE and its registration number.the Autodesk site only has Maya PLE 8.5 to download and there are only plug-ins for Unreal for Maya 5.0 PLE and Maya 7.0 PLE (note: there is no version for the regular Maya)So it kind of leaves you stuck with nothing to use. There is also nothing on the net about it either."},{"Title":"Mastering Unreal Technology: The Art of Level Design","review":"This was once a great book on the subject of level design - I have no reason to doubt that. However, it is no longer of any use. You need to supply your own copy of Unreal 2000 to work with the book, and that game is out of date. Moreover, you need to supply your own copy of Maya 9, which you can no longer get by any simple methods."},{"Title":"Mastering Unreal Technology: The Art of Level Design","review":"This book was great. It has tutorials that walk you through many aspects of the Unreal editor including lighting,movers,particle effects, and more. In addition, it has simple explanations of some of the theoretical aspects of the Unreal engine that help you to understand what is going on behind the scenes. The only thing I wished it had was some information about packaging and distributing content."},{"Title":"Mastering Unreal Technology: The Art of Level Design","review":"This book is HUGE, close to two and a half inches thick! I had no idea how to use the unreal engine going in, but after following the first few chapters I got a very good feel for it. I don't think there is a better book to learn the unreal engine! I totally recommend this book."},{"Title":"Mastering Unreal Technology: The Art of Level Design","review":"Wow, it Big, It heavy and yes my Friends it is a red Brick, But it well worth ever cent and every page. Packed full of Useful Information and Helpful Tutorials it writen with the Lamen in mind. and take you into the Skills needed to make almost a full game. The one thing it lacks is the swcripting language section. But this is forgivable as it would make the book way bigger and much more complex to read if you a new guy trying to make a few little Deathmatch levels."},{"Title":"Mastering Unreal Technology: The Art of Level Design","review":"Just like they said, this book is extremely in depth in its tutorials and its general knowledge. For most of the options in UED, they give pretty detailed lists of what there is and what each of them do. Yet since they give most of them, there are still portions missing for stuff you will find critical in level design. Overall the book is really well done and their general theme of designing the control room is a good one where they show all the ins and outs of what you can add. There was a little too much info on Maya for my taste, I strictly use 3DSMax and even though it's nice to see how to game dev. for another software platform, 125+ pages or so is a tad too much for me, I would rather see more pages devoted to UED and less to Maya. Other than that, this book is an excellent buy for those who want to break into unreal game development or mod making."},{"Title":"Mastering Unreal Technology: The Art of Level Design","review":"I know this book and its technology are a bit outdated but I'm a student in game art and design and the class I am currently in has us learning Unreal Editor 2 (UT 2004). Although the teacher is very good at this editor, she's not always around and we cover a lot of material in class so remembering everything is difficult. This book is a life saver!! It's actually taught me more out of class than I've learned in class. Everything you need to know about creating games and worlds in the unreal editor 2004 is in here. Textures, static meshes, emmitters, effects, everything. If I had to say one negative thing about it, it would be that in the section where it teaches you how to export/import a 3D mesh into the UT engine, it only instructs you using Maya. I use 3DS Max so it took a bit of research to figure out the max method but it was easy enough to find online. Great book and dirt cheap!!"},{"Title":"Mastering Unreal Technology: The Art of Level Design","review":"It's not a common book like a novel, reading all the chapters one by one. Its more like a cookery book. When you want to know something about a particular subject or function, you just look for the right chapter and start reading all about it.

Also, the newest versions of UDK are all available online (free) as well.

This book is superb because it combines insightful commentary and fun lists.What Brooks has done is assemble 70+ top ten lists, but each entry has one or more paragraphs of explanation. And it is clear that he has thought very carefully and researched his choices on his lists.More specifically, why is this such a good book?First, the author is well-read and informed. You may not agree with his opinions, I know I have more than a few disagreements, but they are based on a solid understanding of military history and the literature. (BTW, the author is a decorated veteran of the Gulf War, so he has first-hand knowledge of war.)Second, he has created great categories, not just the obvious ones, like the Great Captains of History, Overrated Commanders, Underrated Commanders, and Decisive Battles. Here are some of the 70+ ones that I found quite facinating: Military Myths, Chaplains, Murder (and Death) Most Foul, Retrograde Operations, Mutinies, Entertainers, Cavalry Charges, POW Camps, Courts-Martial, Military Web Sites, Lopsided Victories (more than 30,000 casualties), Lopsided Victories (less than 30,000 casualties), and Last Stands. I love his four War Movie categories: Operational, Nonoperational, Testosterone, and Estrogen. Also, his suggestions on the ten books with which to begin building a military library are quite sound, especially when combined with his four other military book categories. Finally, Brooks has a great category that will challenge the serious historian -- he canvasses several thousand years of history to create the greatest Command Staff in History.Third, Brooks has a good sense of wit. The book is fun to read! Again, the seriousness of the book is not compromised by his witty and at times, sarcastic, comments, rather it is enhanced. This book does challenge the serious historian to think about his own opinions.Fourth, the book is a useful reference. He has some top ten lists that are straight reference, e.g., air aces, sub aces, Marshal-Generals of France. And for each person in the book, he has their dates of birth and death (when known). There is a twelve-page bibliography and an index.Informative and fun, and a great way to get a conversation amongst historians going -- what more can you ask for in a book?"},{"Title":"Military History's Most Wanted: The Top 10 Book of Improbable Victories, Unlikely Heroes, and Other Martial Oddities (Brassey's Most Wanted Series) (Brassey's Most Wanted Series)","review":"This book easily earns five stars, because it's accurate, well-written, and witty.

As most modern war college and west point grads, the new mind set is that the Virginia son's General Lee and Jackson were fair generals at best.

General Lee led his army for four grueling years against a difficult opponent, The U.S. army and Stonewall Jacksons valley campaign was one of Gen. Edwin Rommel (another fair commander) watch words. As with most U.S. miltary minds General Giap( another fair commander) did not defeat the Japanese, French or American forces in Southeast Asia.

Olivia is staying at a beach house that she and her husband planned to live in together. He was tragically killed and she is trying to come to terms with her grief. She finds Ruby in her kitchen drinking a glass of water. Ruby is 15, pregnant, and has no place to go. Although suspicious of her, Olivia lets her stay in her house and gradually they form a bond.Olivia decides that the best thing for everyone is for her to adopt Ruby's baby. But will Ruby keep her word? Even tho she's only 15, there are times when she seems to think that it will be possible for her to keep her baby.Their relationship goes through many stages from the distrust in the beginning to true friendship at the end. It is a marvelous book."},{"Title":"Ruby","review":"I've read all of Ann Hood's books and I must say this is my favorite one. She captures the grief a newly married widow would be feeling and experiencing perfectly. Her portrayal of Ruby as a messed-up, needy teenager is also right on the money. I thought the characters seemed real and they stayed in my mind long after I finished the book. The only thing I really didn't think belonged was Oliva's relationship with Jake. She just suddenly went to his house (he was her lawyer)and began a sexual relationship? What about his &quot;girlfriend?&quot; I think he just represented her need to feel loved again. Anyway, beyond all that I give this two thumbs up."},{"Title":"Ruby","review":"Olivia, after a whirlwind romance and marriage, finds herself widowed. While she goes through the motions of living at the cottage she and David loved, into her life breaks Ruby. Literally. Ruby is as unexpected by Olivia as Ruby's pregnancy was to Ruby. The two form an unusual bond that is dysfunctional and supportive at the same time. Through out the whole book you continue to see how immature Ruby is and how foolish her choices have been and will no doubt continue to be. Though you hope she will get her life together, even at the conclusion of the book you sense she never will. At least Olivia is able to move forward throughout the story and become stronger. It is a compelling story to read as you try to figure out what Ruby will do with her baby, but it is not a particularly happy book."},{"Title":"Ruby","review":"Hood is another Judy Blume. Ruby is the best developed of the characters; I especially enjoyed her monologues and creative diaglogue. Olivia, the main character, is the weak link. She goes off to her beach house for months, leaving her NYC hat business and means of livelihood. Also, I really wasn't sure she loved her husband until after he died. Then the grief is mostly expressed in self-pity. Teenage girls will fly through this book though, plenty of titilating sex and mockery of society's rules."},{"Title":"Ruby","review":"Ann Hood's novel about a pregnant teenager and a mourning widow was full of shallow characters and a jumbled plot. The conversations were simple and provided little insight into what each character was feeling. I forced myself to finish this book and was not surprised when the end was exactly what I had expected."},{"Title":"Ruby","review":"In the book Ruby by Ann Hood, the main character Olivia is the one person who goes through many hardships, and overcomes them one at a time. First her husband dies when he is hit by a car. Then she returns to her house one day only to discover a pregnant fifteen year old, Ruby, sitting at her kitchen table. She takes this girl in, and the story goes on from there. This novel is sensational! Towards the end of the novel, suspense starts building, and you can't put the book down. Olivia is determined to get custody of Ruby's baby, but will she? Will Ruby and the father, Ben, let her do so? Due to some of the graphic content and adult language, this novel is more recommended for the adult reader. I give this book five stars, and will definitely read more of Ann Hood's books."},{"Title":"Ruby","review":"Ann Hood has a clear voice and tells believable stories about modern women in real-life situations. I knew I'd be in for a good read. I wasn't disappointed.Ruby is the story of a young widow, still grieving for her husband, who takes in a young pregnant teenager. They're conflict of course as they each have different needs. And the conclusion is satisfying, if not perfect.The book does have some faults. I would have liked to see just a few less scenes about the past marriage because the story was really very much in the present.But it is an easy book to read -- a mere 225 pages, and it moves quickly. The characters are real and they drive the plot. And I was drawn into the story and held there for the well-crafted story."},{"Title":"Ruby","review":"Ann Hood alternately captures the heartache and the comedy of a unwed, pregnant teen and a middle-aged widow thrown together while trying to cope with their own individual life lessons.The characters are funny, warm and believable. You can actually smell the salt air of the Rhode Island shore! This is one of those books you want to read curled up in front of the fire with a good cup of tea! It is highly enjoyable......one of Hood's best! Bravo!"},{"Title":"Ruby","review":"Ann Hood should be declared a saint by all married men (along with Dr. Laura since she published The Proper Care and Feeding of Husbands last year). The main character in Ruby is not Ruby, is Olivia. She had been married for only a few months when her husband is killed while jogging. That very morning, when he tried to get intimate, Olivia shunned him away, and suggested that he go for a run. After his death, this is a regret that Olivia cannot shake away. Many a woman (including me) will heed her implied advice after reading this book.So Olivia is devastated and goes to their summer house on the coast in Rhode Island to prepare it for sale. While there, she meets Ruby. Ruby is 15 going on 40, and very pregnant. Olivia starts fantasizing about keeping Ruby's baby, as it had been hers and David's dream to have a child. But Ruby is a bit of a con-artist, and the process is not going to be smooth sailing.The beauty about the story is not so much about Olivia getting the baby as it is about Olivia getting a family. It was heartwarming to see the evolution of Olivia and Ruby's relationship, from distrust, to antagonism, to acceptance, to full support. I loved the ending.I wasn't too happy about a few unsatisfying details in the story:* David falling in love at first sight with Olivia, the milliner who sold him the hat he was supposed to give to his girlfriend on Valentine's Day. He gave her the hat and proceeded to break up with her. How shallow! I never warmed up to him.* Olivia's unrealistic retreat to the beach house in RI. She has a business to run and an apartment in NYC, yet she has the means to close them up without subletting. Was she so independently wealthy?* There is a three-year-old in the story that says things like: \\"We've never eaten in here. [...] Honest to God, we never eat in here. Not in a million years\\". OK, how many three-year-olds do you know that say \\"we've never eaten\\"? I know many an adult that says \\"we've never ate\\".* Olivia and Ruby's fight in the parking lot at the A&W.; No matter how stoned those kids were, no one came to Ruby's defense?* Rex's visit to the beach house in the middle of the night. Hmmm...* The cassette tape. I will not into details so as not to spoil this part.In any event, this was a pretty good novel, that read like a breeze. I don't think it is stellar, but I enjoyed the pace. The style reminded me a bit of Laurie Colwin's fabulous novels, maybe because of the New England setting, maybe because the simple, fresh dialog, maybe because of the strong women friendships."},{"Title":"Ruby","review":"What a waste of time it was listening to this book.The plot outline makes sense, but the novel's progress is ruined by unlikeable characters and a poor grasp of realistic dialog.Who the hell makes or sells fancy hats anymore in today's world?Why was Olivia so blase about David's jog that morning--if she was that head-over-heels about him she'd automatically hug and kiss him goodbye, perhaps say I Love You each time they parted.How on earth could Olivia afford to just up and leave her one job and hang around the summerhouse all year, meanwhile theoretically paying 2 mortgages? The author doesn't mention the provisions of David's estate.Why was there virtually no details of the trial or conviction of Amanda for manslaughter? Would such a girl actually take a fruitloaf to a grieving widow in that situation? How gauche.Where were this woman's loving friends and family during Olivia's mourning? They seemed to either be telling her to buck up, flaunting their own marriages and pregnancies, or callously fixing her up with some nobody when she's lost her soulmate.Are we really supposed to believe Olivia (educated, relatively privilaged) is that naive? Trusting a street kid to behave and refrain from theft, drugs and fornication, and to also give up her own baby to Olivia? She doesn't even catch on when Ruby steals her most valuable, personal possessions from her.The whole adoption plotline bothered me. These open-adoption plans seem rather risky. In my time pregnant teens in the Northeast actually had 3 options: abortion, adoption, or keeping the child and going on public assistance. In Ruby, both Olivia and Ruby seem to want the best of both options: keeping the baby with Olivia but giving the birth mother visitation rights. This is too messy a stipulation--it requires extreme maturity on both parties. Neither Olivia nor Ruby seemed very mature, let alone responsible, to me.I know the character grieved over her husband, \\"in her own way\\",yet I was shocked and horrified when she killed a cat, a poor sweet neighbor's pet, yet didn't bother to shed one tear of regret that she'd been a mini-Amanda herself.I don't think real teens talk like Ruby,and the supporting character's dialog sounded like they were from a made-for-cable TV movie.Not much in this book rang true, and I simply could not sympathize with anyone in it, or their actions. Could have been handled so much better, too bad--the premise was great."},{"Title":"Ruby","review":"I bought this book with great anticipation, as it had been highly recommended by a friend. I have to say, I was more than a little disappointed. I couldn't bring myself to like Ruby or Olivia, and by the end of the book was hoping that NEITHER of them got to keep the baby. Olivia was shallow, self centered, and only seemed to want the baby to fill the void left by her husband's death. Ruby was rude, obnoxiously naive, and only seemed to want the baby to force her boyfriend to stay with her. If this is a true sampling of Ms. Hood's writing, you can bet I won't be reading anymore!"},{"Title":"Ruby","review":"In the book Ruby by Ann Hood, the main character Olivia is the one person who goes through many hardships, and overcomes them one at a time. First her husband dies when he is hit by a car. Then she returns to her house one day only to discover a pregnant fifteen year old, Ruby, sitting at her kitchen table. She takes this girl in, and the story goes on from there. This novel is sensational! Towards the end of the novel, suspense starts building, and you can't put the book down. Olivia is determined to get custody of Ruby's baby, but will she? Will Ruby and the father, Ben, let her do so? Due to some of the graphic content and adult language, this novel is more recommended for the adult reader. I give this book five stars, and will definitely read more of Ann Hood's books."},{"Title":"Kissing the Countess","review":"In 1859, Evan Mackenzie arrives at his Scottish earldom without any fanfare. He loves the area, but has not been back in a decade since his mom walked out on his father. Now inheriting the Kildonan keep, he hopes to retract some of the practices that hurt the estates, but first he must pay off debts accrued by his father. He plans to use his engineering salary to do so.While climbing down a mountainside a storm hits. Evan falls and passerby Catriona MacConn saves his life. However, her father finds them in a compromised position though nothing happened and they were just trying to stay warm during the freezing night. He offers to marry her, but she is wary especially when she learns he is the new earl. After she becomes his countess, they become better acquainted, and fall in love. However, she has a secret quest and he struggles with guilt from a tragic bridge disaster that he worked on so their marriage remains on shaky ground and could implode at any momentKISSING THE COUNTESS is an engaging historical romance starring two charming lead protagonists who on the surface seem wrong for each other, but deep inside make a perfect match. The story line engages the audience from the moment Catriona drags Evan to a flimsy shelter. The lead couple is a delight and her brother is a solid support player, but her henpecked father and her henpecking aunt are a bit irritating with their holier than thou pronouncements. Still Susan King shows why she is highly regarded by sub-genre fans with this strong tale.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Kissing the Countess","review":"This was really distracted. She created a really nasty villain, then did virtually nothing with him except something really contrived at the end. There were too many irrelevant characters, she big deal made about rock climbing that didn't pay off - and speaking of that, he never did solve his money problems! The lovers needed to spend more time together to make this work...this was a mess and in desperate need of editing..."},{"Title":"Kissing the Countess","review":"KISSING THE COUNTESS has a very special corner of my heart taken. What solace for myself and my mom while we care for my very ill sister.We both agree it was a favorite of Susan King's work (we're both big fans) with a hero to die for (and Catriona almost does by the end, bless her heart!). Mom cautions though, that it's NOT a book you can go to bed with saying, \\"one more chapter and I'll turn off the light and get to sleep!\\"Catronia was so interesting, both in her physical type and complexity. Her ties to her roots, the land, and her foregone concluded fate as a Plain Girl provided much inner conflict and much to love in her brave and generous nature. And I never thought Evan less strong for his own struggles with survivor's guilt and his own less-than-perfect family ties.Wow, did KISSING THE COUNTESS get me longing for the Highlands and mountain climbing, even without the quest for the book's fairy crystal. Supporting characters like the heroine's brother and Mother Flora lept off the page. Sexy and evocative use of dress and cultural mores! The English class system along with some casual racism made the story full of painless history as well as a beautiful romance between opposites.Thanks so much to Susan King for all the joy she brought to my mom and me at this very trying time for our family. This wonderful author is the fairy crystal to us."},{"Title":"Kissing the Countess","review":"I loved KISSING THE COUNTESS, which reads faster than some of King's previous novels. The plot is strong and straightforward, without a lot of unnecessary complications, and the characters are dynamic, real, and engaging. Catriona, the Highland minister's daughter who is dedicating her life to the welfare of her beloved Highlands, and Evan, the Highland-born, Lowland-raised earl who is not sure what he should do with his inherited property, quickly endeared themselves to me. The author includes some very interesting detail about an unusual subject, mountain climbing in Victorian times. You can feel the cold winds on your face, you can feel the effort it takes to climb a true Highland mountain, and you feel the reward of the beauty and grandeur when the top is reached. Very exciting and unusual in a romance. The characters, as always in a King novel, seemed very real to me, with very real emotions and reactions. Take any King hero or heroine, and you will find a friend you wish you had for yourself. These people are hard to leave at the end of the story, and I find myself thinking about them long afterward. For me, that is the hallmark of a good romance.Susan King is one of the best. WHile I prefer her medievals, that may just be me, I have very much enjoyed her Victorian series too, and I eagerly look forward to anything she writes."},{"Title":"Kissing the Countess","review":"The story was fine, but it was too choppy and didn't go from one thought or subject to the next very smoothly. And like so many other S.K. novels, this one was almost more about learning how to mountain-climb than a love story.Also, the appearance of characters (the men) from other S.K. books have yet to stand out enough to make me want to rush out and buy that story. I find I do it because of who the author is. I will grab any S.K. book I see, even though I'm sometimes disappointed. In this particular case, Sir Aedan MacBride (Waking the Princess) was an outstanding character, but you'd never get that from his appearance in this book. I just happened to have read that one first."},{"Title":"Kissing the Countess","review":"this book is the worst of the 3 in this trilogy. I felt nothing when i read it. i like to hike, but the details of rock climbing totally detracted from this story. i could hardly wait until i was done (i cant stand to start a book and not finish it. i keep thinking there has to be some redeeming value to it). her earlier books are so much better (the swan maiden, etc.). it always seems to happen with good authors. once they attain some popularity, their publishers decide it is time they write about a different venue, because the populace seems to be losing interest. once the author makes an effort to write in that dif. venue, they fail. their sparkle disappears."},{"Title":"Kissing the Countess","review":"Like others in the series, this novel delves into details about the hero's life (in this case, his hobby of mountain climbing); that can sometimes cause the pace to drag a bit. The aunt & father were very nearly stereotypes, as was the hero's now-deceased father until the end. Appearances by lead characters from other books (friends of Evan's) do not make any kind of splash here--they just show up and have almost no personality (when they were very intriguing in their own books).Otherwise, however, the book was a very good read with strong leading characters and a few interesting secondary ones, especicially Catriona's brother and some of the climbers. Mores and biases add to the historical detail, and both tension and emotion are usually kept at just the right level. It's a slow burgeoning of a relationship that starts off suddenly but takes time and understanding to grow into sometimes more than attraction...a situation that makes for a more realistic relationship."},{"Title":"Kissing the Countess","review":"I truly enjoyed this book-it was standard Susan King material. You felt as if you were on that mountain top and you felt the cold right along with them. The scenery and the history behind the story and the mountain climbing was a special addition to her tales as her research always is. The hero/heroine had a beautiful relationship that you yearned for throughout the story. I still feel that Taming the Heiress was the best of the trilogy, but this comes a close second."},{"Title":"The Cow: Commentaries on Selected Chapters of the Qur'an (Keys to the Quran)","review":"Shaykh Fadhlalla's approach in presenting the Quran is very different from the traditional approach. He brings out the deeper and inner meanings of each word and aya't (communication; verse) of the Quran. This is the way to look at his work. He is, however, a very difficult to understand as one has to be at a certain level; therefore, it's not for an averange reader."},{"Title":"The Cow: Commentaries on Selected Chapters of the Qur'an (Keys to the Quran)","review":"The book does not follow the traditional norms in reviewing and commenting on the Holy Book of Islam. Could be due in part to the fact that the man writing the book is using improper references or is himself a shiite. In which case the material should be considered worthless.

It has topical chapter divisions (e.g. &quot;Signs and Wonders&quot;) which makes it useful when you want to find a particular piece of information or explore a certain aspect about Medjugorje.It is objective, written in a reporting style, yet it is quite readable. It is written, I believe, with an American audience in mind, but it does not have the insider feel that the books by Wayne Weible and Fr. Svetozar Kraljevic have. It is not my favourite Medjugorje book, but it gives a well-rounded and balanced view of the apparitions."},{"Title":"The Queen of Peace visits Medugorje","review":"My friend told me of this book and I read it in only a few days.

This autobiography covers the author's strange and disturbing upbringing (her father would torture the kids by bringing home chocolate, implying that it was for the kids, and then eating it in front of them) without blaming who she was on her father or anyone else. I guess a good or bad aspect, depending on point of view, is that it makes a pretty good manual on how to steal jewels, if that's your inclination."},{"Title":"The Complete Juggler: All the Steps from Beginner to Professional","review":"This book is great for learning a bit of everything, but when it comes to developing special skills, a book should only be about one thing.

I have lots of juggling books, and this is not one of the best. If you want to learn how to juggle 3 balls to start with, get a book on ball juggling. If you want to learn another thing, get a book on that one thing. This book misses what is sets out to do - learn you to go from a beginner juggler to a professional one. One of the few books I've bought that really disappointed me. In addition, the instructions on HOW to do the tricks are not good enough. After all, you want to LEARN YOURSELF these tricks, don't you? Yes, and not only KNOW ABOUT THEM."},{"Title":"The Complete Juggler: All the Steps from Beginner to Professional","review":"This is a huge book. It's over 500 pages. If you do not know how to juggle, I wouldn't buy this book. I would reccomend that you get Juggling for the Complete Klutz first. Then, once you master that book, then buy this book. Although it doesn't give very detailed instructions on how to do the tricks, it kind of encourages creativity by letting the reader interpret the illustrated diagrams how they want and possibly coming up with their own tricks based on the ones described in the book so each juggler that learns from this book will have their own individual style.The book has sections on juggling balls, clubs, devil sticks, diablo, cigar boxes, and many others. It also includes a section on old Vaudeville tricks that could be performed, and another section on how to make money from juggling and how to put on a really good show.I have had this book for years, and I'd say I haven't mastered half of the stuff in it yet.It's great!"},{"Title":"The Complete Juggler: All the Steps from Beginner to Professional","review":"This book has some good ideas, but is annoying to read because of Finnigan's condescending tone and childish banter. The illustrations are sometimes useful, and there is some great sections of making money on juggling and good strategies on performing, but the actual instructional section is rather below average. One would be wise to invest in something else."},{"Title":"The Complete Juggler: All the Steps from Beginner to Professional","review":"Wonderful! This book combines the knowledge and experience of a professional juggler with very clear and easy to understand illustrations. The first two thirds are the instructional part and is covers scarves, bean bags, balls, rings, clubs, cigar boxes, the devil stick, the diabolo, hats, the basics of balance, numbers juggling and interactive juggling. Before each section there is a list of certification requirements for an achievement pin. This serves to inspire you. The other third is a &quot;whats next?&quot; portion. In this section, Mr. Finnigan sets forth his method of making a routine, teaching juggling classes, making money with juggling, and much, much more. However, this book gets only a fourstar rating becuase if is not quite the &quot;bible of juggling&quot; as it is often called. It is better described as the Old Testament and Revelation. The instructional part is the Old Testament and the &quot;what now?&quot; part is Revealation. The part it is missing is advanced patterns (i.e. Mill's Mess)Despite that, this book is absolutely terrific! But be forewarned, this is not a &quot;magic formula&quot;. The only way to success is practice! But don't worry! Once you have mastered the cascade, practicing is no longer work, but play!"},{"Title":"The Complete Juggler: All the Steps from Beginner to Professional","review":"This is an acceptable book for beginners who can learn through reading.

The author shows the trick but doesn't show you the mechanics of actually learning the trick for yourself. If a complete beginner were to start learning using this book then their attempts would end in frustration... it doesn't give a true impression of the difficulty of learning the tricks, some of which would take a juggler years of practice to build up to - if they ever get that far. so, I conclude by saying that if you are looking to learn to juggle don't bother with this book (juggling for the complete klutz is a good gentle introduction, or the encyclopaedia of ball juggling for an idea of what is possible and a realistic view of how much work it takes to learn certain tricks) and that if you are interested in learning a particular type of juggling (eg. balls, clubs, devil sticks, diablo) then buy a book that specifically deals with that apparatus and be prepared to practice!"},{"Title":"The Complete Juggler: All the Steps from Beginner to Professional","review":"This book is exceptionally great .

The characters from Pirate Prince are well used in this story.Serafina is a somewhat spoiled and willful character -- but you find that when you step back and look at the things that she is adamant about....you don't hold it against her because they are not selfish in nature. As a matter of a fact, you find yourself routing for her! She is an extremely clever and intelligent character that was totally enjoyable to read about.Darius, our hero, is also wonderful. He is honorable and upstanding and would go to the ends of the world to protect the woman that he secretly loves. His struggle in the story is to believe that he deserves the princess who adores him."},{"Title":"Princess: (Book 2 in the Ascension Trilogy)","review":"Ms. Foley has surpassed herself with her latest addition to the romantic fairytale kingdom of Ascension.

The love story between Darius and Serafina started off strong, but then it came to an abrupt halt when Darius left the island on a secret mission. After his return, Darius and Serafina have a sweet reunion, but then proceed to act out of character until the ultimate resolution of the book.My experience with Gaelen Foley novels has been a bit uneven, so far. I have really liked some of her books (such asHis Wicked Kiss: A Novel), and not been able to finish some others. This one fell in the middle. I expected more from Princess after I read many great reviews of it here. If I had managed my expectations of the book, I probably would have avoided the mild disappointment I felt after reading it."},{"Title":"Princess: (Book 2 in the Ascension Trilogy)","review":"This is the second book in the Ascension series. In this story the Princess Serifina is going to be married to a Prince from Russia who is not what he seems. But, Napoleon wants her to marry his stepson mostly to get her fathers Navy. But none of this really matters to Serifina, as the only man she has ever loved does not love her back (Darius). In fact he made that clear 3 years ago when she told him she loved him and he walked away.Darius is the boy that came home with Lazar in the last book after saving Allegra. I wonder how it is that they were such strong characters in the last story but play a much smaller part in this one..The story starts out with Serafina being stalked and trying to be kidnapped by the French only to have Darius save the day.See how Serafina tries to make Darius realize that is all she really needs.I liked this one better than the first book!"},{"Title":"Princess: (Book 2 in the Ascension Trilogy)","review":"This is by far one of the best books I've read.

While it is a carefully plotted book the characterizations are weak. I don't know why anyone would want this princess; she is almost cartoonish in her attributes and personality traits.Darius isn't much better. I think the \\"big\\" revelation of why he thinks he's unloveable was pathetic.The dialogue between the two was inconsistent, sometimes very romantic and true and other times forced and trite. It does bother me how this author uses present day slang in her novels. While most probably wouldn't mind, it breaks the believability of the story for me. Ms. Foley does it in all her books.I wasn't bored in this book; I finished it, which I can't say about all her books. In the end, I think I will like this author better when she matures and better understands the dynamics in compelling and believeable relationships."},{"Title":"Princess: (Book 2 in the Ascension Trilogy)","review":"The Princess is the tale of a jaded, lost hero who rediscovers the joy of love with the princess of his dreams.Darius Santiago has been in love with Princess Serafina, his protectee, since she blossomed into a beautiful, young woman. But he knows that King Lazar (who adopted him as ward) would never approve of such a match, especially since Serafina is engaged to the mighty Prince Anatole in order to save Ascencion from Napolean's attack.Serafina has always been in love with the darkly handsome Santiago. But having been rejected once, she believes that his recent attraction to her is only because she is forbidden fruit.Darius risks death in order to keep Serafina in her protective, little bubble world, uncovering dangerous evidence against her fiance and her failed kidnappers. But as he finally succumbs to his feelings, he realizes that only by unveiling his darkest secrets to her can he hope to keep her forever as his bride.This is a fantastic sequel to the Pirate Prince and even though some reviewers seem to think that Lazar and Allegra aren't stellar parents, I can only see their love for Serafina and Rafael. Lazar dotes on her constantly, wrapped around her little finger. As always, Foley's books are filled with interesting plot twists and devious villains that I've come to enjoy as part of her romance book experience."},{"Title":"Princess: (Book 2 in the Ascension Trilogy)","review":"Oh, how I wanted to like this book! I so enjoyed Ms. Foley's, PIRATE PRINCE, but PRINCESS was a HUGE disappointment. The two dimensional characters seemed more concerned with how beautiful they were--which is just fine because they had no depth of personality anyway--than anything else. The heroine consistently acted like a 4-year-old, and the hero wasn't far behind. I gasped when I read that Darius had to check his desire to kick a woman he had just pushed to the ground! The dialogue was horrible--trite and much too modern for the story. Not to mention, Ms. Foley never gets around to mentioning the part of Darius's past that she used in PIRATE PRINCE. What a shame, because that might have made him a much more sympathetic character. The repetitiveness was incredible. If the characters had &quot;panted&quot; one more time, or another reference was made to &quot;his forelock&quot; and &quot;onyx eyes&quot;, I was going to scream. This book should come complete with Lazar's bullet from PIRATE PRINCE. The reader will definitely wish he/she could use it on the hero, heroine, or maybe even themselves, just to end the misery of this book."},{"Title":"Princess: (Book 2 in the Ascension Trilogy)","review":"Darius Santiago was definitely the outstanding secondary character in Gaelen Foley's \\"The Pirate Prince\\" (Book 1 in the Ascencion Trilogy), and \\"Princess\\" (Book 2 in the Trilogy) is essentially his story. In the first book, Darius is introduced as a beautiful but damaged child of 14 years old, resourceful beyond his years and unable to trust anyone but Prince Lazar and Allegra, whose lives he saves by aiding an escape from a sadistic Barbary slave-owner. (Interestingly, this episode is never mentioned directly in the second story.) \\"Princess\\" is set 20 years after the first book and Darius, raised as a ward of Prince Lazar, is now the chief spy and assassin of Ascencion (the fictional island off the coast of Italy where the stories are set.)The princess of the title is Lazar and Allegra's first born daughter, the stunningly beautiful Princess Serafina, who has been nursing a crush on Darius, her former bodyguard, since she was 4 years old. Secretly madly in love with her too, Darius holds himself aloof as he realizes that a marriage between a princess and a illegitimate, half-Gypsy gutter-rat is an impossibility, particularly when Napoleon is eyeing the island's navy and Serafina's marriage could have major political consequences.Darius is a wonderful, dark, *dark* hero--gorgeous, loyal to Lazar, ruthless with his enemies and wonderfully gentle with Serafina. Ashamed of his past, he feels unworthy of the lovely, pure princess. He has a heck of a reputation with the ladies of Ascencion, but never has felt truly accepted by anyone except Serafina. Serafina herself is a bit of a disappointment as a heroine. She is a typical high maintenance, tantrum-throwing beauty--all tossing inky curls, pouting cherry lips and stamping little feet. Her moods are wildly labile and she can be a manipulative little so-and-so. Kidnappers and killers are lurking, the kingdom is in dire peril, and she wants Darius (the king's right-hand man) to loosen up, take a vacation and fly some kites. In a word, she is *childish* (this is Allegra and Lazar's daughter?????) But she is not without redeeming qualities--I did like her spunk, bravery and unwavering loyalty to Darius.The plot starts out with a bang--a foiled kidnapping attempt on Serafina--and moves along pretty well. Things heat up when Serafina and Darius move to a safe house for her protection and are left to their own devices (kite-flying and much, MUCH more!)As usual for Gaelen Foley, the writing is good, the dialogue is littered with distracting modern phrases and idioms and the sex scenes are smokin' hot. Surprisingly, Lazar and Allegra turn out to be losers as parents, although they are still mad for each other.In summary, this is an very entertaining story of forbidden love with a wonderful *damaged* hero.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Princess: (Book 2 in the Ascension Trilogy)","review":"PrincessWow, what a great story. Well written and entertaining, Princess is a great sequel to the Pirate Prince. Bringing together the right amount of authenticity to the time and plot possibilities makes for enjoyable reading. Set during the early Napoleonic Wars, Ms. Foley enlightens the readers of the fears that different countries held at that time. Although not central to the story, we learn about Spain, England and Russia's involvement towards France. Unlike most stories which only portray England's involvement or references to specific battles, this story gives an over all picture of Napoleon's popularity or repugnance, depending on the side of the story you are on.The characters are very well developed, especially the hero. I would even call this Darius's story, not Serafina's (although the book is titled Princess). We know Darius from the previous story, as a ragged but spunky street rat. Seeing him full grown and wearing different resentments towards different sources is fascinating. The only one who understands him (and conversely, who understands her) is Serafina. Maybe it is because they have grown up together that this bond is so strong. I sometimes despair that Serafina is a bit too spoiled and will not grow up, but she only really acts that way towards people who expect her to act that way (her court, parents, etc.). When she tries this with Darius, it backfires in her face terribly.I think the only criticism I have of the book (and its so minor as to not even be worth mentioning) is how could the king and queen not know how much Serafina and Darius loved/desired each other? Why such a shock? Over all, I loved reading this story. The sequel is set up quite nicely, and not just as an afterthought at the end of the book. During Princess, there are many points leading to Rafe's story, revealing to the reader what the court's women and his parent's influence turns him into."},{"Title":"Princess: (Book 2 in the Ascension Trilogy)","review":"This is the fifth book by GF that I have read this past year. I also read and put in a review on \\"The Pirate Prince\\" (good), \\"Prince Charming\\" (good just not great), \\"The Duke\\" (excellent - best so far) and \\"Devil Takes A Bride\\" (pretty good). Now I have finished the last book in the Ascencion trilogy \\"Princess\\".I definitely felt that the first series - Pirate/Princess/Prince- was good but, not her best. She was clearly in the early stages of her writing in these books and learning the art of writing. She was developing her craft of drawing in the reader to every aspect of the book - plot, characters and conclusion.If someone wanted to be picky in her books it's easy to find things that don't work. For instance, actions between the main hero and heroine:1) One moment they start disclosing critical parts of their past they are worried about only to have some incident occur and they change their mind halfway into a scene and decide NOT to share after all (this would be fine had it happened one time - but, it happened time and time again....too often to be appealing);2) Or...the hero and heroine finally get around to telling each other how they really feel and how much they love the other then...some incident will occur again and only moments later they are saying get lost, I hate you, go away (once again, this happened too many times to be worthy of some form of plot interest);3) The writer often had the characters saying the oddest phrases or words that didn't seem to match the time frame of the book. I don't expect someone in the early 1800's to say things like; \\"eh\\" in response to a question, calling a girl a \\"kitten\\" or \\"brat\\", or the phrase \\"ugh-oh\\" when trouble arises, or \\"hey\\" to catch someone's attention. These phrases were out of character for the time frame and odd for the historical context of the book;4) In the beginning of the book Darius saves Serafina from two French guys who are out to hurt her, Darius gets a serious knife wound and instead of rushing back to help him, Serafina's dancing in the rain saying how he saved her (oh, they eventually go back and get him stitched up but, not before a little summer rain dance gets done!). That wasn't very thoughtful of our dear heroine;5)Finally...one reviewer noted how the author spent a large portion of time mentioning how incredibly perfect, beautiful and glorious Princess Serafina was and how handsome, dangerous and gorgeous the King's most trusted spy Darius was. I agree, they were perfect specimens of manhood and womanhood but, after a few descriptions, we get it...it doesn't need to be every few pages.These things were slightly exasperating but, not enough to make me not like the characters or the plot. You just have to get past these oddities and then you can enjoy the rest of the book.Sometimes I found it hard to connect to Serafina and Darius. Serafina showed how spoilt and childish she was in some of her words and actions. She was clearly raised in luxury, attention and security at the Kings court so, it was strange how independent she could be after being cocooned her whole life. She was a strange mixture of intelligent woman ready to help the needy of the island, fight for the rights of others and caring for her family and friends but, she seemed spoiled when it came to getting what she wanted and some of her actions clearly got her in trouble because she didn't think clearly. But...many of her redeeming qualities helped me to get over the unattractive qualities of her character and I was able to like her in the long run.In turn, Darius was out there bedding every gal in the land even thought he coveted Serafina her whole life from afar. (I didn't care for the two gals Julia and Princess Pauline that try to seduce him but...it was understandable with such an attractive man). He was kind and honorable and dignified in most instances and then a wild, crazed animal-like killing machine in others when someone he cared for was in harms way. Darius clearly had a terrible childhood that molded him into the complex yet interesting person he became as a man.I guess I felt each character had almost TOO much going on in their personal development. It seemed there was almost too many sides - often opposites - to one person. Perhaps the book needed to spend more time developing each aspect of their character so...by the time the book ended, they had come more full circle. They each had redeeming qualities and it came to pass by the books ends end but...parts definitely felt rushed getting them there.Many reviewers did not care for how the parents, King Lazar and Queen Allegra turned out in this book, compared to their earlier story in \\"The Pirate Prince\\". I have to concur that the author did a terrible job continuing their story here. Both parents were busy with state matters and although they loved their daughter, spent more time on outside interests, their own love life and that of pampering the future king, her brother Prince Rafe. They were very cruel when they found Serafina and Darius together - basically tossed them from the kingdom and turned their backs on them until near the end. Not appealing. The King and Queen we met in the last book were heads above these new people. I think the editor or publisher should have required these parts to be re-edited before printing so, the story flowed and was told better. The parents part were clear misses in this book.The most redeeming part of this book was the attraction, love and almost from birth bond Serafina and Darius shared. They clearly worshipped the other (once again the parents never got a clue till the end on this one) but...others picked up on it. Most of the time they were trusting, caring and loving. Their feelings grew stronger over the years, even more so when Darius took a bullet for his father, when Darius saved Serafina from dangerous situations and then when Serafina helped Darius to be free at the end. Their love was clearly meant to be and was interesting, passionate and appealing. There was some back and forth anger and defensiveness going on as I noted earlier but, not enough to ruin the book. Clearly, the level of intensity and emotion between the two kept things interesting. Especially a few of the love scenes between the two - hot, steamy and passionate for sure.In the end I would support there is adventure (Darius trying to kill Napoleon to keep the French from invading Ascencion), intrigue (who the Russian Anatole really is who is betrothed to Serafina to keep Ascencion safe with the alliance between the two countries and who keeps trying to kill Serafina), and passion (that between our hero and heroine). All the good things to keep a love story going.Princess is not the best book I have ever read but, it is enjoyable and comes from a really solid author worth reading. I would give her 3 1/2 stars if I could but, not quite four - not up to that standard with the things that were off in the book. I would still recommend you read this series first but, plan to move onto \\"The Duke\\" and the books that follow. The second series is much better developed and a lot of the oddities in the first series goes away (thank goodness). Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Princess: (Book 2 in the Ascension Trilogy)","review":"If you love big epic advnetures that will make you laugh, cry, and stay up all nite, don't miss this book.

I never thought anything would top 'Honor's Spendor' by Julie Garwood, but this one did it!!! I loved the book so much I wrote to Ms. Foley and thanked her for writting it (and I've never done that before). I have never read such passion, devotion, and fierce love between two characters as I did in 'Princess.' Darius loves Sariphina so much it hurts. And likewise, she always knew she belonged to him. This book was everything I have ever looked for in a love story. I mean, you could feel every emotion they felt as you were reading. I cannot say enough about how great this book is. You have to give it a try. I read the book before this, 'The Pirate Prince' and though that was an enjoyable read, this book surpasses it a billion times over in my opinion. Read them both for yourself and see if you agree with me. Thank you, thank you, thank you Ms. Foley for writting the best book I have ever read!!!! Oh, if you want another good book by Galen Foley, you will LOVE Lady of Desire as well! She is such an intense and gifted new writer and she knows exactly what women want!"},{"Title":"Princess: (Book 2 in the Ascension Trilogy)","review":"When the book opens, Princess Serafina is running from French kidnappers. She is saved by the head of royal security, Darius, whom she has known her entire life. The year is 1805, Serafina is 20 and Darius is 34. She is the oldest offspring of King Lazar and Queen Allegra of the island kingdom of Ascension. He is the illegitimate offspring of a Spanish count and a gypsy woman. She is to remain pure until her political marriage to Russian Prince Anatole in exchange for his military protection against Napoleon. Darius is termed a male slut (although not a \\"rake\\" in the typical romance tradition). She is outgoing and spoiled (although she feels that her parents do not truly love her), while he has been abused as a child, is shy underneath his bravado, and has feelings of self-loathing due to his abuse as a child. What they share is love for each other, physical beauty and different degrees of terrible parenting.The plot revolves around Darius' need to prove himself worthy of Serafina, even though he feels he can never marry her. After the initial kidnaping attempt, Darius takes Serafina away to a country villa to protect and hide her. There the two quickly become physically intimate, although Serafina remains a virgin. Upon returning to the palace, Darius leaves without warning to assassinate Napoleon. He knows that doing so will not only rid the world of a monster, but free Serafina from the need to marry Anatole. While doing a requested background check for Lazar, Darius discovered that Anatole had caused his first wife's death. Darius does not expect to marry Serafina when all is said and done, however, because he expects to die after killing Napoleon. Unfortunately, Darius' shot goes awry, his plans to commit suicide with arsenic are foiled and he is captured. Napoleon's sister, Pauline, spirits Darius out of his death row prison cell to have sex with him and he is able to escape. He makes it back to Ascension on the eve of Serafina's wedding and goes immediately to her room. Finally, the two make love and Serafina ensures that her parents will catch them in bed, thereby negating the political wedding and ensuring her wedding to the man she loves. A battle of wills between two strong-willed people ensues, complicated by the brewing military battle, the spurned and murderous ex-fianc&eacute; Anatole, Serafina's brother (the heir apparent, Prince Rafael) and his unwise liaison with a duplicitous older woman that leads to a near rout of Ascension.The plot is fast-paced and although politics plays a huge role in it, the author never lets the reader get lost in political details. The characters in Serafina and Darius' generation are well-drawn and believable. By the end of the book, you feel that you have \\"been there\\" with them and know these characters. My only caveat is that after reading about Lazar and Allegra in the Pirate Prince, I felt that they either had an unsupported personality change between then and now, that they really must be horrible people and that fact was hidden in the earlier work, or Foley has unnecessarily betrayed her characters in order to create the essential plot point. It was shocking tto see these characters as parents who were totally unconcerned not only with Serafina's emotional happiness, but her very life. Allegra especially would have willingly sacrificed her at any time to save Prince Rafael - Serafina was clearly disposable. (Rafael, although the favorite, is also not given good parenting either.) And then at the end, to have Lazar tell Darius he would have allowed them to marry at any time, if Darius had only asked - well, that made no sense in light of his earlier unconcern with her health or happiness and very rapid use of her as a political pawn. (I mean, he did not even wait for the background check to come back.) I felt the older characters would have been better served if they had been shown to be in a huge dilemma about how to save their island and Serafina too - they could have pretended to agree to the marriage and then scheme to prevent it, with or without Darius. This misstep by the author is the reason why the book gets 4 stars instead of 5."},{"Title":"Princess: (Book 2 in the Ascension Trilogy)","review":"Darius is the King's most trusted spy and master assassin. As a royal ward, an adopted son of King Lazar and the captain of the Royal Guard, he lives in the world of treachery, political intrigues, and espionage. With a dark and tortured past, he is ruthless in his pursuit of perfection. Quiet but fearless, always on guard with his emotions, his emptiness and desperation mirror his need to prove himself worthy in the eyes of one stunningly beautiful royal protectee, Princess Serafina, the only woman he loves beyond reason but will never possess.Serafina is betrothed to a Russian prince to ensure the safety of the kingdom from Napoleonic conquest. As head of the palace security, Darius acts as her personal bodyguard, protecting her from men at all cost even from himself. He is aware of the feelings of adoration and devotion Serafina has always harbored towards him but he fiercely masks his smoldering attraction in favor of gratitude, honor, loyalty and love for King Lazar and the royal family.Gaelen Foley weaves a tale of the inner battles of Darius to resist the irresistible Serafina whose caresses promise ecstasy beyond his wildest dreams. She pursues and he flees in this fiery dance of passion. Gaelen Foley sets in motion a sequence of events that will challenge the strength of their deep and unconditional love.Aside from the sizzling erotic moments, she also packs exciting fast-paced actions, from the violent rescue of the princess by Darius, his suicidal mission in Milan, and his final encounter with Prince Tyurinov.Gaelen Foley has created the character of beautiful Serafina as a pampered and spoiled princess who can have \\"any man in the planet\\" but who worships only her dark, brooding protector. Intelligent and beautiful, kind but willful, Princess Serafina knows what she wants and that is the love of only one man, Darius. She will pursue him at all cost even in treachery and seduction for she vows no man will ever rule her heart. She seduces him in their secluded hideaway. In the end, to finally claim her man, she pulls out a scheme this time, in FLAGRANTE DELICTO!Even her daring a la \\"femme fatale\\" rescue of Darius from the hands Anatole proves her deep love and absolute loyalty to her man.The story begins with the rescue of Princess Serafina by Darius in the garden maze on the night of her engagement party from French spies out to kidnap her to avoid the alliance of Russia with Ascension. The wounded Darius leads the panic stricken princess back to the palace through a secret passage leading directly to her bedchamber.As head of the palace security, Darius is the only man privy to the secret door to the bedchamber of the princess. Although he has never violated her privacy in the past, his access to the secret door will later seal his claim to Serafina but will destroy the trust of the King and face the wrath of her fiance, Prince Tyurinov.Inside her bedchamber there are so many tender and poignant moments that will reveal how deeply they feel for each other. He discovers that she keeps a portrait of him on the mantel. While tending to his wound, Serafina finds out that he still wears the medal she has given him on her twelfth birthday when he took the bullet meant for the King.When security demands that she be whisked away to a secluded hideaway alone and unchaperoned, she manuevered the King to have Darius as her protector. She senses that Darius needs to learn how to love and heal the wounds of his past and she is the only person who can handle him. He tries to resist Serafina but the smoldering passion is a force to reckon with. What follows is the battle of wills...I like Serafina's relentless determination, gentle persuasion even brazen maneuverings to get her man. You will feel the inner turmoil Darius suffers in trying to ignore her romantic advances and sweet seduction. Her gentle yet not too innocent declaration, \\"You can take anything from me\\", when he takes the white bow she ties around her head for keepsake when he leaves for Milan in a suicidal mission is utterly provocative and seductive. Imagine what Darius feels!I love their verbal sparring and I admire her spunk in one incident, which I quote:Studying him intently, she rested one juicy hip against his desk, her slim arms folded under her breasts, \\"You're very handsome when you scowl\\".He gave him a dirty look. Laughing softly, she reached out and gently smoothed his hair out of his eyes. \\"You need to learn to relax-\\".He grabbed her wrist and forced her hand away. \\"Stop touching me, for God's sake! Why are you always touching me? What are you trying to do to me?\\"Poor Darius, can he ever resist such a temptation from the virginal princess who is off-limits? Secluded in a villa, passion explodes. While she remains intact and technically a virgin, he shows her all the wondrous ways a man can physically and sexually love a woman.Their physical intimacies in the secluded villa, the taking of her maidenhead in her bedchamber on the eve of her wedding and later the incredible bout of afternoon sexual delights in the pink room in the same villa days after their wedding are so sensual and graphic and yet poignant and romantic you will appreciate Galen Foley's talent to satisfy the romantic and sensual fantasies of her readers.This is a beautiful and satisfying sequel to Pirate Prince. Read the book and get carried away in this forbidden love by Gaelen Foley. She knows how to deliver a story with a strong plot, well defined characters, and scorchingly sensual love scenes that capture the readers' imagination. This blazing tale of seductive desire and passion is simply AWESOME!"},{"Title":"Princess: (Book 2 in the Ascension Trilogy)","review":"There was so much left unsaid in this novel. By the end of the novel I was incredibly sick and tired of hearing how important trust and truthfullness are in a relationship when through the whole novel, Serafina never finds out (or asks for that matter) how exactly Darius met her parents. I mean, she's known him all of her life, and she hasn't wondered how he ended up there? I liked Darius, and enjoyed how you could still see the little boy introduced in the Pirate Prince in the grown man, but I had a lot of trouble coming to grips with Serafina. I would have liked to see more growth from her, and more instances of true bravery. Also, it almost seemed to me like King Lazar and Queen Allegra were completely different people from the Pirate Prince. They might have aged, and had children and whatnot, but why would that make Lazar a hot-headed bad judge of character? And Allegra just completely not taking a moment to hear out Serafina and Darius, choosing to believe the worst? Are those the actions of a chick who literally fought for her man? I almost feel like this novel was fan-fiction based off of the Pirate Prince."},{"Title":"Princess: (Book 2 in the Ascension Trilogy)","review":"I own literally THOUSANDS of romance novels.

But I do know that I will treasure it for a very long time. I have read all of Gaelen Foley's novels (THE DUKE is also very good), but PRINCESS remains my absolute favorite romance novel of all time--I didn't think anything could top Judith McNaught's regency novels, but this has definitely done it! What a fantastic story! :-)"},{"Title":"Princess: (Book 2 in the Ascension Trilogy)","review":"I just loved Foley's \\"The Pirate Prince\\", so I went and picked up the second installment in the Ascension trilogy. \\"Princess\\" surpasses the former installment by a long shot. I didn't think that any book could be better than \\"the Pirate Prince\\" but I was very, very wrong. This book tells the story of Darius, whom we met briefly in Lazar and Allegra's story. He was a tortured young man who had seen horrors beyond our comprehension, and was rescued from his cruel fate by Lazar and made his personal assasain. As he serves his King, Darius finds himself in love with Lazar's daughter, Princess Serafina. He tells himself that she could never love him because of who he really is inside, but secretly he years for her love and acceptance. Serefina has always loved her dark hero, who took a bullet for her on her birthday years ago.As the book begins, Princess is running away from an overzealous man. As she is running away from him, Darius comes to her rescue after being away for a long time. The \\"suitor\\" ended up being a spy who was bent on kidnapping her. The hidden love that they feel for each other is written so beautifully by the author that you can feel every emotion as if you are the one in love. Serafina decides that she won't let this man get away from her again, so she begs her father to let Darius come with her in the country to guard her. Darius is furious that she used such an underhanded tactic to keep her with him. But while they stay in the country together for a few days, their love cannot be detained any longer.Darius finally lets his guard down and embraces the love that she gives him with all her heart, holding nothing back but her virtue. They both know that a whole different world awaits them outside of their little paradise. Serafina is engaged to marry another, and Darius knows that this beautiful woman would come to hate him if she knew who he really is. Then one night, danger comes to crush their fairy tale, and Darius has to go back to Ascension to root out some spies.This story has everything in it to make an historical romance reader content. I nearly cried at the words spoken from Darius' mouth to Serafina when he tells her what is inside him, why she should hate him, not love him. Gaelen Foley has written THE BEST historical romance I've ever read, and I know that I will run to the bookstore everytime a novel of hers comes out. She knows exactly the kind of hero that us historical romance readers long for and pens them with such great personal struggles and leaves us wanting more when we regretfully have to turn the last page of the book. You don't know what you are missing if you don't buy this book. It is in every way different from other historial's in the way that the hero and heroine don't fight their feelings for one another the entire book. Don't skip this book at the bookstore, but buy it and every one that Gaelen Foley has written. You will definately be very happy that you did."},{"Title":"Princess: (Book 2 in the Ascension Trilogy)","review":"Pirate Prince was perfect, and this book has a few flaws, but it's a shame to undervalue such a great book just because it can't live up to it's predecessor. Very few books can.Perhaps people are annoyed by the fact that the hero and heroine of Pirate Prince became rather cold-hearted and insufficient parents to Serafina. Also, Ascencion, which seemed to be a charmingly provincial Italian island in Pirate Prince, begins to look and sound more and more like Regency England. These things can be off-putting to Pirate Prince fans. There is also some occasional overdoing of the mushy declarations of love, but overall the author is a good enough writer to pull it off.This story deserves all five stars for fantastic writing, a great heroine and wonderfully tortured hero, and most amazingly, a subplot that is as good as any adventure novel. There is actually more to a Galeen Foley book than just romance (not that it's lacking). She is the only romance writer I know of whose plot could stand on its own even if you took the romance out. This is what I most love about these three books (Pirate Prince, Princess, and Prince Charming): you get more than just a love story.You also get more than just a hero and heroine in this book. Pirate Prince and Princess both contain strong characterizations of upcoming heros. You meet (and really get to know) Darius in Pirate Prince, and Rafael (of Prince Charming) in Princess. In fact, their stories are so interesting, I would suggest actually reading these books in order so as not to miss out.And that's another thing I love about Galeen Foley's novels: they are unique. The plots are fresh and so original that these books are an absolute relief from the typically predictable romance novel genre. And you don't miss out on a thing, because they are still highly erotic love stories full of longing, fear, and overwhelming emotion."},{"Title":"Princess: (Book 2 in the Ascension Trilogy)","review":"Gaelen Foley can write on heck of a romantic novel. Her love scenes are hot and steamy. Her heroines are strong and romantic, and the MEN. These men are just one of the reasons that I read romance novels. Powerful &amp; protective, they totally mesmerize the reader. \\"The Princess\\" is no different. Darius Santiago made his first appearance in \\"The Pirate Prince\\". He was rescued, and brought to live with the royal family. He has always done his duty to this family and become their most valued protector. Naturally, he developed a relationship with the members of this family but most especially with Princess Serafina. He has fallen in love with her over the years, but feels unworthy. He must protect Serafina at all costs, especially from himself.Serafina of course does not want his protection in this area. She has been in love with Darius all of her life, and would like nothing better than to settle down and live happily-ever-after with him. Serafina is engaged to a disreputable prince. This arrangement has been made to insure the safety of her country in the event of war. Darius knows that this man has been chosen for Serafina, but how can he ever let her go?This is a terrific story of two people who have been in love forever, but have just a FEW things to straighten out before they can be together.The thing that I did not get, was how disconnected the royal family seemed to be. \\"The Pirate Prince\\" described a family that was attached and supportive. In this book, Lazar and Allegra seem to be self-absorbed and to have completely isolated their children. How else could they leave their daughter to sacrifice herself in a loveless marriage (especially after Lazar escaped from one in the previous book) or to let her waste away when she believes Darius has died. This disconnection is felt in \\"Prince Charming\\" as well.

Fortunately, I read this novel before its prequel and had no preconceived notions of how all the characters should act. This novel stands on its own.Darius is an alpha hero extraordinaire. He is bold, fearless, smart and so in love with Seraphina that your heart melts whenever he is with her. His devotion is unquestionable. He is also ruthless, has a past full of secrets, and not above manipulating to get what he wants.Seraphina is kind, loving and also manipulative. She really believes the ends justify the means when it comes to capturing Darius. Together, they have a battle of wills that keeps the plot from falling into formulaic misunderstandings. It is totally understandable why Darius keeps his past a secret. The reader empathizes with Seraphina's desire for Darius but also her commitment to her country and duty. Every scene they have is filled with longing, desire and romance. Rarely do writers raise sexual and emotional tension to the boiling point that Ms. Foley does in this novel.The international intrigue is an added bonus. Darius and Seraphina have to live their life under the shadow of Napoleon and the specter of French armies swarming over their Island nation.The only drawback from this book was that the conclusion was a bit abrupt.

He was a truly magnificent hero. That he was, in essence, one of her servants made it that much more fun! The only problem I had with the book is that, if I remember right from Pirate Prince, Darius had been a slave to Malik in the first book and had suffered horribly at his hands, though that was never mentioned in Princess, instead his 'hell' had come from his parents. I have to admit, I liked Lazar better in Pirate Prince and I didn't care for Allegra's attitude when she found the two of them together, especially after reading about her indiscretions in Pirate Prince, she should have been a bit more sympathetic to Serafina. But when the guitar was found on Serafina's bed, it brought tears to my eyes, and when he came back to her, the scene was so poignant and touching, you couldn't help but fall in love with the dark warrior. I also loved what he told Pauline Bonaparte! All in all, I loved the story and can't wait to read Prince Charming!"},{"Title":"Princess: (Book 2 in the Ascension Trilogy)","review":"This was, in my opinion, the most compelling of Gaelen Foley's novels so far. The heat between Darius and Serafina just leaps off the page to keep the reader enthralled. While the plot is a bit predictable at times, it is never boring. Foley's books just keep on getting better."},{"Title":"Princess: (Book 2 in the Ascension Trilogy)","review":"TRILOGY IN SEQUEL: The Pirate Prince.....The Princess......The Prince CharmingIn addition to the EDITORIAL REVIEWS above: I specially admired the way Gaelen Foley created a make-believe Island of Ascension and molding it with the facts of history. It makes the history of Napoleon's family and his conquest, The Russian Czar's, French Revolution, Spanish Colonies and etc. more of an interesting read. Although, this one was a bit slow and wordy in the beginning compared to the other two books in the series, it's still an entertaining read. Educational and fun at the same time.Darius Santiago: Definitely DARK and scarred hero. He was introduce to us in the first book of the series, The Pirate Prince. At that time, he was only 15 years old yet he's been through a lot of hardship. Abused and enslaved. However he was also characterized as a courageous and determined young man, who's also very loyal to King Lazar. I was intrigued by his darkness so I was looking forward to read his own book. Although, there was no detailed mention of what Darius went through during his slavery years in the hands of Malik (in The Pirate Prince), which I was looking forward to read, I was still not disappointed by this book at all. Oh, there's summary of his overall past, his tragedy years since childhood which made me feel for Darius. It made me even admire his resistance and his disciplined manner. He grew up quite, distant and secretive. He concentrated on himself. Worked hard on being the best in what he does. He achieved everything that he thought mattered to him except deep down he needed something more... he needed love and Serifina. Despite his darksides, he is still an honorable man in most ways, that is why he had loved Sarifina for so long in secret. He knows the Princess is off limit to him. The King had entrusted Serifina's safety over to him. He is to guard her and not to have her for his own... He meant to keep the King's trust.Meanwhile, The Princess Serifina: Beautiful, Rich, Royalty... not to mention KIND yet spoiled, carefree, impulsive, determined and a rebel with a cause... a very dangerous combination and a very irresistible one as well. There is no self pity here for Serifina. She knows what she wants then heads out to get it. She isn't like some Princess story you normally would read who has a &quot;pity-me-poor-little-rich-princess&quot; attitude. Nope, not Serifina. She knows she is a Princess and she knows her station and her rank in life. She would even use that valuable information to her advantage... and why not? Call it selfish at times but that is what makes her more realistic in my eyes. No martyrdom or overly good hearted Princess here either. Serifina is unique and quite admirable. I enjoyed her spunk, her witt and overall attitude. She knows she wants Darius... so by treachery, seduction or even an honest-to-goodness confession, she meant to have him and she will.Darius and Serifina's love story was truly an adventure. Pulse racing, heart stopping and heart warming all in one. The reason why I didn't rate this book a five stars is 'cuz of the slow, wordy and repetitive information's. Also, I would have prefer Lazar and Allegra to be more involved in their daughter's life. It is admirable how they trusted Darius to care for Serifina's safety but it would have been a loving read to see both parents spend some quality time with her daughter. Most specially a mother-daughter relationship scenes perhaps. For both to talk about personal things such as love. Considering Allegra was such a loving heroine in The Pirate Prince, who found true happiness and true love, I would have thought she would want the same for her daughter. Both Allegra and Lazar had so much love in them in THE P.P that I expected more of them as parents. For some reason their parenthood here became somewhat lacking. Oh well, despite that small self-preferences, this book is totally entertaining. It will capture not only your heart but your mind as well. It will also lure you to read the next book of the series, The PRINCE CHARMING. Don't wait, read the Ascension Trilogy and be 'awed' by this new Author."},{"Title":"Princess: (Book 2 in the Ascension Trilogy)","review":"My Gosh, I am still thanking my lucky stars that I walked to the library a few days ago and purchased this treasure...This was the first book by Gaelen Foley that I read and it will definitely not be my last.PRINCESS is the story of the forbidden love between Darius, the king's right hand man and most trusted assasin and the king's daughter Princess Serafina. Darius had a terrible childhood and and is still emotionally scared as an adult. So much so that even though he goes above and beyond his duty in his quest for perfection, he never feels that he's worthy of his \\"Princessa\\"'s love. Darius was the only one who understood Serafina; the beautiful, lonely woman who longed for love. They've been in love with each other forever. When Serafina offers herself to Darius at her debut ball, he turns her down. Serafina was hurt and she was determined that the next time she gave herself, Darius will not be able to refuse her. She will love him unconditionally and fight for their love, a love worth saving.Ms. Foley writes in a way that touches the core of the reader. The characters are imagineable and she'll make you lose yourself in the magical kingdom where the Princess and the Assassin are about to scandalize King Lazar's kingdom."},{"Title":"Princess: (Book 2 in the Ascension Trilogy)","review":"What an incredible match those two made! I never would have thought a world weary warroir would fall for a little spoiled princess but the effect was charming! I guess Darius needed relief from the world he was living in - the cold heart-less world of whores and danger - and so he turned to the delightful little Serafina. Admittedly Serafina annoyed at the beginning she seemed like a baby and I couldn't figure out why Darius would fall fo her. But then you get to know her character and what a good person she is and how much Darius needs her. How much Darius needs to unburden his soul to her - I mean the book is a work of art: you fall in love with both these characters eventually and for different reasons. Perhaps I would have prefered the book if Serafina wasn't soooooo beautiful, it would have meant that Darius wouldn't seem like a man running after an innocent young girl. Although truth be told, his resisting her charms shows that he was trying to save her from him so I suppose you could say that he wasn't really running after her. I found it SOOOOOO romantic when Darius finally gave into desire. He was such a gentleman all the way through the book! I fell in love with him from the start! Serafina was brilliant too! She seemed like a child at first but later on in the book you realise that she is smart and behind those beautiful eyes there is some wisdom. By the end of the book you really do appreciate all the effort she puts into saving Santiago's soul. You recognise her as a mature young women by the end of the book and Santiago as a sensitive warrior not a brutal one! What a romance! What a love! RECOMENDED - A TRULLY, TRULLY ROMANTIC BOOK!"},{"Title":"Princess: (Book 2 in the Ascension Trilogy)","review":"I read the other reviews and do agree that Foley should have written a bit more about Darius being kept as a slave like King Lazar had. Also I do agree that Lazar and Allegra were not at all how I expected them to be as parents and found that a bit disapointing, but I believe they needed to be that way to push the main characters into acting the way they did. As for Serifina and Darius - Wow - what a great story. I could not put it down and read it in one day. I was so sad when it was coming to an end and I really do hope that in Prince charming she does not make them meaningless secondary characters like she did with Lazar and Allegra. I just finished the book and the characters seem so fresh in my mind I do not want to let them go yet. I found there love for each other and insecurities so real. Even when Serafina was acting selfish and foolish it was realistic I remember how I acted at 20 when I was first in love and the foolish things you would do to try to keep the man. All I can say is that this is one of my favorite books and Gaelen Foley is fast becoming one of my favorite authors and if you haven't read her other books, the duke, lord of fire, lord of ice and the pirate prince, you are missing out on such great stories and characters."},{"Title":"Princess: (Book 2 in the Ascension Trilogy)","review":"I started this series in the middle (again!) but the storyline was so great that I didn't miss anything.In May 1805 Princess Seraphina is preparing to marry a Russian prince her father has betrothed her to, but her true love is Darius Santiago, her father's trusted spy. Declaring her love to him three years earlier, Darius turned her away.Believing himself not worth of the princesses love Darius lives his life recklessly, putting himself in dangerous situations. When the French attempt to kidnap the princess, Darius is thrown into the role of her protector.Thrilled with the prospect of being with Darius, Princess Seraphina does everything in her power to seduce him.

Unfortunately it all ends with Seraphina is sent back to the palace to prepare for her wedding and Darius goes to Madrid to assassinate Napoleon.This is a wonderful book. If you love a romance set during the Napoleonic wars, this book is for you. If you enjoyed this book, go back and read Seraphina's parents story, The Pirate Prince."},{"Title":"Princess: (Book 2 in the Ascension Trilogy)","review":"Darius I think is a perfect tortured hero. He's dark, dangerous, and has loved one woman his entire life; one he believes he cannot have because, well, she's a princess. Nevertheless, his fierce devotion to Serafina is matchless. I think he is what really makes this story work.Serafina, on the other hand, is your typical cookie cutter princess. She is spoiled, used to getting her way, and a bit self-centered. But what makes her stand out is that she has a good heart. She has loved Darius since she was a child and her love has never wavered. She is the reason why they're together because Darius won't dare make a move on her so she has to do all the work.The storyline is a bit simple and, well, predictable. Ascension is under threat from Napoleon, and in order to secure some type of protection, King Lazar arranges a marriage between the cousin of the Russian czar and Serafina. The cousin is cruel and underhanded with designs to steal the Russian throne from his cousin Nicholas. Darius, however, is on to him.There is a lot of action with some intertwining plots that make it interesting but, I don't know, there was something missing I think; some magic or depth to it that would've made the difference between a mediocre story and a beloved classic. This one falls somewhere in the middle."},{"Title":"Princess: (Book 2 in the Ascension Trilogy)","review":"Synopsis: Serafina de Fiore is the daughter of King Lazar and Queen Allegra from The Pirate Prince. Darius Santiago is the half-gypsy, half-Spanish protector of the royal family. Darius was fourteen when Lazar took him in and he has been a fierce protector of him and his family ever since. Serafina has grown up under his protection and has always been infatuated with him. Three years ago, she revealed her love for him and he fled the country, breaking her heart in the process. Darius has secretly been in love with Serafina for years, but he knows he can never have her. She's a princess and he's the bastard son of a Gypsy. He's kept his distance from her, but after the French try to kidnap her, they go into seclusion under Lazar's orders. As the two grow closer, Darius realizes that her life as well as his heart is in danger.I rated this novel with four stars because I enjoyed it more than the Pirate Prince. The sexual tension between Serafina and Darius was sizzling and their attraction to one another felt true to the characters. Their banter was amusing (most of the time) and it was refreshing to see a heroine that isn't afraid to go after the hero. Serafina was impish and at times childish in the story but it felt realistic for somebody with her age and background. She grew up with a silver spoon in her mouth so I didn't expect her to be as mature and serious as her parents. She was bratty at times but there were moments where you could see that she was beginning to grow up. With that said, sometimes she was a little too child-like (flying kites, really?) but I could let that go since she wasn't like that all the time. Darius was the quintessential dark, damaged hero with a mysterious past. He felt unworthy of Serafina and believed she wouldn't love him if she knew the truth of his past. His honor was all he felt he had so he kept Serafina at a distance because of it. It was an interesting take on a hero's motives (compared to most stories I've read that is) and I enjoyed it. Darius' love for Serafina felt deep and true, but I didn't always feel like Serafina loved Darius for who he was. She seemed more dazzled by the image she had of him and it didn't go away even at the end of the story. The story also began to head south after the first 3/4 of the story (much like the previous book). The drama between the characters in the last seventy pages seemed unnecessary and repetitive at that point. Issues I thought the character had already worked out cropped right back up for no apparent reason. It was a little frustrating and took away from the story. But overall, I still enjoyed their love story and think this novel is worth reading. It's just not the best I've ever read.The subplot about the French was also interesting and added an element to the story that was lacking in The Pirate Prince. I like when there's history in a romance novel and I felt like this story at least attempted to exist in the time period it was supposed to be in. Though, as other reviewers have said, there were modern phrases and allusions that felt out of place in the story. For example, the children at the end of the story were eating chicken wings. It was unnecessary and bizarre, but it was only a minor quibble I had with the story. Foley based a lot of events off of real life happenings of the time so I was able to forgive those minor mistakes. I thought Darius' attempt to assassinate Napoleon added depth to the story and helped develop him more as a character. It gave us insight as to why he withheld himself from Serafina the way he did for all those years. But, I don't think the French plot helped developed Serafina as much as it did Darius. Serafina was almost kidnapped and killed in the first chapter which clearly left her shaken. But it only seemed to bother her in the first two chapters. After that, it was never mentioned again. And she was blas&eacute; about the whole thing. She was more concerned with being alone with Darius than being killed by her enemies. I don't know if this is just a character flaw or if it's a flaw in the writing. It could go either way since Foley did such a suburb job of developing Darius' character.My major qualm with this book was the way Lazar and Allegra were portrayed. It's like Gaelen decided to throw everything we knew about them from the last book away in order to sell the plot of this story. Lazar had been engaged to a woman he did not know or love in the Pirate Prince but in the end he chose love over duty. So why would he expect his daughter to marry for her country, not herself? And his reaction when he found out about Serafina and Darius was over-the-top and out of place, especially after the things he had done to Allegra in the first book. I understand that he was protective of his daughter and that he had changed, but it was still irritating. Allegra was more concerned with Rafael (the crown prince) and her charity work than her daughter. If you haven't read the first book then you won't notice these flaws, but if you have, it'll probably grate on your nerves."},{"Title":"Princess: (Book 2 in the Ascension Trilogy)","review":"I loved this book. Alone, it was fantastic, but as a sequel, I wanted more of the characters from the Pirate Prince. Like other reviewers, I felt Lazar and Allegra were completely different people. They had little interaction with their daughter and took little interest in her during such a hard time in her life. Sarafina was spiraling downward over the man she loved and they did nothing. It was hard to see two characters change so dramatically. I had a perfect picture of their happily ever after and this book kinda spoiled that. I don't mind some adversity, but I like to see the characters react to that adverstity, to overcome it, not ignore it. Read this book because it is fantastic, but don't expect a great sequel."},{"Title":"Princess: (Book 2 in the Ascension Trilogy)","review":"I've been looking forward to read about Darius, who first appeared in the Pirate Prince. He seemed to be such an interesting character. I especially love the scene when he's following Lazar around and acting tough. We can see the shadow of that boy in the grown up Darius. He's still acting tough and quite stubborn. I think it's just natural that he felt he's not good enough for her and tried to push her away. He tried to suppress his love and would probably have kept it hidden forever, if not for Seraphina's attempt to pursue her love.I think that Seraphina is also a wonderful character. True, she could be childish, spoiled, and selfish sometimes, but I don't find that surprising, considering that she's a princess. However, we can also see her sense of responsibility and duty to her country. She accepted the engagement to the Russian Prince, knowing that it would strengthen her country. She didn't make a fuss out of it and tried to make the best of the situation. Although her love for Darius never wavers, but since he didn't want her, she might as well marry somebody who will benefit her country.There are still some points that I question in the story. It's clear when and how Seraphina fell for Darius in the first place, but I am really curious as to when and how Darius fell in love with Seraphina. After all, he knew Seraphina since she was a baby and probably watched her grew up. I also wonder why Lazar agreed to the engagement so quickly without waiting to hear Darius's report. Napoleon's assassination plan and Darius's escape is also a bit unbelievable.Still, I really enjoyed reading \\"Princess\\". Gaelen Foley has very different writing style compare to other Romance authors. There's more substantial and serious plot and conflicts; invasion, political issue, etc. I also enjoyed her Knight series very much."},{"Title":"Princess: (Book 2 in the Ascension Trilogy)","review":"Ms Foley is by far the most talented author I've had the honor of reading.I started out with one of her books in the Knight series, then procceded to buy all of her books and I have not regretted in thus far.I did this once with another author and boy was I disappointed, I swore never to do it again, but took a chance on Ms Foley, can I say again, In my library of over 200 novels, Ms Foley is by far my favorite.I will not go over the synopsis of the novel in my review since other reviewers have already done so.But if you are someone who looks for accuracy (even though the Kingdom of Ascesion is fiction, I believe she ties the Kingdom in with areas like Sicily), Passion, Drama, Dialogue and Humour, then this is definitely the book for you.Or you can pick up any one of her Knight Series.Reading any of her books forces your imagination beyond comprehension.She also has her spice trilogy (The Knight Cousins) coming out next year.

The book only gets better with its intensity and emotions of these two people for one another. Darius has loved the Princess his whole life, and due to his background feels unworthy of her love so he tries to keep his distance but still protect her. Serafina has been in love with Darius since her 12th birthday when he took a bullet, almost died and saved her father's life. The depth of their love is so clear and you feel the difficulties both continually face dealing with duty and honor. Darius is one of my favorite males - I just love the dark, mysterious type that has so much emotional baggage that it takes the true love of a good woman to overcome and find the wonderful man beneath. That is what this book gave me - an in depth story of true love!! I highly recommend this book!!"},{"Title":"Princess: (Book 2 in the Ascension Trilogy)","review":"Part two of this trilogy seems to really miss a beat. The first book \\"Pirate Prince\\" was great!! I couldn't get enough and was throughly excited that I had found another author her knew how to mix romance w/true passion. Wow! A storyline not focused on Regency England. My excitement was brought to a halt midway thru the \\"Princess\\". I liked the dark \\"Thornbird\\" premise only to have the characters break \\"character\\" midway thru the storyline. First of all the parents. It seemed the author decided to divert the orginal cast to secondary roles by making them unlikeable. The King and Queen were shallow figures hardly seen within this new story-and seemed to somehow forget their own beginnings. If I had read the \\"Princess\\" first I wouldn't have been interested in picking up the \\"Pirate Prince\\". The father was foolish and the mother appeared to be a breed mare who was only concerned w/societial obligations and sheltering the idiot Prince Royal. I kept waiting for our Princess to talk w/her understanding parents (remember the couple from the orginal story)who shared a great love and would of obviously understand the Hero/Heroine plight. No so...it seems that either one of two things occured: they suffered memory loss or somehow became older and well....\\"stupid\\". My concern grew with the father/daughter relationship of the Serafina and Darius. Though I enjoy sensual storylines-.....was crass and quite ridiculious. My dissappoint truely came after the inital love scene where they come together with gentleness and love only to become cold and vicious. She used trickery something we would not have thought her capable of due to her previous trust and devotion. Finally there was his complete resistance to being married after have agnoized for years believing he would never be with her. Where is the common sense? In the end the story began to pick itself up and did infact develop some redeeming qualities. The resolution seemed to bring us back to the original characters I had been previously building up to care about; and Yes-the prince found something like.. a brain! In the end we see him growing and I hope that \\"Prince Charming\\" will recapture some the charm (pun intended) of the \\"Pirate Prince\\". Maybe the \\"Prince\\" will be able to encompass the strength found in his parents-from the first novel!-not this one-let's just try to forget about the parental laspse and get on with the continuing story.

Hence, my joy in discovering Foley's book PRINCESS. The main character knows her mind (she wants her man!) And if that wasn't apealing enough, she also has a clever sense of humor (instead of the OH-SO popular &quot;haughty indignation&quot; that most writers curse their leads with) With soo many Romance books out on the market today and so few hours in our busy lives to read them all, why waste your valuable time being subjected to huffy, spiteful brats who are too busy rejecting love, to ever believably find it at all? Another plus this book offers is the male lead (Strong, silent and secretly in love) Though the formula is a common one, his &quot;dark side&quot; is not. There is just something about a man who is at both dangerous and wounded, that draws empathy. And where most writers make excuses for their hero's lethal actions (For instance, self defense, or the most over-used, their victims were evil and deserved to die anyway excuse) Foley doesn't insult her readers intelect by flowering his motives. She purposely makes her male protagonist a skilled &quot;assasin&quot; (a killer by trade) and the effect is facinating. Can a harden man capable of the worst sin know love? Or, more to the point, can a man who fears nothing, who knows only death, hold out against a determined beauty who will settle for nothing less then his soul. And finaly, does Foley's heroine have the courage to, as the book poeticly states, &quot;pet the tiger and make him purr?&quot; To find out you'll have to read the book."},{"Title":"Princess: (Book 2 in the Ascension Trilogy)","review":"This was a great book.

Full of action, spy, and intrigue. I always enjoy Gaelen Foley's style starting from Lord of Ice. My next book of her is \\"Devils takes a Bride\\"."},{"Title":"Princess: (Book 2 in the Ascension Trilogy)","review":"Serafina is the Royal Princess and \\"Jewel of Ascencion\\" - Ascencion being a mythical island off the Italian coast, resembling Sicily and Corsica in nature. She is a 20 year old beauty; a willful, fairy-like creature. Every prince in Europe wants to marry her, as do many wealthy commoners. Her heart is taken, however. Since her earliest childhood she has adored her bodyguard and adopted older brother, Darius Santiago.Twenty years earlier, when Darius was just 14, the King and Queen rescued him from his destitute life on the streets. He was wild and starving - but he managed, at his young age, to save the Queen's life. Since that time, he has been raised, educated and trusted as one of their own. Santiago is a dark hero, who keeps to himself, trusting no one - understandable, considering his past. He had risen in the ranks to Captain of the Royal Guard by age 20, and now, at 34, is Commander of an elite armed force and a spy for the King. He is the bastard son of a Spanish Count and a gypsy mother. His mother cared nothing for Darius and abandoned him; his father, a cruel and brutal man, cared nothing for him. Although he has noble half-brothers, they are not worthy of their rank or their inheritance. So, the Count, recognized his illegitimate son before he died, and Darius is now a wealthy man. His adopted family does not know this, however, because to Darius, his wealth and official position in society makes no difference. In his mind, he is still the abandoned offspring of a gypsy and a Spanish Grandee. He constantly tries to prove himself worthy of the Royal family's trust and affection. The most difficult thing he has ever had to do is ignore Serafina's love and pretend indifference to her. How could he betray her parents by declaring his love for their only daughter?The Emperor Napoleon is ruling and conquering Europe as the novel begins. He needs the Ascencion Navy if he is to defeat the British. All the unmarried Bonaparte brothers and Napoleon's stepson have been offered as marriage choices for Serafina, in return for a political alliance. Neither Serafina nor her parents want such an alliance with France. So, the Princess becomes betrothed, out of duty, to a Russian general and nobleman - who murdered his first wife and is planning to overthrow the Tzar. The man is a ruthless brute. Darius has discovered this information while in Russia, doing a background check on the prospective groom, at the request of Ascencion's King. He returns home with the information in time to rescue Serafina from an attempted kidnapping by Napoleon's henchmen. Thus begin a series of events and adventures that will put lives in danger and risk the island kingdom...as well as the love between Serafina and Darius.I really liked much of the plot, especially the historical detail. However, there were quite a few incidents that were totally unbelievable, including Santiago's plot against France's Emperor. I don't want to disclose more detail and ruin the story for those who have yet to read it. The pace of the novel is slow at first because of repetitious information and unnecessary dialogue. Much of the dialogue between Serafina and Santiago, especially in the novel's early stages, is totally fatuous. She sounds much too juvenile, as a woman, to have earned the love of a man 14 years her senior. Mature young women of that age do exist...but she does not come off as one of them.I would have rated the book 5 stars except for the annoying flaws mentioned above. I do look forward to reading the first book in the series, \\"The Pirate Prince.\\""},{"Title":"Princess: (Book 2 in the Ascension Trilogy)","review":"This is the second in the Ascension trilogy and picks up right where you would have expected her to.

I was absolutely crazed when I read &quot;The Pirate Prince&quot;. It was the first book that had made me cry. So of course, when I read the first chapter of &quot;Princess&quot; I could not wait so many months until it came out. Finally the day came when on my mail box was the much awaited book. I grabbed it and started reading right away.It was dissappointing. First of all, Allegra and Lazar (The Pirate Prince) were not at all what I thought they would be as parents. They seemed more concerned with themselves than with their daughter. I would've never thought they would do such a thing. Both characters lost strength and made me loose my respect for them.As for Darius Santiago, she should have mentioned how he came to be the king's most trusted mercenary. It also dissappointed me the fact that Darius grew up to be so dull. Thinking how he was on the previous novel, I thought he would be much more exciting, dangerous with his mind and body, not with his body alone, probably funny and playful since he was rescued at such and early age by a loving couple. It looked like he was a cruel cold blooded royal assasin, a person with no other interest than to terminate his opponents and no spiritual strength.Serafina, well, she was a conceited, irresponsible, shallow minded and a proven air head. I did not like her at all at the begining. At least she got to grow and mature by the ending of the book.As for their love affair, they fought so much they only had sex instead of making love. The love scenes were like a battle of wills, and they always ended up mad at each other. These scenes are good, but they lacked the feeling and romance of &quot;The Pirate Prince&quot;. Another thing I greatly disliked was the fact that Lazar was so mad at his daughter and Darius for sleeping together I found it absurd. The author forgot that king Lazar had abducted and bedded the beautiful Allegra without any thought of consequences. King Lazar forgot he had been young and in love once.It is good to read it if you want to keep up with the story line, but if you're reading Gaelen Foley for the first time don't start with this book."},{"Title":"Princess: (Book 2 in the Ascension Trilogy)","review":"I have to agree with the only reviewer who gave this book 1 star. I really wanted to like this book and the first chapter was great but then it just fizzled. Serafina was so scared and then acted like nothing happened. The love scenes were good but the rest of the book was very forgetful.The characters were basically stupid."},{"Title":"Princess: (Book 2 in the Ascension Trilogy)","review":"Cliche-ridden, tired, trite phrasing. The heroine is the most beautiful, willful, lovely, spiteful, etc. etc. The hero is beautiful, dark, brooding, etc. etc. I could not finish this book because I cringed every time I turned the page! Really bad!"},{"Title":"Princess: (Book 2 in the Ascension Trilogy)","review":"Though I'm only halfway through Prince Charming, I think I can safely say that Princess is my favorite of this wonderful trilogy. I've said it before - I don't think Gaelen Foley can write a bad book!I absolutely, positively, unequivocally adored Darius! He's the ultimate outsider looking in - if this book took place in the 50's he'd ride a motorcycle, carry a switchblade, wear a leather jacket and have his smokes rolled up in the sleeve of his white t-shirt! God, he was sexy! And tortured. And, sadly, seriously lacking in self-esteem. His gritty, do anything to survive street urchin past life will not let go of him and he feels unworthy to act on his feelings for the Princesa he adores. So he does the only thing he can and does his best to protect her from the evils of the world. He is, afterall, King Lazar's most trusted man (sadly even more so than his own son and heir, Prince Rafael). Though he was taken in by the royal family at the age of 14, he insisted on working his way through the ranks - ever loyal to the royal family, yet apart from them. He adores Serafina quietly from afar, never acting on his attraction to her, though he knows how she feels about him.Serafina has been in love with Darius all her life. She threw herself at him and declared her love at her debut and he ran. Though humiliated, she still adores him years later. She is a spoiled princess and she knows it (though I swear, she is still very likeable!). She also knows that most of the people around her only attend her because she is a princess. They do not really care about her. Only Darius is always there for her when it really matters. He is always there to save her. Is there any way that these two can live happily ever after? Serafina does her best to make it so!I must say, this book contains one of THE most romantic moments I have ever read: the note and gift that Darius leaves for Serafina when he goes off on his \\"mission\\" is so sweet and so poignant that I must confess, I sobbed out loud reading it. What a sweet gesture of love and devotion!Once I finish Prince Charming, I will have read all of Ms. Foley's books to-date (up through Lord of Ice) and I think I have given all of these books 5 stars. She is an author with a proven track record and her books are a great read!"},{"Title":"Princess: (Book 2 in the Ascension Trilogy)","review":"Finding a new author whose books are brilliant enough to place on my keeper's shelf fills me with happiness. Gaelen Foley is such an author! Princess is my second book by this author, The Pirate Prince having been the first, and after I finished it I was convinced Foley belonged up there with Putney, Hunter, Mcnaught and Roberts. She along with these other authors never fail to breathe new life into a genre that's being beaten to death with the same insipid heroines and eye rolling cliches.Princess is the story of Serafina di Fiore, Lazar and Allegra's first born child. She has been in love since she was a child with Darius Santiago, a professional assassin and the king's most trusted subject. Darius is also secretly in love with Serafina but because of his past and his heritage he believes himself unworthy of her.Their love is further complicated by the fact that Serafina has agreed to marry a Russian prince in order to save her beloved country from Napoleon and his mighty army. This seemingly impossible love explodes when both of them are brought together in a secluded villa unchaperoned.The story will clutch right from the start and will not let you go.If you love a good story along with a heart stopping romance then this book is for you. :)"},{"Title":"Princess: (Book 2 in the Ascension Trilogy)","review":"I've also read Ms. Foley's The Pirate Prince, and whileI did enjoy it, I enjoyed the blurb in the back of the bookadvertising the upcoming sequel Princess more and I was waiting with breathless anticipation for this book to come out... and I was not disappointed. If you are the kind of romance reader who loves those cheesy heroes and heroines that far more resemble cardboard cutouts than fully-fleshed, rounded characters, then this book is not for you. The hero, Darius, is the right hand man to the king of Ascension and bodyguard to the Princess Serafina as well as the victim of childhood sexual abuse, as we learned in The Pirate Prince. His forbidden love for Serafina and his struggle to overcome his tragic past are riveting and emotional. As for saying that Seraphina acted like a four year old, I disagree there as well. The heroine, who is twenty years old, and was raised as royalty AND in the eighteen hundreds, acts exactly as one would expect her to act. She is a little spoiled, true, but possesses a kind of sweetness that I couldn't help but like. AND she FIGHTS for her man. The gal has spunk. If you want a hot, sweet, touching, emotional read with depth then pick up a copy of Princess immediately."},{"Title":"Princess: (Book 2 in the Ascension Trilogy)","review":"A historical, set on an island country during Napolean's era, the story centers around Princess Serafina. Her upcoming marriage to a brutuish Russian will secure her small country from Napolean's forces . Her sense of loyalty wars with her heart . . . a heart that has belonged to Darius Santiago, the king's man. Intrigue and politics are the backdrop for Darius and Serafina's love story. Gaelen Foley's second book was a fast-paced, wonderful story destined for my keeper's shelf. Now, I just have to hunt down her first book, the Pirate (Serafina's father's story) and wait for the third book in this series (Serafina's brother's story, Prince Charming, due out Spring of 2000)."},{"Title":"Princess: (Book 2 in the Ascension Trilogy)","review":"I will preface my review with the fact that I had just read a really great romance novel, and so reading this one afterwards may have tainted this review somewhat. Let me say, that the plot of the novel is stellar. Boy and girl have loved one another since before time, but boy feels unworthy and pushes girl away. Yes, it is a well-used plot, but always has potential depending on the character personalities and developments. In the beginning I was really put off by Serafina (our heroine). She's spoiled, whiney, and rude to every man other than Darius. That made me angry. I thought it showed she had little character in that she looked down on anybody that thought she was beautiful, or wanted to dance with her. I kept thinking that she was a b*tch throughout the whole beginning. I expected our beloved heroine to of course save herself and her heart for Darius, but naturally be nice and dance with other gentlemen who fall at her feet. And when she acts selfishly and calls herself out on it, Darius is there to tell her she is just \\"headstrong\\". But when Serafina acts selfishly and it effects Darius, he gets enraged and feels betrayed and lied to. I kept thinking to myself that he knew her better than anyone else, and yet gets mad at her when she acts exactly as she always has. I didn't have a problem with the fact that she WAS selfish. After all, she's a pampered princess. So, rather than hate her, I thought it was rather realistic that she was whiney and selfish. It just made it hard to like her as a person.Darius, whom I liked in the beginning, got on my nerves in the end. He fought with his feelings of unworthiness towards Serafina, the sense of betrayal to her parents, and the fact that he randomly created a problem between him and Serafina by thinking she only wanted a champion. This last problem was the one that got on my nerves. I much prefer outside problems to ones where characters just assume the wrong thing. This misunderstanding was just rather tedious to me. What's more is that Darious has this annoyin tendency to want to be with Serafina no matter what, and in the next moment he can't stand her. One minute they're love is so strong they can overcome any obstacle, and the next they can't seem to trust one another. I think that's one of the things that angered me the most: Darius's ability to go back and forth on whether to tell Serafina everything or not, on whether he was worthy or not, on whether he wanted to live or not, on whether he would act on his love or not. And these are not just thoughts, these are actions. So I felt it made him seem a little less sincere in his love. Serafina was guilty of this at times too. One minute she's taking laudanum and basically wanting to die because she thinks Darius is dead, but then later she's ready to leave him. CRAZY!I also thought it was sweet when Darius bought the yellow villa for Serafina, but then Foley keeps talking about the fact that Serafina keeps having visions of the men that were killed. It's where Tyurinov slapped her, where Darius almost died, etc. Maybe it's time to just find a new house and make only good memories!! But Foley says that eventually she doesn't think of that stuff anymore. I don't really know how you get past that, but time is a magical thing.I didn't like the King and Queen's reaction to Darius and Serafina together. Nor did I like the fact that the King couldn't see through Tyurinov's facade. It was a little off that a King that doted on his daughter would be willing to give her up to someone in order to stay neutral in a war. It seemed out of character for the King who was himself in a loving relationship.To sum up, I disliked Serafina in the beginning and as I began to warm up to her character my like for Darius waned drastically. I was bored with his internal problems and his horrible past. It didn't make sense that he would let Julia Calazzi know more than Serafina since he didn't have any feelings for Julia and knows that she gets around. It seemed weird that he would trust his past more with a whore than with the love of his life. Obviously, he didn't trust her enough not to leave him. But all is overcome in the end.Basically, the story moved really well. I didn't find myself hanging on to every page but it was still a very interesting read. I felt the love between the characters was real, if a little bit hot-cold-hot-cold throughout. Some people really disliked how idyllic these characters are, and maybe that's why Foley gave their romance an abundance of problems all pretty much made from their own actions and assumptions. Maybe I was a little harsh, so I apologize. I had high expectations and it fell somewhat short. But I still think it's worth a spot in my historical romance collection."},{"Title":"Princess: (Book 2 in the Ascension Trilogy)","review":"First, I would like to note that The Duke, Lord of Fire and Lord of Ice are wonderful books and I can't wait until I see the next in the series. In addition, I thought The Pirate Prince was a fantastic book! Lazar was a tortured hero with a heart of gold and Allegra was a strong heroine who believed in love and herself. Darius was an enigmatic little boy who was smart and self assured and only needed love. What happened to these loving, passionate personalities in Princess?Lazar and Allegra have turned into wooden cutouts of their former selves, uncaring, self absorbed and lacking the ability to see passion in their children - apparently not becoming the parents they so hoped to be. I thought that while Ms. Foley's writing was wonderful, her need to use these two characters to drive weak plot points reeked of uncreativity. And why do they not seem to care about their children? I realize that to a king and queen having a first born daughter won't help with the family line - but this is FICTION, and a ROMANCE NOVEL, is it not?Darius has turned from a brave daring boy into an insecure, self absorbed (are we seeing a pattern here?) and foolish man who rushes head on into danger because he believes glory will bring him love. Didn't Lazar adopt him and bring him up as his own ward? Where did the love in this family go? It seems that once Lazar and Allegra moved into the Castle Belfort they assumed different personalities, and Darius grew up into a brooding man whose adoption made absolutely no impact on his personality!Finally, Serafina is everything you'd expect a spoilt princess to be - but not what I expected from the child of Lazar and Allegra! Where was Allegra's charity and Lazar's fearlessness? She should have inhereited at least a few of her parent's characteristics.I think that the creation of Ascencion is fantastic and Ms. Foley's ability to believably weave it into the history of the times is admirable. However, I do wish she'd paid as careful attention to the development of the characters in this book. I am hoping for redemption in Prince Charming."},{"Title":"Princess: (Book 2 in the Ascension Trilogy)","review":"What we have here are the ingredients for an amazing romance. Darius is our sexy, swarthy, dark-skinned cutthroat assassin who carries a torch for his king's beautiful daughter, Serafina. She worships him as well, and has since childhood. There are villains who would threaten their happiness and the kingdom. Serafina once threw herself at Darius, but he, knowing himself to be nothing but a humble servant, denied her, and vanished for years. Serafina moves on to an arranged match and is set to marry a man who she seems resigned to.But then Darius returns and in perfect timing. The princess is running from attackers through a garden maze. Her virtue and safety are at stake. The opening to the novel is angsty and cliche, but very exciting. I was willing to lose myself in it despite the coincidence, right off the bat, that Darius happens to return, after years away, on the very night Serafina needs him. But okay, ignoring that I was liking it... up to the point that, after the rescue, Darius is injured and instead of getting help for him right away, Serafina begins to dance in the rain. It was so strange and dramatic... that a woman who has just been ruthlessly chased and abused, her bodice ripped away, and then witnessed brutal killings in front of her, AND the man she loves has returned mysteriously, AND he has been injured... that she would pause to dance in a rainstorm. How very strange and awkward.That was a red flag indeed. The rest of the novel followed that same pattern. Like ridiculous, overdrawn, over-dramatic and silly actions and conversations. I felt like Serafina and Darius had little depth. Darius seemed careless and even beta for an assassin at times. And Serafina was just too stupid to live. The part where her fiance shows up and she pretends to be over Darius and tries to seduce the villain was cringeworthy. So awkward.I gave it three stars however because the love scenes are richly drawn. And I loved the idea of the story so much. Darius love for Serafina is spectacular in that he's star-crossed. He knows the match makes little sense and he tries to resist her. However, the story as a whole just didn't work out.I love some of Gaelen Foley's other novels, but this one just wasn't a hit for me. Too ridiculous and over-the-top. I preferredThe DukeandMy Dangerous Duke (Inferno Club)amongst others."},{"Title":"Princess: (Book 2 in the Ascension Trilogy)","review":"This is the second book in the romance trilogy that is based in the 1800s (think Napoleon) in a mythical island kingdom off the coast of Italy. I'm giving it 4 stars as it held my attention and I enjoyed it. I actually thought it was more believable than the first one (The Pirate Prince) to which I gave 3 stars. It's the story of Darius and the kingdom's princess, Serafina, the daughter of Lazar and Allegra, the King and Queen of Ascencion, whom we met in book one. Darius, who was a young waif the king rescued from a twisted fiend and made his ward in book one, is now a handsome, tortured soul, the son of a Spanish lord and an unstable gypsy, and a complete rake who can have any woman he wants (and apparently does) though he pines for Serafina as she does for him. He is fiercely loyal to King Lazar, and by the time this book begins when he is in his early 30s, Darius has already saved the King's life and Serafina's more than once. The king sends him on special assignments as a spy, the most recent of which was to uncover the secrets of the Russian military leader to whom the king is considering betrothing Serafina so Ascencion will be able to resist Napoleon's desire to steal their navy. Before Darius can return with his report, however, the king moves forward with the betrothal. Darius is a hunk to die for and Serafina has loved him since she was 4, but she will do her duty and marry whomever she must to save her kingdom.Serafina was at times confusing as a character as she alternately went from self-sacrificing giver to over indulged spoiled rotten \\"princess.\\" She shows strength one minute and then caves the next...similar to a problem with Allegra in the first book. Neither Lazar nor Allegra seemed to be the same people they were in book one, which was disappointing. This was particularly true of Lazar who criticized Darius for the same thing he did in book one. Darius was also inconsistent. On the one hand he worshipped Serafina and held her on a pedestal refusing to \\"go all the way\\" with her even though she is willing. Then a few scenes later, he just beds her with no expectation of marriage. Bizarre. I also agree with one reviewer who noted that Foley sprinkles her novels with modern words and expressions that just don't fit the 1800s and they really stick out. Since they aren't needed I can't imagine why they weren't edited out, but oh well. I think Foley has the potential to be a 5 star author but her work needs a master editor as the books tell a great story and contain meaningful action and dialog but somewhere in the middle, issues arise with her plot and characters. While they start out very well the ending doesn't quite measure up to the first half (in this case I really liked the first 2/3rds and then found the rest not quite as good. Still, it's worth the read and I liked the story line."},{"Title":"Princess: (Book 2 in the Ascension Trilogy)","review":"This has become one of my favorite books of all time and it's surprising because this is the first book that I've ever read by Gaelen Foley. Anybody can write romance novels but not with the skill and aplomb that only a few writers such as Linda Howard, Elizabeth Lowell, and Johanna Lindsey have, who happen to be some of my favorite romance novelists. This book struck me as an endearing and fascinating read because the main characters, Darius Santiago and Princess Serafina, have such great intellect, honesty, bravery, integrity, strong and admirable personalities, a red-hot attraction to each other and searing love scenes that will melt the pages off, in addition to the kind of love that comes once or twice in a lifetime that most of us would probably envy. This book has got all the necessary ingredients in a good book: love, romance, great sex, great and fascinating characters (including the delectable hero- Darius and the strong female heroine, Serafina, who is not afraid to stand up for her man and fight for their love, regardless of what society and her father say) that you'd grow to love, and some adventure (dealing with 1800s Napoleon)! Everything is described in such a picture-perfect way and so eloquently that I couldn't put the book down- the three times that I've read it! Trust me, if you haven't read this book yet, go out there and get yourself a copy! You'd be missing out if you didn't!

He is now the King's most trusted spy and almost \\"son\\". He has many \\"issues\\" from his past, but unfortunately they are only describe in about 1 page towards the end.

She has pledged herself to Darius and will stop at nothing to \\"win\\" him.I thought that Seraphina was wonderful for Darius. She made him laugh, allows him to relax and have fun with life...something that he doesn't know how to do on his own. I loved the fact that Darius was her bodyguard and protector. There's just something about the idea of being cherished and protected that just makes me all warm and fuzzy inside. Darius has this characteristic down pat.I was really cheering for this pair throughout the book. It was a quick read (I read it in 1 day) and impossible to put down. A good and rare treat in a book.

In the waning days of the Epic imprint (1986, to be exact), a writer named James Hudnall got his start with an idea for a new series called \\"ESPers\\": a team of six covert operatives, each with their own specific mental ability. There's a pyrokinetic and an electrokinetic, another who teleports by visualizing a destination, and yet another who can use telekinesis to both move objects and become untouchable. Several storylines have been collected since that time by different publishers.This particular trade paperback collects the team's first two adventures. In the first story, Hudnall and artist David Lloyd assemble the ESPers in a very \\"Giant-Size X-Men #1\\"-fashion via the daughter of a kidnapped diplomat. She herself has a special ability - to communicate with electronics - and becomes aware of the others' existence while accessing CIA computer files to get a clue as to her father's whereabouts. After the obligatory initial encounters and training sequence, the team jumps between Monaco, Beirut, and Monte Carlo, chasing down the kidnappers and those that pull the strings. Hudnall's writing style would develop further over the years, but this is a decent first effort. It seems that he and Lloyd did not convey as much information on the page as they could have. As a result, some finer points of the team's powers are not presented clearly. For example, one character has temporal control in his immediate vicinity, essentially allowing him to move at super-speed (I'm not sure exactly how that's a mental ability, but anyway...). He uses it in the first issue when he's attacked, but it just appears as if he's rushing his attacker. The action in this scene is not really made clear until the end of the issue, where a text piece gives a more detailed explanation of his powers. This bit is actually well-written and helpful, as are the two others, but I really don't like to go from comic to short story and back. It breaks the overall mood of the story.In the second story, Hudnall teams with artist John M. Burns for \\"The Liquidators\\", a collection of short bits focusing on certain ESPers, as well as some assassins who will apparently be tasked with taking them down, thanks to a familiar face from the first story. Here, Hudnall's writing flows much more smoothly, and Burns' art is spectacular, with excellent line and color. Very well written and illustrated, and making good use of previous events, \\"The Liquidators\\" definitely got my interest for more adventures with this team. Whether or not I'll get to them is a different story."},{"Title":"Finding Nemo - Meet Dory!","review":"Yes, it's Dory, the blue friend of Marlin from \\"Finding Nemo\\".

This is one of the best introductions to medieval European history out there. The only drawback is the price, which is ridiculous. This book ought to be $15 or so. Oh well."},{"Title":"Medieval Europe; a Short History","review":"Short and Sweet review:This book is THE starting point for understanding Medieval History. Professor Hollister does a wonderful job of explaining the ins and outs of medieval history.My one complain is that Professor Bennett has tamed Hollister's odd sense of humor. In previous incarnations, Hollister presentes an painting of an emporer (I want to say Charlemagne, but I don't think that's right) holding a sceptor with an orb atop it. He suggests in the caption that this is evidence that the early midevals didn't think the world was flat - otherwise he'd have been holding a spatula! Bennett got rid of that and not it flatly says to the effect of: \\"here we see a mid 10th century representation of Charles the Great, yada yada yada.\\"Earlier versions may be the ones to buy - and I've not read the latest edition.

It's an easy read, but it goes by waaay too fast. And, by never losing its scholarly detachment, the book fails to bring the subject people and events to life, betraying in places a mild disdain. Even the included biographical vignettes are overly clinical. History is made by people, who are products of their times. A good historian gives the impression he has walked among his subjects. This book treats them like bugs under glass. For those of us with a serious (but passing) interest in the middle ages, who (let's be honest!) wanted to read two or three books and call it good, this book is a waste of time."},{"Title":"Medieval Europe; a Short History","review":"Any serious student of history should avoid this opinionated, controversial and dry account of the Middle Ages. The author opens his book with a charming three page analysis of the Roman Golden Age, exclaiming, and this in a TEXTBOOK mind you, &quot;If this was humanity's happiest time-God help us all!&quot; He relegates the achievements of the Renaissance strictly to the realm of the aesthetic, even going so far to lament the fact that the slender and mysterious saints of the Middle Ages seem to have &quot;turned voluptous&quot; in the workshop of Michelangelo... Perhaps the author had some bad experiences in the classics and developed an abhorence for their achievements which he feels he must emphasize in his textbook. Even worse is his one sided, clinical and insensitive view of history; only in Hollister can the reader read of the horrorrs of the Black Plague without blinking an eye. AVOID!"},{"Title":"Medieval Europe; a Short History","review":"I strongly agree with the former reviewer's comments. This book, (superficially ugly, uncolorful and poorly illustrated), is boring and opinionated,cramming one thousand years of history into fifteen or so so chapters. Hollister, who, I'll admit, clearly loved his subject, made the mistake of emphasizing again and again that the Middle Ages were THE domiant force that created modern Europe- history is not a contest, but should accurately reflect the past and incorporate modern interpretation and, (the element most strongly missed in Hollister), constant primary sources. For the responsible instructor looking to teach a worthwhile course on the Middle Ages, numerous sources should be used, and by no means should this out-of-date book form the backbone of the course."},{"Title":"Medieval Europe; a Short History","review":"A succinct and well-balanced survey of the European Middle Ages, this book is an excellent choice for undergraduates and other scholars needing a good overview of the period.

I was pleased to read the explanation of the growth and development of modern European nations. The most surprising part is the growth of civilization throughout the time we were taught were the Dark Ages. Something that is slurred across in most history classes is the age of Charlemagne, about 400 common era (c.e.) to about 900 or 950 c.e. I guess that it is not talked about because not much happened but invasions by Vandals or Attila or Saxons, but there were farms and communities developing (this is the era that beget villains from villagers). There was starvation, missionary work, development of monasteries and convents, etc. This book explained all this and more, making it a lot more interesting just by what it included.There are not a lot of footnotes because this is a survey book, not a scholarly one. What is written about is well known and accepted as undisputed, so the footnotes would be unnecessary. He does have extensive bibliographies between sections for additional reading for concentrating on those issues or subjects. He does use footnotes to direct the reader to where he discusses the person or place otherwise, and to chide himself for errors he corrects. It is also very good that he explains where some of the names come from: Charlemagne or Plantagenet or Louis for example.All in all, a really enjoyable book to read."},{"Title":"Medieval Europe; a Short History","review":"Hollister here presents one of the best introductions to medieval history. I have read this book several times, and each time, I learn something new or gain a new insight. As other reviewers have said, the book is well organized, coherent, and comprehensive. It is replete with relevant maps, charts, timelines, and photographs, but without degenerating into childishness. Its multiple bibliographies suggest where to find useful sources, both primary and modern.The best thing about the writing style of the book is the way it presents history in the form of ongoing dynamic tension: east v. west, church v. state, aristocracy v. peasants, invaders v. defenders, one nation v. another, reformers v. establishment, monarch v. nobility, etc. The tides of history are moved by such forces.Bear in mind that this book is only a survey of medieval Europe, so everyone can say it doesn't cover some topic or another in enough detail. However, its lasting effect is that it introduces topics in such a way that it makes you want to move on to other sources to study some of them in more detail. As a first course, it does its job in whetting your appetite.p.s. I'm not sure what's with the kooky price here. Find it used or in a library. Earlier editions are quite good.p.p.s.

The narrative in offered by this book is straightforward, coherent, and for the most part, an easy read. The chapters have clearly defined themes and chronologies, and the authors do a good job exploring many issues, events, figures, and concepts of the medieval ages.At times it was difficult to keep track of all the various names, as many medieval figures shared similar names. I felt the authors could have done a better job laying out more distinct biographies of some of the figures.There were also times when I had to reread parts because I lost interest due to the tendency of the book to devolve into a simple reiteration of events, ie: The church did this, then certain kings responded in this manner, which caused this event. Whether this is the fault of the writers, something endemic to the material, or my own indolence is debatable, but I still feel the book would benefit with some more color/vibrant writing.Overall, I found it useful in my studies because it offered coherent organization (making content easily accessible), and it was an easy read (for the most part.)"},{"Title":"Medieval Europe; a Short History","review":"I bought this to take on a trip around Western Europe.

More importantly, it does much to dispel the myth that the \\"middle ages\\" were a dark period in European history, instead bringing the richness of the time to life. The ninth edition is a further improvement over previous eds, with its emphasis on medieval women.Modern Europe is largly the product of its medieval roots - part Roman, part Germanic, part Early Christian.

I give it four stars because I believe that the highest ranking should be reserved for works of unparalleled insight and expression. That aside, this is a solid, professional, comprehensive, and accessible piece of work.First published by Dr. Hollister in 1964, the book is now in its Ninth Edition (2002). For this reason, some of the criticisms in the reviews pre-dating the most recent edition are unfounded. (I have a Second Edition, and it is but a shadow of the current volume.)The work of updating the text has been taken over by Dr. Bennett of the University of North Carolina. I believe that the long legacy of the book and its many revisions reflect what does and does not work in an introductory course to the Medieval period. Dr. Bennett's touch is apparent in the steady but fair commentary given to the role of women throughout the long period.Above all, the book is compact and well-organized. While, at times, it may proceed like an outline, that aspect is driven by its scope: Western Europe from late antiquity to the Renaissance, with additional commentary (for context) on Byzantium &amp; the rise of Islam. In fact, the amount of information contained within its 397 pages (paperback version) is impressive.Given its purpose, one cannot expect much digression into painting portraits of the times. What one can expect is a clear and direct exposition of the salient events and major trends of the Medieval period from all angles (political, religious, intellectual, social, economic, artistic, cultural). On that score, it squarely delivers.The signature element of the discussion are the brief asides and analogies to 20th Century American society and culture. They only show up every once in awhile -- not enough to be distracting and certainly witty enough to bring a smile.From &quot;A Short History,&quot; I'd suggest proceeding with Cantor's &quot;Civilization of the Middle Ages&quot; and to the essays in the &quot;Oxford Illustrated History of Medieval Europe.&quot; After that, the door should be wide open to an investigation of whatever detailed aspect of the period a reader might want to pursue."},{"Title":"Medieval Europe; a Short History","review":"It's rare to find a textbook animated by its author's love of the subject matter. And Hollister is a devoted paramour. I had the pleasure of using the seventh edition of this textbook in a medieval history class, and I still have it. Simply put, it's a far-ranging, thorough and fascinating look at the art, events, and culture of the Middle Ages. And as for the previous review's objections to the book: the reason Hollister dismisses the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of Rome as anything but a &quot;Golden Age&quot; are carfeully listed. Infanticide, widespread slavery and poverty (running up to 90 percent), and a closely-bonded upper class that enjoyed the fruits of classical culture without bothering to transmit its fruits to the remainder of the realm. Nor does Hollister object to the Renaissance: he points out that the knowledge and thought processes the Humanists claimed to have rediscovered after the &quot;long sleep&quot; of the Middle Ages were set in motion and used quite well during the High Middle Ages. Humanists were simply more self-consciously &quot;awakened.&quot; HIs critique of Renaissance art (if you can even call it that) is a simple observation of how the priorities of artists were changing by the end of the late Middle Ages. This is masterful stuff. The book makes a very convincing argument that western culture was shaped more by the Middle Ages than anything following. And Hollister's playful sense of humor makes everything go down easy. You've got to love a book that can discuss the problems of urban life in London while adding this observation: &quot;The violence of medieval London may be attributable in part to the existence (in 1309) of 354 taverns and more than 1300 ale shops -- a fact that provides added meaning to the term 'High Middle Ages.'&quot; It's pithy asides like these that reveal the humor and humanity of Hollister's effort, and make you realize that this gentleman is in love with his work, knowledgable about it, determined to learn even more, and brave enough to crack jokes in the super-serious world of academia. A terrific introduction to the Middle Ages."},{"Title":"Medieval Europe; a Short History","review":"I, too, had the pleasure of using this book for an undergraduate class and believe the material to be superbly organized. There seems to be just the right amount of subject headings, and the prose is clear and enjoyable to read. Moreover, illustrations and charts are equally well-placed. Rather than \\"cramming\\" a thousand years of history between its covers, the author works his way through a vast amount of material, omitting the non-essential. It is an outstanding example of what it means to survey a subject.Yes, the author has no great love for ancient Rome and perhaps believes there is too much fuss made of the Renaissance. I do not agree with either sentiment. But the author's opinions, rather than detracting from the book, are nothing but a small though refreshing infusion of personality in an area that is notoriously dry: namely, the college textbook."},{"Title":"Medieval Europe; a Short History","review":"With this review, I hope to offset some of the unfortunate negative reviews listed here. This book is not only informative, but enjoyable to read--I literally couldn't put it down! How often does one say that about a book of Medieval History? I am currently teaching my first few semesters of Music History, and chose this book to help me get a broad generalization of the currents that shaped Western civilization, and ultimately Western culture. Some may say it is too brief in the retelling of history, but I for one found this book to be exactly what I was looking for. A wonderful overview of European history."},{"Title":"Medieval Europe; a Short History","review":"Hollister, C. Warren & Judith M. Bennett 2002 Medieval Europe: A Short History. 9th ed. New York: McGraw-Hill.As an introduction to the Middle Ages, few books could surpass Warren Hollister's Medieval Europe: A Short History. It is a daunting task to write a \\"short\\" history of the thousand or so year period that covers the Middle Ages, but this book does a good job of introducing the reader to the main events, personalities and concepts of the period. Rather than delving too deep into any one concept or event, Hollister surveys the medieval landscape and produces quick summaries of its highlights. The book is organized into chapters chronologically and according to themes. Each chapter presents a timeline of important events and people and sidebars that give a more in depth look at one important personality of that period. The ninth edition was edited and revised by Judith Bennett, who did a wonderful job of filling out some missing areas of Hollister's original. These additions include a glossary of \\"medieval jargon\\" as she terms it, more dates, the timelines and biographical sketches mentioned above and a strong list of suggested readings at the end of each chapter for the reader who wishes to delve deeper into a particular subject.The text of the book is a refreshing contrast to many of the history books in the bookstores today. Rather than being a very dry read, as history can be, Medieval Europe, is ripe with insights and witty comments that many other medieval history books lack. While some may find that such comments have no place in a serious history book, we find that it breaks up the monotony of dates and facts, which can deter many readers from finishing even the first chapter of a book.The reviewers would highly recommend this book to both the student of medieval history, and to those with no background knowledge of medieval history whatsoever. Both categories of readers will find the book entertaining and an easy read, and will gain a basic understanding of the events, personalities, and concepts important to a deeper study of the Middle Ages. That being said, we would not recommend this book to those who already possess a firm knowledge of medieval history, unless they are looking for a quick refresher course of a particular event.Jennifer Regan and Dr. Carl Edwin LindgrenAmerican Military University"},{"Title":"Medieval Europe; a Short History","review":"I read this text for a survey course on medieval history. I found the book to be better than most general history texts I've encountered in the past. The organization is superb and the writing is crisp and to the point. Oftentimes it was difficult to highlight anything because every sentence contains useful facts. Hollister writes with good humor in a subject that often lacks amusing anecdotes. The book starts with a brief view of Roman history and ends with the development of the Renaissance. There are chapters on Byzantium and Islam, as well as sections on medieval art, thought and architecture. Sidebars illuminate important medieval figures such as Hildegard of Bingen.

The author writes in a clear, organized style, though such text-book seriousness is occassionally betrayed by a dry sense of humor.

I originally bought this book to refresh my memory before a Chaucer seminar, and under such circumstances I was well served. I have re-read it since then just for the fun of it. It also makes a good gift for well-read relatives and friends. I do not hesitate in recommending Medieval Europe: A Short History to anyone interested in the topic."},{"Title":"Medieval Europe; a Short History","review":"The ninth edition of _Medieval Europe_ is a very informative, and very readable, introductory text. Professor Hollister compiled the first edition of this book in the 1960s, and its popularity is evident in how many editions have been produced. Professor Bennett updated the text and published this ninth edition in 2002.Bennett's updates and additions are very welcome: she adds a great deal of women's history, as well as expanded sections on socio-economics, and religious history. The general layout of the book is also very attractive; it is not a huge tome that will scare people away, rather a small unassuming paperback. Yet, it is filled with organized and well-researched chapters. The suggested readings at the end of these chapters were particularly helpful for me."},{"Title":"Medieval Europe; a Short History","review":"The first edition came out in 1964, and has become a franchise in the American texts on the subject, now carried forward by a younger historian, J. Bennett. Hollister wrote the first few editions alone, writing clearly and making narrative sense out of the confusion of centuries, peoples, without an overload of academic quarrels, so it is a good book for interested readers who are NOT taking a college course in which the book may be assigned reading. Not a trove of original insight, but a balanced view that incorporates the major ideas of more important historians. Readable, although ultimately academic."},{"Title":"Medieval Europe; a Short History","review":"I am a graduate student who has recently begun teaching first-year undergrads. The Hollister and Bennett book is the main text book for a Medieval Period General course, and the students use it to supplement their core readings. The textbook, a general synthesis of the history of Western Europe, is decent and fairly comprehensive, written and updated by experts in the field. However, it has been a long time since I've read a general textbook, and found the lack of footnote references a bit unnerving.

Although I am now a 48-year old American living in Australia, the book had relevance to me in ways that surprised me.The vivid descriptions of Garrett's surroundings and struggles took me back to my youth in Pennsylvania. To the days of wanting more out of life than just existing in the farmlands, doing my chores around the house, and waiting until I could escape to the wonders of city life.I was transposed back into my life as a teenager and remembered the struggles I had with my father, the lack of real communication and my fierce desire to be independent. It took me longer to realize the love between us than Garrett's journey, but I did get there.I had no aspirations to ride with Jessie James, but Whistle Man had the same romantic appeal to me. The story could have easily been scripted in the Bad Lands of the American West, describing the battles between the landowners, cattlemen, and the mean-spirited railroad companies.What added to my enjoyment of the read was that I had just gotten back from a trip to Melbourne and a ghastly tour of the jail that housed Ned before he was executed. I, like many others, read the plaques and testimonials on the cell walls with wonder and horror of what this man endured. I did have the opportunity to try on a model of Ned's armor and it acted as a time machine and I was one of the gang.The interesting aspect of learning about the Kelly gang before I read the book was that I was even more interested in the era because of the historical facts woven into the fictional character's life. What was real and what was not? It made me want to find out!As to the discrepancy of my age in reading a young adult book? This book was so well written that it made for an easy read and the vocabulary kept it well within my interest level. Plus the story really had no upper age barrier in my opinion.Knowing my mother's taste in literature, a copy is on its way to her in my hometown of Royersford, PA."},{"Title":"Pornography of Meat","review":"In addition to being terribly written and poorly organized, as many other reviewers have noted, it was, at times, borderline offensive. When she equated the slaughter of chickens for food with the raping and beating of a woman, I had to close the book and be done with it. Anyone who would equate those two things has never been raped or beaten and is probably a crazy fundamentalist with wing-nut tendencies.I was hopeful that this book would be a critical and intelligent analysis of the objectification of women in parallel to the sexualization of meat. Instead it was a mash of PowerPoint-esque bullet point statements, poor writing, and disorganization, without any thoughtful analysis or scholarship. It was nothing but anti-meat, anti-sex, anti-man propaganda."},{"Title":"Pornography of Meat","review":"Admittedly, I have not read this book, but I stumbled upon her slideshow/lecture on campus recently, and I definitely do not plan to persue her theory. The connections between sex and meat in the advertising industry seem rather obvious to me. I guess it's nice that she's been devoting so much time to collecting these images, but it's really not anything terribly enlightening. Her approach is not very academic, she has invented some pseudo-intellectual \\"A\\" and \\"not-A\\" categorization, which is again, rather elementary. (Granted, I saw Judith Butler speak the same evening, so the contrast was all the more painful). After her lecture, she was outright rude to a man who wished to respectfully argue with her, then proceeded to push the Bible as her underlying evidence that animals have souls and we should not eat them. Also, her sense of feminism leans a lot more toward femi-nazi-ism, aka one of those feminists who tries to make it a life style rather than a political movement, aka she probably thinks porn is inherently degrading to women. Anyway, as a feminist (in the legal gender equality sense) NON-Christian pescatarian, I was hoping her lecture would be an interesting academic arguement, but I was seriously disappointed. She really gives feminist vegetarians a bad name."},{"Title":"Pornography of Meat","review":"As a person concerned and active in animal rights work, I find this sort of rant abominable.Publishing this whack-job does as much is doing as much for animal rights and women as Oliver Stone has done in &quot;solving&quot; JFK's murder.The idea that this is scholarship is an embarassment to anyone with a brain. A lot of mumbo-jumbo and bad semiotics and flimsy Deconstructionist lit-crit nonsense.It's too bad that hacks like this get encouraged. The saddest thing is, this moron probably at one time had a decent brain, a caring heart, and the best of intentions.Flipping through it is like watching the train wreck of modern education.One can only hope the reading public will put her out of her writing misery."},{"Title":"Pornography of Meat","review":"This more easily digestible offering from Carol J. Adams, furthers the provocative argument put forward in \\"The Sexual Politics of Meat\\" -- that meat eating is an intrinsic part of a patriarchal society.Adam's tells us,\\"Before someone can be consumed or used, she has to be seen as consumable, as usable, as a something instead of a someone.\\"In other words, in order to enjoy pornography, we must forget that the body we are watching is that of a full person who might want to be somewhere other than in front of the camera, naked. And in order to enjoy meat, we must not think of the life of the animal who would rather be out in a field guarding her offspring, than on our plate. Rather, we must think of both as consumable objects.The book is full of visual images that make that link for us. For example, on page 14, we see a roasted chicken, photographed from above, wings crossed behind what should be the head but is the severed neck. A bikini has been painted on the carcass, so we have the impression of a sunbathing woman, roasting in the sun. A link is clearly being drawn between two consumable objects.Adams shares many fascinating images from popular culture in which animals are feminized and women are animalized. Sometimes the analogies are clear, sometimes I find them too much of a stretch. But the pictures and arguments are all thought-provoking. 'The Pornography of Meat' is short and easy to read. It would make a great holiday gift for anybody with an interest in feminism."},{"Title":"Pornography of Meat","review":"\\"The Pornography of Meat\\" seems largely to be a condensed version of Adams's earlier volume, \\"The Sexual Politics of Meat\\". The general premise is the same, as are many of her arguments; however, \\"Pornography\\" is much shorter and easier to wade through.With its informal writing style, \\"Pornography\\" reminds me of a journal-slash-scrapbook as opposed to a more scholarly piece of literature. Adams's writing style can be somewhat disconcerting; she shifts gears rapidly, leaving the reader with the feeling that she's jumping from topic to topic without fully resolving (many of) them. Her arguments are sometimes so abstract and theoretical that they seem enigmatic. Additionally, Adams does provide references, but not in an especially organized manner; as a result, it's hard to tell what information she pulled from which sources.Don't get me wrong, \\"Pornography\\" is not without its redeeming qualities. Every few pages, Adams does hit the reader w/an excellent point, making all the other jargon worthwhile. The pictures (and there are many!) are the book's single best feature - but unfortunately they're all reproduced in black and white, many of them shrunk down to a fraction of their normal size so that the critical details are obscured.One more minor gripe: as one of the leading AR organizations, PETA bears the brunt of anti-ARA criticisms, not all of them invalid. Though Adams does mention PETA's \\"exploitation\\" of women in their ads, the discussion is unfortunately very brief. As PETA is seen as the Church of the AR movement (and leader Newkirk as its Pope), I thought a more detailed discussion would have been appropriate (after all, what's more ironic than sexism in an organization designed to eradicate \\"ism\\"s?).Adams is one of the few feminist writers that tackles the topic of \\"parallel oppressions\\" (speciesism, sexism, racism, etc.). There are painfully few books that deal with such issues, so \\"Pornography\\" is a must for anyone interested in the subject. If you'd like to learn more about feminism in relation to animal rights, this book is certainly worth the price - and is actually one of the few options out there."},{"Title":"Pornography of Meat","review":"As a vegetarian, and as someone who is interested in media and the use of it, I had high hopes for this book. They were sadly not met. The idea is good, but the writing is horrible. Adams is all over the place. Paragraphs jump from one subject to another making no sense at all. It is very hard to follow. And there are few references - instead of foot or end notes Adams uses 'citations' at the back of the book and the reader is left to guess what exactly was cited on the page.There is such a wealth of material available on this topic, and in the hands of a better writer this book would have been truly amazing.Don't buy it."},{"Title":"Pornography of Meat","review":"This is an interesting book. The theory behind it no doubt has a place in our society. However, the evidence used to support this theory is ad hoc at best. As a result there is no limit on the range that Adams attempts to apply her world view. The chapters lack focus as jumps from topic to topic. I would have like a little bit more unity and building up to the individual chapter focus. The other issue is the books lack of theory that works towards etiology. She does not describe an explanation behind her theory and somewhat bashes evolutionary psychologist David Buss who would provide an underlying theory. To be concise, the book is interesting but it is chaotic and appears to regress feminism back to the negative stereotype of the anger femiminst. There are better choices out there on both feminism and animal rights."},{"Title":"Pornography of Meat","review":"The pornography of meat not only adresses the need for intersectional analysis of dominance cultures but does so gracefully, in a historical context and with a lot litterary style. The arguments are well built-up and Carol shows much knowledge in feminist and post-colonial theory. The book covers much ground and returns to the same firm arguments that make it a complete work. When ze evokes Freud that does it for me though, and on single occastions the analysis is one-sided to the extent that I simply feel that there should be an explanation for why two ideas from the same pool seem to be almost contradicting each-other; you can't have the cake and eat it too! But for the most part the book is magnificent and presents its case very simply and adequate. Probably for those who are very easy on reading books which they don't agree on, and people already feminists and vegetarian; for the latter, it should make perfect sense from my perspective."},{"Title":"Pornography of Meat","review":"In my review of theThe Sexual Politics of Meat: A Feminist-vegetarian Critical Theory, 20th Anniversary Edition, I expressed annoyance that Adams, like so many feminists, ties her other causes to feminism (i.e., anyone who is a real feminist ought to be a vegetarian) and wondered if she does the reverse and ties feminism to her vegetarian cause (i.e., is a vegan who doesn't support women's right a real vegetarian?) Well, more or less. Less in that she only obliquely argues that vegetarians ought to espouse feminist viewpoints, but she does take PETA to task for using pornography to sell animal rights. (I have no idea if Ingrid Newkirk, founder of PETA, considers herself to be a feminist.)Unfortunately, in this book, she is, to a lesser extent, doing the same thing with ecological concerns that she did with feminism in the previous book. In general, I think it is simplistic to assume that vegetarianism is automatically more environmentally friendly: crop farming can have serious ecological consequences and have many of the same ethicial issues regarding species considered as vermin. I would hate to have ecological decisions made on such a shallow basis.I will try to be fair: Adams hasn't convinced me, but I'll admit that I'd be a hard sell, so I wouldn't declare the book to be universally unconvincing. Adams seems to have aimed her book, intentionally or not, at the college crowd. After searching the statewide database of public libraries with which Maryland is blessed, I found that I had to drive to the University to read the book, unless I wanted to order it. Moreover, the writing is rather academic. This is not a criticism, Adams has the right to choose her audience, and perhaps this is the sector of the public to go after. It is just not likely to cross the paths of meat-eaters in general.Adams argues that there is an \\"A-List\\", e.g. white, male, human, whose members dominate the \\"non-A-List\\", e.g. non-white, female, nonhuman. She is quite aware that it is possible to be on both lists, but argues that being female trumps being white and moves white women to the \\"non-A-List\\", as least with regard to white men, and and argues that us \\"non-As\\" should stick together. She sees pornography as reducing women to \\"things\\", whose feelings need not be considered, or who are eager to be used as objects, and that similar tactics are applied to meat animals. I shall reflect carefully on this argument; as any statistician knows, arguments from corelations are extremely tricky. The person who wants support for vegetarianism will doubtless find this a good support for their views. I'm not sure that it makes the absolute authoritarian argument that Adams intends.Some cultures exploited animals without reducing them to unregarded things: the Puritan objection to bull-baiting has been distorted to an objection to fun, but in fact it was an argument that inflicting pain on animals for food and clothing was acceptable, but finding amusement in the infliction of pain, or inflicting simply as an amusement, was not. Many Native Americans had the same ethic: hunting was acceptable for supplying daily needs, but not simply as an amusement. If Adams were simply attempting to persuade us that we who can should avoid exploiting animals for work or products, now that industrialization and global trade have made it much easier to do so, I would have no quarrel with her.The arguments gets slightly confused, as these arguments tend to, by Adams' discussions of the treatment of farm animals. That would seem to imply that if animals were raised under more humane conditions, her objections to meat-eating would be reduced, and I don't believe that's the case. Her illustrations include an advertisement from someone who raises organic, free-range chickens, and I presume that is there as another example of unacceptable behavior. She argues that cows are a reverse-protein machine, i.e. they consume more protein than they produce, but this neglects the fact herbivores can eat foods that we cannot and convert it to food that we can. Yes, they are sometimes fed food that people could eat, but since Adams apparently wouldn't approve of eating purely grass-fed cows, their diet is more or less irrelevant to her premise.She also adds a few other issues, like gay pornography, health, and animal snuff movies for masochistic men that I presume are intended to rebuke animal exploitation by association, but which also undermine the central argument. This doesn't even get into the arguments about the fate of domestic species if we cease to exploit them, let alone the question of whether animals would be our wards or our equals.Once again, Adams' ethnography leaves a bit to be desired; inThe Sexual Politics of Meat: A Feminist-vegetarian Critical Theory, 20th Anniversary Edition, she foolishly attempted to link meat-eating to white racism, in this book she attempts to link it to pornography. Modern pornography, she argues, grows directly out of black slavery, which a dubious argument since pornography is not limited to either the present USA since 1600, nor is it limited to African-Americans. Had she attempted to link it to slavery in general it might have been a better argument. She also cites the arguments that whites needed black slaves in order to feel free. Outside of the historical fact that many states banned slavery after the revolution as inconsistent, although, not, alas racism, does she really want to argue that no-one can feel free unless they have a slave class to look down on?Further, she apparently believes the common fallacy that societies that live by gathering are vegetarian. I don't see any particular moral merit in not eating meat purely because it it not as readily available. It might be healthier, but that's another side issue. Adams argues that gatherers often consume insect protein, but is that o.k.? One ad that she includes seems to argue that killing insects is wrong. Moreover, shellfish are considered part of gathering, not hunting. (I don't know where fishing falls into the picture.) Is it o.k. to eat animals in climates where vegetarianism isn't possible, or should people never have moved to such places?I admire the intended kindness behind the arguments without accepting them as a universal moral imperative, or granting Adams the right to rebuke me that she claimed in her earlier book."},{"Title":"Pornography of Meat","review":"Any analysis that examines at the intersections of oppression (in this case speciesism and sexism) is important. Unfortunately, Adams is a scattered, non-linear thinker. Her writing is convoluted and fragmented. If a reader is neither a passionate animal rights advocate nor committed to an anti-pornography perspective, s/he is not likely to be very tolerant of the poor writing. As such, most readers who finish this book are probably already members of the choir. This is unfortunate. I hope Adams finds an articulate co-author for her next book. I give four stars for the ideas in the book, and I give two stars for the writing."},{"Title":"Pornography of Meat","review":"Carol J. Adams is a brilliant thinker. In this book, she takes a complex, emotional subject and breaks it down to basic terms that everyone can understand. The point becomes so painfully obvious that it is irrefutable. We have all been seduced by the pornography of meat, even women and we are the objectified class! When we see other beings (human or animal) as simply \\"parts\\", it is easier to use and abuse them. Domination of \\"others\\" seems to come from fear.We are all, in some form, still operating in our sleep -- unaware of the manipulation. It's time to WAKE UP and this book is an amazing tool that can help."},{"Title":"Pornography of Meat","review":"if christopher guest ever set out to do - in a book about intellectuals - what he has done on film to rock bands and dog shows, The Pornography of Meat would be the result. here is a book that is so bizzarely and feverishly \\"leftist\\" that it seems to defy all reason. the book is a carnival of anti-meat, anti-porn, and anti-man rhetoric that may or may not be true. but, honestly, i can't tell you whether or not it is, because i can't wade through this text seriously. it looks SO MUCH like it was written to act as a parody, that i have a difficult time approaching it as actual scholarship. the basic idea seems to be something like this: there is a distinct and provable relationship between the consumption of meat (or at least media depictions thereof) and the consumption of pornographic movies/magazines, etc.. this all presumably builds from the logic of her first book The Sexual Politics of Meat, which i do not own.the unquestionable highlight of the book are the many pictures that are offered up as evidence of this sordid relationship between porn and meat: the adult video cover where the female character is \\"hunted\\" by lustful men, the 30 year old ad for turkey where the bird carcass is layed out in what we are assured is a purposefully lurid pose. the whole thing is really sort of - excuse the pun - undigestable from the point of view of the skeptic. of course, if you're already a zealous, fervid, wild eyed supporter of these sorts of ideas, then this book will be very gratifying. girls with hairy armpits at liberal-arts colleges in vermont are going to be carrying this around like it was the Bible. the only thing that's missing (though perhaps it's there and i just missed it) was a way to tie all of this in with good old fashioned socialism. you know, the oppression of the masses by the ruling elite? the great future that is bound to come when the terror of property is destroyed and we all live on a big hug-a-bear commune and make arts and crafts and uncomfortable itchy hemp shirts? well, other than that, this book is an angry liberals wet dream.look, let me speak honestly: i'm a man. i don't think of myself as a part of a patriarchy, or as an oppressor or rapist, or even as a good speller. and i do eat meat. plus, i'm a libertarian, which means that everyone regards me as a \\"conservative\\". so, you know, this book obviously wasn't written for me. i appreciate and identify with feminists, but books like this give them a bad name. maybe a book like this is supposed to be so \\"revolutionary\\" that it shocks everyone out of their dogmatic slumbers, but it just comes of as fanatical and - worse - flaky. so, take my ill-informed phallocentric egodriven opinion for what it's worth. read this book. if i'm wrong, WHICH EVEN AS A QUASI-CONSERVATIVE I CAN ADMIT THAT I MIGHT BE, then this book will be very informative. if i'm right, then you're bound to find this as entertaining as i did."},{"Title":"Pornography of Meat","review":"I picked up this book in my library, expecting it to be an interesting cross-study of the use of pornography in conjunction with food. When I read it, I was sorely disappointed.When Adams isn't busy bombarding us with \\"offensive\\" images of pornography and sexualized meat, she's telling us how horrible men are. She can't appreciate beauty, and seems to think if a man likes something, it must be bad. She even identifies the reason that men combine images of sex and food--they crave both of those things on an innate level--but she sarcastically dismisses it.Her constant talk about how men objectify women cites heterosexual pornography a good deal, but she never, even once, mentions the gay male porn industry, and it's quite easy to see why: If she did, her arguments would fall apart like a house of cards. Nor does she mention the fact that every culture in the history of the world (except those with Judeo-Christian roots) objectifies young boys in the same way as they do women.On a final note, don't take seriously anybody who cites Andrea Dworkin more than once, except in ridicule."},{"Title":"Skippack school;: Being the story of Eli Shrawder and of one Christopher Dock, schoolmaster, about the year 1750,","review":"This is a good book.

You follow what it's like to be a young girl in the turn of the century and, in this book, what it's like to be the superintendent of an orphanage.

Then she receives a letter from her dear friend Judy Pendleton (aka Jerusha Abbot from \`Daddy-Long-Legs') asking her to be the new superintendent for the John Grier Home. She's perfect for the job. Persistent, headstrong, and full of love and ideas, she turns the entire establishment upside-down and brings happiness and life to scores of orphans! I love Dear Enemy for its simple complexity. This novel is a companion to Daddy-Long-Legs and, just as its predecessor, is written entirely in letter form. All the letters are from one person, but this time they are addressed to varied characters. There is a depth to the method of writing to more than one person--you sometimes hear many different sides of the same story, or hear details that are omitted to someone else, but on all accounts you grow to love the characters even more. Sallie is pert (at times impertinent), witty and cheerful; In a word, her character is marvelous. She develops over time from the superficial society lady to a strong leader full of depth and courage. The makeover of the JGH is absolutely fascinating! Sallie's ideas are perfect and make you want to emulate them in your own home! She understands children and loves them. I love those little ones and their antics; such fun personalities that shine through the pages. The romance is sweet and deep without going over the top! Another fantastic classic that deserves to be read!

There are dealings with lunacy, illegitimacy, genetics, etc., and sometimes the way they are flippantly described seems a little calloused. But if you remember this was written almost 100 years ago, and that's the way it was done, it becomes more of a history lesson. None of it is shocking or gruesome, though, and I never once felt uncomfortable. There are a handful of swear words--one little orphan is always in trouble and is quoted a few times, along with an angry farmer and an upset politician. But there are probably less than 10 words in the whole book.

While it is certainly a worthy little novel, I have always preferred Dear Enemy, its lesser-known sequel. Daddy Long-Legs is vanilla, sweet and smooth. Dear Enemy is more like mint chocolate chip, refreshing with nuggets of warmth, laughter, bittersweetness. You will be enchanted by the fiery-haired Sallie McBride and her orphans.Sallie has been asked by her college buddy, the Judy Abbott of Daddy Long-Legs, to run the John Grier Home, the orphanage Judy was raised in. A cheerful and unabashed socialite waiting for her Congressman boyfriend to propose, Sallie takes on the job on a temporary basis. Armed with her sense of humor and her firm brightness, along with her maid and her Chow doggie, she gets her heart stolen by the 100 sad-eyed charges.The book is modeled after Daddy Long-Legs, so it is entirely composed of Sallie's stick-figure-illustrated letters to Judy, Gordon (the boyfriend), and the Home's prickly visiting doctor, whose letters are soon addressed \\"Dear Enemy.\\" Her letters catalogue her daily adventures with the sweet, colorful kids, a series of cooks and farmers, sexist trustees, and grumpy neighbors. In all of this, there sparkles a strong feminine spirit, blithe optimism, and clear-headed compassion. The letters read so naturally and sure, Sallie's charm radiates whether she is amusing us with a story of orphan mischief or seriously discussing the consequences of hereditary alcoholism. The pace of the novel also clips along due to the relative shortness of the epistolary style.As beguiling as the characters and story is, there are drawbacks that date the work (written in the 1910's) with its references to inherited behavior, social expectations, and nationalist stereotypes. A historical context is important for those. The overall voice is strong enough to carry the worthwhile messages - particularly, forging a future and identity for girls. I recommend this highly. There are books that you return to time and time again to comfort, entertain, and enlighten you - this is one of those I have treasured from my childhood. They need to bring this one back in print!"},{"Title":"Dear Enemy","review":"This sequel to the classic &quot;Daddy-Long-Legs&quot; follows Sallie McBride through a year running her friend Judy Pendleton's orphanage. Less well-known than &quot;DLL,&quot; &quot;Dear Enemy&quot; is really a better book. This is not a cutesy portrayal of orphans, but an amazingly honest look at the serious, even tragic price kids can pay for their parents'-- and society's -- shortcomings.But there's plenty of fun and humor, and a wonderful realistic-yet-romantic storyline about the importance of making a wise choice. If you want a quality story for girls, Sallie's self-confidence, independence, and intelligent optimism make her a top-notch role-model. Women readers could find a lot to love about this book, too."},{"Title":"Dear Enemy","review":"This book captivates you from the beginning and quickly has you turning pages.

In casual throw aways we learn that the main characters dispose of various defective children without remorse...... they don't want to waste orphanage resources on deaf, epileptic, down syndrome, traumatized children.When they are old enough for historical context we will read this book but I will get a copy with the original illustrations."},{"Title":"Dear Enemy","review":"Judy Abbot, the heroine of Webster's DADDY LONG-LEGS, has purchased her \\"alma mater,\\" the unhappy John Grier Orphanage, and places it into the hands of her college roommate, Sallie McBride. Sallie considers herself as flibbertigibbet and arrives at the school with her pet chow dog and a personal maid, determined to stay only a few months until she can marry her fianc&eacute;, an up-and-coming young lawyer/politician. However, Judy is wiser about Sallie than she is about herself, and Sallie grows to love her position, releasing the children from the browbeating institutional regime that they have previously followed and devising all sorts of new schemes like camps for the older boys that will help the children when they eventually go out into the world.Sallie also runs afoul of the orphanage's dour physician, a Scotsman named Robin MacRae, but as the story progresses, they become each other's ally as well as antagonist (it is from her salutations to him in letters that the title of the book derives).The book contains, unfortunately, the unsettling and bigoted theories of eugenics as practiced in the early part of the 20th century. It's a bit startling and depressing today to hear college-educated adults like Sallie and Dr. MacRae talking about heredity as something that overwhelmes upbringing, so that an alcoholic's child will always need institutionalizing because he will \\"naturally\\" crave alcohol, and watching Sallie sending handicapped children away to asylums because they don't belong with \\"normal\\" children. But this was the prevalent attitude at the time, and it doesn't keep Sallie or MacRae from actually breaking from the trends of the time. In particular, there is a girl named Loretta who is what we would call today \\"mentally challenged.\\" Instead of banishing her to an asylum, Sallie sends her to live with a kindly farm family who basically act like one of today's residential homes for people with Down syndrome. Loretta is treated kindly, blooms into a happy young woman, and learns to do many things rather than spending the rest of her life rocking back and forth in an institution.With all the eugenics twaddle disposed of, what a great story is left: spoiled college socialite finds a social conscience and career, helps children, and eventually finds love with a man who has had some tough times in his life. There is a appealing subplot about three children who have just become orphaned, and a couple want to adopt just the little girl, not her older brothers. Sallie and MacRae quarrel because she at first thinks having the little girl adopted without her brothers would be an accomplishment, but as the doctor protests, Sallie must weigh breaking up the siblings, who are very close, or losing the little girl a good home where she will be given all advantages. Sallie also grows emotionally, becoming dissatisfied with her fiance who merely expects her to be ornamental.A wonderful tale, told in a lively epistlatory format, with some heartbreaking moments."},{"Title":"Dear Enemy","review":"I was pleased to see that this is back in print, but disappointed when I received my copy and discovered that the little drawings Sallie included in her letters have been left out."},{"Title":"Dear Enemy","review":"&quot;Dear Enemy&quot; is a good read, but I was bothered by the eugenics ideas which seem to permeate the book. I would not recommend this book for young readers unless you can also discuss with them that its views on heredity are sorely outdated. Surely the children of barmaids are not all destined to become drunks, thieves and murderers and neither are the children of respectable families all destined to become lawyers and doctors. Unfortunately, the narrow-minded (though appropriate/understandable for the time) discussions on the inevitability of genetic baggage spoiled the rest of the book for me. I don't think I'll read it again."},{"Title":"Dear Enemy","review":"I was so thrilled to find this book for my Kindle - I had read Daddy Long-Legs years ago and was so very pleased to find a sequel. It is a gorgeous book with the warm-hearted Sallie McBride taking over the dreary John Grier Home, where Judy Abbott, the heroine of DDL, spent a miserable childhood. HIGHLY recommended!"},{"Title":"Dear Enemy","review":"I am a fan of Judy Abbott and Daddy Long Legs, but I loved Sallie's letters more! Judy asks her to be the superintendent of the John Grier Home. And Sallie puts her reforms into the practice. The book is consist of Sallie's letters to Judy, to the asylum's doctor, and to her boyfriend. I find this red haired, fierce, Irish girl Sallie and her letters very exciting , funny and humorous. I enjoyed this book a lot, also it is nice to learn somethings more about Judy and Jervis's wedded life."},{"Title":"Dear Enemy","review":"It's nice to see the characters we all so appreciated in Daddy Long-Legs in a different context; I loved getting to know the characters better. It is true that some outdated concepts are presented in the book, but I think it's important to note that Jean Webster seems to question most of those concepts. The characters ultimately seek love over &quot;suitability&quot; and what's right over what's appropriate. Even the concept of eugenics is repeatedly questioned by the main character, who doesn't quite believe the hype but is willing to let a man of science &quot;educate&quot; her. Yes, the book is dated (as was its predecessor, to some extent), but the story and characters it contains are timeless."},{"Title":"Applied physics","review":"Apparently, editions of this book have come out every 3 years or so, according to the copyright page. Given that it is aimed at the high school and first year undergrad level, you might wonder about the need for this. The subject is not even one like molecular biology or politics, where perhaps revisions are often needed at an introductory level of discussion.The Applied Physics refers to how the authors strive to motivate a possibly uninterested and listless reader in the fun of physics. Daresay that most such readers will put fun in quotes. So there are many examples, and colour photos, sprinkled throughout the text, in which elementary physics is applied in daily situations. As you could expect from an 8th edition, the prose is polished and the logic is well done.A cynic could say that an earlier edition would have been just as adequate."},{"Title":"Applied physics","review":"I bought the book used, it has minor wear n tear but its all good.

It's a short story to be read in one sitting. Of course with the Kindle version you don't get Beatix's wonderful artwork but my kids don't seem to care. And for the price it fits my budget perfectly. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"THE TALE OF JEMIMA PUDDLE-DUCK","review":"I was disappointed by the reviews left for this book in its various formats. But at $1.50 bargain book, I figured how bad could it be? The sounds were different but catchy, my kids liked them (they were short songs rather than sound effects for the most part). My book came with 6 sounds, the picture here says it comes with 5. The book was of good quality but the sound effects buttons were hard for my kids to press (I had no problem myself).The story itself was only so-so but wasn't as bad as others made it out to be. In short, a duck wants to lay her eggs in private. A fox offers his hut. She lays eggs and he suggests she gather some herbs so that they can have dinner to celebrate. The duck mentions it to the farm dogs who are suspicious and follow her to the hut where they chase away the dog. Yes, I suppose the story goes that a fox tricks the duck into leaving her brood unattended so that he can eat her eggs. But this is never shown and not alluded to much (there was no picture of an empty nest or anything like that) so my kids totally missed what some parents picked up on. Also, the farm dogs do not then kill the fox as some mistakenly say. The text says that the fox was \\"never seen again\\" and the picture shows the dogs chasing the fox away. My kids thought it meant that the fox wanted to eat the duck but the dogs scared it away - happy ending and everyone was satisfied. For $10 or more this book may not be worth it. But for under $5 it is a bargain."},{"Title":"THE TALE OF JEMIMA PUDDLE-DUCK","review":"I purchaced my grandson baby china from wedgwood with Jemina Puddle-Duck pattern on it.

Where ever Jemima was she would get caught and her eggs were taken away. Then one day Jemima Puddle-Duck went looking for a place to hatch her eggs. She saw a forest down a hill and started to run for it. She flew down and saw a stump that would be nice to site on but a gentleman was sitting on it reading a newspaper. So Jemima started to quack and he looked at her. He thought she was lost and asked her if she was but really Jemima wasn't. She told him she was looking for a place to hatch her eggs, so he took her back to his house where he has a place full of feathers that would be nice. Jemima kept going to his house and one day she decided to stay there until they were hatched. The gentleman told her he was going to cook an omlette for her so he told her to go get some supplies. She did and saw a friend and told him the hole story and one day he went to see her at the gentlemans house. What happened at the end of the book?

It contains images of danger and death and the main character, Jemima, is portrayed as inept and stupid. I realize that millions of kids have enjoyed this book over the years, but my child will have to wait until she's old enough to understand these concepts and not be frightened by them."},{"Title":"THE TALE OF JEMIMA PUDDLE-DUCK","review":"I always had Beatrix Potter down as an avatar of Home Counties tweeness, with her anti-modern paeans to the countryside and de liddle cuddly animals. So the unsentimental brutalities of this story came as a welcome shock. 'Jemima Puddle-Duck' is as endearingly hopeless as her name suggests, unable to tend her eggs in the overcrowded barn she shares with some supercilious hens. She flies over the forest in search of a suitably solitary spot, and comes across a helpful gentleman dressed in tweed, reading 'The Sporting Times'. He is a fox, and invites her to make use of his summer residence, in particular the shed carpeted with the feathers of previous victims. Dazzled by his good breeding, Jemima accepts his offer and visits daily. When the eggs are about to hatch, Foxy suggests she bring along various goodies so they can have a charming goodbye party...The unremitting violence in this story does not emanate from where you'd expect, and this clear-eyed vision of the natural order of things, of brute force vs. cunning, takes place in the most idyllic setting yuou can think of, a richly detailed rural England, its hills and plants alive and painted in the most soothing colours. But even this balmy backdrop plays out a cycle of struggle for domination, with spiders eating flies, and various other creatures being horrid to one another.Written at the turn of the 20th century, just before female emancipation, it's hard not to see the woebegotten Jemima as an image of women's fate in a world run by men, both good and bad, with the fox as parisitic aristo in straitened circumstances, and the dog as paternalistic liberal. Indeed, the whole thing plays like an Emile Zola potboiler disguised as toddler fodder. Upsetting, cruel and marvellous."},{"Title":"THE TALE OF JEMIMA PUDDLE-DUCK","review":"This IS the story of Jemima Puddleduck, and it can be read to children. It loses a lot of its interest value without the pictures, but the story is still good."},{"Title":"THE TALE OF JEMIMA PUDDLE-DUCK","review":"The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck was the first Beatrix Potter book I read when I was young. It is the tale of a barnyard duck named Jemima who wishes to hatch her own eggs instead of leaving the task to the hens. She decides to leave and find a place to nest and encounters a polite gentleman with sandy whiskers who so kindly offers his help. It is a charming tale, as so many of Ms. Potter's stories are, complete with an endearing if not somewhat naive duck, a handsome yet sly fox and a wise old collie dog. The illustrations are quite nice, with some beautiful countryside scenes of Sawrey where the author lived. This story is a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"THE TALE OF JEMIMA PUDDLE-DUCK","review":"THE TALE OF JEMIMA PUDDLE-DUCK is one of Beatrix Potter's lesser known tales, but it is still a favorite in our house. Jemima is a duck who wishes to hatch her own eggs. Apparently it is common on farms for hens to sit on duck eggs. Ducks in general, and Miss Jemima in particular, do not have the patience to sit on a nest for 28 days, so farmers transfer the eggs to hens. Jemima, however, is quite determined to hatch her own brood, and searches for a calm, quiet place to do so. In a secluded clearing, she meets an elegantly dressed gentleman with a long bushy tail, who is reading a newspaper. Jemima thinks he is mighty civil and handsome, and he is very solicitous of her plight. Jemima takes the sandy colored gentleman up on his offer of a safe, dry place to hatch her eggs. But there is more to this gentleman than meets the eye. Is he really as selfless as he seems?THE TALE OF JEMIMA PUDDLE-DUCK quietly and deftly teaches children to be wary of strangers. This simple tale completely captures the imagination of young ones as they follow Jemima on her misadventures. As always, it is Ms. Potter's charming illustrations that are the true star of this book. Jemima looks like a real duck, albeit one who is wearing a bonnet and cape. The soft colors and rich detail of the original drawings continue to delight children of all ages.My three year old has a special affinity to THE TALE OF JEMIMA PUDDLE-DUCK. Whenever the story refers to Jemima's sister-in-law, Mrs. Rebecca Puddle-duck, my wee one says, \\"That's me, Momma!\\" Any book that captures the imagination of my little puddle-duck is a winner with me."},{"Title":"THE TALE OF JEMIMA PUDDLE-DUCK","review":"I recognize that this is a classic, and can be weighed on its literary merit in that regard. From the perspective of women's history and the allegories in the story-- fine.However, this is a brutal story. The tragedy of the mother-figure losing all of her eggs to dogs, and then only being allowed to keep some of her second set of eggs is deeply disturbing to both kids and potentially adult readers. There is enough real-world tragedy without adding this story into the mix for leisure reading. Better to discuss those realities with kids, when they are old enough, than to introduce a brutal read disguised as an animal story."},{"Title":"THE TALE OF JEMIMA PUDDLE-DUCK","review":"I thought this was such a horrible book. So the duck runs away, shacks up with a fox who is going to eat her eggs. The duck tells a dog who brings his puppies to \\"save\\" the duck and her eggs. They kill the fox and then eat her eggs.

There's something appealing about the ditzy Duck and her adventure with the sly, charming and untrustworthy Fox. Something very organic, particularly when you add the wonderful saving graces of the dog, and Potter's steady scrutinizing eye and prose. Her pace is impeccable.I must say, the negative reviews shock me! Whatever must you think of Grimm's tales?Silly, feckless Jemima is merely a slice of real life, the way life used to be. I adore her for it.Once Upon a Time, most people lived on farms, and so the idea that a duck might not sit her nest (they don't sometimes) or that she and her eggs were in danger from foxes was as familiar to children as moronic video games and the TV shooter are to today's \\"natural-world\\"-impoverished children.Chuck the TV shooter.Read the kids Jemima.

Some consider Mr. Frost to be a New England poet, but many people have now discovered in his poetry universal themes crafted for expression by the persona of a Yankee farmer, a profession by the way that Mr. Frost never suceeded in despite the fact that he owned several farms during his lifetime.

Their concern is with men as individuals, or , more exactly with man in his individuality and social relationships, and in his private thoughts.

I bought this book whilst a student there, because many of the books of Marxist criticism available took a rather pro-Marxist view, of sorts. They mostly viewed Marxism as something about 'revolutions in the head' rather than as the rational project it was when written. Len Jackson shows how Marx has been 'dematerialized' in the mid to late 20th century by philosophers reducing Marxism to an ideology stripped of its most convincing doctrine - that of economic infrastructure determining social superstructure. Jackson is not a Marxist, and not being so deals very evenly with his subject in a way that does not assume prior knowledge of the subject."},{"Title":"The Original Road Kill Cookbook","review":"We had purchased this book prior for a friend for Christmas.

She writes this book for the layperson, guiding us to use remedies that are easy to find in our local health food stores. One can tell that she has seen these remedies work and that she believes in them. I have read books of remedies in the past but they are presented in a theoretical fashion. Dr. Dean is writing from experience! What I love about this book is that she clearly describes what can cause the ailment, what the variety of symptoms might be, and how to deal with very specific symptoms using herbs and/or homeopathy. When I have looked up a particular illness, I have come away with easy-to-do solutions that worked. Yes they worked.In addition to the compendium of health problems and treatments, Dr. Dean provides us with a straightforward description of homeopathy and how it works. Accompanying this description is a listing of different homeopathic and herbal remedies and the very precise conditions that they are used to treat.I particularly enjoyed the section of the book entitled Advice and Information. Dr. Dean gives her \`natural' insight to illuminate topics like antibiotics, surgery, x-rays, and dieting. Without being preachy, Dr Dean encourages us to consider the impact of non-natural substances in our food and environment.In conclusion, Dr Carolyn Dean's Natural Prescriptions for Common Ailments is a practical, easy to follow and valuable guide to self-care using natural substances. An extra bonus is that it is a really interesting and informative book to just sit down and read.

If you like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or Barney the Purple Dinosaur, this book may be for you. Yeah, this book changed my life.........for the worse. The 6 hours of mindless, self-absorbed fantasy drivel in audio form nearly sent me looking for a hanging tree. I stuck it out to the bitter end hoping this story would just END. I didn't care if the guy got hit by a train or got VD from one of his numerous trysts or if he ever figured ANYTHING out. I guess this crap sells: I bought it.If you want to change your life forever, look elsewhere for guidance.

I've read and heard so much about this book and from the get-go...well I had to let it go and quickly. So bad. It appears that another get-rich-scheme has come and gone, with Mr. Millman being the winner. I wouldn't pay 50 cents for this book, I'm glad I didn't add to the profits by actually buying this. The library had a copy available. save your money. This is a work of fiction and a bad one at that. Not some life-changing read that you can't live without. Soooo bad!"},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"Thats all I can say. Its a childish stupid book. Its ok for an 8 year old. Its naive and fantasy like. I dont know but I cant be inspired about personal growth by some ghostly figure at a gas station that teleports itself from here to there in 0.5 seconds. I'm not sure why so many people are rating it high or what they liked in it. Repeating some other 1-star reviews:- \\"This is real drivel, that might be considered precocious if written by a 12-year old\\"- \\"This book is a dip in a kiddy pool, let's try for the deep end.\\"- \\"Way of the Peaceful Warrior changed me. It transformed me into a being who will never trust the title of a book again.\\" (lol)With that I also support another reviewer's comment that Nathaniel Branden is much better, if you're looking for realistic, non-gas station super man stuff.This really tells me how bad a highly reviewed item can actually be. I will pay more attention to negative reviews now. Thank you, Dan Millman. If the book was useful for any of you, more power to you."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"This is a reasonable fairy tale which can help to pass the time while on the train. However it is very simplistic and not at all inspiring since it's nothing you haven't heard a million times before. The 'insight' into life is given through a mystical, supernatural old hippie called socrates - this makes the story far too abstract and cannot be applied to real life. Dan Millman has made a lot of money out of some very gullible people. If you want to know about the meaning of life etc then go to the experts and read the views of a real philosopher. Hey..what about Socrates. Or else, try 'Sophie's World' by Josteein Gaardner, which is a far more insightful and intelligent read."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"If you expect to discover bad habits, change your attitude, and improve your life just by reading a book....good luck. Everyone should know that it takes hard work, self-knowledge, and lots of time. Still, Dan Millman tells a compelling semi-autobiography that resonates with many readers, including this one.It's heavy on sports analogies, which I don't identify with, much, but insightful reading can apply it to other frustrations in life.I would purchase this book again for myself, or for someone else on the given conditions: 1) that you feel something is wrong with your level of happiness and you need to identify and follow someone's trials, 2) that you know something is wrong and can't quite identify it, or 3) that you are in a transitionary stage - between jobs, between mates, between goals. If you don't fall into any one of these categories, or if your intended reader doesn't, you probably won't get anything useful from this story.Having written the above, I sincerely believe that this book is an engaging and easily digestible recipe for improving self-awareness regarding your life, your goals, and your frame of mind.I give this work 3 of 5 stars because it's good, but it wouldn't be included in my desert island library."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I found this tale to be both boring and a waste of time. I wouldn't suggest this book be read by anyone over the age of 14."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"The sub-title here peaks the curiosity in saying \\"A book that changes lives.\\" -Which makes you want to get right in the book and find out what it's about. I read this in 2 sittings. I enjoyed it so much I didn't want to put it down. Reading it through is almost inevitable the first time, but I think this book deserves to be read slowly so that the lessons and points can sink into your mind. As I was reading, I found myself wanting to take notes, but couldn't stop reading to do so. There is so much here to learn, and it's presented well.This book is about a man who 'stumbles' upon his guru who teaches him lessons in both life and spirituality, and of disciplining one's mind and thoughts.This book reminded me a lot of \\"The Millionaire's Secrets, Life Lessons in Wisdom and Wealth.\\" There's an abundance of information here on how to \\"awaken\\" from our dream, written in story form. I think the novel style is helpful to us in remembering the information better. Humor mixed throughout also helps to bring the messages across in a real way.Excerpt:\\"To really get it, you must observe yourself to see what I mean. You have an angry thought bubble up and you become angry. It is the same with your emotions. They're your knee-jerk responses to thoughts you can't control. Your thoughts are like wild monkeys stung by a scorpion.\\""},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I found this book a true inspiration!

Wouldn't that be a great example of what this book encourages?"},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"Having written extensively in this genre myself,The Evolution of Thought (The Great Flood of Western Thought)andA Ripple in Time (Time Without End), I would say that this is definitely one of the books that changed my life. There are a few cliches thrown in here and there, and you might get a sense of \\"Modern American Buddhism\\" throughout, but I don't have a problem with any of that. If you work in an office, enjoy sitting behind a desk and enjoy living an \\"ordinary life\\", you're not going to \\"get\\" this book. But if, on the other hand, you are open to, and accept the tagline \\"There are no ordinary moments,\\" then this is a book that does have the power to change your life.But you're only going to get out of it what you're willing to put in.

Cheers and wishes for continued happiness."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I am going to keep this review simple and to the point. 'The Way of the Peaceful Warrior' is one of the best books I have ever read. A good American friend of mine lent it to me whilst I was studying in Germany and I couldn't put it down. I was constantly thinking up excuses to feed my friends so I could slip away and read another chapter. The language of the book is simple and easy to read. The moral content of the story is more profound and so I think it is fitting that the language is basic. The spiritual messages are easily accessible. What you do after you have accessed them is up to you, however. Having said that, I would not want anyone to think that the book's language is like a young child's school reading book. Some parts are extremely well written and poetic.I persoanlly thought that it was the most profound and spiritually uplifting book I have ever read. Another friend of mine, however, read it and when asked afterwards what she thought, pondered the question for a moment before saying 'I guess it IS important to laugh'. I think she missed the point... several points the size of elephants.This book will not be everyone's cup of tea as we say here in England. You may find the medium which the author uses to tell his story and to get his message across simply too unbelievable. You have to be willing to just suspend disbelief in order to enjoy this book and get anything out of it.I was walking around on a spiritual high for weeks after reading this book. I just bought my own copy and am about to start reading it again. I vowed to myself after I finished reading it the first time that I would not forget some of the life-lessons the book taught me.That's all I have to say. I hope this book will inspire others as much as it inspired me."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"Simply put, in shining, simple prose, Dan Millman conveys many lessons and great inspiration through his book &quot;The Way of the Peaceful Warrior.&quot; Some of my fellow reviewers enjoyed this book and some didn't. I believe that you have to be ready to read a book like this, and that you absolutely must be open. Most people are too caught up in illusions like knowledge (see reviews) to appreciate the full benefits of the story, even when the limits of knowledge are unquestionably pointed out. This is all part of our individual progress. However, for those of us ready to think about it openly &quot;Peaceful Warrior&quot; can be a great book indeed. Also, heed Dan's words from &quot;Living on Purpose,&quot; &quot;ten percent of what I say may be wrong for you at this particular time, so listen with healthy skepticism and take with you only what you find useful.&quot; I challenge all of you, those that liked it, and those that didn't, to &quot;empty your teacup,&quot; as it were, and try reading it again without imposing your assumptions on it.Best wishes for all,Allan"},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I read this book when I was in my twenties and it has remained on of my all time favorites even 20 years later. I have re-read it a number of times and this summer I encouraged my 13 year old to read it before we saw the movie \\"Peaceful Warrior\\" based on this novel that came out this summer. I feel that the book lived up to the sub-title \\"A book that changes lives\\". It certainly changed mine. The images and personalitites of the characters stayed with me years after I read it. It was a book like no other I had ever read. Rather than just being another self-help book, Way of the Peaceful Warrior put concepts that I had been thinking about and stuggling to understand, into a story that brought everything to life and was wonderful to read. It showed me that you can be both a warrior and peaceful which is the most important lesson of all."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I read this book years ago; however, every time I pick it back up, I find something more inside of it to appreciate. The story is so good because:A) it's a true story about real suffering and growthB) it's just as much about the main character's inner journey as it is about his external one.This book was highly relevant to me because it describes in Western terms, the essence of a traditional guru-disciple relationship. This relationship is as old as time, and most of the greatest world's teachings have been passed on directly in this way. As a student of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Zen philosophies with a personal mentor myself, everything that Dan's mentor, Socrates, said in the book rang true. It's one thing to simply read about ideals, but how many people truly practice them? That's where the mentor becomes so important - they are the external observer necessary to check on our real progress and keep us on course. Most people live like Dan did before he met Socrates; Dan was insulated from the world by a thick cloud of judgments and reactions to every experience that came his way. Little, if any, knowledge he had was based on real experience or wisdom. The sequence of conversations he has with Socrates form a rich dialogue that progressively opens Dan up to deeper truths about life and what it means to really be happy. Whenever Dan deliberately tries to impress Socrates with his egotistical side, Socrates shows him how much he is making a fool of himself. Yet when Dan is forced by a sudden turn of events to learn how to become humble, then the lessons really begin. Many people have termed any spiritual pursuit as an escape from the world and its problems; yet Socrates confirms that after you give up your attachments, you do not try to escape from anything- you embrace your challenges instead with real focus and clarity.On the superficial level, it's an impressive story about a young man who turns a devastating tragedy into a stepping stone for success and fame; however, don't stop there. If you read carefully, you'll see that even by the end of the story, Dan has just begun a new journey that's about much more than \\"how to succeed\\"- he is learning how to really live for the first time.-Joy S. Williams (author)"},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I can always tell when I have found a good book because either I finish the book in 24 hours of reading time OR my hand develops a mind of its own and begins systematically highlighting the important contents of the book.When I encounter a book that I do BOTH . . . then I know I have found a GREAT book worthy of typing up the important points that are in colorful highlighting. Since I see most people are giving positive reviews and I'm one to read the 5 and 1 star reviews to assist in making my choices, I have decided to paste the points that I highlighted in the book and those of you who find the information interesting and would like to read it in full context can buy the book.Terms and Reminders from \\"Way of the Peaceful Warrior\\"Body Wisdom - Everything you'll ever need to know is within you; the secrets of the universe are imprinted on the cells of your body.Understanding - the one-dimensional comprehension of the intellect. It leads to knowledge.Realization - the three-dimensional, simultaneous comprehension of head, heart and instinct; comes from direct experience.Life requires more than knowledge; it requires intense feeling and constant energy. Life demand right action if knowledge is to come alive.You have to cleanse your body of tension, free your mind of stagnant beliefs and open your heart to loving-kindness.The best performers have the quietest minds during their moment of truth.Dis-illusion - is literally a \`freeing from illusion'.In your habitual quest for achievement and entertainment, you avoid the fundamental source of your suffering.Your mind is your predicament. It wants to be free change, free of pain, free of the obligations of life and death. But change is a law, and no amount of pretending will alter that reality.Life is not suffering; it's just that you will suffer it, rather than enjoy it, until you let go of your mind's attachments and just go for the ride freely, no matter what happens.Brain - directs the body, stores information and plays with that information. The brain's abstract processes are \`the intellect'.Brain and Mind are not the same. The brain is real, the mind is not.Mind - an illusory reflection of cerebral fidgeting. It is all the random, uncontrolled thoughts that bubble into awareness from the subconscious. An obstruction; an aggravation; a kind of an evolutionary mistake in the human being; a primal weakness in the human experiment. I have no use for the mind.Consciousness is not mind; awareness is not mind; attention is not mind.When you can't stop thinking of that math problem or phone number, or when troubling thoughts and memories arise without your intent, it's not your brain working, but your mind wandering.Your mind - not other people or your surroundings - is the source of your moods.Observing how you become angry when you notice that another is not the least bit upset.Stressful thoughts reflect a conflict with reality. Stress happens when the mind resists what is.The thoughts that assail you are actually created by you.Stop taking yourself so seriously.When you are in trouble, let go of your thoughts to see through your mind.Silence is the warrior's art - and meditation is his sword.The highest purpose of the human body is to become a clear channel for this light - so that its brightness can dissolve all obstructions, all knots, all resistance.Attention - the intentional channeling of awareness.Real Meditation - to expand awareness; to direct attention; to ultimately surrender to the light of consciousness.Meditation consists of two simultaneous processes:1. Insight - paying attention to what is arising.2. Surrender - letting go of attachment to arising thoughts.This is how you cut free of the mind.Relax and stop acting so serious! (Do you see a pattern here?)You still believe that you are your thoughts and defend them as if they were treasures. Your stubborn illusions are a sinking ship. Let them go while there's still time.Consciousness is not in the body; the body is in Consciousness. You are that Consciousness.Body - is Consciousness; never born; never dies; only changes.Mind - your ego, personal beliefs, history and identity - is all that ends at death.Sitting meditation is the beginner's practice. Eventually, you will learn to meditate in every action. Sitting serves as a ceremony, a time to practice balance, ease, and divine detachment. Master the ritual before you expand the same insight and surrender fully into daily life.Emotions are not the problem. The key is to transform the energy of emotion into constructive action.Food:First, give your complete attention to what you are making.Second, love is one of the primary ingredients in everything you make.Purifying, regenerative practices are essential.You'll need to refine every human function - moving, sleeping, breathing, thinking, feeling - and eating. Of all the human activities, eating is one of the most important to stabilize first.That means your good habits must become so strong that they dissolve those which are not useful.Eat only what is wholesome and eat only as much as you need.The pleasure from eating is more than the taste of the food and the feeling of a full belly. Learn to enjoy the entire process - the hunger beforehand, the careful preparation, setting an attractive table, chewing, breathing, smelling, tasting, swallowing, and the feeling of lightness and energy after the meal. When you pay attention to all elements of the process, you'll begin to appreciate simple meals.Avoid foods that contain refined sugar, refined flour and meat as well as coffee, alcohol, tobacco, or any other drugs.Focus on fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes.Breakfast: fresh fruit meal with occasional yogurt.Lunch: your main meal should be a raw salad, baked or steamed potato and wholegrain bread or cooked grains.Dinner: should be a raw salad and, on occasion, lightly steamed vegetables. Make good use of raw, unsalted seeds and nuts at every meal.Find your thrills in fresh air, fresh food, fresh water, fresh awareness and sunshine.Let feelings flow; then let them go.Any unconscious, compulsive ritual is a problem. But specific activities are both bad and good; every action has its price, and its pleasures. Recognize both sides; then you can make the warrior's free and conscious choice - to do or not to do. Responsibility means recognizing both pleasure and price, action and consequence, then making a choice.My actions are conscious, spontaneous, intentional and complete.There are no ordinary moments! Treat every moment as special, worthy of your full attention.Satori - a Zen concept; occurs when attention rest in the present moment, when the body is alert, sensitive, relaxed and the emotions are open and free.Your task is to expand this clarity into your daily life. Satori must become your everyday reality. Satori is your key to the gate.Meditating an action is different from doing it. To do, there is a doer, a self-conscious \`someone' performing. When you meditate an action, you've already released attachment to the outcomes. There's no \`you' left to do it. You become what you do, so your action is free, spontaneous, without ambition, inhibition or fear.The master dedicates his training to life.House Rules reveal that you can control your efforts, not outcomes. Do your best; let God handle the rest.The birth of the mind is the death of the senses.Jesus of Nazareth once said you must become like a little child to enter the Kingdom of Heaven.The dry concepts of the mind obscure your direct perception.You have to \`lose your mind' before you can come to your senses.There are two ways to be rich:1) You earn, inherit, borrow, beg or steal enough money to meet all your desires; or2) You cultivate a simple lifestyle of few desires; that way you always have enough money.A peaceful warrior has the insight and discipline to choose the simple way - to know the difference between needs and wants.The secret of happiness is found in developing the capacity to enjoy less.There is the way of the peaceful warrior and the way to the peaceful warrior. As long as you tread the way, you are a warrior. The way is now; it always has been.A fool is \`happy' when his cravings are satisfied. A warrior is happy without reason. That's what makes happiness the ultimate discipline. Happiness is not just something you feel - it is who you are. Sometimes sorrow, sometimes joy. But beneath it all, remember the innate perfection of your life unfolding. That is the secret of unreasonable happiness."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"One of My favorite books.

Little did I know that after reading it I was forever changed by what Socrates had taught and said! I had to have more! So, I dove in and read all of Dan Millman's writing that I could get a hold of! ... and each one changed my life! Thanks Dan!"},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"Having heard it mentioned on more than one occasion that \\"Way of the Peaceful Warrior\\" was a life-changing story, I felt compelled to pick up a copy. I ordered one used from Amazon.com, and quickly started reading as soon as the item arrived. It didn't take long before I found myself completely enthralled in the story. The author does a good job telling a story that we can all relate to. Whether I believe that this is non-fiction is a different review in itself. However, I absolutely loved this book. As a forewarning, this story includes several Buddhist principles, and the author does not try to finesse them at all. However, the lessons provided within these pages are definitely worth while to people looking for some inspiration. I highly recommend this book for anyone looking for something different."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"Excellent book that truly forces you to analyze the weaknesses in your life and how to change them.

I wish that I hadn't waited so long. An easy read that is full of insight."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"Let me start by admitting that I found the book very riveting except in some of the places where they start narrating 'stories'. And even within the fantasy the events seemed to be lifted from old Zen stories (for example, where Socrates keeps filling the fuel tank even though it is full - just to drive home the point that you if you are full of ideas you cannot receive wisdom). All these (like carrying the woman over the water, illegitimate child, etc) were picked up from the wonderful bookZen Flesh Zen Bones: A Collection of Zen and Pre-Zen Writingspublished in the late 1950s. The book is also a lot irrational: the mind trips caused by Socrates touching Dan, erasing of the memory of Joy by a touch, etc., look implausible. But what I found interesting was the way Dan struggles through life to evolve physically and spiritually - that part was depicted admirably well. I wish the author had acknowledged where he got his ideas from and come clean. Once you don't acknowledge the source of stories it makes you wonder where else he has copied the other 'undetected' parts... If you haven't read much Zen, then this is a definite must read esp if you treat this as a fantasy and not as a real story."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I've seen Way of the Peaceful Warrior floating around for a few years now, but for a book that was a national bestseller, the only place I ever saw it, and I repeat, the ONLY place I ever saw it was at a gun show. Strange.Looking at the cover, and reading the title, I got the impression this was a book about a wanderer who came to hang out at a gas station, a quiet, calm man who was also a great brawler, held with strong moral codes and beliefs, somewhat like Cain on the old \\"Kung Fu\\" TV show.Instead, \\"Socretes\\" is an old gas station attendant with seemingly magical powers and unique worldview, who inspires the author in his own spirtual quest.I can't claim this book has really \\"changed my life,\\" but it has made me think. Among the lessons I've learned by reading this book are: There are no ordinary moments, eat properly, live NOW and HERE, enjoy what you have, and take full responsibility for your actions."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"&quot;Way of the...&quot; shows how a gymnast named Dan realizes that his way of thinking, living, and being is inherently flawed and self defeating, by way of a mysterious teacher.The book is good in it's presentation, and also I found it very inspiring. The warrior's life almost exactly mirrors a very Buddhist ideal, but never made mention of that, which I thought was good, so as not to promote one thing, and make the book's message fully available to everyone.So why 4 stars? My main problem with this book was it's portrayal of anyone living the warrior's life as being some sort of mystic or magician. I didn't mind Socrates' jumping, or some other things like that, but I thought sometimes the whole visions thing, the glowing, and especially Socrates' death were really too much. When Socrates touches Dan on the head and makes him forget something I think that it serves very little purpose in the book, and just makes it seem more surreal.Also, the role that &quot;Joyce&quot; played, and Socrates' death were a little too neat and tidy for me. It was just wrapping itself up like a Disney movie for adults.This book could have been written in a more down to earth sense that would have made the warrior's life and the whole message of the book seem closer to people instead of something that you have to train hours a day for, and totally change yourself, etc. I did however like Dan's focusing not only on the mental/emotional/intangible elements of training, but also physicality as well. I think some books on Buddhism would be good accompanying texts for this."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"Dan Millman is one of the greatest writers of our day. I am most thankful for a friend introducing this book to me several years ago. It was a first step in my own re-awakening. It is an amazing story of how the strongest teachers in our lives are always the ones we least likely will expect. And I thank Dan Millman for being one of mine."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"This is an interesting book, but not one I would say that is so immensely profound, as the cover suggests. (A book that changes lives) It made me want to be more disciplined, and to clear the mind of excesses. But I had a few problems with the story. Maybe it was written so that even a ten year old could understand it. I had trouble with the fact that this man had no real, long,intimate relationships with anyone other than Socrates. His marriage was also pushed aside, like it didn't really matter who he hurt on his path to self enlightenment. I also had trouble believing that he could become so submissive to somebody whose real name was kept secret.Does vegetarianism and drinking herbal tea really make that much of an impact? Beside those points it was a good book, I read it in two days.

It agitated and enlightened and then it moves on in rushed cough. It falls apart I hate to say towards the end. It is rushed and runs out of true spirit. Socrates would make Zorba proud I think but He would make Kazanzakis throw up. The book treds as if in deep water but in truth it is merely fighting little waves on the smooth sandy sure. Overall I liked it though it left a bitter taste in my mouth. I'm glad I read it. I am probably a little more disciplined in my life since.

It recreates in vivid detailhis experiences with &quot;Socrates&quot;, a man who tells him more aboutlife than anyone else had or ever would. The book creates many questions about lifewhich can only be answered by the reader. Best of all, it leaves a quiet tranquility in the reader'ssoul, suitable for meditation.&quot;Way of the Peaceful Warrior&quot; is definitely one of the bestbooks I have ever read. I wholeheartedly reccomend it."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I was looking for the life lessons that I found in the way of the peaceful warrior, this was more Harry Potter meets Karate Kid."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I was encouraged by the reviews, as well as a college-athlete-roommate, to pick up this book. But my expectations were not met at all, probably because I'm just not in tune with all this new-age stuff going around these days. I certainly won't pick up 'The Celestine Prophecy' now! I read the amazon.com interview w/Dan Millman, and noted that a favorite of his is Hesse's 'Siddhartha', which strikes a cord, because that's a favorite of mine as well. -That was a book that brought about much reflection and insight- but for some reason, 'The Way of the Peaceful Warrior' fails to evoke these responses. Maybe I let the excessive melodrama of Dan's character get to me. Or maybe it was the writing style in general. I mean, what do you think of this??: &quot;But Joy, you know I want you to be with me always. I want to have children with you and keep you warm at night. Our life could be so fine together.&quot; &quot;Danny,&quot; she said, &quot;there's something else I should have told you before. I know I look and act-well, the age you might expect me to be. But I'm only 15 years old.&quot; I stared at her, my jaw slack. &quot;That means that for months I've had an awful lot of illegal fantasies.&quot; All three of us laughed, but my laughter was hollow. A piece of my life had fallen and broken. &quot;Joy, I'll wait. There's still a chance.&quot; (p.177) ---I mean, this kind of writing wears on ya after a while. But I finished the book, and feel humbled in the respect that I ask, &quot;Can some-one explain to me what that was all about??&quot; There are principles in the book that I agree with and practice myself, but the thought of this book being an eye-opener, or dispensing wisdom beyond the basics of Buddhism, does not pan out. I'll stick with 'Siddhartha' or 'Zen &amp; The Art Of Motorcycle Maintainence'."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I read this book when I was about 13 years old. It was one of the first books I read and it had such a tremendous impact on my life I called Dan Millman. I looked up his name in the phone book and called him at home. I can't believe I did this. Dan if you are out there, and remember this - please get it touch with me. All I remember is that the back of the book gave his hometown. From there I was able to get his home phone number. I remember calling him late at night, well late for me as a 7th grader anyway. I just told him that I really liked his book. That was about it. It seems like a magical dream. However, when I look back on it now, I must say I have always known that I am capable of being a peaceful Warrior. I think this book is what implanted that into my brain for so many years. Thank you Dan!"},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"A coming of age book of a young male having dimmed hopes of gymnastic glory, this book is a must read for any young male seeking a path to enlightenment. Through numerous exchanges with an old saintly Wizard named Socrates, the narrator expands his perspective on the journey of life. To truly becomming a peaceful warrior, one must continually explore, retain, and focus in on the present, sub-consciously feeding one's life meter with new experiences and observations upon which to accumulate and feed off in future years. Just as a saintly oracle would profess, Socrates' message is to always strive for more optimism, better relations, and more knowledge and curiosity by being in the now."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I liked the thought provoking element of this book. It seems to me that the author is trying to compel the reader to think through his or her own life and to come to certain spiritual conclusions. The book is a narrative of the life of Dan Millman and is done well. There are times that I got lost with what the author was trying to convey but overall, I will rate this book as a good read if one wants to think through their own life's journey and how they have dealt with it."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"The book is a good read and has good life lessons entwined in an entertaining story. Although I believe the protagonist was selfish throughout the story, the idea of better living, feeling and thinking came through."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior, MillmanThis book takes the reader on a journey, following the course of one man's life and his becoming, if you will. I use the word becoming, because that encapsulates for me what this book is about. Dan Millman becomes a Peaceful Warrior, and this book encourages us to do the same. Now we don't have teachers like Socrates to guide us as well as Millman had, nor do most of us, I imagine, have the time to devote to the teachings that we would have had while younger and without adult responsibilities. But there is within these pages a story, and it is a story that kindles within me the desire to be more than I have been, and to experience and live life more than I am now.There are a few things that I really like about this book. First, the concept of internal alchemy. Alchemy is the process (legendary) of turning lead, or other cheap materials, into gold. Internal alchemy involves turning bad, destructive feelings and emotions into positive, constructive feelings and emotions, which hopefully will then translate into our actions and attitudes. Most notably, anger can be transformed into humor that can be positive instead of destructive. He also teaches about anger as a potentially positive thing, however, in that anger motivates us to change. Fear and sorrow inhibit us, while anger, when properly understood and channelled, can motivate positive change in our lives. I see much truth in both of those thoughts.Additionally, I like Millman's revelation that there are no ordinary moments. A bit later he journeys in his mind back to when he was an infant, and he recalls (?) crawling on the carpet, and feeling the carpet touch him, and smelling a rose, and experiencing so much of the world as an infant. Today we lose much of that experiential element because we are just going through the motions.I also find his teachings about the mind quite fascinating, although I struggle to understand exactly what he is saying. He seems to say the mind is a bad thing, a negative thing, and a later development in our lives that is not necessarily a good thing. Is he talking about the mind as superego? I am not sure, but he goes so far as to say that the fall from grace in the Garden of Eden involved Adam and Eve developing their minds. In some ways, this is true, I guess. But I still struggle to fully grasp it.The book ends well, and leaves us to grapple with how much of the book is true and how much is fiction. Regardless of whether it is 'true' or not, the entire book still teaches 'truth.' I am not comfortable with the panentheistic concepts to which Millman alludes, but still liked the book overall and am challenged to live each moment as an extraordinary one."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"Great book.

Here is what I gleened1-The less attached you are to objects, ideas or goals, the more happy you will be. Your happiness simply IS: it does not depend on external events.2-Hard work and getting down to the essentials of life is one way to strip away the attachments and get back to the natural self--again, the happiness that IS3-No actions are good or bad, habits and states of being areAll this is interesting, and I find great sympathy with it, even though at times it is impossible to impliment. Since Worrier is written in fiction style, it is sometimes hard to internalize each lesson in your mind--a lot of the ideas are extremely abstract. Even Dan has not really gotten it when he is so sure he has. Perhaps a summery of concepts as an apendix would help.I also wonder: Is this the path to enlightenment, or DAN's path. Are the techniques Socraties uses his, or is he shape shifting just for what Dan needed at the time.As a learning coach myself, I am not a beliver in demanding more and more, the best not being good enough. Socraties can be pretty hard on Dan, but is this his inharent approach, or just the one he morphed around Dan's initial brattiness and vainess.Please: i am inviting comments on all of the above, though i am sure i will read and learn from this book many more times."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"Some ideas from this book:1) The greatest battles are fought in the inside2) Learning how to cope with experiences3) Great fables such as the farmer and neighbors, the king and the townspeople, the mother mourning his son, along others.It is light profound reading, which it the kind of reading that you can do very quickly with a profound meaning.Read it."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I enjoyed this book.

It offers really good insight into how to lead your life in a more positive way for yourself and others. This is an excellent book for those who are, for the first time, seeking the answers to the &quot;why&quot; questions in life. For those more advanced in their spiritual journey this book may seem trite or obvious. I picked this book up during a time when I was &quot;finding myself&quot; and it was very instrumental in my discovery. On the negative, the story is difficult to take seriously and seems a little ridiculous. As a realist I had to remove the ideals from the story line in order to continue. Also, some of the ideals are unattainable to a beginner. Some of them take years to master (like giving up sex and meat!). Overall this book was absolutely inspiring and life changing you just have to not take the story line so seriously."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"This book was given to me by a dear friend eight years ago and was the beginning of my journey into the light.

There are several dozen typos in the Kindle version. Needs a Kindle edit."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"Many of the events in this book are said to be true, but the book is fictional. Right from the start, I was yearning to hear Dan Millman's true story, not a fake one. And I never got past that. As a guide to changing lives, as the title suggests, I applaud the author's efforts to introduce spiritual elements into everyday living. An introspective way of life can be rich and rewarding, and for those searching for deeper meaning this tale points the way. Clearly, many people have found it useful.As a novel, the characters are one-dimensional and the dialog clunky and there's not much of a story. It's seems to be stuck between fiction and non-fiction with elements of both mixed together, although we don't know which is which. There doesn't seem much point in reading a fake autobiography unless it has a good story arc. Maybe if the main character's name wasn't the author's name I wouldn't have been so hung up on this. It's kind of Dan Millman's story, but not really. If it's going to be a novel, I would've been more interested in a captivating story that demonstrates spiritual growth and development rather than fictional characters telling me how to do it. However, I'd rather Dan just write a autobiography that's true. Either one would've been better than something in-between.If a reader wants to learn meditation and an introspective way of living, I'd suggest one of many good authors/teachers in Zen or Work-centered practices. Not this book. However, I gave this book 2 stars because it may lead someone to deeper study in these areas and, for that reason, it would be worthwhile."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I had not read this book for over twenty years and wondered what had made me pick it up in the first place. It is somewhat dated but speaks to a way of life all of us could share or, practice, no matter what our religions or callings are - zen b is a 'way' to our beliefs.This book holds up over many decades and provides a step by step approach of strengthening the being to accept the world as it is, but in a modern day 'parable'. Dan and Socrates are engaging characters and their relationship draws one into the story of Dan's spiritual internship.These teachings are also available through many sources,including Pema Chodron and B. Alan Wallace, but Warrior perhaps, is more readable.This is worth the second glance -"},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"The subtitle says that this is a book that changes lives, and it certainly can. First published in 1980, this semi-autobiographical novel takes place in the mid-1960s, and it reflects the kind and intensity of the spiritual quests many of us were on back then. The bits of wisdom sprinkled throughout the book have been echoed in books and movies of the last 30 years, from \\"Star Wars\\" to \\"The Karate Kid\\" to \\"The Dead Poets Society\\" and many more, so the concepts will not likely be new to most. This book collects them in one neat volume, and would be ideal for someone -- of any age -- who is asking some of life's big questions. Decently written, the book's first-person approach and gentle humor keeps this book from being heavy-handed and preach-y. This is a book that's staying in my collection -- I'll definitely be turning to it again."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"A former star gymnast stops by a gas station late at night, and hooks up with an unlikely guru -- the gas station attendant, who leaps to the top of low buildings in a single bound, pumps gas with a smile, and has attractive female friends. This is The Karate Kid for college students. It felt like a movie, and lo and behold, I searched and saw that it is. It's a fun read, and who could not be attracted to the mysterious young woman, Joy, who outruns a trained athlete? And manages all the unreality without drugs (for that, see Castaneda.) But I'm just not sure if the messages come through in this cute story, even though they're stated. Live like you're about to die. Train your soul as well as your body. Everything in moderation, but OK to break out every so often. You could read Maimonides instead -- he said the same things, but without the gas station."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"This is yet another in a series of life changing books I have been reading of late.

Any of Millman's books are great tools for personal growth."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I definitely enjoyed reading this book and its many different insights. I'm a notoriously slow reader and the pages still flew by.....but I actually think I went too fast. If you do decide to read this book, I would highly recommend taking a deep breath after 30 or so pages just to sit back and soak in the story and its meaning. There really are a lot of concepts thrown to you at once and it only makes sense to take the time to understand their impact. There's no doubt I will read this again (I'm going through the sequel right now) and will make it a point to slow down a bit.There were some parts of the book that really hit home for me and others that seems a little \\"bit much\\", but, overall, I thought the presentation was done well. Near the end of the book I was a little bit diappointed at how fast the author decribes his life events after college; I guess I was just expecting more meaningful discussion about what he went through. (EDIT: Some of the \\"holes\\" are filled in by his other books)I'm looking forward to seeing the movie adaptation just to compare how Millman's Socate's character translates to the big screen. The most important question I ask myself after I read this book is: \\"Do I feel that it made an impact (big or small) in my life?\\" I would definitely say \\"yes\\" just for mere idea that past and future are simply subtle barriers that can impede our progress today."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"The book was even more inspirational than the movie- and we loved the movie.

A student at the University of California at Berkley, Dan's life revolved around school and gymnastics. Stressed with his life Dan left his apartment and took a stroll around town. What he did not know is that this walk would change his life forever. His experiences and outlook on life changed once he entered the doors of the infamous gas station. Dan walked in the gas station and saw an old man sitting in a chair. When he walked out of the gas station, the same man was on the roof. Wanting to know how the man got on the roof, Dan returned nightly to obtain his answer. Over numerous years, Dan learned lessons that aided in his quest to become a Warrior.Dan Millman is a University of California at Berkley graduate, a world trampoline champion, and member of the Gymnastics Hall of Fame. He was the director of gymnastics at Stanford University, and later became a professor at Oberlin College. He has written 13 self-help books and gives talks and seminars all over the United States and abroad. He currently lives in Northern California with his family.This book is incredibly powerful and leaves the reader with a new perspective on life. The vividness of word choice creates a surreal vision. An explanation of The Warrior is offered by Socrates, Dan's guide on his new quest. Socrates, 94, incorporates Eastern philosophy and Western fitness to embark on a spiritual odyssey to discover the meaning of life and becoming a warrior. Socrates uses humor, kindness, and love in his teachings to convey that happiness, creativity, and fulfillment can be achieved by developing one's human potential. By the end of the book, it is difficult to have dry eyes. The reader really connects with Dan and has a desire for him to be successful in his journey.This book was very hard to locate and is found in the New Age section of bookstores, an unusual area to search for a personal growth/fiction book. It is a story based on true aspects of Millman's life.This book is recommended for teenagers and older. It is important to have a good grasp of vocabulary and some life experience to understand the concept of this book. Other books by Dan Millman are: The Life You Were Born to Live: A Guide to Finding Your Life Purpose, and Wisdom of the Peaceful Warrior: A Companion to the Book that Changes Lives. The reader must be open to new ideas, and new ways of looking at oneself and the world to appreciate this story.Way of the Peaceful Warrior has been made into a movie starring Nick Nolte, Scott Mechlowicz and Amy Smart. The movie version recently came out on DVD."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book, after hearing many good things about it. After reading about 25 pages, I had to stop, because it is so badly written. The setting with the old guru at the gas station is completely contrived, and not enough detail is provided to give the story any credibility. For instance, in one early scene,the old guru is sitting in a chair. Then, when our trampoline-champion hero looks again a moment later, the old guy is up on the roof looking at the stars. No way! How did he get up there! Then, the guy keeps asking the old guy, for several pages, \\"how did you get on the roof?\\" The old guy just laughs, and basically asks mysterious questions that suggest, \\"you really don't know anything that you think you know.\\" This is real drivel, that might be considered precocious if written by a 12-year old. Stories which have supernatural characters are effective only when the setting is made to seem realistic. The attempt at realism is lost when the writing itself is poor, and the details are contrived. \\"The Greatest Miracle in the World\\" by Og Mandino and \\"Illusions\\" by Richard Bach come to mind as successful well-written examples of this genre. But in this book by Millman, there is no such believability established. The guy comes upon this gas station, and this old guru simply starts teaching him the meaning of life. For this to be a reasonably well-known book that has a \\"20th Anniversary\\" edition is rather shocking. Simply put, this guy is not a good writer. His sentence structure and word choice is awful, and his scenes have a wooden falseness that renders the whole thing unreadable. And don't tell me \\"it's the message, not the medium\\" which is important. The message--that we are all too self-absorbed, that we need to embrace the universe, awaken to reality, etc.-- has been forcefully transmitted by so many great written works, that we don't need second rate stuff like this to tell us what we already know. Admittedly, succeeding in this \\"wise-old-guy-who-teaches-regular-guy-mysteries-of-life\\" genre is not so easy; but this effort is an appalling wreck that cannot seriously be considered as literature. I have nothing against the author. More power to him for his success with this book. I have never had anything published, so I am not looking down on him. It's just very surprising to me that people think this book is good."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"Millman's book - Way of the Peaceful Warrior - follows the journey and development of the protagonist (Millman himself) as he undergoes a spiritual transformation and \\"self-realization\\". Millman uses a mysterious teacher character, Socrates, to convey life's important lessons. The plot is very straightforward - it is a standard quest-for-knowledge. Think of the movie, The Karate Kid, and you get the gist of the plot.It's important that you read the book as an allegory and is only meant to be read semi-literally. This is important because Millman's writing is very rough at times, the dialogue made me cringe, and there are random moments of misogyny. Also, Millman throws in various supernatural events, which gave me a few \\"Huh?\\" moments. Towards the end, the book feels like Millman tried to pick up the pace of the novel, which felt ackward given the pace of the first three quarters of the book. So, minus two stars for the bad writing.Once you can see through the poor dialogue and supernatural events, you can pull out the lessons that Millman is trying to convey:- Take care of your health and eat well. Your body will reward you.- Avoid stress and use anger positively. Meditation is a good tool.- Don't fuss over the past; it's done. Learn and move on.- Don't fuss over the future; it's too unpredictable.- Go all-in or don't play at all. Moderation is for bores.- Life is a journey to understand yourself and in doing so, understand your own way to happiness.- Live for now and enjoy the present; be aware and avoid passive understanding.To the informed reader, this novel doesn't really express anything new or ground-breaking; it just bundles some basic advice nicely in a story that is easily read by most Americans. I didn't find this novel life-changing or phenomenal or great but rather a simple suggestion of ways to achieve happiness. Overall, I enjoyed reading the book and thinking about Millman's suggestions but it did not live up to the hype."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"Depending where you are in your life, this book will be hit or miss. If you're starting to feel disillusioned about life and its meaning, then this book could be a story you'll really relate to. I read it when I was 15. Even though it's a story in some ways I couldn't relate to - I wasn't in college, and I didn't have an unlikely teacher that I met in gas station - I could relate to his struggle to feel alive and give his life meaning. I could remember in high school how the few real moments I had were playing soccer or spending time with a special girl. Kind of like the book's protagonist until he meets Socrates. Outside of those fleeting moments, my life felt pretty unspecial and meaningless. I felt very lost without purpose. The positive messages and the profound questions in this book are really inspiring, moving, and uplifting. To read of Dan's adventures grappling with culturally-obscured truths to life was exciting. So this book will always have a special place in my heart. It spoke to that sleeping part of myself that thirsts to \\"know thyself\\". But now I've moved on to new books, having used Way of the Peaceful Warrior as a stepping stone.Wonderfully bright, active prose helps keep the pages turning. This is helpful when there are so many stunning ideas that don't need obsfucation caused by sophisticated mumbo-jumbo. One mistake I notice is that people tend to think because the book is easy reading for a student in middle-school that the ideas are unsophisticated. Go ahead and read Being and Nothingness, and then come back to Way of the Peaceful Warrior. I'm sure you'll have a larger, more complex vocabulary, but I'm not sure you'll have any deeper ideas. I think it's a tribute to Dan Millman that he could present fundamental philosophical questions in a way that connects them to real life and everyday happiness and suffering without writing about war, climbing a moutain, or something else extreme. I looked at my own life in new ways after reading this book.Hopefully you'll enjoy this book like I did."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I have bought this book some 10 years ago and share it with a lot of people since then. My boyfriend, who is more insterested in martial arts than in spirituality, shared this book in turn with some of his friends from the martial arts (Muay Thai) club, specially those who felt stuck at a crossroads. One of them had a dream to fight in Thailand, but was immediately discouraged by his Thai instructor and told that, as a black man, he would never make it in Thailand. After reading this book, this fighter packed his bags and left for Thailand anyway. Not only did he succeed there, he became a world champion fighter and is still winning fights in Thailand. And then, another one read the book and packed his bags and went on fighting in Thailand for a year.All that I can say is that the book has helped many people I know, who have read this book, break through limitations and courageously embark to follow their hearts and their dreams."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I had seen this book in stores for years but always passed it over because I thought it was New Age \\"lite\\". Over the past 25 years I have read a great number of books on spirituality (for example, Carlos Castaneda, Yogananda, James Redfield, Edgar Cayce, Deepak Chopra, Jose Silva, Sondra Ray - to name just a few). Some of them more than once. I have been very discriminating - seeking out books that I determined contained true knowledge. I based this on opinions from other seekers and various book reviews. I judged Peacefull Warrior by its cover - wrongly, I might add. Only after I saw the trailer of the upcoming movie did I get interested in reading the book - so I bought it. It turns out that I have deprived myself of an absolute treasure for many, many years.This is a book that actively teaches you something as you read it - effortlessly. Millman has a way with words. I can't adequately describe it - it is simply enthralling.I liked it so much I then read \\"The Journeys of Socrates\\" (which was advertised at the last of the book). I loved this book even more! I could not put it down. It was like I was watching the story being played out before my very eyes. Amazing. And such a revelation at the end. This book caused me to experience every emotion while reading it. You must read this book - but be sure to read \\"The Way of the Peaceful Warrior\\" first!\\"I feel very grateful to have had the opportunity to read these books. They truly have worth beyond measure. I just purchased \\"Sacred Journey of the Peaceful Warrior\\" from Amazon.Do yourself a great big favor and read these books."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"A semi-docmentary of the life of Dan Millman with his character Dan, a young athlete in college who stumbles across a most curious gas station attendant by the name of Socrates. This book, after reading it changed my life, as well as inspired me to become a Peaceful Warrior myself. That was almost 10 years ago, but I keep coming back to it from time to time reminding myself of some of the simple pleasures in life and to remember to lose myself in the moment. The book unlocked my rigorous thinking to move on and look at things differently and more uniquely. Definately a book that is highly reccomended for anyone, but also for the beginnering philosopher to change their ways of seeng reality and life."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"When I was 13 years old, I was always in a lot of trouble, getting expelled, etc. A substitute teacher eventually came to me and handed me this book. I thought he was crazy but I read it anyway. I did not understand it at all. I asked him many questions. He responded similarly to Socrates ways of answering questions. I put the book away for many years. Now I am a senior in college. I found the book and read it more than once. Last night I started reading it again. It's amazing that I could cry while reading a book. I hate reading. This book still confuses me, but it makes me think. And any book that can make me think about myself, I mean really think about myself, is a good one. I am going to read it again."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"Wow! What a great book! Really. Author and main character of \\"Way Of The Peaceful Warrior,\\" Dan Millman weaves a fast, catchy and easy-to-read story-line that is also slow and penetrating enough to seep into the pores of consciousness with words by enigmatic teacher and \\"warrior,\\" Socrates - a name given to the Japanese master upon the first meeting of the two.The journey shared within the pages is bound to create a magical enlightenment for some readers, a familiar knowing and relate-ability for others. It promises to be uplifting and inspiring for all, reminding us that we truly are spiritual beings who temporarily live in a physical body.Near the end of the story, as Dan made his escape from \\"the box,\\" finding the gateway to reality, he wishes to tell everyone: \\"There is no need to search; achievement leads to nowhere. It makes no difference at all, so just be happy now! Love is the only reality of the world, because it is all One, you see. And the only laws are paradox, humor, and change. There is no problem, never was, and never will be. Release your struggle, let go of your mind, throw away your concerns, and relax into the world. No need to resist life; just do your best. Open your eyes and see that you are far more than you imagine. You are the world, you are the universe; you are yourself and everyone else, too! It's all the marvelous Play of God. Wake up, regain your humor. Don't worry, you are already free!\\"This is a book I plan to re-read.

Everything in this book (allmost) is stuff that i have made a plan to do for the rest of my life...problem though is that i have been teaching myself to live this way through books, i am not lucky enough to have a teacher to show me.It is possible to live a life like the one described in this book, but it is allmost impossible to do without becoming kind of \\"aberrant\\" as far as societal normality goes...But what fun is the state of normality?There really are people that wander around the world that ARE allmost on the level of the Buddha or Christ as far as \\"enlightenment\\" goes, and it really is possible to strive for that state of mind, but there is no one single path to get there, the way is different for every person. This book is not made to be followed to the letter, but the themes, if someone really is serious about going this way, CAN be followed. This book is only an opening to where you want to go with this, only the first step, the very tip of the iceberg, there is far more to this than what is in this little book, but the value of the book lies in the fact that it shows that there IS a path that can POSSIBLY be followed by any person, if they so choose, it isnt easy though, it is not by any means the path of least resistance. This is just the doorway, the first step to those who are serious.Some other books like this are 'Siddhartha' by Herman Hesse, 'The Hope Valley Hubcap King' by Sean Murphy (great \\"journey tale\\" of this genre, with comedy and satire thrown in, very very good book), and some of the stuff by Carlos Casteneda perhaps.If anyone else really has the will to try to build beliefs and \\"habits\\" like those in this book, good luck in finding what you hope to find in the end, it isnt supposed to be easy though...then again \\"easy\\" is just a label.If any of those who are like Socrates see this and need a dedicated and able student... =)This book does not automatically change lives, you are not \\"different\\" just for having read it. If you want to make a change in your life for the better, you have to have the will to MAKE change, dont expect it to just float into your hands, it is not that easy.I would recommend reading some Stuart Wilde if you really want to go far more indepth into the Warrior/Sage persona...If you are serious about this book, you will get very good and much more detailed information from the Taos Quintet by Stuart Wilde."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"Love this story.

The reason is because its wonderful message reached me at a time when I really needed it. In 1991, I was purposeless and in a depression I could not come out of. It was a therapist who gave me Dan's book to read. The easy paced action and enjoyable interaction between Dan and his teacher, Socrates, absorbed me completely. I escaped into a world that filled my own world with enough hope to lift me out of my negative state. Uplifted, I began to live again.I believe the ancient truths contained in this book are the best way for a human being to live and relate to others and life. Awareness takes the ordinary and makes it extraordinary.

I think Dan Millman's books are a more entertaining way of reading personal development titles. He knows how to tell a good story, and at the same time inspire the reader. When we experience the growth of Dan into the \\"Peaceful Warrior\\" it inspires us to believe in our goals and reach out and grab them. It's an entertaining book, and it will help the reader on a human level."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I do. I read the book when I was eighteen, 40 now, and back then and still I like it a lot. In some ways, it is my favorite book. I'm really more literary in taste, Nabokov, Delillo, but this the writing in this is superb I think. Very compelling story of one guy trying to help another.When I say I want to know more I understand that there are lessons in this book galore. And all of them are good lessons. Help others, stay in the moment, what else? Is that pretty much it? Don't take life too seriously. Laugh more. I just don't see how, for myself a book can change a life. I guess you think about what you read and then take action, right. But no one writes about the action. They just say \\"This book changed my life.\\" And is sounds to me like some platitude, but my not be. Let's talk further in the comments."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I have read several of Dan's books in the past (i.e. The Warrior Athlete,No Ordinary Moments and The Journey of Socrates), and I find this one to be a bit contrived and shallow. The idea of touching someone and having this \\"out of body/mystical experience\\" just seems like too much LSD.Some of the basic concepts of this book seemed to be rooted in some type of \\"wishy-washy Zen\\" philosophy without the philosophy. I believe he would have done himself a greater service by representing the story in more realistic terms without the hokey, unrealistic mysticism. On a brighter note, I did like the fact that Socrates did try to teach him some practices that are helpful, such as meditation, abstinence, proper diet and the concept that we are all fallible.Pass this up in lieu of \\"The Journey of Socrates\\". This book is more realistic and a better written story. I think Millman himself has evolved into a better author since this book was penned. But as I heard him say in a youtube interview...He isn't here to make think any which way. He wants you to have your BS detector on, and learn for yourself from life itself.

Be very afraid. Maybe if you're twelve years old this would be readable, but an adult of average intelligence - even a teenager - will find this book nearly unreadable.I am reminded in reading this that it's in the same category as the Ayn Rand novels. They \\"work\\" when you're 17, but are ridiculous at 27. Men often relate to the hero; women to the heroine. I'd be embarrassed to admit I related to either of the characters.Millman says, \\"Act happy, feel happy, be happy.\\" I agree. But the way it's presented, is, for an adult, nearly moronic. What happens when a parent is slowly dying of cancer or your son didn't come home from his tour in Iraq. The book is entirely simplistic, on a level of a four or five year old's first story books. Be sad, grieve, be anxious, nervous, afraid. Nature gave us those emotions to use when it's appropriate. And the rest of the time ...be happyThe book in brief? Accept reality - it's all there is. Stop whining. Make the most of what you have and stop feeling sorry for yourself. Make every day count, and always ask yourself, am I doing the best I can. And try very hard to accept others as they are. There.

But the transformation from paper to kindle was horrible. Tons of typos that left me trying to figure out exactly what word was supposed to be in that place. I felt more like a copy editor at times."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"An interesting philosophy, though seemingly unatainable, which, to those non-warriors, would be the likely response.This is definitely a different way of teaching a philosophy. Way of the Peaceful Warrior is a cross between a new age, spiritual, self help, fantasy book with a touch of Gandhi. It is meant to teach the lessons that Dan had learned in his life experiences, to impart a bit of a man that he names Socrates upon his readers through a fictional format. Granted the storyline is unbelievable, but the lessons are the core of what he is trying to get across, touching upon drinking, violence and other topics and how his philosophy views them.In the beginning his style is sophomoric and forced, but as the story unfolds you begin to let go of the conventional comprehension of styles of writing and allow the story to unfold. By the end I didn't really think about the style of writing and instead enjoyed the ending.I wouldn't say 'run out and buy it', but if it is sitting around or at the library, pick it up and give it a go."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"Stop waisting time and read this book, then read the 2nd book. Then read them both again and again!! This book is for anyone (beginers or those already on a spiritual path) and should be read by everyone! Its not a self help style book, its a story that everyone can relate to.This book is one of my favorites and I highly recomend it as a first read if you are new to the spiritual scene.It goes hand in hand with so many other &quot;non preachy&quot; spiritual books and it doesnt sound like a grandmother preaching the bible.If you liked - Celestine Prophecy, Power of Now, Life &amp; Teaching of the Masters of the Far East, anything written by Krishnamurti, The Spiritual Tourist, Sanctuary - Path to Consciousness, Carl Jung, Deepak Chopra..... just to name a few. or... if you read this book I suggest reading any of the above as each book is connected to the other and will point you to the next step on your path.I am a true &quot;Spiritual Seeker&quot; who wants answers to the many questions that haunt us all and have led us to the spiritual relm. I owe it all to this book as it was the first spiritual type book I read and it became the First Step on the Path to my awakening and it gave me the drive to continue to seek and become more conscious of what is.I have no idea what my life would be like if I did not read this book. I would probably still be an MTV drone like most people out there who is only concerned with themselves and creating a fake image that we like to think makes us a superstar, which I now realize is as far from reality as it gets. If the whole of society would only wake up!!!!The book is such an easy read with such an impact.. you dont even realize that you have changed until you catch yourself thinking in a different way that then makes you realize that this world we live in is fake, ignorant and is made up of bad habits. But not to worry, its a good thing!!! because the more conscious of it we are, the easier it is to get off this crazy train we call everyday life. That is what this book does, it shows us the way off the crazy train of our own life situations!If you want to break free, if you have a desire to seek for the truth, if you want to be YOU and not a fake image of someone or something.... than this book is for you!!! You wont have to dress like a monk... you wont have to light candles and incense or chant like a freak, you wont have to look in the mirror and pretend to like yourself, you dont have to give up your job and posessions. You just have to wake up and be the REAL YOU. The YOU that you have always been.... and this book will show you the way!!Now think about this...If you are reading this review and are thinking about reading this book, you ARE READY to start on your journey. Something has brought you here that is beyond our comprehension. Dont fight it, just accept it. It will change your life one way or another!!!!!Remember this - To dwell on your past is to rob your future. To worry about the future is to rob the present....We all do it and that is why we are so angry, anxious, grouchy, bitter, and depressed.So, in order to be free from the haunting past and the &quot;what if&quot; future. YOU MUST LEARN TO LIVE IN THE NOW.

It is about appreciating life and waking up to the joys around us.I cannot imagine anyone not loving this book. It is strange to read some of the negative reviews.

I was hesitant at first, thinking nothing could ever alter my current state of mind. It sat on the desk for a week or so, but I decided to pick it up. I had nothing to lose, besides, it came highly recommended from someone I hold in very high regard.I will cut to the bottom line. Dan Millman, in writing this book, has the ability to change lives as he indicates on the cover. If you practice even a few of the lessons and disciplines that are taught by Socrates (the teacher), you too can reap the benefits of being a peaceful warrior. I have made tremendous strides only 3 days after finishing the book. I plan on reading it again, mostly to write down or highlight some of the practices and lessons and put a strategy together to follow each day.Peace to you, D."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I remember when I first saw this book I was at a rummage sale at a church. I was in my early teens, maybe 12 or so (I'm now 27). I fondly remember my intrigue with Dan and Socrates, in the humble setting of a gas station near a college campus. The spirituality is powerful and the lesson profound, I don't remember it being a quick read, persay; nor the most mainstream transcript - but I'm still talking about the book to this day and I'd consider myself an avid reader. Great book."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"The Way of the Peaceful Warrior by Dan Millman is an autobiographical book about Dan's journey from being a selfish, ignorant gymnast to a wise, caring husband. The writer of this book is a former world champion athlete, university coach, martial arts instructor, and college professor. Dan has written thirteen inspirational books so far and has had a movie adapted from The Way of the Peaceful Warrior. Dan currently lives in California and speaks at seminars and workshops from time to time. He hopes to influence others as he continues to write.The beginning of the book starts off with Dan going to college at Berkeley University. Dan was one of the best gymnasts in the country; however, being the best didn't satisfy him sufficiently. He got depressed. He had nightmares about death, and in his nightmares, there was an old man named Socrates. One night, Dan woke up from a nightmare. Since he was awake, he decided to take a walk to a gas station. Oddly enough, the man who was working the late night shift looked exactly like the man in Dan's nightmares. Dan nicknamed him Socrates and frequently visited the gas station after that. In time, Socrates became his close mentor.Socrates became Dan's teacher on how to really live life to the fullest and how to enjoy the simplest things in life. Dan didn't understand why Socrates helped him at first, but as the lessons advanced, he understood that Socrates was just trying to help him. Dan learned that experience is the key to learning and the only way to show knowledge is to act on what has been taught. Socrates knew that as Dan learned, he would find the answers he has been searching for.Dan was always a busy gymnast who never had the time to find happiness in the littlest of things. Socrates told him, \\"You are rich if you have enough money to satisfy all your desires. The easiest way is to cultivate a simple lifestyle of few desires; that way you always have enough money.\\" Socrates showed Dan how to tell the difference between needs and wants. Socrates said, \\"The secret of happiness, you see, is not found in seeking more, but in developing the capacity to enjoy less.\\" Socrates helped Dan take a step back and breathe so that Dan would have time to get to know himself.There are so many things in this book that really make a person think about life's big questions. If you want to know what Dan learned in the end, you'll have to read the book and see what happens to Dan after he leaves college and what happens to Socrates. If you're the kind of person who likes philosophy and deep thinking, I would definitely recommend this book. I am the type of person who loves anything that involves a lot of wisdom so this book was a pleasure to read because it talks about experiences and shares lessons. If I could summarize this book with one word, I would use the word \\"Happiness\\" because that is big picture in life that this book is trying to remind us of. I think sometimes people get so caught up with work and business that they forget how to live. This book opens up reality and can really make you see the world a different way if you open your mind up to it. The book really tries to emphasize that we should do our best to live right here, right now. If you do decide to read this book, remember not to rush while reading it. Enjoy the little humor that is set in it and reflect on its ideas."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"The first time I read this I was at a point in my life when I was searching for the truth. I &quot;accidentally&quot; found this book and it changed my life. Once I began reading it, I couldn't put it down. It made everythign so clear. I cannot thank Dan enough for sharing his experiences with that crazy old man at the gas station.Recently I was cleaning my bookshelves and again &quot;accidentally&quot; stumbled upon it. Ten years later and the teachings ring as true today as they did the first time. I had forgotten many of the teachings and again, it was just what I needed to get me back on the path. Amazing how it keeps surfacing at the right times? For those of you on The Path, it's a must. For those of you who have read it, read it again. Don't stop here, follow Dan through the Sacred Journey as well. It's worth the time, if you're willing to open your heart."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I was in a state of flux when I picked up the book the first time quite a few years ago.

It's true, as some other reviewers have pointed out, that the concepts and spirituality here are nothing new, but why try to reinvent the wheel? Dan Millman embraces ideals from a variety of places that fit together to form a framework for one of the best written stories I've ever read.The book takes spirituality to a new level by taking the core values of several faiths & religions and illustrating them through a very colourful and enjoyable story that allows the reader to cast him or herself into the lead role without feeling \\"preached to\\"."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"A friend has been raving about this book for years and years. In some ways, I was disappointed, but in others, quite rewarded, when I finally picked it up and read it.First, about its merits: when reading WAY OF THE PEACEFUL WARRIOR, keep a highlighter handy and be prepared to use it a lot. It's full of wonderful truths that will help you become a warrior whose &quot;life is not about imagined perfection or victory; ... [but]about love.&quot; Many of the truths the book has to offer, I have had to learn through experience. I rather wish I'd read it twenty years ago. It might have saved me a lot of time! It's great to have some of my personal beliefs affirmed, and of course to become a true &quot;warrior&quot;, there are things I still have left to accomplish.As for the literary aspect of the book, I found the writing rather clumsy. Most annoying to me was Millman's habit of trying to set up little &quot;zingers&quot;. There is very little craft in this book, and perhaps it would have been more honest of the author to just say what was really on his mind, without the excuse of having a character meet Socrates in a service station.A very worthwhile book. Read it for the ideas--now that you know the truth about the writing style, as Millman puts it, &quot;when you know the horse is wild, you can deal with it appropriately.&quot;"},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"An enjoyable, enlightening and compulsive read, almost impossible to put down. In many ways very Castenada-esque with many similarities between Socrates and Don Juan Matus and between Dan and Carlos, although less in depth and detailed than Castenada it carries it's message and story with effortless fluidity. Not exactly \\"a book that changes lives\\" in my opinion, but a book that gives you a lot of food for thought whilst being a humorous, well-written and interesting novel. This novel shouldn't be likened to books such as Working on Yourself Doesn't Work by Ariel and Shya Kane as suggested by a previous reviewer as I don't believe it is intended to be a \\"Self Help\\" book. Dan Millman more or less covers in one small section of this book everything that Ariel and Shya Kane harp on about in their entire dull and condescending book about instantaneous transformation. I look forward to reading the sequel: Sacred Journey of the Peaceful Warrior, and hope it is as entertaining thought provoking as this book."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I remember when an older cousin gave this book to me when I was about 15. I read it as a story the first time. But later I understood the impact of the words as they became ideas on how to view the world. The view that Dan imparts is not some complex, new age philosopy of personal power, but a simple, heartfelt path towards peace and service to your fellow humanity. These things are not achieved through some miraculous overnight transformation to an elevated state of consiousness, but through an effort to realize that nothing is here but now. An effort to make every day a living meditation. (By the way, it's not supposed to be easy... it's life not nirvana). A great read for anyone and serves as a great intro to Dan's other books."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"This book is a classic of its kind: one man, one teacher, on the path to enlightenment. Once the book gets rolling, it is a riveting, multi-stepped journey, dramatized by the protagonist's resistance to self-realization. It reminded me of the Kanes' book Working on Yourself Doesn't Work: A Book About Instantaneous Transformation. In both books enlightenment is not about finding some cure-all, but seeing things as they truly are. With the Kanes, however, you don't have to wait for a magical teacher to find you. Their books are excellent guides in having life itself carry you to clarity."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"This one of my favorite books. It is not that it is such a well-written book. However, it is one of the few books that has a nice and interesting story, is easy to read and has profound spiritual lessons. There are a lot of spiritual books but few are novels which are easy to read. Another plus is that the story sets in our time and the main character a normal person we all can relate too.For me the best books are interesting novels with spiritual lessons, such as this one. I like to lend this book to my friends who are starting out on the spirtual path. They get a nice and easy to read novel and while they are at it, learn some powerful spiritual truths. I wish there were more books like these!Thanx Dan and Socrates for this truly life-changing book!Be Blessed..."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"This is a wonderful story, although I will stop short of saying that it changed my life, I would recommend it to anyone. I found the fiction surrounding the real characters entertaining and capable of conveying a message of spiritual growth through perception of yourself and your surroundings. It definitely reminded of how not to let life embitter when an individual is confronted with personal hardship. It has been very helpful when applying simple rules to life - rules that each of us have known at one time or another."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I read this book back in 1991. It was the right book at the right time and it was in the hands of the right person, as it turned out. I needed inspiration. I wanted to do something very different, very challenging, something that could change my life. Why I picked up this book is a memory lost in the past at this point, but it was not the kind of book I would normally ever buy. Whatever, I bought it, read it, and it picked me up. While quite a few people have read Dan's books and have seen the movie based on this book and while I imagine many of them felt inspired as well, I doubt they did what I did at age 46. Because of this book, I finally found a gymnastics coach who would work with a middle-aged guy who had no gymnastics background whatsoever. Six years later at 52, I was the oldest competitor at a fully sanctioned gymnastics meet in the US, as well as the oldest athlete member of the US gymnastics federation. It was an incredible experience. But the real story was the six years from the day I read Dan's book to the day of that meet. I would never have persevered and finally stood there with my team, the oldest of whom was 35 years younger, ready to do what had only been a ridiculous, crazy dream, if it hadn't been for Dan Millman and this book.I have no idea if this book can be of any use to you. I only know it was for me. I am thankful for that."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I first saw a trailer for Peaceful Warrior when I attended a film festival in Washington DC back in April of 2006, to see Hard Candy. I didn't quite grasp it, and forgotten it - then somewhere along the line, Peaceful Warrior has resurfaced (the June 30 release) I haven't seen it in theatres, but my interested had once again peaked. I then watched the trailer countless times on youtube. I finally saw the film, and was amazed. It had struck me, and I've decided to purchase the book right after my viewing.Last Wednesday, it had arrived, and I started reading - I have only a few pages to go before I am finished..and I can safely say, this is one of the best books I have read in my life. I do not judge it on entertainment, or on escapism or writing, or anything else (although yes! this book IS entertaining) i judge this book on the LIFE LESSON it teaches, and I can't recommend it enough. This book will be passed on to my friends and to everyone I know, who is willing to OPEN THEIR EYES and to REALIZE what has been missing in their lives. Constant thoughts were running through my mind when reading the book - and as I read it, I highlit every lesson Socrates taught. Some of them hit home so much, some of them made me realize and open my eyes a little bit (Yes, I can't say I have yet opened my eyes, I'm only a fool in kindergarten by Socrates standards!). Since reading the book, I've been practicing the lessons taught, and I've been trying to be more self-aware. I have been searching for something like this, searching for something I did not know myself - I was searching for THIS LESSON that THIS BOOK TEACHES, In movies, and in film but could never find it - and THIS is the one literary work that SATISFIES my search. We can choose to start living NOW, PRESENTLY.

Now, the content of the story looks fine, but the technical translation from print to eBook leaves much to be desired. Within the first chapter, I found numerous spelling errors that quickly took me out of the reading experience and, at times, left me trying to decipher what the author intended. Given the fact the book has been in print for more than 20 years, I quickly deduced the eBook was beset with translation issues. Even at a discount off the price of a traditional book, the eBook should have to meet standards of quality, which appeared to be lacking.I am wrestling with a decision to either go out and buy the hard copy version or stick with the eBook, but no matter what, I am planning on continuing my reading experience with this author and subject."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"This is a fantastic book that carries on deep philosophical knowledge despite the author's humbleness to suggest its imaginary contents.

I can't put my finger on why. Yes it was a good story and yes it was well-written. But Dan Millman, like Richard Bach, has a way of communicating between the lines to places our rational minds cannot comprehend. All I know is that I felt uplifted and inspired by reading it. And when I wrote my book, To Bee or Not to Bee (an allegorical tale of awakening), Dan was kind enough to write this endorsement: \\"A book for the child in all of us....a simplicity that is powerful, a purity that reminds us of the light we all are.\\" It's now in 11 languages and exploding. Thanks, Dan for your contribution to the awakening.To Bee or Not to Bee: A Book for Beeings Who Feel There's More to Life Than Just Making Honey"},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I was introduced to this book in 1998 by a friend.

It has illustrated very entertainingly how mind can get in the way of life and drag one down. The story has inspired me to become a witness to my own inner dialog / illusions which have kept me from taking action to creat what I want out of life. There is no self help tone to this book. It is just pure fable with some truth mixed in (or is it the other way arround) unlike many of the books out there on mindfullness.

If you've seen the movie, \\"Peaceful Warrior\\", I would definitely suggest to you that you read this book because it will change your life.My final words are...Are you 100% happy and satisfied with EVERY aspect of your life? Are you living a perfect/horrible/ or \\"so-so\\" human life right now?? If you answered \\"YES\\" to ANY of the questions, the very least that you can do for me and your family is to at least put this book on your \\"wish-list\\" or recommend it to a friend and ask how they like it because you never have time to read."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"Though fiction (sort of), this book can easily change lives.

I've read it multiple times. And every time it reminds me of important things and helps me in my life. It chronicles the journey of a man struggling to find himself, something most people I know can relate to, not to mention myself. It tells of his discovery of what he was looking for, his purpose, it helps you to do so also. This book changes the way you think and affects your life in many ways, it teaches you about moral and purpose and the realities of life. Although it isn't one of the most extravagantly written books, Dan Millman does an incredible job of conveying his message through his medium. This book is truly a work of art. I would recommend Way of the Peaceful Warrior to anyone. Period.

It's a coincidence because I just grabbed the book randomly on my friend's shelf to take on a roadtrip (I don't even read that much usually) and the subject of the book is exactly what I'm going through in my life right now so I will give it a review.I'm a Chinese myself and have practiced Qigong and Buddism for six months now, and have found tremendous spiritual growth since then, and I could tell you that the book is good but it is definitely only half of the story, and here's the other half- you have to learn to meditate and even better, learn Qigong to start to see the spiritual experiences that is illustrated in the book, then if you are persistent you'll have a different viewpoint on life. I know most people are skeptical like I was before, and that's the only reason why I started this journey so late.Now while I enjoyed the better half of the book, here are my insights of the not so good parts. First, I do not know why the author never explained the inner workings of meditation and of Qi when he wrote about so many practices that are derivatives of the two, such as healing Dan's leg and giving him vision, or becoming one with nature, those are all possible and even I could take away some physical pain for a moment or two through manipulating Qi energy. Without the slightest explanations of those phenomenons readers will be lost. Honestly I doubt the author understand that half of it at all and feels like he merely place in the most important doctrines of Buddism inside dialogues as a progress of his journey, but what about his own physical and mental awakening? Secondly, I do not think Dan ever found enlightenment because of the way he illustrated it at the end of the book. The ONLY way to become enlightened is through deep meditation and achieving high level of Qi energy, I don't think the author knows that so he just pretty much cheated with a vision and let it be. Another mistake the author made while trying to illustrate the path of searching for enlightenment is the wrong and stereotypical Hollywood version of neglecting families and going around the world for eight years trying to find answers. There are absoulte no answers to be found in the outside world but inside yourself and Dan should know that if Socrates had taught him that far, yet Dan has to sqeeze that part into the book, guiding the readers on a wrong path.Even with those faults, the story is entertaining and inspiring with many essential teaching of Zen Buddism and Taoism. I love it for that, as an easy to digest book that immerse and educate at the same time, I have not read another english book that's quite this unique on the subject of finding your soul. Remember, if you want to go on a real path of enlightenment, find meditation (Vipassan or Zen meditation, not new age BS) and/or Qigong (a lot harder to find the right teacher, but worth the search), then you'll have your answer."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"The title of this book aroused my curiosity; however, after 3 or 4 reading sessions, I found it easy to just let the book rest and pick up something else to read. I suppose I was looking for a \\"how-to\\" book, but instead found it to be tiresome fiction."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"This book is nothing short of amazing. This is a perfect book for anybody like me who is turned of by fundamentalism of any religious persuasion but knows there is a deep spiritual wisdom out there somewhere."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"Don't read this book -- read INTO it. Close your eyes to the juvenile manner in which it is written and listen to the message it sends. Dan obviously has something to say, and if his manner of saying it is slack, it shouldn't stand in the way of you listening to the message! Look past the transparent words to the actual story itself -- that is what is important! READ INTO IT!"},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"Let's start out with the good here-the message that this book conveys draws largely from Asian philosophy and, though it may be nothing you haven't heard before, it is all presented in a less profound and abstract way for us westerners. In a nutshell, it says to exercise and be disciplined, be wary of your thoughts, and eat healthy (and without meat!)-Which I agree with.With that said, let's get to the bad...and it is bad. For one, the author is quite possibly the most pompous person I have ever heard talk. I am pretty sure that much of the Asian philosophy that he draws from conveys that you need to avoid being egotistical, but he seems to have missed the memo there. The beginning and middle sections suggest that he was lost and hopeless, but turned his life around after following the philosophy set by this magical old man. And towards the end after essentially reaching nirvana, he walks up and down the street and says that he sees so many people who are slowly dying and lying to themselves about their lives (I paraphrase here). It is nice to know that this author not only reached nirvana, but gained the ability to judge others without ever even talking to them.I was on the fence about whether to give this a 2 or 3-star review, but went with 2 for the simple fact that I wouldn't recommend this to friends."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"If your'e interested in a little self-help and motivational reading, this is the book for you!

The friend was addicted to heroin at the time and had just pawned off my acoustic guitar I lent him in order to buy more junk. He came to me shortly after the event and told me he had something for me while reaching into his backpack.I knew my guitar wouldn't fit in the bag... and I wasn't using heroin.. so I had zero idea what the hell he was about to give me. Out of his bag he pulled out a beat up copy of \`Way of the Peaceful Warrior', handed it to me with a smile, and said \`I never give my books to anyone, but I want you to have this'. I glanced at the front cover, which boldly claimed it was a \`Book That Changes Lives', and automatically thought \`heard that one before', said thanks, and put it in my bag. In retrospect I noticed he was a lot calmer than usual, but I didn't make any connection between that and the book he gave me. At the time I was so absorbed in my own little world that I had minimal awareness of other people and my environment.I read a couple of pages a day or two later, and deciding I wasn't interested in the story, put it back in the bookshelf where it collected dust for a while. That was maybe a year ago, I can't recall, but quite recently I saw the friend again, after a long absence, and found out that he was leaving Melbourne for good to move to Hawaii. So I decided I would read that book he gave me; after all, he had previously introduced me to The Alchemist, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance and Shantaram, so I figured he was a on a roll with good books. I read the book in Bali in a couple of days, and I didn't want it to end. After I finished it I felt a zest that I hadn't felt in a long time; I bubbled with energy and appreciation for life. Has this book changed my life? Definitely. Infinite gratitude goes to the friend who gave me the book, whose life appears to have changed as well: he has now kicked his heroin addiction, is practicing a vegan diet, and is getting married to a beautiful girl in Hawaii!It's a good thing I didn't read the book when I first received it, because I don't think I was at a stage in my life where I could appreciate such a book, or absorb its insights. This is the sort of book that will come to you when you are ready, and I don't doubt that you will read it more than once when that time comes. As for the story, it's not important, but I'll humour you and say it's about a young gymnast named Dan Millman (the book's author: it's a partly autobiographical book) who discovers an old nameless man at a gas station, whom he develops a teacher/student relationship with. Dan calls the old man Socrates, which is a very fitting name for two reasons: 1. Socrates, the Greek philosopher, was very wise. And 2. No one knows whether Socrates really existed, as he only exists within the writings of Plato, his pupil. Socrates is for the most part shrouded in mystery, but what does get revealed to you about him I will not ruin. This is a book that I think is best to know as little about as possible before reading. All I will say is that the book follows the relationship of Dan and Soc till the very end as Dan, and the reader, struggle to come to terms with the new world Socrates has opened up - a world of infinite energy and potential."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"This book reminds me of The Guru Delivery, or Illusions, in that it is a wonderful story of an unexpected master/student relationship. It expresses a way to balance the mind/body/spirit relationship and does so in a very entertaining fashion. I would highly recommend this book for anyone who enjoys reading about things of a higher nature."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"This book s AMAZING. It makes you want to change your ways just like the main character. I recommend it to anyone.. Boy, girl.. man, woman.. SO GOOD."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"Once I started reading this book I couldn't put it down! After I read it I tried to get all my friends to read it because the message is something everyone can benefit from. It challenged me over and over again and changed the way I view myself and those around me. I've actually ended up reading other books by Dan Millman and have continued to find great insight and wisdom in his writings."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"One of my most treasured reads, and as a professional librarian and reviewer, needless to say I've read much. This unusual book is a wonderful introduction to deeper philosophies like Zen, but it's written in a light, upbeat style that is very approachable. As a result of reading this book, my life really did change. I ended up as a \\"student\\" of Dan Millman's, of a sort, when he became my Editor and I published in a bestselling series under his direction. Choose this title only if you're ready for real change, personally, professionally, spiritually. Reread it every five years to mark your own path."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"If you choose to read this book then it is the right time for you to start the change. To be given insights into how we can better our lives is a very special thing. And must be given in the right way and at the right time. It can be a story about any one of us. And how our lives can get better from having a conscious understanding of how things really work in this world. It was given to me by a friend at the right time and I am thankful."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"This novel created a new image of life for me. It has got me looking at life through a different perspective. I rate this novel a five because Dan went through similar situations that I had gone through, and has gotten me thinking differently about the rough road ahead of me. He coped with the stress exceptionally well and he was also able to keep a positive mentality. Some of his experiences are very similar to mine so it was farely easy to relate to his thoughts. For example, he's an athlete going through college with very overwhelming struggles. He struggles and fights through rough experiences and still reaches graduation. He also hurts his leg in a brutal motorcycle accident which prevented him to compete in gymnastic competitions. I also had injured my leg playing a sport, and it's also preventing me from being active in my sports. He also is a unique individual that is eagared to suceed. He helps his team win a National Championship and also he finally becomes the warrior that he had been anticipating for quite a while. I admired his courageous heart and accomplishments that he achieved through the tough road to recovery. He also has a friend named, Socrates, that advised him how to cope with difficult situations in life, and how not to get discouraged. He helped Dan and I find our inner peace that's needed to pursue our goals in life. He showed us the path of becoming a &quot;Peaceful Warrior.&quot;"},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"Mr. Milliman's &quot;The Way of the Peaceful Warrior&quot; is an excellent book.

HIs book, labeled as self-help, entrances readers and forces their curiosity to probe the pages for answers. The book is dedicated primarily to answers.

A novel for anyone who has an open mind to change."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"yes, indeed this book is incredibly inspiring, but it does more than just that. it lays out a way to live that is simple and full of common sense--based on action. and this book does change lives, as the sub-title says. it is not some mumbled psychological garble, but it instead offers words that reach you and get you out of your own head and into this life. i seriously hope everyone reads this book."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"Going through a very difficult time with my marriage and children, I was suggested that I offer this book to my 14 year old, but I found myself reading it instead and I'm glad I did! I lost myself in the images of the story. Taking myself to the places than Mr. Millman traveled through. I looked within myself and found that I was and am better than I thought. I highly recommend this book for troubled minds and for teenagers who are stuggling with who they are and were they belong. It makes you think and it actually enlightens you, resoluting in peace of mind. I look forward to reading more of Mr. Millman's books."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"When I first read this book, I literally felt myself changing. It was like I woke up to the life I had been missing. I realized what was real and what wasn't, plus I began to understand the power of living in the present. I have now read the book many times and have passed it on to others. Purchasing this book was one of the best decisions I have ever made in my life."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I knew almost nothing about this book when I picked it up. As I began reading I was amazed, rivited. I made my best friend read it, and we spoke of nothing else for weeks. It changed the way I think, act, eat, and even how I see the world. I found this book to be a priceless gem amidst the sea of meaningless &quot;inspirational&quot; and &quot;self-help&quot; books that swamp every bookstore. A must-read for anyone, anywhere!"},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"Giving that book to me was one of the best things a friend ever did to me. I do now believe that I can survive this life - and I love it!!"},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"I love eastern philosophy and religion. I read alot back in my college days. Much of this story is exactly that in a westernized style. Kind of refreshed my reading. I will give this to my son who is 10 in a few years."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"This just have to be the only book which tries to help a truth seeker in real sense. A sincere try from Socrates - a real warrior, sage and probably more than that. I have completed the book in two days, just couldn't stop reading. Just amazing insights from Socrates - just invaluable in terms of the betterment of man kind it can cause. I thought the book would be same as the movie but it is much better than the movie and Socrates covers much more than Here and Now.I have one suggestion though, it is that in the end in the actual sense Dan did not open the Gate. He thought he did, but not really. What he had is an experience, not a realization. An experience sometimes stays on the person and would have a temporary affect of not using the mind. But only when Self Realizes the truth then and only then it can be free from mind. So Dan should keep going in his search."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"It was hard for me to get through this book although I understood many of its themes. I think that the author failed in trying to write a \\"novel\\" out of his personal spiritual experience. I was hoping that there would be more of a deeper philosophical discussion behind his narration but rather I found the reading rather dry and unengaging. Maybe the simplicity of the book is deliberate, as \\"Socrates\\" would have prefered. But for a book that \\"changes lives,\\" I expected that there would be more of a discussion of the journey of the spirit."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"This book is fantastic. It reads like a conversation with an old friend - the wise friend who sees that you need something but aren't sure what and tells you just the right thing.It's a remarkable book and a beautiful and energizing read.If you're at the top of your game or feeling like you need a helping hand, this book is a nice way to re-examine your life, the people in it and makes you want to live in the moment."},{"Title":"Way of the peaceful warrior : a basically true story","review":"Interesting read filled with self-actualization and revelation some truth and some fantasy. The author made some good points about improving oneself and being a master of oneself, however, he injected the storyline with a lot of fiction. Some are realistic and most of the time believable. Nonetheless, it was entertaining and worth reading but don't change your life over night just to live by it. Plus, the movie didn't do the book justice. Way off from the storyline in the book."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:P},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:S,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},q=["disabled"],j={key:0},M={key:1};function W(n,e,s,c,r,i){const f=g("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",x,[(t(!0),a(y,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(t(),b(f,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",M,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",j,"See more"))],8,q)):p("",!0)])}const E=u(C,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-de2999c4"]]),H=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/60.md","filePath":"glossary/60.md"}'),K={name:"glossary/60.md"},L=Object.assign(K,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(E)]))}});export{H as __pageData,L as default};
