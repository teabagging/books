When I read the FOTR, I was speechless and breathless, and when I saw the movie, I was even more breathless! I read the Two Towers, and nothing, nothing at all can stop me from praising Tolkien's great masterpiece, that changed my frown to a joyful smile. It starts when Aragorn(Strider) Legolas and Gimli are alone in the wood, and mourn for their recently lost friend, Boromir. Frodo and Sam have departed the fellowship, and are climbing the Emyn Muil, a cliff, followed by Smeagol-Gollum, the slimy creature enchanted by his 'precious', and is tamed by Frodo and Sam. Pippin and Merry were captured by orcs (That is the way they spell it in Middle-Earth), they escape into the wood, and encounter Treebeard, the Ent. Aragorn and the other two, meet Theoden, Lord of the Mark, and they all set out to find Pippin and Merry. At Helm's Deep, they fight orcs, and Gimli brags about how he hewed forty-one heads with his axe. They meet Saruman, and Gandalf captures the ball on the tip of Saruman's staff. Pippin suddenly steals the ball from Gandalf, and is enchanted by a spell, but is broken by Gandalf himself.There is much violence, but it shows every detail, that maybe not only a boy would like. There is much more in the story, but if you want to know, read the story, and be enchanted by it's great spell."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Now divided &amp; separated, the surviving members of the fellowship continued on with their individual missions. More characters were introduced (good &amp; bad alike) &amp; more actions were seen on the first half of the book - what with the battle of Orthanc. The second half was quite slow &amp; focused on Frodo &amp; Sam's search of the Tower. What made it a little exciting was the continuous suspicion they had on their newly found ally (GUESS WHO!). I think the saving grace of the second half was its ending (here, I will not divulge any further) which promised a very exciting start for the subsequent book - The Return of the King.I suggest you immediately proceed reading the sequel once you finish this book."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book is very good like the 1st novel, the action and story are top rate, how ever after a while there were so many names of characters to remember. I would often to turn back the pages and even consult an online glossary to keep me in the loop as to who they were. Definitely worth the time."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book was written with a lot of thought and detail. Each chapter brings you closer to Mordor and the end. I enjoyed the way that Tolkin divided the book into sections, first your on a rescue mission to find Merry and Pippen, only to find out that they can take care of themselves just fine. And then your heading out with Sam and Frodo on a quest to destroy the ring. I enjoyed meeting the new characters like Theoden and Eomer, I didn't really like Eowyn though, she just didn't get through to me. I especailly liked meeting the brother of Boromir and learning more about his past and the people of Gondor. I have read the last book and the character of Faramir and Boromir's father shows through and you begin to see why they were as they were. I also really enjoyed the old characters of Legolas, Gimli, and Aragorn. The ending of this book will leave you needing more, thereby forcing you to run out and buy the last one where everything comes to a wonderful close."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"At the end of Fellowship of the Rings, Frodo and Sam have left the fellowship to destroy the ring in Mordor but what happens after that. Divided into two books, (one for Aragorn, Legolas, Merry, Pippin, Gimli and everyone else. And one for Sam and Frodo) this story answers that question. The first book (and my preferred part) tells about how Merry and Pippin are captured by Orcs. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli must rescue them before it's too late, friends and enemies on the way. But when they reunite with an old friend they learn that they must help to defeat the evil dark wizard Saruman.The second book follows Sam and Frodo on their long journey to destroy the ring. Frodo is weakening slowly under the rings weight and needs help if he wants to finish his quest. But when he receives that help in the shape of Gollum, a dark creature who is more or less a slave to the ring (his \\"precious\\") Sam is less sure than Frodo to accept his help. Gollum may seem harmless but what plans does he have for the two young hobbits? Is he being a faithful guide or leading them into danger?I really enjoyed this book. In my opinion it was even better than the last. The first volume of this book was my favorite due to the extensive presence of my favorite character Aragorn and the creating of a new kind of friend called the Ents. This book was well written and the characters drawn wonderfully. I can't wait to read the next and final book in the trilogy. Just like the last one the end leaves you with quite a cliff hanger."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"As the sequel of The Fellowship of the Ring and part two of The Lord of the Rings, this is definetley a page-turner. The strength of Isengard while Saruaman is ruling it has become so great that the great Men of Gondor dont think they have much hope without help. In this amazing book the friendship of the Fellowship and the loyalty that Sam has for Frodo is definetley tested. Gollum is playing a big part in this book also, being Frodo and Sam's guide through the Nameless Land.These hobbits have overcome so much that that as Sam puts it, \\"they should write a song about our adventures\\". This is a wonderful, awe-striking book. READ IT!!!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Perhaps the most accessible of all the Tolkein books, THE TWO TOWERS is the quickest read in THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy.It is a tale told at a brisk pace, and it is primarily an adventurous narrative with less of the historical 'timeouts' that occasionally plague Tolkein works. Boromir is gone, leaving Merry and Pippin in the hands of the marauding Orc army. They escape, and, with the help of Treebeard, they manage to find their way back to the center thread of the story ... rejoining Gandalf (back from the dead in stellar form), Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli in their quest to save all Middle-Earth from the treachery of Sauron. In THE TWO TOWERS, we also see the strong emergence of Aragorn as the 'king figure,' as his heroism and derringdo at Helm's Deep captivates the reader for the better part of two chapters.A must-read for fans of fantasy and science fiction, THE TWO TOWERS shows what a gifted writer can achieve when he lets his imagination loose to wander the hillsides for awhile. Absolutely breathtaking."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"THE TWO TOWERS is the second part of THE LORD OF THE RINGS. As mentioned elsewhere, it is a shame that THE LORD OF THE RINGS was originally printed in three separate volumes except in the one whole that Tolkien intended because now we constantly have to refer to the three pieces of the whole distinctively. With that said, THE TWO TOWERS is a grand follow up of THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING.The book begins exactly where THE FELLOWSHIP ended, with Frodo and Sam setting forth together to fufill the grand quest and the remaining members of the fellowship left fighting orcs of Sauron and the Uruk-hai (that develish breeding of orcs and goblins) of Saruman. The book begins on a sour note with the fellowhip tearing asunder and the death of Boromir and ends even more dismal with the separation of Frodo and Sam and Frodo's capture. Nevertheless, there is a great amount of hope in THE TWO TOWERS. Treebeard and the Ents arise from a sleeping living to avenge themselves on their former friend and neighbor, Saruman, and the forces of good win a great victory at Helm's Deep.However, the best part of THE TWO TOWERS are the lessons of friendship, love, and loyalty that it contains. The novel begins with the fellowship torn asunder: Boromir is killed; Merry and Pippin are captured by orcs; and Frodo and Sam leave on their own. Aragorn makes a difficult decision; realizing that Frodo has made his own decision; and attempts a rescue of Merry and Pippin. He would have followed Frodo all the way to Mt. Doom but chose instead to help the companions that could least help themselves.Later in the novel and even greater act of love is displayed by Samwise Gamgee. No spoilers told, but Sam shows in THE TWO TOWERS that the Baggins aren't the only hobbits who can do great deeds (a lesson even illustrated more in THE RETURN OF THE KING by Merry and Pippin) and his devotion to Frodo is the stuff that true friendships are made. Even in the darkest hour things aren't as hopeless as they seem."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"First, would like to say I am not a reader.

He makes up a history of wars and detailed maps, it is a wonderful book."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Two Towers by J.R.R. Tolkein is one of the best books I have ever read. Two Towers is the second book of the Lord of the Ring series. The plot of the novel revolves around destroying the ring of evil power.The novel beginning with an interesting \\"cat and mouse\\" game. The characters are from all over middle earth. Some of the characters are Froto, Gimly, Arawhen, elf and dwarf. The character are trying to destroy the ring. They had to destroy the so the evil would not come back.In the book Gimmle comes later. Gimmle helps them get to somewhere they need to go. He is helping them because he was tortured because he had the for along time. When they found out he had it they found him and tortured him. On the way back they blindfolded him so he would not know the way back.In the book they had a lot of imagery. When I read some parts of the book it felt like I was in the book. He used a lot of description. The symbol of the book was the ring itself. The ring symbols the book because the book is based on destroying the ring. The theme of the book is about the Hobbits. Hobbits even though small have as much to offer as humans, elfs and dwarfs.I would recommend Two Towers to anyone who likes to read to fantasy and adventure books. Tolkein used many details to describe the characters and settings with in the novel. The sere Lord of the Ring is an exciting, suspenseful and action packed book. I cant wait to read the next book in the series."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers by J.R.R. Tolkien is an epic tale about two courageous hobbits. Their fate separates them from the rest of the Fellowship when attacked by a group of orcs. In the attack, Boromir is slain and the hobbits Pippin and Merry are taken captive. The other two hobbits, Frodo the ring bearer and Samwise his trusty servant, leave during the attack on a quest to destroy the evil Ring of Power in the feared land of Mordor. The remaining members of the fellowship Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli begin their chase of the orcs to save the captured Pippin and Merry. While Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli were hunting the orcs, Frodo and Sam find an unlikely guide who takes them to the gates of Mordor and beyond. Frodo and Sam meet untold perils on their trek to the gates of Mordor. Meanwhile, Aragorn, Legalos, and Gimli take part in an epic battle that leads to a turning point in the war against Sauron, and begins Pippin and Merry on their road to fame and glory.I recommend this book to people who like action, drama and fantsy. Before you read this book you should read two other books written by J.R.R. Tolkien. These are \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\", the prologue and first book in The Lord of the Rings trilogy, respectively. These books are all very good books and are definitely worth your time."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Tower comes after The Fellowship of the Ring and before The Return of the King. Most of my favorite parts in the trilogy are in this book and The Return of the King. Some of the things that Frodo goes through are amazing. You would almost think that he wouldn't be able to go through with them. This book might be hard for young readers because of the style that J.R.R. Tolkien uses."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"&#65279;The Two TowersBook ReviewJ. R. R. Tolkien's The Two Towers is a fantastic book. It is the kind of fantasy that every person would enjoy. There is every kind of event, so even the pickiest person would be able to find something they like. The second book in a three part series, The Two Towers continues the story of the Ring. The reader meets many new characters, including the Ents and the Riders of Rohan. The Two Towers is about the quest to destroy the Ring of Power. If the dark lord Sauron gets the Ring, all of Middle-earth will be destroyed. The broken fellowship now insists of three groups: Legolas, Aragorn and Gimli, Merry and Pippen, and Frodo and Sam. The novel starts with the death of Boromir, who was taken over by the Ring. Legolas, Aragorn, and Gimli immediately set out to find Merry and Pippen. Merry and Pippen have been captured by the enemy and must be rescued. Thisbegins The Two Towers, with many more adventures to come. The Two Towers is a must-read for anyone who likes fantasy and adventure. There are no weaknesses. I enjoyed reading the novel very much. The beginning starts out slow, but things speed up quickly. Anyone who likes fantasy will enjoy it because every page in this masterpiece is very well written. The Two Towers is definitely a great book."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The second book of the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" series is named \\"The Two Towers.\\" The first part of the book is about the company of Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas following the trail of an Orc company who captured two of their Hobbit companions (Merry and Pippin). With the help of an old friend and other the company finally finds the lost Hobbits and they overtake Saruman at Isengard in the process.During the second part of the novel Frodo and Sam (two other Hobbits) were traveling to seek Mount Doom to get rid of the evil ring. They capture Gollum who had been following them for a long time and he agrees to take them where they want to go. They trust Gollum and follow him. Eventually Gollum flees in fright of Boromir's brother. Frodo and Sam however stay and get great provisions from him. Then they move on and run into danger witch leads Frodo and Sam to be separated.I have enjoyed the trills of the first two books in the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" series. I am sure to read the final book soon. Even if you do not enjoy the science fiction genre I still recommend this book. It is a great read and always keeps you interested."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"\\"The Two Towers\\" opens with the dispersal of the Fellowship Of The Ring. Boromir, eldest son of the Steward of Gondor, is killed by marauding Orcs intent on capturing Merry and Pippin. In a sense, his heroic death is an act of redemption on his part, after trying to seize the Ring from Frodo. Merry and Pippin are carried off by these Orcs, servants of the corrupt wizard Saruman. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas begin their trek towards Minas Tirith, the capital of Gondor, hoping to overtake Saruman's Orcs. And Frodo and Samwise proceed towards Mordor and Mount Doom.This second installment of \\"The Lord Of The Rings\\" is in two parts; the first deals with the exploits of Merry, Pippin, Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas. The second recounts Frodo's and Samwise's perilous journey to Mordor. Without a doubt, this is the most character driven installment of the entire \\"Lord Of The Rings\\" saga. Without giving away the plot, the book is an insightful survey of the main characters and their motivations. Suffice it to say that their interactions amongst themselves as well as with important minor characters such as Fangorn, the chief of the Ents, play an important part in determining the outcome of the war of the Ring.Much of Tolkien's best writing can be found in this book. I found \\"The Two Towers\\" as engrossing as either \\"Fellowship Of The Ring\\" or \\"The Return Of The King\\", the third book in the trilogy. Incidentally, \\"The Two Towers\\" refers to Saruman's tower, Orthanc, at Isengard, and the Dark Lord Sauron's tower in Mordor."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"In an outstanding second book in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, JRR Tolkien continues the saga of Frodo and the Fellowship. It picks up where the Fellowship of the Ring left off, but loses nothing in momentum, and has an overall darker tone to it. Great book, great series, great author. It is a must read for people of all ages."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers tells two stories. First, it tells of the defeat of Saruman. This is Pippin and Merry's part of the story. With some help from Ents (walking &amp; talking trees), Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas, Eomer, Theoden and the newly resurrected Gandalf, the power of the traitor wizard Saruman is broken. In the second half of the novel, Frodo and Sam are lead to Mordor by Gollum. But Gollum, try as he might, cannot overcome the corruption of the ring; and his obsession to repossess it leads to betrayal. Wonderfully poetic, fun at some places, sad and dark in others, this is a novel not to be missed. If you don't have a copy, get one and read it. If you have read it, read it again. It never gets old. It gets better with age."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Excellent great book one of the best books ever written phenomenal .

Plus, if you've watched the movies, there are many things in the extended editions that will make way more sense if you've read the books. Third time reading, no regrets!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Liked it much better than the movie; I would recomend this book to both teen and oldie readers like myself."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I remember reading an article where the author discussed which towers were possibly the two towers referred to in the title of the second novel of \\"The Lord of The Rings\\". Candidates included Ortanc, Barad-dr, Ecthelion, Minas Morgul, and Cirith Ungol. One could have included the Hornburg in the list as well, but this particular discussion did not include it. The author discussed several pairs of options, but for me the answer was simple, as it indicates at the end of authorized Ballentine edition of \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" that it is Ortahnc and Minus Morgal and that is where the action is focused for most of the two books contained in the \\"The Two Towers\\". However, if you watch the film, it strongly points to two towers as Orthanc and Barad-dr. To confuse matters more, there is a letter from Tolkien to Rayner Unwin where he states that the two towers are Orthanc and Cirith Ungol, but remember that it wasn't Tolkien that split the work into three volumes and he was never happy with the title, and apparently he changed his mind later as he is the author of the note I mentioned above. Of course, to enjoy the book it really doesn't matter which two towers the title actually refers to, but it was an interesting discussion.I believe that the second volume of a trilogy is the most difficult one to evaluate. The reader is coming into a story which has already begun, and left with no real ending. In the case of \\"The Two Towers\\", Tolkien navigates those difficulties quite well. Though certainly one should read \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" first, there is a brief synopsis, and while each of the two books in the volume leaves the story hanging a bit, they are certainly reasonable places to leave the story off. \\"The Two Towers\\" was originally published on November 11th of 1954.Book III is titled \\"The Treason of Isengard\\" and covers the stories of all the characters except Frodo and Sam (who are the subjects of Book IV). It starts where Book II left off, with Aragorn hearing Boromir's horn. This book introduces numerous new characters such as Treebeard, &Eacute;omer, King Th&eacute;oden, Lady &Eacute;owyn, and of course Grima Wormtongue. It is a tale rich in characters, and in large battles, heroism, and last ditch efforts. The book ends with victory against Saruman, but that is over-shadowed by the coming battle with Sauron and the forces of Mordor, as well as the lack of knowledge of what has become to Frodo and Sam.Book IV is titled \\"The Ring Goes East\\", though it has also been called \\"The Journey of the Ringbearers\\" and by contrast with Book III there are very few characters. Frodo, Sam, and Gollum are the main characters of this book, though we do meet Faramir during the tale of the ring-bearers as they take the ring to Mordor. This book as a darker ending than Book III, as the book closes with Frodo having been poisoned by the venom of Shelob and has been taken by the enemy, with Sam struggling to rescue him.As with the first book in the series when compared with the movie, I personally prefer the book, though I have enjoyed the movie as well. However long the movie is, it is a condensed version of the book, and you will miss out on many significant characters and events, as well as be unaware of the changes which were made for whatever reason. The movies were a valiant effort to bring this effort to the screen, and they honor Tolkien's overall story, but to fully appreciate what Tolkien created, you need to read the books."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Lord of the rings is a classic that I hold dear to my heart, I loved all the books and the last one I have to say was a triumphant ending. I feel like the original ending was perfect for this story, one that you can't remake."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"It's said that J.R.R. Tolkien invented an entirely new genre, \\"Sword and Sorcery,\\" by creatingThe Lord of the Rings. Some readers will insist that Tolkien's work falls under the rubric of \\"High Fantasy,\\" but the difference between the two genres seems, to this reviewer, to be equivalent to the difference between purple and violet.More relevantly, fully 30% of all fiction books published today fall into the genre, whatever name we give it. In truth, Tolkien breathed life back into the old Northern European myths about Elves and Dwarves and Trolls.Tolkien, when he wasn't teaching philology at Oxford, academically translating Anglo-Saxon epics, working on the staff of the Oxford Dictionary of the English Language, or raising his fair-sized family, spent all his adult life creating the LORD OF THE RINGS universe, which includes the entireSILMARILLIONlegendarium.Tolkien's desire was to create a mythology for England. More properly, one might say he wanted to create a mythology for Anglo-Saxon England based upon it's Germanic roots. Arguably, England's mythology would be the mythology of the original Celts who populated the Scepter'd Isle, but so much of that has been lost under the palimpsest of Roman, Anglo-Saxon, and Norman domination that only fragments remain, and during his lifetime Tolkien admitted he did not much consider the fragments compelling.Although Tolkien began writing THE SILMARILLION legendarium in 1917, it was considered bizarre and ultimately unpublishable by the decision-makers of the day. A history of the speakers of the \\"Elvish Tongues,\\" it grew out of Tolkien's invention of those tongues. Like a classical composer, Tolkien was compelled to put his favorite sounds down on paper, and once having done so, wove a history around the development of the languages he created, which were based, in part, on Finnish (Quenya, or High-Elven) and Welsh (Sindarin, or Grey-Elven).The legendarium backed into published existence when Tolkien wrote down an episodic bedtime story he had been telling his children over the years. As written down and published it becameThe Hobbit, the story of the hobbit Bilbo Baggins and his amazing journey \\"there and back again\\" to wrest a treasure from a dragon. Willy-nilly, it contained elements of his legendarium, and quite unexpectedly, it became a best-seller when published in 1937.With his publishers clamoring for a sequel, Tolkien sat down to write it. It took him twelve years to complete, finally seeing the light of day as THE LORD OF THE RINGS. I first read THE TWO TOWERS back in 1976, just as Tolkien's work began to enjoy a resurgence. Having been embraced by 1950s longhairs, and then by 1960s counterculturists who loved its vision of a pastoral and unspoiled Middle-Earth, we in the late 1970s valued it for its escapism (and not a little for the in-joke of good-natured, laid-back Hobbits indulging in \\"pipe-weed\\"). Tolkien's popularity amongst my generation spawned the publication of THE SILMARILLION, the republication of THE LORD OF THE RINGS and THE HOBBIT in leatherbound editions with typo-corrected texts, and the production of aJ.R.R. Tolkien Animated Films Set (The Hobbit/The Lord of the Rings/The Return of the King)in those years.I own the leatherbound editions, and the old Ballantine boxed set editions (seen here) copyrighted 1966 (which I bought in 1976). It's tough to carry the leatherbound editions around (or even read them in bed) and my Ballantine editions have fallen apart due to re-reading and age, so I bought a new boxed set. I'm glad to see that the text in the new set is the corrected text, though the maps in the old paperback edition were larger and clearer.Despite being called a \\"trilogy,\\" THE LORD OF THE RINGS is not a trilogy in any real sense. Tolkien conceived THE LORD OF THE RINGS as a single volume comprising six books (plus appendices) but the original publisher split the work into three, publishing two books per volume with the appendices included into the third. The titles proposed by Tolkien for separate books were: Book I, \\"The First Journey\\" or \\"The Ring Sets Out\\"; Book II, \\"The Journey of the Nine Companions\\" or \\"The Ring Goes South\\"; Book III, \\"The Treason of Isengard\\"; Book IV, \\"The Journey of the Ring-bearers\\" or \\"The Ring Goes East\\"; Book V, \\"The War of the Ring\\"; and Book VI, \\"The End of the Third Age\\".Tolkien accepted, but did not like, the publisher-created titles, the ones most readers know. He felt that THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING was properly descriptive, but felt that THE RETURN OF THE KING gave away the ending of the story. He preferred THE WAR OF THE RING for the third volume. THE TWO TOWERS is the most obscure of the titles. Does the name refer to Saruman's Isengard and Sauron's Barad-Dur, or to Gondor's Minas Tirith and Mordor's Minas Morgul, or for that matter to the Tower of Cirith Ungol? It could be any of these combinations or others.In synopsis, it is belatedly discovered that The Ring held by the Hobbit Frodo Baggins is the One Ring, the Master Ring of all magical Rings in Middle-Earth. The Ring was created by the Dark Lord Sauron more than two thousand years before, and, having recently (as time is measured in Middle-Earth) re-established his Kingdom in the Land of Mordor, Sauron is seeking the One Ring.THE TWO TOWERS is the second publisher-created volume. It begins right where THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING ends. The storyline of THE TWO TOWERS divides in three: Boromir, killed by Orcs at the end of THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, is laid to rest by Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli, who then set out in a seemingly hopeless pursuit of the Orcs who have captured Merry and Pippin. In the course of their pursuit they meet up with Gandalf The White, travel to the Kingdom of Rohan, and bring Rohan into the War, fighting the great Battle of Helm's Deep against the corrupt wizard Saruman.Even as the Battle of Helm's Deep goes on, Merry and Pippin, having escaped the clutches of the Orcs, flee into Fangorn Forest where they become friends with Treebeard the Ent who leads his people against Saruman himself at Saruman's redoubt of Isengard. (In a book filled with invented races and their languages, Tolkien's Ents, a race of living, walking, speaking trees is a stroke of brilliance, a paean to the trees and woods he loved so much.)Frodo and Sam leave the Fellowship in secret and set out to take The Ring back to Mordor, where, if unrecaptured by Sauron, it can be destroyed in the fire where it was first cast. Along the way, they ally themselves with Gollum, the deranged Hobbit who had held The Ring for some 500 years, who acts as their guide into the Black Land.Considering the complexities of maintaining the three storylines, Tolkien demonstrates incredible care in his storytelling. This is not simply authorship, it is the detailed craftsmanship of a master wordsmith. The Moon is in a consistent phase across all three storylines and the weather varies locally but is referenced across-the-board. In all my re-readings of THE TWO TOWERS I have found only two unforced errors: That of Faramir the Captain of Gondor, who rejects The Ring in passing (although, to be fair to Tolkien, he never actually sees it), and the fact that Sam puts on The Ring within the boundaries of Mordor but is not discovered (Frodo, who does so later, is perceived by Sauron).Tolkien, who is the Shakespeare of Sword and Sorcery, sets a high standard for fantasy authors who come after him (not that he ever imagined the legions of writers who would follow in the footsteps of Frodo and his Nine Companions) by crafting his Middle-Earth with such precision and detail.Thus, we are allowed to experience, \\"the smell of a distant wood borne from afar by a cool breeze at night.\\" The trees are \\"great ilexes of huge girth standing dark and solemn in wide glades,\\" the Valley of the Tower of Sorcery, itself illuminated with \\"a noisome exhalation of decay, a corpse-light,\\" is filled with \\"shadowy meads filled with pale white flowers . . . beautiful yet horrible of shape like the demented forms in an uneasy dream.\\" Even in a battle scene, there comes, \\"A blare of trumpets . . . a crash and a flash of flame and darkness.\\" And of Shelob, the monstrous spider of Cirith Ungol, Tolkien writes, \\"All living things were her food and her vomit darkness.\\"This is poetry. Not just adventure, Tolkien created art---a portrait in words. \\"Aiya E&auml;rendil Elenion Ancalima! Hail E&auml;rendil, brightest of stars!\\" THE TWO TOWERS deserves as many stars as it can get."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"My 10 yr old wanted to watch the movies... Told him he had to read the books first. He finished Fellowship of the Ring in 1 week and Two Towers in 3 days. Amazing part was he had to prove he understood what he read by passing a Q & A with me on the story and characters. Very impressed with his comprehension. He can't wait to read Return of the King, which I'll be ordering today."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I have yet to finish this book, but I was enchanted on the first page.

NAO!!!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I really liked this book, even though there were parts of the story that slowed down too much. I liked how this book jumped straight into action where the first book left off. If you haven't read the first book I advise that you do read it before reading this one, or at least read the summary that is found in this book. I enjoyed the first half of the book where you are with Aragorn and his half of the company, but the second half with Frodo and Sam wasn't as exciting. The story kind of lagged and became a little boring. I had already seen the movies and that helped me to stay interested through the slower story line. However, I kept pushing through to the end and I was not disappointed. The ending leaves you wanting more.J. R. R. Tolkien did a great job of creating and illustrating Middle Earth. I feel like I'm living the legend with the main characters. Tolkien did a great job of illustrating the characters. All of their personalities made me feel like I was with them. Here is one of my favorite examples of imagery: \\"Disturbed as if out of a gloating dream by his small yell she turned slowly the dreadful malice of her glance upon him. But almost before she was aware that a fury was upon her greater than any she had known in countless years, the shining sword bit upon her foot and shore away her claw.\\" This is in the part where Sam fights Shelob, but I won't spoil anymore of the book."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The second volume of Tolkien's epic trilogy never even wavers. If anything, it seems steadier and more controlled than \\"Fellowship of the Ring,\\" as several characters become more central and the plot focus widens to envelop all of Middle Earth. It suffers from a bit of sequelitis in places, but the overall book is just as enthralling as the first.Aragorn finds that Merry and Pippin have been abducted rather than killed -- for what reason, no one knows. Frodo and Sam have left on their own. So Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli race to find the orcs and retrieve the hobbits, but are stopped by the fierce Riders of Rohan, and then by an old and dear friend: Gandalf, who has been resurrected in the new form of a White wizard. Elsewhere, Merry and Pippin must use all of their wits to escape the orcs, and then find a strange band of allies that no one could have hoped for.Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam head into Mordor -- with an eerily familiar figure, Gollum, following them. Frodo subjugates Gollum, forcing him to swear on \\"the precious\\" that he won't harm him. In return, Gollum promises to guide the two hobbits through Mordor, straight to Mount Doom. But the Ring is weighing more heavily than ever on Frodo, and is starting to reassert its old sway on Gollum...One of the most noticeable changes in this book is the shift of focus. \\"Fellowship\\" was Frodo-centric, since the narration revolved around him, as did all the events and thoughts. But with the breaking of the Fellowship, the narration falls into three categories: Frodo and Sam; Merry and Pippin; Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli. This triple style allows individuals to shine more brightly, when they are called on to do more than hike with Frodo.Tolkien also presented a wider view of Middle-Earth in general. While the slow slog through Mordor doesn't really tell or show readers much -- aside from what a hellhole Sauron is the middle of -- it's shocking to see the the effects of the orcs, Saruman and Sauron on places such as Gondor and Rohan.Changes can be seen in Frodo even in this book, and which become more pronounced in the third book of the trilogy, \\"Return of the King.\\" He becomes sadder and more introspective, and the Ring's growing hold on him can be glimpsed at times. Aragorn is also changing. He is no longer merely the rugged outcast Ranger, but displays the hints of a future great king, if he can only get to his throne.Merry and Pippin also change: these two innocent young hobbits have to suddenly Sam is more promiment in this book, as Frodo's friend and personal pillar of strength.But where Tolkien really outdid himself is Gollum. Gollum returns, in a substantially different state. Oh, he's still addled and addicted to the Ring, but he displays a dual love/loathing for the Ring, a weird affection for Frodo (who, from his point of view, is probably the only person who has been kind to him), and displays a Ring-induced multiple-personality syndrome. Very rarely can bad guys elicit the sort of loathing and pity from the reader that Gollum does.One noticeable aspect of this book is friendship. When the Fellowship sets out from Rivendell, virtually everyone is a stranger, with the exception of the hobbits. However, in this book we get our view of how much Sam loves Frodo and wants to help him. Sam is fully aware of how much Frodo needs emotional support, and he's quite willing to be a pillar of strength for his friend. We see Gimli and Legolas's affection for Merry and Pippin; and Legolas's willingness to kill Eomer if Eomer hurts Gimli shows how far this Elf and Dwarf have come.This book is substantially darker than \\"Fellowship.\\" Frodo is starting to stumble under the weight of the Ring, and other characters die or are seriously hurt. The scene where Pippin's mind is trapped by Sauron is a very disturbing one, as is a violent and saddening scene late in the book. But there is also some wry humor: Gandalf's joke as he hears Saruman throttling Grima Wormtongue, Legolas's snippy comments about pipeweed as Gimli and the hobbits smoke up a storm, and Sam's debate with Gollum about whether they should cook the rabbits.Tolkien's second Lord of the Rings novel is a thrilling fantasy adventure, exploring more of his invented world than \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" did.

The computer science concepts are treated very differently from any other comp sci author I've seen before.It's a great book to read, but not so easy to understand. You need to be deeply philosophical to understand and enjoy it. I am, so I do. It helps to have a background in psychology of computers."},{"Title":"The Society of Mind","review":"The book provides several kind of falsifiable (perhaps some are too abstract) theories and hypothesis floating around the book, but don't worry, Minsky is well aware of how science marchesThe only course left for us is to study the mind the way scientists do when something is too large or too small to see - by building theories based on evidence.That is not what the book is about of course, like I said before, it provides a framework, or several frameworks and hypothesis, to begin building experiments and improving the hypothesis and frameworks(or destroying them).There is a lot of talk about what things mean, and how meaning is merely the connections that one does between scarcely existing things.The secret of what anything means to us depends on how we've connected it to all the other things we know. That's why it's almost always wrong to seek the ''real meaning'' of anything. A thing with just one meaning has scarcely any meaning at all.This connectionism is keenly related to Papert's principle and to how people learn (the ideas that grew into this book originated from Papert and Minsky dialogues, but they went into separated directions, Papert went into pedagogy and the applications of these ideas into constructionism, Minsky remained interested in the construction of an intelligent machine).I disagree with what Minsky's concept of intelligence.Our minds contain processes that enable us to solve problems that we consider difficult. ''Intelligence'' is the name for whichever of those processes we don't yet understand.Then he goes and addsLike the concept of ''the unexplored regions of Africa'', it disappears as soon as we discover it.I think that our concept of intelligence is flexible and mutable, but it is not bound to disappear, it will just change with our perception of the world.There is also several Buddhist quotes, mostly about the nature of suffering (attachment). Since I identify a lot with those though, I'll cite one of them:Do not become attached to the things you like, do not maintain aversion to the things you dislike. Sorrow, fear and bondage come from one's likes and dislikes.The most interesting part for in was the description of what is called Papert's principle:Some of the most crucial steps in mental growth are based not simply on acquiring new skills, but on acquiring new administrative was to use what one already knows.I think the development of this principle is one of the aspects of the book who is most valuable in a profound personal way. It is, as Papert would say, a powerful idea.This idea, in my opinion, is the embryo that gave birth to constructionism. There is several ideas that resonate with those found in other works by Papert, specially Mindstorms. Like for instanceOur best ideas are often those that bridge between two different worlds!The book goes on through a lot of ground. Sincerely there is quite a lot to learn, even from casual reading, like this little pearl from Buddha:If the mind were an ego-personality, it could do this and that as it would determine, but the mind often flies from what it knows is right and chases after evil reluctantly. Still, nothing seems to happen exactly as its ego desires. It is simply the mind clouded over by impure desires, and impervious to wisdom, which stubbornly persists in thinking of ''me'' and ''mine''.Well, I'll say it one more time, Minsky is a genius, one of the greatest minds to work on AI and psychology. This is a great work, so go ahead and fetch it! My bet is that this book and its successor will still be studied for decades, and will be looked back as reference for a lot of subjects."},{"Title":"The Society of Mind","review":"This book by one of the most important pioneers in artificial intelligence was ahead of its time.It deals with a society of agents that interact with each other, organize into hierarchies and networks, and give rise to \\"emergent\\" properties (in Minsky's view, the mind).The ideas in this book were highly influential in artificial intelligence, computer science, the philosophy of mind, and psychology.The book may seem a \\"popular\\" exposition and it was geared, in a sense, to be so.

The approach is metaphorical/philosophical, and no empirical evidence is given for the ideas expounded. The &quot;society of mind&quot;, composed as it is of a collection of simple objects, is purely reductionist in its strategy and philosophy. It is though a highly original and thought provoking introduction to the major questions involving mental states, concept formation in the brain, learning theory, and artificial intelligence. The author gives many interesting examples that entice the reader to &quot;think out of the box&quot;.The book itself is written as though each chapter were itself one of these agents. Typically a chapter poses a question or a particular phenomenon, and the author then addresses how the mind would implement of resolve this question or deal with this phenomenon. Some interesting chapters in the book include:1. Self-Knowledge is Dangerous: The author argues that mental constraints are needed to prevent the individual from artificially creating emotional states that would prevent deliberate action on our part. An intelligent machine will then need to have such constraints in order to prevent it from repeating endlessly the same activity.2. Learning from Failure: Minsky argues that confining oneself to positive learning experiences will not be as robust or effective as one that will involve some kind of discomfort or pain. Such discomfort will enable more radical changes in conceptual structure.3. Power of Negative Thinking: The author argues that an optimistic problem-solving strategy is contingent on the ability to recognize several paths to the solution, with the best path then selected. When such knowledge is not available, a &quot;pessimistic&quot; strategy is more optimal. The solution in this case is one that at first glance seems the worst possible avenue of approach.4. Emotion: The question is posed as to whether machines can be intelligent without any emotions. The author seems to be arguing, and plausibly I think, that emotions serve as a defense against competing interests when a goal is set. Emotional responses occur when the most important goal(s) are disrupted by other influences. Intelligent machines then will need to have the many complex checks and balances.5. Must Machines be Logical: It is argued correctly that intelligent machines must employ reasoning tools other then ones that are strictly logical. Logic is strictly a side constraint, a test that prevents invalid conclusions. It cannot by itself lead to genuine knowledge.6. Mathematics Made Hard: Minsky argues that the strategy behind the construction of mathematical systems, via strict definitions and categorization, results in systems that have very small &quot;meaning&quot; content. More robust systems must be developed and integrated into the educational process and into any design for intelligent machines.7. Weighing Evidence: There is an interesting example of a collection of four index cards on two of which are connected line patterns, and on the other two disconnected line patterns. When the cards are cut into many pieces, and put into separate piles, then a machine with a feature weighing capability would be unable to distinguish between the piles.8. The Mind and the World: The author's thinking on the mind-body problem is a very sensible one, namely that &quot;minds are simply what brains do&quot;. It matters not, according to the author, what the substance of mind (brain) is, only what it (the agents) do.A few omissions in the book include the discussion on intelligence: the author never really gives his outlook or &quot;definition&quot; of intelligence, but merely comments on a few other opinions on this concept. If one is to make &quot;intelligent&quot; machines, it is important that intelligence be characterized explicitly so that one will know when and if the goal of artificial intelligence has been reached. The author correctly argues however that expert systems can and have been successfully constructed, and that the most formidable obstacle to constructing an &quot;intelligent&quot; machine is in implementing the ability of humans to exercise &quot;common sense&quot;."},{"Title":"The Society of Mind","review":"In this book Minsky tries, as have many scientists before him, to explain what seems unexplainable. Even though in present day, many people believe in science over magic, the majority still believes that the brain is somehow magical and cannot be replicated. Minsky asks what stops us from building a brain out of steel instead of carbon? He breaks down the mind in a way that anyone can understand how it works.I'm almost 14 and in the 8th grade. I picked up this book for a research project on Cognitive Psychology because it was the only thing I could find that wasn't written for graduate students. Not only could I understand it, but it kept my attention (unlike most non-fiction books) and I enjoyed reading it. I liked how Minsky could take the most complex thing in the world, the brain, and describe it in easy to understand terms. There were many pictures and diagrams used to represent the text. For example, to show the basics of how the mind works using many separate agents, Minsky used the example of a child building a tower out of blocks and how the agent in the child's mind, called \\"builder\\" and all of \\"builder's\\" agents beneath it created the tower out of blocks.I recommend this book for anyone curious about what goes on in the mind to cause people's actions as well as anyone interested in artificial intelligence."},{"Title":"The Society of Mind","review":"This book does more to explain the fundamental structure of the human mind than all the volumes of developmental psychology that I've read. In a step-by-step process, Minsky constructs a believable thesis for a way in which the human mind in all its complexity can be built up, layer by layer, from the interactions of &quot;agents&quot;, functional subroutines. Some agents are hard-wired by evolution and some are learned. The learned ones stay in consciousness only while they are being built and then become the substrate for higher-level constructs. &quot;The Society of Mind&quot; had shaped the way I look at consciousness."},{"Title":"The Society of Mind","review":"I have been reading many books concerened with artificial intelligence and the mind during the past years. Many of them drift off into endless philosophy, or get into too much psychological analysis.Compared to other books out there, this one is easy to read, and is deeply inspiring. Chapters are concise, and comprehendible. I would recommend this book to anybody who is new to AI and overall theories of the mind."},{"Title":"The Society of Mind","review":"The Society of Mind attempts to explain how the mind works. The author considers the mind to be a society of small mental machines that do simple things by themselves but combine to perform amazingly complex tasks like the walking and talking that we take for granted. As this book was written in the 1980's I am sure that it is somewhat out of date. But the questions he asks are timeless. How does memory work? How do we sense space? How do we process conflicting ideas? How do we know when to replace a memory with a more accurate version? This book will make you think about these questions and more. The Society of Mind is worth reading just for the questions it asks."},{"Title":"The Society of Mind","review":"Mr. Minsky's book is a true nugget of golden wisdom. A broken-down, step-by-step guide to the elements of thought and action. Tired of self-important terminology and baroque explanation in the realm of psychology? Pick up this brilliant mind's prosaic, simply worded and lucidly illustrated work on the subject of how our minds work. He is the Bob Villa of consciousness."},{"Title":"The Society of Mind","review":"Minsky has assembled 270 of his essays into this handy compendium. Each is somewhat of an epigram; only one page long, including an occasional diagram. The topics all revolve around the mind and intelligence. You can treat this book casually, by randomly reading an occasional page. Or you can plough through its entirety.Written over several decades, the essays give an incisive view into many aspects of intelligence. Hence, Minksy explains why some university level topics like calculus were relatively easy to program. But why \\"elementary\\" tasks like having a program do the equivalent of a 3 year old kid recognise and arrange building blocks have proved to be enormously harder."},{"Title":"The Society of Mind","review":"I work in virtual human technology and Minsky has long been an inspiration. I can't just sit down and read this stuff through, I have to think about it in chunks. Society of Mind suggests some operational views of the mind that can be helpful in designing thinking machines. I don't always agree with him and sometimes he's not the easiest guy to read, but overall this book is a must read for any one interested in how the mind may work and how to emulate it with Natural Language/artificial Intelligence engines."},{"Title":"The Society of Mind","review":"Who said simple is beautiful? Beautiful as it may seem, the simple is often deceptive. Like the famous Maxwell's equations in differntial form. They look beautifully simple. But to apply it requires another not very simple form. Minsky tells us that what seem simple enough to us (so simple that we are hardly aware of) are actually very hard to implement in machines. So the biggest question in artificial intelligence is to simulate simple human tasks. Minsky is not like some lousy popular textbook writers. He seeks to find an answer, and all along, he does not attempt to make a logical 'jump'. The book is full of ideas. Though not with any big promises or big future plan, it gives you practical insights (such as why 'agents' should be simple enough, when the 'agencies' are not. Highly recommended to those who want to see the practical side of artificial intelligence. Like the integral form of Maxwell's equations."},{"Title":"The Society of Mind","review":"The fundamental assumption underlying the principles in the book is that the mind is a result of many small and independent pieces that act in a predictable way and CANNOT think for themselves - but that the result (the mind) CAN think. Of course, the title 'The Society of the Mind' is not a good fit to the ideas in the book because Society and its parts (individual minds) can BOTH think.But leaving these kind of simple inconsistencies and incongruencies (I discovered at least a couple after some deep thinking) to the side, this book makes for an absolutely fascinating read if you are interested in the subject of how the mind works. The approach is very unique, and the ideas are thought provoking. There are 270 components in the book grouped into 30 chapters and each component takes up 1-2 pages to explain the idea and some basic logic supporting the idea presented in that component. The book has 339 pages in case you are wondering (including the index).The format of the book makes it very convenient to pick up the book once in a while and read 5-6 ideas in a 15 minute sitting. Of course, to get the most benefit from the book, you have to read one chapter at a time as each chapter contains ideas that are interconnected. The best approach would be to finish reading the book in 2 or 3 sittings so you can connect all the ideas. The author does warn you at the beginning that there are a lot of cross-connections between the different ideas that you may miss. You have to take this advice into consideration and pay extra attention to connecting the ideas in order to get the real theory that the author is trying to communicate. He never actually explains the theory in a nutshell. He leaves it to the reader to come to some conclusions that hopefully will match the author's theory.Marvin Minsky cofounded the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at MIT and this book gets accolades from some very well known and popular figures like Douglas Hofstadter, Michael Crichton, and Gene Roddenberry.The book has numerous thought experiments that are fun to do! There are also references made to the works of some very eminent scientists and thinkers. The best part about the book is the simplicity of Dr. Minsky's theory on how the Mind works. The second best part about the book is the really elegant way he explains his theory.The first downside to the book - the actual theory is never explained explicitly but contained implicitly in the different ideas presented throughout the book. The second downside to the book - there isn't clear logic backing some of the ideas and you have to take the author's word for it.My opinion in a nutshell - this is a book definitely worth buying for your personal book collection. I have thoroughly enjoyed this book for several years now and even though I personally disagree with some of the ideas in the book (you may quickly find yourself feeling the same way), I believe that it is a beautiful work.

Working together these agents creates our mind.Some might find this approach somewhat reductionist. However, in broad terms it lines up with my understanding of the mind. So this is ok for me. However, I think that there are many mysteries of the mind that we need to address.I.e. How can two agents, say sound and sight, bind together and give you an experience which includes both? And how do you really get from something as basic as cells to a conscious experience. All of this is hardly crystal clear .... And the books doesn't bring you any further inunderstanding these questions.Yet, it is, as other readers have stated, a highly original and thought provoking introduction to the major questions involving mental states, concept formation in the brain, learning theory, and artificial intelligence.-Simon"},{"Title":"The Society of Mind","review":"One of the all time best books I've ever read.

Minsky assumes that a \\"mind\\" is not a single, efficient decision-making machine, but a collection of many such machines, which he calls agents. Each agent, on its own, is simple and specialized, but through a process of cooperation and competition with one another, the agents form a collective understanding of the world. This gives rise to an emergent intelligence guided by preprogrammed assumptions, but not constrained by them.Minsky writes with a disarming simplicity, using the whimsical but versatile example of a child playing with building blocks to illustrate his points. How does a child's brain manage the many parallel, interrelated tasks inherent in such play, from fine motor control, to hand-eye coordination, to physical intuition, to forming structural knowledge from experience, to remaining motivated amid competing desires, to deciding when to knock the block towers down? Each chapter is a self-contained one or two page essay, exploring a different facet of how a network of separate, co-evolved agents might implement decision-making, pattern-recognition, task delegation, memory, learning, and problem-solving.This is not a practical book to help you write AI software, to teach you about A*, Bayesian networks, or other relatively concrete techniques. It's a book to get you to think about what intelligence really is. But I think that any software developer with a genuine interest in the possibility of machine learning and machine thought will find both illuminating and stimulating. While Minsky's zenlike thoughts are focused more on abstract ideas than technical details, they offer valuable starting points for breaking the densely tangled problem of \\"intelligence\\" down into more manageable layers and processes.The essays that comprise each chapter build on each other in a somewhat linear order, but their shortness invites non-linear contemplation, which seems an appropriate way to explore the nature of thought. I think that some of Minsky's more advanced concepts amount to speculative castles in the air -- ideas that seem only loosely derived from neuroscience and might not pan out in real AI frameworks. Still, this 1988 book deals with questions so far ahead of the 2011 state of the art, that its value is less in the end product of its thought experiments, and more in the experiments themselves. This isn't a work about artificial intelligence, but about how to think about artificial intelligence, and it's a defining classic. As a software developer, I look forward to proceeding into the world he envisioned."},{"Title":"The Society of Mind","review":"This book is written so you can pick it up and set it down pick it up and set it down.

You could say it proved it to me."},{"Title":"The Society of Mind","review":"I took Marvin Minksy's Society of Mind class at MIT. Minksy's book is a must-read for anyone who is interested in seeing the building blocks of how our minds do anything. These one-page essays are simple to read, but are really complex to think about, and it's even more complex to think about how Minksy could so clearly describe and put abstract concepts an organized framework. He's nothing short of genius, see for yourself. His later book, The Emotion Machine, is also great. Neither have anecdotes or chatty overtures (like The Female Brain, for example), but explain mind architecture concepts like goals, analogies, imprimers, actors, inhibitors and self consciousness. In short, it illuminates the mechanics of stuff we can't seem to control. At the very least, it will help you be at peace with a screaming parent. :) Read me."},{"Title":"The Society of Mind","review":"How does your brain work? This book tries to answer that almost unanswerable question. This book assumes that any brain, machine, or other thing that has a mind must be composed of smaller things that cannot think at all.

All the pieces put together form the mind which can think, of course."},{"Title":"The Society of Mind","review":"I have to give this book five stars because it takes on a great subject and makes some great points. But it could be better. Einstein said, &quot;things should be as simple as possible but not simpler.&quot; I think this book is overly complex, not because its inherently hard to understand, but because I think the mind is complex based on simple rules. In other words, while the human mind is wildly complex, the functions that lie beneath are dumbfoundingly simple. Minsky gives us a great deal of food for thought which is interesting and valuable, but I found myself wanting more simplicity, better organization from one of the great thinkers from MIT. When you listen to the greats (Feynman, Einstein) they made things so simple yet the things they describe are so universally relevant. I wanted Minsky to do the same."},{"Title":"The Society of Mind","review":"Minsky's book isn't terribly profound or monumental. Most of his claims are purely his own philosophies, without much scientific backing. However, the book is interesting in a couple ways. It's very rare to see a scientist come out and say, &quot;This is how brains work&quot;, but Minsky's book attempts to do just that. It's also interesting how amazingly structured the text is - each chapter occupies exactly one page. The book isn't going to change your way of thinking, but it's a good introduction to some of the questions and issues of cognitive science."},{"Title":"The Society of Mind","review":"Marvin Minsky, pioneer in AI presents digestible pieces on how the mind works, how it develops.

Each essay brings up a different idea of how the human brain completes tasks, however small they are. Each thing we do (breathe, walk, talk) is carried out by small actors in our brain, and those actors are controlled by even smaller processes and yadda yadda. It's hard to explain what this book talks about, you have to really study it. I've only read it once through, and I probably need to read it again to fully understand the big concepts.But what I like about it is it's easy to walk away from for a while and pick it back up again. The essays are each only a few pages, so you can just read one a week, dwell on it, then read the next essay. It's a strange book, I wish I knew of more like it."},{"Title":"The Society of Mind","review":"The book kind of reads like a series of short essays. Each is like a little important part that adds up to the whole. Most of it revolves around the idea of the mind consisting of agents that execute functions, much like a computer processor executing functions which obviously the author is inspired from.

The other person was Carl Sagan.Minsky, a pioneer of Artificial Intelligence, is a fascinating writer. This is a book that combines philosophy, educational and language theories, poetry and science into an elegant package.\\"The Society of the Mind\\" is unlike any other book I have read about thinking, learning, or the brain, and I like it. No appearance is made in this book by the amygdala, frontal lobe, cerebral cortex or thalamus. Minsky's view is that thinking is made of many smaller processes which he calls \\"agents.\\"Each mental agent by itself can only do some simple things that needs no mind or thought at all. Yet when we join these agents in societies--in certain very special ways--this leads to true intelligence.The format of this book beautifully complements Minsky's style of writing, with each chapter functioning as a building block leading towards greater understanding.In many ways the size, shape, layout and design of \\"Society of the Mind\\" remind me of the history books by Edwin Tunis that gave me endless hours of pleasure as a child.Like Tunis's books, Minsky's one or two page long chapters, black and white illustrations and use of fascinating quotations to introduce each new concept, gently lead the reader forward to greater comprehension of a highly complex subject.Although this is a book for a sophisticated audience, it is one that could easily be given as a gift to an inquisitive child or young adult who will ponder over it and learn to think big thoughts.Kim BurdickStanton, Delaware"},{"Title":"The Society of Mind","review":"This book is wonderfully readable!

Check it out!"},{"Title":"The Society of Mind","review":"I was interested in AI for many years, and read hundreds of papers or books on the subject. After I found this book, I thought I wasted much time.The book is about methodology of finding things out, and building things up.Many researchers wrote books about AI or other sciences, and describe the philosophy in a different context. However, they are just the same thing presented in new fashions. And unfortunately, seldom give him the credit. An extreme example is the now best selling ANKOS by Wolfram, which is just an application of Minsky's theory with some variations, on some different problems!!Scientific theories in the deepest sense are all based on the same philosophy -- building up complicated things from simple things. And the mathematician Minsky was the first to put all that simple-complicated theory all together in a concise small book, in a philosophic way, and for science people.The philosophy can be applied to many fields, not only AI. It's also a philosophy of problem solving and modeling. Or, even how to study philosophy!The book is quoted more often in philosophy papers than AI.I recommend this book for all people who love knowledge."},{"Title":"The Society of Mind","review":"In the Society of Mind, Marvin Minsky advocates that the human mind is composed of a number of various networked agencies (or societies). He discusses a number of different areas (psychology, linguistics, reasoning, child development, computer science, humor, etc.) in the context of this mind-agency theme.Minsky also assigns names to a number of other entities in our brains that he discusses. He calls these b-brains, k-lines, polynemes, pronomes, isonomes, trans-frames, uniframes, etc. They are all unified via this agency-thread. In any case, much of the work in the book is not originally Minsky's. However, the book serves as a collage of essays (all written by Minsky) which express Minsky's unique perspective on the mind and the work of others in these areas, namely Seymour Papert and Jean Piaget.I recommend the Society of Mind to anyone interested in psychology or the human-computer interaction (HCI) and artificial intelligence (AI) sub-disciplines of Computer Science, or in looking at life in an esoteric way. In addition, a potential reader needs to be able to tolerate a book which is long and talks about a number of different areas, but by the end has really not made any concrete conclusions. In this book, Minsky states (describes) some obvious things (phenomenon) in complicated / drawn out manners. However, he does provide interesting perspectives on certain things. Minsky challenges us to think about common things in unique ways.Marvin Minsky was the 1969 ACM A.M. Turing Award winner."},{"Title":"The Society of Mind","review":"This book is different from other books on many different levels.For instance, its organization parallels its subject. The main theme of the book is that the mind consists of a network of non-intelligent agents organized into more and more highly complex agencies. - That the function of these agencies taken together is to perform the mind (mind is thought of as a process and not a thing - the same way that in chemistry fire was eventually recognized as being a process of oxydizing and not an element). In the same way, each page of the book has a single concrete point to make or an idea to present. These ideas reference each other in a networked fashion. As a result, the meaning of the book emerges as you consider the networks of these ideas. This is a very aesthetically pleasing concept for organizing a book as it is informative.The book introduces a lot of different ideas to its readers - such as the currencies that the mental agencies use to measure the importance of various tasks or views. It talks about the educational value of humor - in a way I never considered. It talks about organization of memories.One thing that I thought was oversimplified was Marvin Minsky's description of how genes affect the development of the brain. He seems to treat the subject as though the environment has nothing to do with it. For example, we know that mother's consumption of alcohol can drastically affect the development of the fetal brain. What mother eats during pregnancy and even before can also affect the development of the brain. For example, consumption of Omega-3 fats seems to have a very strong effect on the brain development. The brain change is also directed by the experiences that the person has. Vision will not develop in an infant that has not been exposed to light in its first weeks of life. I think that this is a rather weak point of the book."},{"Title":"The Society of Mind","review":"This is a very unusual book. 270 chapters of one page grouped under 30 headings. Minsky tries to figure out how the mind works, by splitting what it does in one page very interesting bits. The discipline of one subject per page is unusual but effective. The brain is recognised as enormously complicated, but not so complicated that nothing can be understood about it. In fact it can only be understood by understanding its many different bits. Minsky built the first \\"randomly wired neural network learning machine\\" the SMRAC Such a type of machine has some kind of intelligence and some learning capabilities. Marvin Minsky is one of the pioneers of \\"artificial intelligence\\". He found that to make these machines work intelligently it was useful to figure out how the brain solved the challenges of for example seeing in a useful way. To understand those brain processes Minsky delved into the workings of evolution.He found that you can learn a lot by figuring out how evolution in different steps increased brain capabilities. For example: why are we much more capable to remember faces of people rather than their names? Simply because vision is much older than language. Or why do people have strong egocentric tendencies? That is the result of a child having to learn how to survive. Why blind desire for prestige, money and sex? Our shared ancestry with chimpanzees etcTo me surprisingly the book contains many useful rules that can make you more effective. For example if you want to convince somebody it is better to use parallel than serial arguments. A serial argument is more vulnerable because if one link in the chain is weak you lose. Another example. \\"Virtually any problem will be easier to solve the more one learns about the context world in which that problem occurs\\". Finally \\"Whatever happens, where or when, we're prone to wonder who or what's responsible?\\" That is why people are uncomfortable inside and outside organisations if they cannot find out who is responsible.An unusual and very stimulating book."},{"Title":"The Society of Mind","review":"like Darwin's epiphany- Minsky's genius has revealed an idea that once understood- it is almost unquestionable- and makes you shout &quot;Of course! how could I have not seen it!&quot;"},{"Title":"The Society of Mind","review":"Ahh the concept of AI.

But in the end, I skimmed the last third of the book in order to be able to finish it at all.So how can this be? Sure, the book has its good moments, and a few of the aphorism-like chapters do contain worthwile insights. But most of it is either obvious or plain uninteresting.The obviousness could come from the book's age. It's almost twenty years old now, and what groundbreaking ideas there might have been it in have now trickled down the cultural heap to anyone with a passing subject knowledge of AI, or even an intelligent reader of modern SF.As for the uninterestingness, many chapters deal with the implementation details (not in the sense of programming language constructs, but algorithms) of Minsky's various modules/agents. The reason these are less than interesting is that even if you buy the overarching idea of the modular mind, you can't help feeling that Minsky's thinking is terrible GOFAI. Everything is framed in an old-school logic-based classical computer metaphor; you can almost see the outlines of lisp declarations thinly veiled in prose. I, and so many others in the field today, prefer to think in a lot more biologically inspired terms. Therefore, while the ideas about what types of modules there might be and how they interact are interesting, the internal details of Minsky-modules are not.This is not to say The society of mind is a bad book. Minsky's writing is fluent and it might be of interest to novices in the field.

When first published in 1985, Minsky's work stood out from other books of the time for his blending of bold thought and his systematic approach to understanding the way minds work. Minsky provided a cogent analysis of how he believed human minds operate and expressed his theories of how that thought could be adapted to the creation of intelligent machines based on his principles of artificial intelligence. Minsky's book was written in many respects as a philosophical text that uses his ideas to engage and challenge the reader to consider the scope of his thought as a fundamental shift in how intelligence is conceived. In this regard, it can be argued that Minsky wrote Society of Minds as a communication between our humanistic and scientific selves; as a communication, it can be said, between the two cultures represented by objective and subjective thought.

The most critical is the stories of each chapter are supposed to be from a variety of people; however, the language and imagery provide a single tone for all people. Oops!The second is that the author is enthralled by adjectives, similes and metaphors. There are far too many sentences using an excess of them. Each sentence is reasonable alone but piled one upon another they become tiring.The third is that in the first section of each chapter, the section describing Laura, within a single sentence there are contraditory images which do not appear to be literary devices to emphasize her otherness nor to reflect competing images in the story.There are excellent images and a few short poem-stories that are excellent.

In describing one of his subjects, the painter Paolo Uccello, Schwob wrote, he &quot;was not concerned with the reality of things but their multiplicity and the infinity of their lines.&quot; So, too Swchob, who chose for us,Empedocles, Supposed GodErostat, IncendiaryCrates, CynicSeptima, EnchantressLucretius, PoetClodia, Impure WomanPetronius, RomancerSufrah, GeomancerFra Dolcino, HereticCecco Angiolieri, Poet of HatePaolo Uccello, PainterNicholas Loyseleur, JudgeKatherine the Lacemaker, Girl of the StreetsAlain the Gentle, SoldierGabriel Spencer, ActorPocahontas, PrincessCyril Tourneur, Tragic PoetWilliam Phips, Treasure HunterCaptain Kidd, PirateWalter Kennedy, Unlettered PirateMajor Stede-Bonnet, Pirate by FancyBurke and Hare, AssassinsAmong them you're sure to find a kindred spirit--or hopefully not."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Vine Bible Study Leader's Edition","review":"Secrets of the Vine by Wilkinson is perfect for someone who has embraced the Christian lifestyle and is on the journey toward seeking God's will in their lives. It is a self study on figuring out how to find out God's plan for us. He shows us the significance of Jesus last parable on the night before He died - knowing He is about to die, He gives us a way to live. the topic is crucial for finding a peaceful way to reap the fruit God has in mind for us. Wilkinson wrote a book, devotional and study. I read the devotional first and loved it. So I put together a study. The Bible Study works best in a group. I am not beyond week 1 yet, but so far it has taught us a lot by looking up relevant passages and reading them aloud to eachother.

What he did do, in his own time, was (a) write and teach the writing of &quot;haikai no renga&quot;, the popular style of linked, collaborative poetry of his time, (b) collect the largest number of followers (or &quot;disciples&quot;) of any poet of his day, (c) write a number of short prose pieces with short verses he called hokku (haibun), (d) write a number of independent hokku (which we now call &quot;haiku&quot;), and (e) write several travel diaries, the last of which, &quot;Narrow Road of the Interior&quot; goes by a number of titles in English and is one of the great masterpieces of world literature.You can find out about all this from other books. However, in Professor Shirane's book, you will find out more: Basho was not the only person doing these things during his lifetime. And although nobody is likely to say that Basho was not the most important poet of his day, he was definitely influenced in all his work by the trends of the time. When funny verses were the vogue, early in his career, he wrote funny verses. When Chinese poetry became a major influence on the poetry scene, his writings reflected his own rich knowledge of that Chinese heritage. When other poets started advocating a &quot;lighter&quot; style, more directly concerned with the things of daily life, Basho took up &quot;lightness&quot; as an important element of his art.Basho's uniqueness does not lie in his unique type of poetry, but in his great ability to ride the wave of fashion in a common type of poetry and make something rich and lasting from it. By placing Basho and his work--with many fine translations--in the context of his own day and his own culture, Prof. Shirane gives us a deeper, richer Basho than we knew before. And, he helps us grasp some basics of Japanese culture, and of haiku, that we probably missed in other books on the subject."},{"Title":"Traces of Dreams: Landscape, Cultural Memory, and the Poetry of Basho","review":"William Higginson's review of this important book is spot-on. However, he missed a few features of the book I regard as significant.One rather major omission is Shirane's wonderful, in-depth translation/analysis of a Basho-group kasen, \\"Withering Gusts\\", which is really the centerpiece of the book since it brings together all the critical themes of the book. In fact, the subtext of the book seems to lionize Basho as a renku (linked-verse) master par excellence, emphasizing his catalytic role in the development of renku (or haikai no renga as Basho would have called it).\\"Withering Gusts\\" is an early example of a kasen (36-link renga or \\"renku\\") by Basho et al. It is outstanding in that the participants were all young, full of vigor, and overbrimming with newness and skill. Of course, Basho was the \\"master\\" of this renku session, but his presence seems to have stimulated the other renkujin to great poetic heights.One plus is the reproduction of a few of Basho's own haiga, sumi-e drawings he made with his hokku poems and calligraphy included.Haruo Shirane is a thoughtful critic who brings much to bear on his subject. He skillfully shows how Basho brought newness and vitality into renga by introducing haikai subjects that would have been prohibited in the more formal and sober rule-bound renga of earlier masters such as Sogi (d. 1502). Shirane shows how Basho not simply introduced demotic subjects but raised them to the level of great poetry.This book, as the flap claims, is truly for both the general reader and the specialist. As a \\"general reader\\" myself, I must confess some of the analysis went over my head, but there is enough that I can understand that kept my interest throughout. Even so, after a while, I could really grasp some of the deeper analytical concepts he discusses, because his writing is so lucid and not overburdened with specialist terms.The modern-day renku enthusiast will undoubtedly find much of value in this study. It is superbly well-written, with relatively few typos (I caught a couple, H. G. Henderson's 1934 book on haiku titled \\"Bamboo Broom\\" was mistakenly referenced as \\"Bamboo Room\\"). But these trivial peccadilloes do not detract from the achievement of this book, a major contribution to Western understanding of the haikai poetry of Basho and his time."},{"Title":"Dark Summer (Poetry Ser.)","review":"Dark Summer is a wonderful book of poems; on the surface, the poems shimmer with elegance and luminous language that's almost seamless in its beauty. Beneath the surface lurks a more complicated tone, often tongue in cheek, almost savage. There is much more to Bendall's poems than initially meets the eye, like much good poetry, they reveal themselves slowly, and will reward the patient, careful reader."},{"Title":"Dark Summer (Poetry Ser.)","review":"Molly Bendall's Dark Summer is a collection of poetry that explores the many facets of relationships. She delves into the every type of relationship one may experience, from casual sex, to serious affairs, to relationships that end with murder. Bendall investigates the erotic and yet withdrawn feeling many women experience when involved with a lover. Because her poems cover such a wide range of emotions and difficulties, she is able to capture the wonder and admiration of a large and diverse audience. Although Bendall's poems appeal to a wide variety and successfully capture the complicated emotions experienced throughout many different relationships, her syntax can be confusing at times. As many of her contemporaries do, she uses abnormal punctuation that may leave the reader somewhat baffled upon the first reading. Sometimes her phrases and arrangement of words are difficult to comprehend and can detract from the poem's quality. For the most part, Molly Bendall has created a work of art and achieved a difficult task. By exploring the most intimate corners of love and relationships, she is able to effectively convey the diverse and complicated feelings one often experiences but cannot describe. This book is a great one to own if you enjoy contemporary poetry."},{"Title":"Dark Summer (Poetry Ser.)","review":"Molly Bendall is brave and daring in her exploration of the sexual world from a female's point of view. She uses vivid, descriptive language that draws the reader in to her poetry. Her poetry reads like a story of a woman who has been through tough times and difficult relationships that many people in this world can relate to. Because her poetry is about the reality of women experiencing love and sex, it appeals to both men and women. Men can refer to the poetry to get a clue about the way that women's emotions operate, and women can use it to help define the feelings they experience. On the negative side, Molly Bendall, as many contemporary poets do, tends to overuse the free-style type of writing that is so popular with writers these days. The way she arranges her words and the lack of punctuation at times confuses the writer on the intentions of her writing. She uses strong words that could be offensive to some; however, they convey the strong feelings that the narrator or the author are experiencing. Overall, Molly Bendall has written a good book of poetry. There are many keys in this book for people to use to open the doors of their minds and hearts and explore their true emotions."},{"Title":"Dark Summer (Poetry Ser.)","review":"Molly Bendall chose the title of her book to be &quot;Dark Summer&quot; because the focus of the book is darkness. The poetry that Bendall writes is full of vivid imagery that allows the reader to visualize the scenes unfolding. However, the readers will probably wish they had never pictured these circumstances. The scenes that are taking place are centered on the immoral and pessimistic sides of life. Bendall spends the majority of her poems talking about love affairs gone a wry. Sex is a casual occurrence in the relationships of this book. Marriage is never considered sacred, and there are no examples of abstinence until marriage taking place. That explains why the outcomes of the poems are usually sad and devoid of encouragement. This book takes you on a trip through the eyes of women who have engaged only in life's sensual pleasures. The ride itself is nicely simulated; however, when it comes to the end of the track it becomes obvious that these immoral lifestyles are nothing to envy. Bendall depicts women who strive after fleshly treasures and the outcome is their twisted and corrupted lives. Bendall puts together a luscious poetic language that entices the reader, but the meaning behind her language leaves little for the reader to learn or grow from. The reader is better off leaving this poetry book in the dark."},{"Title":"Dark Summer (Poetry Ser.)","review":"I purchased this &quot;book&quot; because an acquaintance assured me that it contained poetry, that most noble genre of literary expression. My acquaintance lied--and I have since caned him for taking advantage of my misplaced trust. This work (for Miss Bendall certainly labored in the creation of this unsightly child) is little more than a concatenation of disharmonious sounds and half-baked thoughts. Make no mistake, the work is not without passion--Miss Bendall is, if nothing else, an enthusiastic writer. Sadly, however, these writings (which she calls &quot;poems&quot; but which most literati would label &quot;curiosities&quot;) fail to incite any emotional reactions among her readers other than bewilderment, frustration, and (for those who peer too deeply into the void) utter despair. Determined to purge my soul (and my bookshelf) of these vacuous scribblings, I listed the item on Ebay under the category &quot;Books.&quot; In doing so, I sincerely hope that I have not committed a disingenuous act. I would bring to my reader's attention the most common definition of the word &quot;book&quot;, which is nothing more than &quot;a set of pages fastened along one side and encased between protective covers.&quot; Certainly, &quot;Dark Summer&quot; meets these criteria. But what if a bonafide bibliophile--one who ascribes to the definition of a book as &quot;a source of knowledge or understanding&quot;--should win my auction? Knowing full well that this collection of literary oddities lacks even a single penetrating thought, could I exchange this homely volume for filthy lucre and retain my clear conscience? Perhaps my worries are for naught. With only two days remaining on the auction, not one of my three bidders has yet to meet my reserve of seventy-five cents."},{"Title":"Dark Summer (Poetry Ser.)","review":"Book Review on Molly Bendall's Dark SummerThe poems in Molly Bendall's book Dark Summer deal primarily with the sexual experience. She seems to be infatuated with the topic referring to it in one way or another in just about every poem. Her constant references to sex leads the reader to suspect that she is speaking largely from personal experiences and frustrations with it Despite this overbearing emphasis on the sexual nature of humanity other value can be taken from the book. The poems describe relationships. In so doing, the reader can gain insight into the characters of the poems, and hence themselves. By looking past the sexual emphasis much can be learned from relationships in general. Bendall's poems often illustrate the dichotomy of existing and broken relationships. She describes the benefits that everyone desires yet their sad, oppressive, and fragile side as well. Overall, the book is an interesting read. Unlike many modern contemporary poems, most of Bendall's poems have a story line that the reader can decipher. The typical reader can relate in one way or another to many of her poems in the themes that they express."},{"Title":"Dark Summer (Poetry Ser.)","review":"Molly Bendall does an excellent job in this book of poetry of enticing the reader and drawing them into her stories. Very understandable and easy to picture, the poems provide an entertaining read for any person. The words and lines flow smoothly, creating enjoyable tales. Open to interpretation, the poems in Dark Summer allow imagination and new ideas to be explored and considered. An excellent book of poetry, although at times sexually explicit, this is a book to be considered for any lover of poetry."},{"Title":"Dark Summer (Poetry Ser.)","review":"What do most young men and women expect from the summer? They want beaches, no school, cold beer, and hot nights. Also, they expect a steamy summer love. You know, one of those relationships where two curious youths spend their days rolling in the sand, and the night rolling in each other's arms. The typical summer love is purely a physical experiment into newly discovered body parts and emotions. Once the summer draws to a close, the two young lovers move away from each other, only after one more sunset tryst by the water. They spend the next couple months dreaming of each other and the time they spent in the summer, but with little emotional attachment to each other. As many victims of summer romances realize, these relationships are not so easy to break away from. Young hearts are fragile and can shatter when they are forced to separate from their first love simply because the leaves change. In her book Dark Summer, Molly Bendall examines these relationships with a series of poems. Through her poetry, she describes how the heat and passion of summer can create serious emotional ties within young lovers. These are ties that are not as easy to let go of as some may expect. For anyone interested in exploring this side of love, I highly suggest Molly Bendall's Dark Summer."},{"Title":"Better Electric Lamps of the 20's and 30's With Prices - Including color catalogs of Moe Bridges, Pittsburgh, Lightolier and others.","review":"This handsome book from L-W (173 pp, 2 pounds, on glossy stock, pictorial hardback boards issued without dustjacket) showcases lamps from the 1920's and 1930's with lovely illustrations, many of them full-page and about 70% of them in color.Taken from the catalogues and ads of lamp companies, one finds floor lamp, table lamps, desk lamps, a few torchieres and a couple of pages of shades. The variety of shades here is delightful.These are extraordinarily pleasing objects, both \\"beautiful and useful\\" (according to a Handel ad) which embody some of the best of maintstream pre-war 20th century design. They are objects on the edge between commerce and art -- mass-produced, yes, but exhibiting the individuality of each company and often hand-decorated, using fine or somewhat fine materials.One can still feel the excitement that electric light afforded consumers and designers. (Gas lamps and lit lamps couldn't be designed like many of these...they'd cause fires!)This book is also worthy because it does NOT showcase the leading edge of 20th century design. These objects aren't trying to break new ground. There's only a hint of Deco, no Machine Age, and no Moderne here. These are stunning but homey objects that sometimes have a bit of Art Nouveau in their design but more often feel like American reinventions of Victoriania. They aren't the best lamps, they're \\"better\\" lamps -- worthy of a prominent place in a middle class or upper middle class home in, say, Ohio.If you're looking for a price guide, look stuff up on the internet. Two sorts of prices appear here -- a printout of prices as of 1997 and (more interesting) the original retail prices in the catalogues that had prices.The following makers are featured: The Art Lamp Manufacturing Company (1920), The Edward N. Riddle Co. (1923), The Handel Co. (1919), Lightolier Co. (1923-1924), Mac Beth Evans Co. (1919), Moe Bridges Co. (1926), Pittsburgh Lamp, Brass, & Glass Co.

I do not consider a loose piece of paper, inside the cover of this book, with 1997 prices on it,to be called part of this book. The printed prices in the book are in deed from the 20's and 30's. Maybe I read more into the cover of this book then I should have. And why does L-W Book Sales stamp their hard cover books with the price in big bold numbers on the back of there books? I sell music books, and the price is on the books discreetly. If a person was sitting 20 feet from a person looking at this book, they would know how much I paid for it, in which case, this book, I would be embarrassed to let anyone know what I paid for it."},{"Title":"*Signed* When Egypt Ruled the East","review":"Heavily revised, this book covers every possible aspect of Ancient Egypt culture, from the invasion of the Hyksos to hieroglyphs, from Egyptian art to its religion. The authors discuss the reigns of several pharaohs, including Thutmose III, Amenhotep IV and Tutankhamun. Containing many black and white illustrations, this is an interesting and informative book for beginners in Egyptology."},{"Title":"*Signed* When Egypt Ruled the East","review":"This book was recommended to me by a famous historian and scholar, whom I admire, Dr. John Henrik Clarke. The overall information contained is fairly detailed, however it does not go to the fullest extent of the Egyptian Empire and culture, however much of that could be attributed to the dating of the writing. Much has been discovered since the original work and revision, also it would require multiple volumes of books. The authors go to lengths to provide historical detailed data in order for the reader to extrapolate a formative opinion and understanding. I caution, though there is coded language and blatant racists remarks included in various statements, which one will have to be thick-skinned in not preventing one from finishing the reading. Several passages refer to the so-called Black Africans (which a true original African cannot be anything but Black) as Negroes and at one pointed referred to them as crude and uncivilized, outside of Egypt, and insinuates that Egypt is not a country in Africa. He attempts to debunk Herodotus and other Greek accounts which they state and conclude otherwise. The author writes \\"...visiting Greek writers jumped to the conclusion that the entire civilization of Egypt had originated in Ethiopia, the land of the Black Race, and had been exported thence down the Nile to Egypt proper...\\"pg. 101. In another instance he writes \\"In the place of a native Egyptian pharaoh or of the usurping Libyans, the throne of Egypt was occupied by a Negro king from Ethiopia!, pg 271.\\" A different topic altogether, however I urge a student, to do unbiased research of prehistoric Ethiopia and the Kushite Empire, including Nubia, all which are older and have blood ties.Of course the actual eyewitnesses are more informed and reliable than historians who were never there to account. This sort of attitude was/is present in the world of science and archaeology, especially when this book was originally written and revised. With this illness, the author goes to great lengths to avoid the cultural and racial connections between Nubia and Ethiopia, both which are older civilizations and the mother of Egypt, from which prehistoric Egyptians migrated from, thus there is no such thing as a Hamite as the author refers to, nor was there a Semite on the scene in the early development of Egypt. Semite is a culture and related language from West Asia, i.e. Arabic, Hebrew, Aramaic, Akkadian, which did not arrive in Egypt until much, much later. Those are vain and vulgar attempts to separate Egypt from Africa which is not only historically but geologically impossible. Also the authors attempt to connect biblical allegorical stories to actual world history in Egypt, which again is fruitless conjecture, since they are just stories that exist only in biblical literature, outside of true world history. Overall the book is mediocre and fair general information and is worth reading."},{"Title":"*Signed* When Egypt Ruled the East","review":"Great book, shipped fast. The author does a great job of explining African history, any reader would be impressed and appreciate the information."},{"Title":"Fishes of Arkansas","review":"Even as the Clinton presidency draws to a close, Arkansas remains the undiscovered state. Fishes of Arkansas is a visual treat--a species by species documentation of the incredible diversity of freshwater fish found in that state's streams and waterways. Arkansas is an inland state, so one might imagine that a fish survey would document only a narrow array of green and brown game fish, of little interest to those outside the bait and hook hobbies. Fishes of Arkansas demonstrates instead the incredible biodiversity found in the numerous fish species located in Arkansas. Here are pictures of gorgeous fish, large and small, including many of intense beauty and tremendous color. The darter section of the book, featuring many species endemic not only to Arkansas but in many cases to a single river in Arkansas, shows the reader spectacular, unforgettable fish. The narrative is simple and straightforward--each entry is a separate species, usually with a picture. The grouping is organized by family, and the authors provide judicious use of light explanatory and summation material to tie the individual entries together. If you need something on your coffee table or shelves which is light, pleasant picture-filled reading but not fluff, try Fishes of Arkansas."},{"Title":"Fishes of Arkansas","review":"Fishes of ArkansasRobison and Buchanan have done a good job of describing all of the fishes of Arkansas and showing where they can be found.

Years removed from slavery, a teen-aged Moses leaves his caretakers and makes his way to Red Springs, North Carolina.

As Moses' tale ends, one of the men realizes that this just isn't any old tale but his realization comes just a little too late.If you can get past the first couple of chapters, you'll find that this is a decent piece of storytelling. I found the story pretty far-fetched, but it's well-written and finely crafted with nifty twists and turns that I didn't see coming. I must admit, it took about two weeks for me to finish this because while I found the story quite interesting, it was hard to read.

The book haunted me with an otherworldly memory and needed to be revisited. I found McCachin's skill as an author and storyteller compelling and very deep. Some passages verged on sheer poetry. The plot unravels in such a way that, just as the reader senses predictability, new surprises arrive.Good characterization also deserves note. Each person is iconic and simply but well developed. Mildred is the old fearful aristocracy and Archy is the change agent that victimized the South. Ben came forth as the old guard slave, Ms. Pratt the voice of hope, Moses, the new generation of liberated slave, and of course there was the ever present representation of ignorance and hate.

Mr. McEachin has a rare voice, one that is informed by his experiences as a boy growing up in segregated North Carolina, polished by his time as an actor and playwright. He gives full rein to it in this amazing first novel. Highly recommended.Make no mistake, this is a challenging book. But that is a truism about all truly great books, the ones that stay with you. As for the reviewers who did not like the book, well, I am sorry that it was not for you.One more thing, once you have finished this, you will want to read McEachin's other books.

That being said, it is hard for me to find a book that really keeps me interested, and so far, this book has accomplished it. Kind of odd, being that I'm young guy, who was given this book from a friends mother when I randomly had the urge to read. I'd like to think I'm putting myself in Brian's shoes :-) Never the less, I can't see why anyone wouldn't have fun reading this book. Highly recommend to anyone!"},{"Title":"Brian Kelly: Route 1","review":"I've read the whole series, waiting patiently for the next book!

Coughlin's writing style is a bit pedestrian...as if he hasn't had much experience writing. However, the story is fun to follow. Brian Kelly is a modern day hero, mixing compassion, humor, and an f-you attitude into a engaging character. The first half of the book is better than the second and the love scenes are awkward, at best, but it leaves you dying to read the sequel. If you're looking for great literature, this isn't it.

There is no doubt that the authors know Jesus Christ and have a deep understanding of the word of God. Most of the world is under the impression that the devil doesn't exist. Yet, those who are saved after having been deeply involved in \\"high-level\\" occultism, high ranking members of secret societies, etc. are acutely aware of his existence and modus operandi. Who better to teach spiritual warfare than those who have been deceived by the father of lies and saved, re-educated by the Father of Truth. How can we avoid and shatter the strongholds of the devil, if as individuals we may not even be aware of how we (or perhaps previous relatives) have opened the door to him in the first place. The knowledge in this book can close that door or cut any evil tie that binds by the power of God. Even if you are a Christian but struggling with oppression or addiction of any kind this book has the information that can set you free by the power of Jesus. It is a great resource for any person or family struggling with any kind of demonic influence in their home, their mind, or their life. No matter how bad, it can be brought to a screeching halt."},{"Title":"Blood on the Doorposts: An Advanced Course in Spiritual Warfare","review":"This book definitely held my attention. It is well written and documented. Some have claimed that it seems an exageration for the author to have been involved in so many unholy arenas in his life, but it does not surprise me knowing how the enemy will lead one down one unholy path after the next until one is destroyed or until The True Savior is found."},{"Title":"Blood on the Doorposts: An Advanced Course in Spiritual Warfare","review":"Before I read this book, I was unfamiliar with the concept of spiritual warfare.I had just received Jesus (Yashua) as my personal Lord and savior as well. I was lead to this book with questions as to why so many christians live defeated lifes and maybe this book would help me understand why my life was a complete mess as well. What I discovered inside this book was the key to living a victorious christian life. I was involved in somethings that I didn't know were non christian. I had things in my home, that again, I didn't know where non christian. I didn't know about generational curses that needed to be broken either. Now 11 years later after reading this book, I still use it as a resource to help others. I think it is essential that once a person is born again, they need deliverance in order to live a victorious christian lifestyle. I have ordered several of these books and passed them out as the Lord leads over the years. Its really a must read...it will change your life if you read it and apply it to yours! It changed mine... Thank you Bill for writing this book!!"},{"Title":"Blood on the Doorposts: An Advanced Course in Spiritual Warfare","review":"Rather than outlining the principles of spiritual warfare, this book was more specific to those who have been involved in the occult, witchcraft, or where the victim of SRA.

But, it is good."},{"Title":"Blood on the Doorposts: An Advanced Course in Spiritual Warfare","review":"Exceptionally well-written and understandable book about spiritual warfare. Bill Schnoebelen has a good understanding of the occult due to his background. Very helpful and informative."},{"Title":"Blood on the Doorposts: An Advanced Course in Spiritual Warfare","review":"This book really is something. I mean, I always knew we were engaged in a spiritual battle, however this book showed me the high degree to which Satan and his minions REALLY attack born-again children of God! I have to say I underestimated that ol' serpent, but now I'm all the more wiser to defend against his schemes. From now on I will recommend this book to any saved person I meet.You can really tell how much the author loves the Lord and wants others who are in the predicament he once was in to be freed by the powerful, wonder-working blood of the Lamb. While there's a lot of meat in his instructions on how to fight demons, he continuously presents his advice in a loving and encouraging way. And what more, he reminds us constantly to pray, pray and pray some more, and have faith in our Almighty God. There is victory in Jesus!Be informed and be exhorted by this awesome book!(P.S. Yes the author Bill does take cracks at the Roman Catholic Church. But he's not doing it to be hateful, he's just telling the truth. Anyone who sincerely digs into Scripture will see the many errors of this counterfeit \\"church\\".)"},{"Title":"Blood on the Doorposts: An Advanced Course in Spiritual Warfare","review":"This book, while offering some interesting background stories on the authors, was opinionated and even snotty in some areas towards those who engage in spiritual warfare differently. I found their methods and interpretations in dealing with demons completely weak, leaving the person ministering deliverance convinced the demons are gone when they are not, and leaving the victim still victimized."},{"Title":"Blood on the Doorposts: An Advanced Course in Spiritual Warfare","review":"Love the book as it gives good details of what to do when faced with spiritual dilemmas. Couldn't put book down and finished it in one afternoon."},{"Title":"Blood on the Doorposts: An Advanced Course in Spiritual Warfare","review":"Well, a note about the logic here. According to this guy, if someone else's exorcisms fail, it is because they're an 'idiot in a black robe sloshing salt water on people.' But if HIS fail, it is the victim's fault, because if he fails to cast out a demon (and to his credit he admits that has happened to him), it must be because the victim WANTS to be possessed.While I am very happy he and his wife are no longer involved in satanism, I do question many of his theological points. Especially in his criticisms of Catholicism, it should be remembered that he himself had a very bad experience with Catholicism, met a heretical professor at a Catholic college who got him involved in the occult, and then went on to be (as part of his occult training) ordained in an OLD Catholic church and then ordained as a bishop in a gnostic church (which has succession from the Catholics). The trouble is, if you have seen his book detailing this experience, he doesn't do much to distinguish between these three completely separate organizations.He also speaks as if Baptists and Lutherans can get along. I do not know if he is merely ignorant of the theological divide there or what, but Lutherans are, according to proper Baptist teaching, going straight to hell. This is because Lutherans teach that baptism is a Sacrament with soteriological power, and according to Baptists no one who believes that can 'be saved.' I mention this because one really needs to be careful when reading this guy's works to remember that he isn't necessarily too clear about the real beliefs of various denominations.In addition, his exorcism experiences should not be used to argue for his theology. People from many different Christian denominations have performed exorcisms in the past century, including Roman Catholics and Eastern Orthodox and even Coptic Orthodox (for the Eastern Orthodox there is a wonderful little book on the life of Papa-Dimitri which includes his discussions of not merely exorcising demons but of other encounters with them). Shamans in Africa appear to successfully exorcise demons ([...]). The fact is that one cannot use this as an argument for the doctrines put forward by 'Chick publications.'"},{"Title":"Blood on the Doorposts: An Advanced Course in Spiritual Warfare","review":"As a &quot;retired&quot; Witch/shaman/ceremonial magician, I want to encourage anyone who has had contact with the occult to read this book. If you have a loved one, friend, or neighbor who dabbles in paranormal, supernatural, or occultic practices of any kind - read this book. It is a rare thing for someone to have the courage to come out honestly against &quot;New Age&quot; spirituality and other non-Christian practices. The author shares his experiences with unusual intensity and understanding, from the point of view of someone who has DONE the wrong things and recovered from them. Contrary to what cultic groups tell you, and contradicting what &quot;spirit guides&quot; tell (threaten) you with when you try to leave their &quot;perfect love and trust&quot;, you CAN leave the Path of Lightning and keep your life. You can stop generational spirit persecution, oppression, possession, curses, diseases and mental illnesses brought on by unclean spirits. You CAN help loved ones get their lives back. You CAN choose God and live. You CAN tell the Devil where to go, and back it up. The prospects of leaving the Craft are dismal without Jesus, but certain with him - this book explains why. It is not easy, but it is possible to break free. The sample prayers are thorough and effective. The rationale is sensible, not sappy and emotional. The writing is clear and logical, not scholarly and dry. Bill is not a pious wimp, he's a former Satanist/Witch priest. He has endured attempts on his life because of his ministry and because he is a &quot;traitor&quot; to the Craft. On those grounds alone, this book is worthwhile, whether you agree with him or not. I invite you to check it out and &quot;prove all things&quot;, as the Bible teaches. Blessed be and God's peace."},{"Title":"Blood on the Doorposts: An Advanced Course in Spiritual Warfare","review":"...Well, I read the \\"Blood on the Doorpost\\" book, that book opened my spiritual eyes to realize that Satanism is so real and very existing because of the existant of God!!

Again, Don't be deceived!Lord Jesus Christ is saying: \\"Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.\\" Who is that enemy? Satan and his demons. That means all true Christians can have Jesus' power to take authority over Satan and his demons. Understand that clearly? Good! Amen....

It is of course limited to plants that survive in the SF Bay Area, though not limited to natives."},{"Title":"Advanced algebra and calculus made simple (Made simple series)","review":"When Stephen Hawking was planning his book, \`A Brief History of Time', his publishers warned him that he would lose half his readers (and hence, half his purchase-royalties) for each equation he included in the text. Despite this admonition, he did include one (Einstein's E=mc&lt;squared&gt;).Alas, for a calculus book, even one with the title of \`Advanced Algebra and Calculus Made Simple', has no choice but break the rule on equations, and hence is not likely to be purchased widely.The \`Made Simple' series includes much more than simply Calculus. In the 1970s as a young teenager I collected many of these books (which, as I am someone who never throws a book out, all still sit on my shelves). These include the following titles:Biology, Botany, Zoology, Chemistry, Physics, Electronics, German, Latin, Everyday Law, Religions of the World, and Philosophy -- all made simple, or made easy (the titles shifted at some point).Additionally, there as a Mathematics Encyclopedia put out by the same firm, and a preparatory volume, \`Intermediate Algebra and Analytic Geometry Made Simple' as precursor volume to this title at issue here. They also put out another volume I have, the greatly mis-titled \`Statistics Made Simple'. But that's another story.Can calculus be made easy? I think so, but I'm not sure if this volume follows through on its pledge in the title. Rather like the slim volume I have from the 1930s, part of a series entitled \`Mathematics for Self-Study', four volumes concluding with \`Calculus for the Practical Man' (of course, women didn't study calculus in the 1930s, we all know!) -- there is probably not a less practical volume of calculus in existence than this, and the made simple volume likewise is not made all that easy.Most of the \`Made Simple' volumes in other areas are fairly accessible to readers. Partly this is done be focussing upon broad issues and topics and not dipping into too much detail. However, this approach fails in topics like algebra, chemistry, languages and calculus where the knowledge is in the details. The layout is reasonable -- I've studied calculus in three different texts (John Olmsted's volume, Howard Anton's volume, and Angus Taylor's volume, each of which bears the basic title \`Calculus with Analytic Geometry'), and found that the approach in \`Advanced Algebra and Calculus Made Simple' is certainly no more difficult than in these other volumes.It covers in its chapters all of the basic beginning issues of calculus: rates and limits, derivatives, differentiation, integration -- but it doesn't get too far into any of these. One must wonder, for example, why Anton or Taylor would devote entire chapters or sections of chapters to a topic (say, for instance, logarithmic and exponential functions) where the 'made easy' volume seems to cover these in but two or three pages! Hmmm, perhaps something is missing here...I must confess that my mathematics skills are not up to snuff as they once were (I started university in the accelerated, honours mathematics programme, but have gone in another direction) -- math is one of those skills that if you don't use it, you lose it, and while I am still generally far above my other religious-studies oriented fellow students in mathematical abilities, and am rare among seminarians in that I have 50 or so math texts on my shelf, spanning from basic algebra to non-euclidean topology and advanced differential equations, I still have to open the book and explore to remember the most basic of calculus or trigonometric functions. In this task, the \`Made Simple' series serves me admirably, because it does condense topics into just a few pages, and those few are generally sufficient to remind me of what I've momentarily forgotten.Given that these volumes are generally inexpensive compared to other texts of the same topics (which is undoubtedly why, as a young teenager I acquired so many), they are useful references, and \`Advanced Algebra and Calculus Made Simple' is no exception in that regard.So, have fun -- see for yourself if, for you, it can be that calculus can be easy.There may be a quiz!"},{"Title":"Bowmanville Break A Novel","review":"\\"The Bowmanville Break\\" is a fascinating novel by Sidney Shelley. It is set in Canada during World War II, in a camp for German POWs. Most of the prisoners are U-Boat men, including some quite famous U-Boat captains, who are desperate to get back into the war. Incidentally, although the characters in this one are fictional, this story is said to be based on an actual escape incident at at Canadian POW camp for German prisoners.The plot and storyline for this one are linear and fast-paced, and hold the reader's interest. The best part of this novel in my opinion is the background. The author plausibly explains how this camp of captive POWs nonetheless manages to run an espionage network under the noses of its Allied guards. The author discusses the difficulties of managing large numbers of POWs and does so with authority and authenticity. This is an excellent novel, well-told.This novel was the theme for the excellent film \\"The MacKenzie Break\\" which starred Brian Keith. This one is highly recommended. RJB."},{"Title":"Caedmon Short Story Collection","review":"This is a truly marvelous collection of short stories on audiocassette. The choice of stories excellent on its own, but when you consider the readers (some of whom are the authors themselves) it's even better!My favorite stories here include &quot;The Lottery&quot; - just as chilling as I remember it, even though I know how it will come out; &quot;Owl Creek Bridge,&quot; which is wonderfully read by McCallum; &quot;The Diamond Necklace,&quot; which is one of the nastiest tricks played on a story's main character that I've ever read; and &quot;Tobermory,&quot; just because it's Saki and cats. [If they'd chosen &quot;Shredni Vashtar&quot; instead as the representative Saki tale I'd have had to figure out how to give the collection 6 stars!] I enjoyed listening to all of the stories, many of which were unfamiliar to me; Welty's reading of her own story is a hilarious, breathless take on a small-town family, Lotte Lenya's reading of Kafka is relentlessly chilling, Kiley's reading of Thurber is dry and funny - heck, they're all good.The only slight quibble I'd make is that there's very little space in between stories; they pretty much lead right in to one another. This means that if you want to pause to contemplate the story you've just heard, you should stop the tape the instant it's over, or else you'll be caught up in the next tale instead."},{"Title":"Caedmon Short Story Collection","review":"I'm currently listening to this series of short stories on CD and thus far they are excellent.

High Country is a hugely satisfying novel which leaves you feeling fortunate to have accompanied these memorable characters...both the two legged and four legged ones...on their adventures. Spanning fifty years in the lives of packers, this novel reminds you afresh just why you are a book lover. In addition to introducing you to the packer culture, High Country offers a very human tale about people you love getting to know. High Country has humor, suspense, romance, and descriptions of wilderness that few of us are lucky enough ever to see. Do not be surprised at the close of this story to be wondering..although you may never have even been on a horse, much less close to a mule ....if maybe, just maybe, there could be a pack trip in your future."},{"Title":"High Country: A Novel (Literature of the American West)","review":"It's been 50 years since I last went on a packing trip (in theWyoming Bighorns) and Wyman's novel brings back many pleasantmemories. This is not an \\"action\\" novel, nor is it dramatic inthe usual sense of that word. It is a novel about a man whocoexits with nature--a kind of mutual respect rather than abattle. Introspection and inner strength are the key words here.Ty Hardin has relationships with people to be sure, and these areimportant to him, but it is his relationship to the mountains andthe wilderness which is the crucial point. There are dramaticmoments--a lot of them--but in the high mountains of Montana andCalifornia these are natural and expected (e.g. you are goingto have bad weather fronts moving in).The writing is moving and very satisfying, and come from theheart of someone who has lived the life that Ty Hardin does.Packing is an unusual subject for a novel, but suddenly we havetwo at the same time--High Country and Brumfield's Across theHigh Lonesome--and both are excellent reading."},{"Title":"High Country: A Novel (Literature of the American West)","review":"Eight years in the making, Bill Wyman's first novel has arrived. For anyone who loves horses, mules, romance, camping and the Mountain West, High Country has been well worth the wait. In this action packed story, Wyman masterfully tells of Ty Hardin, son of a Bitteroot Valley rancher, who leaves the farm during the Depression for a packer's life in Montana's Swan Range. Ty learns the ropes from a Fenton Pardee, a veteran guide, who also becomes his mentor and close friend. Tending to dudes and hunters, crossing snowbound passes, fording swollen rivers, encounters with bogs and bears, mule wrecks of epic proportions - and coming of age in town - High Country captures the fears, dreams and fantasies of all who live for life on the trail.This book is a tale of riveting adventure, romantic love, profound sadness and natural beauty which is hard to put down. I honestly didn't want it to end. On one hand it is unique simply because it focuses on the packing industry and its culture - topics which, as literature, haven't been seen much on the printed page.On the other, more than just a first in its genre (does another packer's adventure novel even exist?), High Country is also a profound description of the people and landscapes all of us as westerners love - high country landscapes, before coffee table books, when wilderness was something to be experienced fist hand.High Country is a book you'll want to throw in your saddlebags and talk about around the campfire. Like your favorite camping trip, warm memories of High Country will last long into the night. If you like the Mountain West, this is a great read in every way. I promise you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"High Country: A Novel (Literature of the American West)","review":"I thought this would be a standard western genre work, but it turned out to be a thoughtful and moving elegy to love, memory and a fast disappearing America.

A very good read."},{"Title":"High Country: A Novel (Literature of the American West)","review":"If you are buying a book for a soldier this holiday season, choose High Country. Or, if you want to honor the courage and decency--and youth--of men who havechosen to put themselves \\"in harm's way,\\" buy this book for yourself. It is not a book about war, but about brave and good men. Few writers know forthemselves the life that makes some men quietly, quirkily, independently heroic. Bill Wyman does. High Country reflects the values of the western edge of this country: physical courage, modesty, self-discipline, and a love of the skills of the trade. Wyman knows the mountains, the high country of Montana and California, and he knows how to give life to such rugged places and the rare people who work among them. His central character, Ty Hardin, gifted with a special understanding of animals, learns the trade of a packer and comes of age in the mountains, He learns to read the country and to judge others truly, how to live intuitively, gracefully, and tenderly, with deep love and honorable self-sacrifice. Enriched by beautiful settings and lively and true dialogue, as well as memorable characters in Ty and his teachers and companions, this a novel to read and read again."},{"Title":"High Country: A Novel (Literature of the American West)","review":"Though this novel reminded me at times of McMurtry's LONESOME DOVE or Norman MacLean's A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT, the book stands tall on its own, not unlike the mountains that figure so prominently through the story. Wyman's prose brings the Montana Rockies and California's Sierra Nevada so much to life that they become characters in the story, always challenging and testing the people who love and live and work in them. Running throughout is a reverence for the power and nature of high country, the pack animals and their packers who inhabit that world, and the culture that's grown from the terrain. There's also an equally strong current of humor to be found througout -- these are men and women who live with a passion, and are serious enough to see the humor in all that's around them. They are genuine characters, in both senses of the word. I'd recommend HIGH COUNTRY to anyone interested in the American West, history, mountaineering, horses, laughter, cowboys, packing, adventure, and the outdoor life. This is a book that, like an actual experience in high country, will stay with you long after you are home again."},{"Title":"High Country: A Novel (Literature of the American West)","review":"This is not, in the end, a book about animals or mountains. It is about how a boy grows up and becomes a man--HAS to grow up. Along the way, it is, yes, about his physical surroundings. And--thanks to other writers like Wallace Stegner and Hemingway and a little bit of Thomas Hardy--it is about how our natural surroundings have a lot to do with how we get defined. But the reason I liked it is that it moved beyond all these things and into the heart of a person who learned to endure and, along the way, found wisdom. This is a smart, good book."},{"Title":"High Country: A Novel (Literature of the American West)","review":"The subject is mule packing, but much, much more is neatly and securely packed into this wonderful book. Big characters, big adventures and big themes. Love and loss, human agenda vs. higher order, wilderness and redemption. The writer molds the characters and their experiences with so much care and loving detail that I felt I was living those experiences, yet the story never bogs down, even for an instant. The pace is fast and the action no less than thrilling. Meanwhile, underneath the high adventure run steady currents of deeper themes -- the detail and specificity teasing them up to the surface -- and it all blends together effortlessly. It's a rich and complex book, full of love and humor and adventure and spiritual resonance, the kind of book where you can't wait to find out what happens next, yet you don't want it to end...."},{"Title":"High Country: A Novel (Literature of the American West)","review":"It takes two things to make a great Western novel: a true knowledge of the country and society you are writing about and a love of language. Wyman has both: a clear and evocative prose style and a consistently authentic presentation of the world of the mountain packer. As a result, scenes of shoeing a mule or navigating through a snowstorm make for powerful reading. Wyman moves from comedy to pathos in a way that always takes his characters seriously and respects his reader. A must-read for those who love the Sierra or the Montana high country and for all who appreciate a good story."},{"Title":"High Country: A Novel (Literature of the American West)","review":"Great book if you love the mountains and enjoy escaping into a great story line with wonderful descriptions of the life of a packer in the mountains.

It's not a \\"Western\\" at all. There are no blazing guns, sheriffs, or bad guys. There is just the beauty of the western high country bringing sustenance to a kid farmed out from a depression defeated Montana ranch to a find life packing mules and horses into the mountains. . . . We see the mountains grow into Ty Hardin as he grows into them, even when yanked from them to fight a war he is obliged to fight and which wounds him physically as his mentor, Fenton Pardee, knows it will, somehow. . . . Hardin returns to his high country to repair, and subsequently suffer the failure of a love that cannot be. He soon finds the deeper love of the woman he marries. But that too goes awry, his love dying with their child in a botched delivery. . . . That sadness takes him from the Montana mountains where he found life into the High Sierra, the west's highest range, where he knows life.

There is heart in this book, sometimes one of steal, but nevertheless one with enduring spirit. In Ingraham's epilogue she writes, \\"What allows us to imagine possibilities? To continue to live shrouded in romance is to participate in and benefit from such atrocities. Confronting the reasons for which we need romance is to see what it conceals. Critiquing the heterosexual imaginary is one step in that direction.\\"I've never looked at the wedding industry the same since reading this monumentally significant text. Never before has Ingraham's work been as important as now."},{"Title":"White Weddings: Romancing Heterosexuality in Popular Culture","review":"Chrys Ingraham, in her book, White Weddings, shows a behind-the-scenes look on the wedding industry. She effectively presents to the reader the ugly truths about the diamond industry, racism in wedding catalogs, homosexuality, and what happens after marriage. This excellent book opened up my eyes to what goes on behind such a supposedly \\"beautiful\\" occurrence in females' lives. This book not only opened up my eyes to the wedding industry, but to other matters as well, such as child labor, animal abuse, and sex trafficking. White Weddings was an inspiration to me to go out and see what I can do to help change the world in order to make it a better place. Fortunately, there are people like Chrys Ingraham, who want to make the world a peaceful and just place for everyone to live in.

I do feel, however, that the book lacked substance and repeated the same thing in a different way. This topic definitely deserves much greater attention and perhaps with more attention, we will get better and more thoughtful writers.I also was driven insane by the shape of the book. Besides making it physically difficult to read, it turned a supposed academic study into a novelty book"},{"Title":"White Weddings: Romancing Heterosexuality in Popular Culture","review":"Chrys, I cannot tell you how happy I was to read this book. You've so eloquently vocalized what I've felt for years but have never been properly able to express: my distaste for the &quot;white wedding mill&quot;, women's societally created lust for weddings, as well as points that I had never considered - especially the racial aspects. Your book has made me feel like I am not the only person (or woman, at least) who feels this way, and has helped me reinforce my long-held opinion that I will buck tradition and have NO WEDDING at all, in spite of my family's gasps of disbelief. I only wish it had been longer!"},{"Title":"White Weddings: Romancing Heterosexuality in Popular Culture","review":"I started out reading Chrys Ingraham's White Weddings with positive attitude. I am very interested with how the &quot;white wedding came about&quot;. As she went on with the book there were a few problems that did not settle with me. Number one she often used the words wedding and marriage interchangeably. These words are two very different in definition and shouldn\`t be used in place of one another. The second thing that I found very hard to handle with her book is that she often would make broad generalizations that would have no factually information to support the idea. Finally when you read the epilogue she says, \\"writing this book has been a wrenching experience. Without realizing how fully I've been sutured to dominate heterosexual culture, I have frequently found myself engaged in a variety of internal struggles. Tears would be streaming down my face as I empathized with the characters in a movie while, at the same time, I would be taking notes critiquing the heterosexual imaginary.\\" It seems to me that she wrote this book as a statement of how she feels and her opinions. This is great if it is therapy for her but should not be taken as fact or the answer for other people. The one educational part of the book was the section about how white weddings are capitalized. Sweatshops are terrible and it is a horrible feeling to know that people work in awful conditions to make your wedding dress. This is however should not be the main reason to critizes white weddings, but a reason to make changes. This book was a start of a good idea but in the end turned into someone else's opinion and platform. After reading this book no one should feel bad about the choices they make for their own weddings just because they don't fit with what Chrys Ingraham's believes. A person should make decisions based on what feels right for them."},{"Title":"White Weddings: Romancing Heterosexuality in Popular Culture","review":"I began this book expecting to agree with much of it but was very disappointed. The author is ranting instead of calmly stating a realistic argument. If I understood correctly, she believes that the Wedding Industrial Complex (with some vague notions of society and government) CAUSES women to desire marriage, view themselves as princesses and then spend as much money as possible on the wedding.Although her argument is far-reaching her facts are extremely narrow- (she spends a chunk of the book repeating herself with magazine advertising statistics).If her point was to let us know that many business owners within the wedding industry do not operate out of good will but are in fact out to make as much money as possible, point taken. But I knew that before I read the book."},{"Title":"White Weddings: Romancing Heterosexuality in Popular Culture","review":"I read this book while studying both contemporary North American and cross-cultural weddings and marriages. Ingrahms book describes the &quot;white wedding&quot; a white upperclass affair as discriminatory and exclusive.

I didn't understand why everyone else who read it thought it was so excellent. So I really thought hard about it one night, and made up my mind that I would keep reading it until I understood the message. Finally, it came to me, and it was so overpowering that I broke down and cried.Gibbie is a young, mute boy with an alcoholic father. He has a kind heart and is extremely gentle. His good friend, Sambo, is murdered, and he runs away. Gibbie is just a small boy in a large, cruel world, and he is treated badly by everyone on his journey but one woman, Janet. The variety of places he lived and the things he had to go through really taught me that not everyone has a full roof over their head, or enough clothes to cover more than a few body parts. This book gave me a lot to think about, such as the fact that some children are abused and don't show it at all to anyone. Or that most people just make assumptions about things that they know nothing about. I realize that I am guilty of these things, as everyone else is.This book was very compelling and I learned a lot about grace and mercy from it. The forgiveness that Gibbie shows his father towards the end is unbelievable, and I thought it was amazing that a tiny, mute boy could show so much more faith, wisdom, and emotion than anyone I have ever met, or read in a book. The story definitely had an impact on my view of how the world treats people and how the smallest child (who isn't even real) could change your life. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone - it is extremely good!"},{"Title":"Sir Gibbie,","review":"Like many people, I read MacDonald's 'Lilith' and 'Phantastes.'They were superb. I tried a collection of short stories, theywere ok. It seemed the rest of his work, labeled as children'sstories or novels of Scotch pastoral life, would not interestme.2 or 3 years later I read Melville's 'Moby Dick' I was castingabout desperately for something even remotely comparable toMelville's masterpiece. I read Chesterton's 'The Man who wasThursday.' Very good book. But what next?Even more desperate, I ordered an unabridged 1927 printing ofSir Gibbie. About 400 pages of small print, btw. I am amazed.I'm 3/4 thru it. This is even better than 'Lilith'or 'Phantastes.' This is MacDonald at the height of his power.His ideals and his knowledge of the human condition come thruin prose so rich and powerful that many passages have to bestudied rather than read. Like Melville in 'Moby Dick.'Yes, if any of this can be conveyed to a child, great. Yes,Christians may embrace it and seek to make it their own.MacDonald was a minister and he preaches from the soul here.But Gibbie as a literary character is a Titan of the same statureas Melville's Ahab. That comparison is of Light to Dark onlybecause I don't know of any other fictional Hero of the Lightcomparable to Gibbie. Let me underline this: if you won't likea hero who is entirely good, if you don't believe any charactercan embody the universal ideals of humanity, then you won't like'Sir Gibbie.' MacDonald is utterly uncompromising on this issue.He wanted a Power of heaven to walk on earth. Gibbie is thatPower.I believe 'Sir Gibbie' is the work which is at the root ofMacDonald's influence and friendship with other writers.But let me make clear, the book is not just an exercise incharacter development. MacDonald's prose in observing thenature of the book's many other characters is devastatinglypotent.One of the most powerful literary works I've ever read."},{"Title":"Sir Gibbie,","review":"I love this book so much that I have re-read it many times. It is a beautiful story of overcoming obstacles, increasing one's faith, and the redemption of mean-spirited people as they recognize goodness and truth and leave their unkind ways. It makes one's heart leap for joy with its Christian message. The writings of George MacDonald had a major influence on C.S. Lewis, and you will understand why when you read this Victorian classic. This edition is especially good to read to children as the confusing Scottish dialect has been simplified."},{"Title":"Sir Gibbie,","review":"I had just began rereading the original long-form version of the story when this Young Readers version arrived.It didn't take long for me to be disappointed.In the first, I had to work hard to understand the Broad Scotch passages, the non-P.C. language (BTW, what's wrong with using the word \\"negro\\" in an innocently non-judgmental way?) and the author's lengthy sidebars, which are all missing from this edited version. This later edition makes the central story much easier to read.But, sadly, Ms. Lindskoog removes much of the richness and depth of the original. Gone are the insights into the characters' motivations - all we get are their actions. Gone are the many of MacDonald's opinions about human life and God's desires for us. Gone are many interpersonal exchanges between characters, such as the most of the quite delightful argument between Mistress Croale and Reverend Sclater about his goal of closing her saloon.Don't get me wrong, this is still a very good story and does not shy away from MacDonald's original *very* evangelical Christian goal. But (this version at least) misses much of what the author originally seems to have intended.If you can get the full, unabriged version, please, by all means do so. You will be enriched through the effort of reading it.

It is difficult to read in that it has quite a bit of dialog written in scottish dialect which slows the story down so much that you forget what you are reading because it took so long to figure out what the character was actually saying. I am sure it is a lovely story but I could not get into it and I am glad I didn't have to pay for this edition. There was one long conversation between two characters where I was real not sure what it was all about and only got the gist of it. NOT a page turner, this one, unless you are just trying to get past certain parts."},{"Title":"Sir Gibbie,","review":"This unabridged version of Sir Gibbie is worth wading through the Scots dialect--a challenge even for those familiar with it to some extent. You can skip some of it and still follow the story, but the dialect adds much to the story. And the story is an extremely entertaining and edifying one. I read that this was C.S. Lewis's favorite Macdonald book. At first I thought I agreed, but on a second reading, I find that it is not my favorite. What's Mine's Mine is my favorite, and there are other MacDonalds that come ahead of Sir Gibbie for me. But none of his books taught me what Sir Gibbie taught me--something it was vitally important for me to learn: that we should love human beings IN GENERAL, just because they are human beings, if we love God. I was very far from understanding this important fact, despite the Lord's words in Matthew 22:39 and 1 Jn 4:20-21. But, also, it's a wonderful story. And the humor is delicious when it appears, as in the scene of Gibbie in the doghouse with Oscar, the collie--exquisitely funny to anyone who loves and knows dogs. I finished the book inspired, entertained, and spiritually much wiser."},{"Title":"Sir Gibbie,","review":"Having read & enjoyed Sir Gibbie some time back, I continue to purchase copies to give to friends (young & old) and to try to keep additional copies on our church book table."},{"Title":"Symbolism of the cross","review":"To read this book is to never see the Cross in the same way again. This is because it will become immeasurably more to you. Indeed, the metaphysician and mathematician Guenon demonstrates the symbol of the Cross to be the fundamental key, model, and archetypical pattern to all of creation.Briefly, the upper axis of the cross is shown to be the spiritual axis. This is the divine ray of emanation from the Source, it is the connection to the higher Self, the direction of divine attraction in spiritual evolution, the \\"will of heaven\\", and the connection between all possible worlds.The horizontal axis is shown to be the created world, the plane of earthly life and existance, the stage on which the individual ego operates.The intersection of the two axes is where \\"heaven and earth\\" meet. This is the point of divine influence. This is also the goal of the seeker, for to find this center is to merge your will with the will of heaven and obtain perfect harmony and\\"effortless action.\\"Guenon demonstrates in detail the parallels of this model with that of the Cross of Christ, the World Tree, the Sephirotic Tree, the Net of Brahma, the Neoplatonic system of heavenly spheres, the Hermetic macrocosm and microcosm, the Hindu Gunas, the Taoist Yin-Yang, as well as many other cross-cultural relationships.This study fits perfectly into the rest of the great edifice of Guenon's other work on the perennial wisdom. Numerous footnotes show one where to refer to his other books for further elaboration of various concepts."},{"Title":"Symbolism of the cross","review":"This is the second and the most important of the three &quot;metaphysical&quot;, purely doctrinal, books written by the great french author; the other two are &quot;Man and His Becoming&quot; (a description of the Indu Vedanta traditional doctrine) and &quot;The Multiple States of Being&quot;, perhaps the most difficult of all. In this book, the explanation of the symbolism of the Cross doesn't have nothing directly to do with the Christian theology, but (remember that R. Gu&eacute;non was a mathematician) a wise metaphysical description built -in accordance with the traditional doctrine- on the geometric symbolism. It is notable that this book is devoted by the author to his Sufi teacher, and that in the beginning of it he affirms that &quot;if christianism got the sign of the cross, Islam instead has his doctrine&quot;. A book that is essential for whoever had read the more simpler (even if radical) books of Ren&eacute; Gu&eacute;non, such as &quot;The Great Triad&quot; or the last he wrote before he died in Egipt, &quot;The Reign of Quantity &amp; the Signs of the Times&quot;."},{"Title":"Symbolism of the cross","review":"Guenon is a remarkable man. In this work he encourages the reader to see beyond the cross and see the spiritual meaning and significance behind it. Guenon not only looks at the cross in our own culture but examines the symbol of the cross in world cultures and societies. Guenon explores its meaning to those cultures, the relationship between man and the absolute and also how symbolism can be distorted or lost.

In this symbol is a cosmic reality that nothing in universal manifestation escapes; that much comes across to the reader. This is tough stuff unless one allows an intuitive grasp. For me, Guenon restores the cross of Christianity as the final Word. According to Guenon, a Muslim convert via Sufism, the \\"Universal Man\\" is the mediator between \\"heaven\\" and \\"earth\\" [Purusha and Prakriti]. Guenon quotes the Gospel: \\"Heaven and Earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.\\" (note at end of Chapter XXVII). No matter what your religious orientation, this book can serve as a great intellectual exercise, if nothing else."},{"Title":"Lose the Halo, Keep the Wings","review":"I had been looking for a book that would be honest and helpful.

It consists of about 20 plates (very sharp pictures) of the moon. The plates are on the right page, and on the left page is the matching drawing. The drawings are the outlines of the craters, mountains, valleys, rills, seas, and other objects, with their names. At the bottom of the left page, selected names are listed with their sizes, in kilometers. Relative ages are also indicated.After a few short introductory pages, the rest of the book consists of pictures and drawings. There is an index page near the front of the book that shows the area of the moon that each plate covers.The only reason I did not give the book 5 stars is because it does not have an index and grid system to help find a particular feature on the drawing page. If you are looking for the crater, &quot;Archimedes&quot;, you are just going to have to search until you find its name on that page.Still, if you have an interest in identifying features on the moon, this book will do it for you. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Hatfield Photographic Lunar Atlas","review":"The importance of a good reference is incalculable for those who do any serious lunar observing, or for those who need to know exactly what they're looking at (or at least what they should be seeing). The Hatfield Atlas is by far the best lunar reference available. But rather than subject you to further ramblings-on about the merits of this book, I'll just state some straightforward points in simple fact:The membership of our club includes about 140 dedicated amateur and professional astronomers. Many of us gather at our dark site facility to attend monthly star parties. If there is even the slightest moon that evening there may be a dozen or so telescopes trained on it well before dark. And those of us who do any serious lunar observing may already be consulting a single particular book which is kept on a desk in the observatory. Care to guess which book that is? &quot;Yo, who's got the Hatfield's?&quot;.The Hatfield Atlas is our 'official' lunar reference. Other references have been left out for the membership to browse and sample. Two of them drew favorable comments about their indices and cross references (and which are explicit advantages over Hatfield's). But as expected, we always go back to the Hatfield Atlas, and there are reasons. Plain and simple, you won't find better or more accurate renderings anywhere. If you want an exact reference, or if you need to match detail and gradations with what you see in the eyepiece, this is the book to have.The first time one examines a reference of this quality, there is generally some astonishment at the high level of detail involved. My first inclination was to 'read' it from cover-to-cover, as one would regard a centennial issue of National Geographic. You will likely find the renderings here to be of equal or better quality and possibly more fascinating.I highly recommend the Hatfield Atlas for both amateur and professional astronomers who have a need for the finest lunar reference available."},{"Title":"The Hatfield Photographic Lunar Atlas","review":"This book of elderly, sometimes fuzzy photos and rough drawings is outrageously overpriced, even with the small Amazon discount.Try to find a copy of the far better Rukl Moon Atlas, or write lots of letters to Kalmback to get them to reprint Rukl.The only virtue of this book is the paucity of any Moon Atlas - a juicy opportunity for someone - Hello Msrs.

Even a three-inch refractor will show far more detail. There are better sets of photographs, covering most of the visible surface, available on the web.However, the atlas will probably be useful to observers who are starting to find their way around the mooon's surface, as they will not be overwhelmed by fine detail.If you want to see good quality images of the moon do not buy this book; look on the web."},{"Title":"The Hatfield Photographic Lunar Atlas","review":"The photos in the Atlas were taken in the 1960\`s using B/W film and a home made 12\\" telescope. There are usually a variety of shots of each region taken under different libations as well as close-ups of important features.

The original work was published just before man landed on the moon - and thus moon observation was a &quot;craze&quot;.This &quot;new&quot; version, bearing Hatfield's name, uses Hatfield's original Lunar photographs that were taken, obviously, in the 1960's.I've read other people's reviews, most of whom complain about the quality of the photographs. These photograph's were truly remarkable in the 60's ... and 70's ... and even for the 80's into the early 90's. Are these the best photograph's for today's standards? No. But part of the beauty of this book are the remarkable vintage photographs (just as many of us marvel at the sight of vintage cars or vintage motorcycles).Specifically, this book is a &quot;nice&quot; (not great) photographic atlas of the moon. The sketches are &quot;very good&quot; (maybe not perfect). And the book's format/layout is STILL very useful for the casual and amateur astronomer.Yes, the RUKL MOON ATLAS is THE STANDARD. But this atlas has been out of print for several years. A copy of Rukl's was recently listed for $579 on eBay! And I've seen Rukl's sell for $100-$175 on other Internet sites.In summary, is Hatfield's the best? No. Is it very nice? Yes. Though I'd also agree that the price for this book is a bit too high ($25 is more reasonable), when compared to Rukl's, is THE HATFIELD PHOTOGRAPHIC LUNAR ATLAS worth $35? Yes.It is what it is: an updated reproduction of a classic. It doesn't have all of the bells &amp; whistles a 2004 Corvette has, yet isn't it still a joy to drive a vintage Corvette? You bet it is!"},{"Title":"The Hatfield Photographic Lunar Atlas","review":"Being in amateur astronomy for many years, mainly observing deep sky objects, I've now turned my scope back to the moon and have begun sketching craters and other lunar features. From free sites online to iPhone apps of the lunar landscape, none of them compare to this atlas. Yes, like the other reviews say the photos are grainy and not entirely sharp, but come on, the pictures are MORE than clear enough. The pictures were taken with the authors 30cm (essentially 12 inches) reflector...so of course the pictures are not going to look like Clementine's photographs or something from Star Trek or the old Apollo 13 movie. I love how the atlas shows a photograph of different grids of the moon, then shows close up a legend of what's what drawn out exactly the same as the photo. What I especially love about the atlas is how it shows the moon pictures in its full phase where the light flattens out all the major features and a photo of the same area with shadow details from a phase where the sun is shining at almost 90 degrees casting side-lighting. In short, I would recommend this text to anyone in astronomy interested in a more detailed look at the moon. As a person like myself who sketches celestial objects...this atlas is, in my opinion, gold!"},{"Title":"The Hatfield Photographic Lunar Atlas","review":"Old pictures and quite badly drawn maps of the moon makes this book feel to expensive no matter what it costs.Although, it gives you (as a matter of facts) very much information of the lunar surfice when it come to manmade names of the different places. Still some names misses, like the crater named after Neil Armstrong - where is it?I also wish a book that says it is an Atlas of the moon, sold year 2001, would contain fresh photos of better quality (The Hubble Sky Telescope could maybe do something for us moonfans!) and better drawings. And why not more information about how and where the names of the places came to real and, what I really miss - pictures of parts of the earth placed on the lunar surfice to give me a view of how big the craters and the moon as a whole actually is. And why not a part in the book with pictures from the Apollo missions?! More could be done."},{"Title":"A Choice of Catastrophes","review":"In this book, Asimov explores and analyzes the different ways the world, or civilzation, could end (the &quot;catastrophes&quot;) and estimates the likelihood and time frame of each one of them. He goes all the way from the macro-catastrophes (heat death of the universe) to the micro-catastrophes (disease and political turmoil).Very interesting book that brings science and a dose of reality into this consideration of the ultimate demise of mankind."},{"Title":"A Choice of Catastrophes","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by this book(Dutch translation). I had never before read Asimov, and although I imagined him as a &quot;serious&quot; science-fiction author, the subject and title of this book made me uncertain about what to expect... Would it go down the popular road of feeding on people's fear? As it turns out, there was no need to worry. Asimov uses a nicely balanced approach to this mass-appeal theme to touch many fields of science and even culture. His message is not one of hysteria, but a message of hope. He presents himself as a true Homo Universalis of our time. Not in the sense that he pretends to know everything about anything, the sort of omni-knowledge that died after the Renaissance. But in the sense that he argues like a true World Citizen. A member of the human race instead of belonging to this or that nation/religion/sex/whatever. Of course, the subject of the book lends itself very well for this. So my impression is that Asimov found it more important to awake this feeling in the readers, than to write a sort of disaster-encyclopedia. The book is meant to assist us in becoming conscious about our position in space and time. About our relation to the past, the future and all the phenomenons in the Universe that completely outscale us in size, violence and duration. It is meant to make us feel tiny and insignificant in one way. But certainly also to unite us in a collective battle against the indifferent laws of nature and evolution.I would recommended this book to anyone with a broad view on the world around us."},{"Title":"A Choice of Catastrophes","review":"I had read this book years ago and found it fascinating. In this book Azimov goes into exhaustive detail into how the earth and indeed the whole universe could come to an end. He has a chapter on how various religions think about the end of the world.

In fact, technobabble is even explained, so you too can learn how a black hole forms.Recommended for fans of the website Exit Mundis, which has a similar concept, and for all other fans of the good doctor's work."},{"Title":"A Choice of Catastrophes","review":"A range of disasters is covered here. Asimov begins with threats at the cosmic level, such as a reverse big bang, and works down to disasters that would destroy the solar system, and then only the earth. The last category include the least destructive and most managable dangers: those that disrupt our lives but would not wipe us out, such as pollution.It became clear to me early on that this is not a true disaster book. We learn little about what these catastophes would actually do and how they might play out. Instead, Asimov concentrates on the scientific and mathematical possibilities and probabilities involved. A bizzare tone of optimism also permeates the book, as the author believes every problem can be solved and every danger avoided, if only mankind works together for the good of humanity. Not likely!The young (or old) scientist with a global perspective will find this a great read, and all readers will learn a thing or two about how our end might come.

ETC!!!! This is due to the fact that whoever put this on amazon, downloaded the kindle version of this book from priviously mentioned free site, which can not reformat alot of the old reproduced advertisments, etc in the old book and is SELLING it! This i know because i have BOTH versions now. I honestly assumed that when i bought this, i was buying a better copy, where i could see everything that was in the book. WRONG!!! All i got for my money, was another exact copy of the copy i already had gotten FREE!! I don't fault amazon themselves for this, as it would be IMPOSSABLE to \\"police\\" everything that sells through them. It IS mostly readable, IF you have the patience of mathusla, as i seem to, to remember what was just said, although only 1/2 way through the sentance, then scroll past all the hyrogliphics {sometimes a couple kindle pages long}, & continue with the sentance. Luckily, i have just purchased a dvd rom online that has a ga-ZILLION magic books, mags, radio shows, etc on it, including this book, but in an ACTUAL SCAN! Meaning NO hyrogliphics, duplicate pages placed within proceeding chapter, as happened in both the others, etc! It's the same as reading the original, except in pdf format, so you do have to scroll, etc. This is proving to be a VERY interesting read, full of magic history i've not read much of before, & if you are a Houdini OR Houdin fan, i very much reccomend it, but if you can get a better copy, as i did on that disc, the reading will be MUCH more enjoyable.

At times I dislike it, at other times I was compeletely captivated by it, and now that I'm through with it, I am utterly haunted. There are more detailed reviews on this site about Wuthering Heights but I'll go into what I liked and didn't like and you'll forgive me if the story description that I give isn't 100 percent up to par with everything that happens because frankly alot of stuff occurred and it would be impossible to fit it all here. Catherine and Heathcliff are two people destined to be together as they have been inseperable since they were children and Heathcliff was adopted by her father Mr. Earnshaw. But as they grow older, people try to keep the two apart. The neighbors, the Lintons, have a son named Edgar who Catherine becomes friends with also and this will bring trouble in the future. Also, Catherine's brother Hindley hates Heathcliff because his father doted on him. This will bring more trouble. And finally, once they are fully grown, Heathcliff overhears a part of something Catherine says about how it would be degrading to marry him. Intensely hurt, he leaves for years and years before he can hear her proclaim how much she loves him with a passionate love if ever there were one. She marries the Linton boy Edgar and Heathcliff returns. A tragedy occurs and he uses every fiber of his being trying to get even. To say more would be major spoilers I think, so I'll leave it at that. Now to the good and bad. The narrative is told by both Catherine's nanny and by this other guy who came to rent a room from Heathcliff and sometimes I had trouble telling who was speaking. Also, I felt that it could've been cut shorter in some places with the dialogue, but these are minor problems really. So what's good about this novel? CATHERINE AND HEATHCLIFF. These two deserve to be together and you can feel that whenever they are in one another's presence. I have never read a novel that made me feel so strongly for two characters. Many times I became physically ANGRY that things were happening to drive them apart. Never has this happened. I found myself silently seething about some of this stuff. You really have to read it to fully understand what I'm talking about but so much happens against Heathcliff and the entire world is stacked against him and then Catherine goes and marries Linton. I felt betrayed by that, by a CHARACTER IN A NOVEL. Then later on when there is no longer any hope for the couple to be together at all, I felt such anguish for Heathcliff. It was a real anguish that he was being denied, even as he did despicable deeds to exact revenge. And I'm a guy, not some 16 year old girl. Another thing that was great was how Emily Bronte crafted her characters. Each and every one of them at some time or another does something shameful or mean or just plain evil. But I always understood their motivation and could not hate them for what they did. I felt compassion for some of them as if they were actual flesh and blood. Lord have mercy, why couldn't they just be together? There is something about this book. It is filled with such anguish, such unrequitted love, that it lingers and stays with you. It is the saddest book I have ever read and it will stay with me for the rest of my life."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The book is mainly narrated by Mr. Lockwood and Ellen Dean.Mr. Lockwood is renting Thrushcross Grange near Wuthering Heights. A man named Heathcliff is his mysterious and rude landlord. Lockwood asks the housekeeper, Ellen Dean, to tell him the story of Wuthering Heights and its inhabitants.She goes on to tell him the story of Heathcliff and Catherine and Wuthering Heights. The first part of her story is of how Heathcliff came to live at the Heights, the seond half of the story is about how Heathcliff takes his revenge as an adult.It's the depth of love that I really like in the book, that timeless love that Heathcliff and Catherine possess. The woman is dead for God's sake, and Heathcliff continues to love her and she haunts the Heights unwilling to leave her soulmate behind. That's what I call true, enduring love. Catherine and Heathcliff's love affair affects everyone they come in contact with. There's no escaping it.Bront creates these imperfect and passionate characters, some of whom are borderline evil. I love the drama within the story, the setting of the dark and stormy Yorkshire moors sets the mood just right. This is a story about love, revenge, family and grief. It's a classic gothic love story that is not soon forgotten. Thank you Emily Bront for creating one of my favorite anti-heroes in literature, Heathcliff."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"But it's not a love story... I really wish people wouldn't call it a love story. Its a story about thwarted passion and what happens when almost obsessive love is taken to extremes.I started to read on Monday and I have now finished it.. I loved every page but I am completely at a loss as to why Heathcliff is so adored. He isn't a romantic figure especially not in the latter half of the book and Cathy is so selfish and spoilt that they can't be together.Brilliant examination of passion gone wrong but not a romantic novel."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This classic of English literature has certainly stood the test of time. From the commencement of the novel with moody images to its likewise saturnine conclusion, Bronte's work with tone and characterization sets the bar high for authors of all kinds. The raging zealousness of love that so possess Heathcliff and Catherine melts off the pages in molten waves - truly, has a romance so deluded and inherently doomed ever been described so well? The passions of Romeo and Juliet seem lame in comparison. But never have protagonists been so unlikable. It is hard to sympathize with either one of them, which is the major disappointment of the novel. It is with relief, then, that the romance between young Catherine and Hareton is established. Innocent and true without the sadness that is a trademark of Heathcliff's obsession, the reader begins to glimpse the true meaning of love. The book is intensely readable and page-turning, accessible and unique. The bulk of Wuthering Heights is a psychological exploration of what the past does to a person - it does not so much examine a passionate affair than it does the consequences of actions undertaken by the abused and misguided. Surely Bronte's masterpiece of the human soul will linger as long as Heathcliff's intensity for his lost idol."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The outdated writing style takes a little getting used to, but once you do, it's good. It's incredible to me how the author, with her unusually limited experience of the outside world, who probably never had a boyfriend or lover in her life and lived a secluded life in a remote part of Yorkshire with her sisters and died a virgin, could have created such an incredibly realistic and well-drawn character like Heathcliffe. I love the fact that he's flawed and I love the chemistry between him and Jenny. It's just amazing to me that so much passion could lurk in the heart of such an isolated and inexperienced soul as Emily Bronte. I don't suppose she and Charlotte got any real romance or sex as governesses. Emily's poems are full of originality and vision, but it is her novel that's a true masterpiece."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Told in alternating flashbacks from the perspectives of two narrators, Wuthering Heights is the gothic love story of Catherine and Heathcliff. Their doomed love has tragic repercussions for them and both of their families.I absolutely loved this when I first read it as a teenager. It's like a creepy soap opera."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Of course, I'm not referring to one of the best novels (I don't say \\"best-loved\\" novels, because it's not a lovable reading, but an all-important, soul-searching and unforgettable one). As the noted critic A. C. Swinburne said in 1883: \\"It may be true that not many will ever take it to their hearts: it is certain that those who do like it will like nothing very much better in the whole world of poetry or prose\\".So it has been for more than a century. Nobody should miss this strangest and strongest of English novels, so hauntingly beautiful and intensely poetical in its dark and eerie otherness. By the way, don't miss Emily Bront's poems, or a good selection of them.The issue now, is this PARTICULAR paperback edition (Wordsworth Classics, 2000). What do we get and what not, how does it compare to the other editions in the marketplace.To begim with, it's ONE OF THE THINNEST EDITIONS EVER, light on your pocket and cheap as airborne luggage (6/8 inch vs., say, one full inch for Penguin Classics edition). The mass-market paperback, is as bad as you fear, and then some... for its paper quality and binding. A bit surprisingly, printing quality is good enough. The Introduction (18 pp) by John S. Whitley is not bad, perhaps one bit askew for the intended readership (I don't feel myself at ease with those Freudian interpretations). The Bibliography is good and so is the annotation at the end of the book, three pages in small type that aren't user-friendly, specially in the handling of the dialect tirades.So, it looks like a good edition, were it not for the outrageous material production; but then, Penguin's and Oxford's aren't so much better as paper quality and binding go, although their type is easier on the eyes and the printing quality a little better. And, mind, when I speak of bad quality paper, it's a matter of Penguin browned pages in only five years, and Oxford's little better behaving of slightlier browned pages in ten years. Wordsworth Classics pages haven't got brown so far but they sure will do (when you make paper out of whole timber logs, it always happens).The worst thing, by far, is the text itself. It's a careful and accurate 1850-type text, that follows that of the by then very distinguished Haworth Edition (1900), the same text used by Barnes&Noble; Classics noteworthy hardcover edition. Of course, there are texts far worse than that, namely Modern Library, Chatham River andTime-Warner ones, not to mention Gutenberg Project's most corrupted electronic text.As you probably know, the 1850 text was edited, or more precisely, in all good will tampered-with, by Charlotte Bront (who didn't like her sister's novel at all). The changes in the text from the 1847 edition were pervasive, and detrimental: there were some hundred of small stylistical or grammatical \\"improvements\\", now as useless as then; a toned-down, sweetened version of York dialect paragraphs that looks decidedly funny and almost as hard to understand; the punctuation was brought in line with Victorian practice (which isn't ours, anyway): professional, light and discrete, syntactical in concept, instead of Emily's rather inconsistent usage, rethorical in concept, as 18th century's prose and specially poetry had been. Even WORSE was the urgent need to save printing space at all costs, which resulted in the disparition of more than 600 paragraph beginnings (I mean just the paragraphing, not the paragraph contents!). Overall, it makes for a worse and distorted reading experience. Many of us (I don't know HOW many) think 1850 is a no-go textform, and would like to see it no more in the intricate textual history of this work.TO SUMMARIZE: I recommend strongly NOT to buy this edition, in spite of its real merits. And then what?If durability is not a must and budget is tight, go for either Penguin's Classics (Pauline Nestor) or Oxford's World Classics (Patsy Stoneman).If durability is a must, and budget is not so tight, then go for one of the best context-oriented, \\"study\\" editions: Broadview Press (Beth Newman),Longman Cultural (Alison Booth) or Norton Critical (Fourth Edition) (Dunn).If what you are after is a nice hardcover edition, the options are greatly reduced:you may try Barnes&Noble;, with the selfsame ignoble text as Wordsworth Edition, or go for a good copy of the 1978 Franklin Mint edition, the one with the Alan Reingold lithographs, with a very good 1847 text and no Introduction or annotation other than Charlotte Bront Preface (NOT to be read BEFORE the novel) and full and right glosses as footnotes for the dialectal tirades (the first edition to do so, as far as I know)."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This purely wonderful novel is indisputably a classic, with many wonderfully unique and complex characters that are, at the same time, very hard and very easy to relate to. Just the whole novel and all aspects of it are just breathtaking from first page to last. Recommended to anyone who wants to take a break back to a time where every word is well deserved to be read. Not a book to skim by any means."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I have always meant to read \\"Wuthering Heights\\", but, until recently,never got around to it. Following a recommendationI read \\"The Thirteenth Tale\\" by Diane Setterfield. After being quitedisappointed with that book, I followed the advice of other reviewersto read Emily Bronte's original. I have to agree that \\"WutheringHeights\\" is incomparably better than Setterfield's effort. Readingthe two books together so closely was actually quite enlightening.While both are dark, Bronte's book is so with reason. And whileboth books abound with odious characters, in \\"WutheringHeights\\" they are not caricatures. I would not recommendSetterfield's book to anyone, but reading it made me appreciateE. Bronte all the more."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I just finished reading Wuthering Heights and, though I never really had much of an interest in romances, this book changed my perspective. The characters are interesting if not likeable, and it would be impossible to guess where the plot would turn next, it being controlled by a fabulous imagination. The book is wonderful, I got to a certain point- a point early on, too- and I could not stop reading."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"When first started reading this I expected it to be about two lovers who were somehow being driven apart. And although that proves to be true, it's far more complicated than that. Filled with hate, revenge, and anger, you can expect to find very little happiness in this book. As for the characters, I found it impossible to like any of them except for Hareton. You have characters who are so self centered and filled with rage, that in their time of weakness you can't even pity them for they're that despicable. But don't get me wrong, each character has their moments that make you want to forget all their flaws, but those moments are limited.Emily Bronte created a book about love and hate, and what they can do to people. Driven with love and hate, people do crazy things and this books goes to show you that. And although this book had it's slow parts, I still found it to possess a well thought out story. And as for the ending..well that part I enjoyed."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Brot's \\"Wutheting Heights\\" is a two sided coin. The whole narrative is contructed over doubles and juxtapositions -- with elements arranged into pairs. From the basic conflict of love against hate, the writer brings up the most and lest noble feelings and actions -- always making pairs and putting one against the other.To begin with, the narrative is divided into two distinct poles, each representing a different generation. Structurally speaking, the first part -- the one that includes Catherine, Heathcliff, Isabella, Edgard -- is stronger and more important, while the second segment works as a sort of anticlimax dealing with the love of the second generation --young Catherine, Linton, Hareton. Another double point is that there are two Catharines, being the second one the daughter of the former. They both have many resemblances, physically and psychologically. But the young Catharine is an amalgam of her mother's and father's personality.\\"Wuthering Heights\\" is a generational drama. Two generations have to face the same problems that they parents had. But at the same time, Bront deals with the gap of one generation to another. The same dramas do not have the same conclusion. Time has passed, minds and behavior have changed. In this fashion, the book tackles life as a process that is in constant change.Places are also battling against each other. The main stage for the action is the Wuthering Heights, while the other part of the narrative happens in the Thurshcross Grange. The first, as the name gives away, exploits the wildness, the extremity, the unstoppable love. On the other hand, the Grange represents the social status and the aristocracy. At the same time, they represent Catharine inability to choose between Heathcliff (WU) and Edgard (TG).Despite not being a success when first published in 1847, Brot's \\"Wuthering Heights\\" became a cult with time. Nowadays it is considered one of the most important novels ever written. Not a bad change for a book that received much critics when published and the writer had to use a masculine pen name in order to be considered serious.As Gothic novels go, not only structurally is \\"Wuthering Heights\\" a very brave effort, but also thematically this book defied its genre. Following the gothic tradition of the late XVIII Century, the books has elements like supernatural aspects, moonless nights, valorization of the grotesque. But, despite these strong points, what remains more popular in the book is its characters and their love story, Catherine and Heathcliff.The narrative is told by many different narrators from various sources, like letters, diaries entries etc, therefore there isn't an unbiased narrator. Nelly tells most of the story to Mr. Lockwood. She watched most of events she describes, however she remains as an unreliable narrator, once she injects her own view of the facts and characters. That is why it is so important to read between the lines in this book.Thinking of more contemporary concepts, \\"Wuthering Heights\\" is like yin and yang, dealing with two basic principles of the universe: love and hate -- both inhabiting the same people. Since the novel deals with the human nature, Bront's single novel is timeless and appeals to most readers."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I first read WUTHERING HEIGHTS as an assignment in 10th grade English class and was struck by how emotionally twisted the characters were. I also wondered if I was reading the book the right way, because I found a lot of the story very funny.So I decided to pick it up again recently and realized what a timeless, brilliant book WUTHERING HEIGHTS really is. It's as emotional and labyrinthine as any soap opera -- but so much more worthwhile. These are some of the most strongly-drawn characters in literature, and they will pull you right into the story with their caprices, turnabouts, fripperies, and cruelty.First-time readers may find the beginning a bit slow, but please don't be discouraged by that. A really wild, romantic -- and, yes, after all these years, still pretty hilarious -- story awaits you. This is a book that can move you to tears and make you laugh out loud.First-time readers may also have trouble keeping track of the two Catherines and who's married to/in love with whom. Even while rereading it, I had to remind myself who was who, who's the child of whom, who's the mortal enemy of whom -- but it is absolutely worth it. So many people go on about how romantic this book is, and it certainly is, but let's not overlook the sheer drama and insanity of this book.This book is more about obsession than pure romantic love. There, I've said it. This book will make you glad that your life is not like this. But any time you need a shot of histrionic behavior and violent obsession, Heathcliff and Cathy are waiting for you at WUTHERING HEIGHTS."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"...when you have nobody to love you...lonely like the devil and envious like him...nobody will cry for you when you die!I don't consider &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; to be a love story or simply a book about love, hate, and revenge, as it is often wrongfully described by many. I dare not say this is a social work either, but it is somehow concerned with broad issues such as social and familial oppression, the subordination and the disadvantaged nature of female lives at that time, the brutality of the patriarchal power, the unjustices of the inheritance law, etc. The most striking thing about this book is that it is concerned with extremities like love and hate, human and animal, life and death, masters and servants, earthly and divine.Of course the relationship between Catherine and Heathcliff is maybe one of the main things of, at least, the first part of this work: they're like almost two waterdrops, both showing a fondness for freedom and nature. But their relationship (I don't know why I hesitate to call it love) is kind of dysfunctional, for lack of a better word. Maybe it's because of the lack of a mother for both of them, maybe because of their upbringing in an atmosphere of patriarchal brutality.And maybe it's not a pure coincidence that Heathcliff's origins are obscure: when he first appears at Wuthering Heights he is dirty, ragged, starving and houseless, ill-treated by the patriarchal and he is refused education. As a critic simply put it, Wuthering Heights can hardly be described as a social novel, but it deals with many social themes, as Heathcliff might be seen as a representative of, maybe not the dispossessed, but at least of the oppressed; on the other hand Edgar reads a great deal, but his reading seems more a means of escape from the emotional turmoil which surrounds him rather than a pleasure per se. Besides, towards the end of the story, Cathy begins to educate Hareton, which later leads them to falling in love, as preposterous as this might seem earlier in the book: their previous enmity and hatred has been forsaken in favour of union through learning. Interestingly, as this is happening, Heathcliff, formally the force for energy (not a positive one), now acknowledges the draining of this energy and the lost of his faculty of enjoying their destruction and his being too idle to destroy for nothing (I have to remind myself to breathe-almost to remind my heart to beat: conscience has turned my heart to an earthly hell).If the first part of this work depicts a fierce and passionate but also binary view of the Yorkshire moors society, the second part of it is about reconciliation, education, development and, thus, progress. At the end of the book the powers are much more balanced, the relationship between sexes more egalitarian, as E. Bront seems to emphasize the need of the society to develop and move forward with necessary cohesion.Or at least this is the way I see this novel, much more a social work rather than simply a book about love, hate and revenge, and that's what makes it, in my opinion, one of the best of its time. But hey, every reader may see and interprete it his or her own way: I guess this too is the beauty of literature, as that of music and art in general."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I had to read this in my senior year of high school and found that I could NOT put it down. I would linger after class to talk to my teacher about it, and finally she told me I could keep the school's copy for my own use. She could tell how much I loved it! I practically have tears in my eyes when I reread the first few sentences. This is the saddest, and yet the most hopeful book I have ever read. It's so beautiful, and Bronte has taken cares to describe the human condition of loneliness she doubtlessly felt during her own lifetime. These are some of the most realistic characters in all of literature, and YOU WILL NOT REGRET PICKING UP THIS BOOK!!! I can't even fully describe how much I love this book. Honestly, it changed me. The story is unforgettable, and exquisitely profound. I urge you to open your heart and let this book move you too."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Before reading WH, I knew its reputation as a dark novel but was taken aback a bit by the grinding dreariness and cruelty of the story. Noone who has read Jane Eyre will confuse Emily with Charlotte. I had also heard it described as a tragedy but, while it certainly has its tragic elements, it lacks the defining element of a truly gripping tragic story--sympathetic characters. In short, WH seems to defy easy classification and I suppose that's an important part of its allure.While I found the first three chapters, which establish the odd and mysterious inhabitants of Wuthering Heights, to be a bit slow in gathering momentum, the remainder of the book heightened my interest as the narrative of past events unfolded. I disagree with some reviewers who found the prose to be overdone and difficult to read; I enjoyed the narrative style and diction and found myself immersed within the wild moors setting. The story itself is compelling and, if one can stifle the desire for a hero in shining armor to alleviate the persistent suffering found within the pages, the flawed characters are fascinating.Putting aside some very minor problems such as the plausibility of the detailed recollections of Nelly Dean which constituted the bulk of the narrative, my primary issue with the book is the ending. In particular, I found the Cathy/Hareton union to be a bit difficult to believe and, more importantly, the potential suspense and suprise around the death of Heathcliff to be an opportunity lost by the revelation of his passing before its description within the narrative flow.Taken as a whole, WH is a very enjoyable read and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I know that I will be tarred and feathered for denouncing the &quot;20th Century's favorite 19th Century novel&quot; but I have my reasons why as you shall see. Most of the novel rests entirely on Bronte's ability as a weaver of words, and not on her creation of characters. Bronte tried to imitate the passion of Lord Byron's characters and succeeded only marginally. Out of all the characters in Wuthering Heights only Heathcliff is strongly developed in the sense that although we may despise him at certain times, we always feel a sense of empathy, even compassion at times. For the character of Catherine Earnshaw/Linton one feels only contempt, with a thin veil of sorrow. It is the same feeling one has for Miss Havisham in Dickens Great Expectations. Catherine senior is a deceitful, destructive force who almost succeeds in passing on her vices and moral depravity onto her daughter. Unlike Dickens Great Expectations however, we see no reason in her madness, which is one of the failings of Bronte's novel. To most readers she is just a spoiled little rich girl who wants to have her cake and eat it too. This is never expounded on in any great length and Bronte, while not explicitly saying it, seems to condone it as a perfectly good reason to go to Edgar and not Heathcliff. It is at that point in the story that we have nothing but total contempt for Catherine senior and nothing else. But there are many morally bankrupt characters that populate great literature and they do not take away from the story, Dickens Miss Havisham and Estella, come up once again. The difference between Catherine senior and these characters is that Bronte's character is shown as a weak, whining woman with no clear direction either in her life or in the plot of the story. She is in short the airhead of the story. It is a very negative portrayal of women and I'm surprised that Bronte devoted so much time to this character. Her daughter Catherine junior is a much stronger character in every way, but here again is another downfall of the book. The characters of Catherine junior and Hareton Earnshaw are cast out of the spotlight in favor of concentrating on Catherine seniors whining. These characters, along with those like Nelly Dean and Lockwood have far less substance than they should. Bronte should have devoted more time to Catherine and Hareton than she did. Overall, I think that Heathcliff saved the story from bombing terribly, and Bronte's prose also contributes to the beauty of the book, but she was no Lord Byron. Bronte simply did not understand plot and character well enough to make this the novel it could have been, which is a terrible shame. Although some people indict this book as just being a 19th Century soap opera, its fault rests not in the plot being too unrealistic and trite, it rests on the fault that the reader only gets to know a few characters really well, and of those characters only Heathcliff is given the attention he deserves."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Charlotte Bronte is a great writer. I read Jane Eyre twice and comprehended every word, every nuance. Wuthering Heights was another matter. So much of it was obtuse. Just a little while ago, I read a very helpful review here by an English teacher no less, who said he had trouble comprehending the story the first time around, but he has read it again and this time it was a completely different and positive experience for him. I certainly have benefited from this particular review because now I am going to read Wuthering Heights again with a different attitude. It is not easy reading; it is a deep book. You have to concentrate, but I know I can do it, and I am going to do it! Even though I saw the movie before I read the book (I thought the movie starring Merle Oberon and Lawrence Olivier was outstanding), parts of the book were still obtuse. If I hadn't seen the movie, I suppose the book would have been a total imposssibility. I don't mean to seem so negative about Wuthering Heights, but I have never in my life read a book where I had to concentrate so much; it took the pleasure out of reading it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Enjoying a great novel sometimes requires a willingness to accept confusion, at least initially. Many readers who have trouble appreciating &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; are put off by the work's first 50 pages. The novel begins with a focus on a fastidious hypochnodriac who is not actually the main character and who never even has a first name: Mr. Lockwood, a tidy little man who enjoys observing love from a distance but is terrified by its proximity. He has no idea what's in store for him. Urged by his doctor to rest his over-wrought nerves, Mr. Lockwood rents a beautful manor in the apparently idyllic Yorkshire moors of northeast England, a decision he will soon both deeply regret and enjoy. In the novel's opening pages, Bronte successfully integrates Mr. Lockwood's mistaken conclusions with the reader's: 1)Mr. Heathcliff must be a gentleman [He isn't]; (2)The young lady by the hearth must be Heathcliff's wife or perhaps that of the coarse young man who also lives there [She's neither; she's actually a widow, and the coarse young man should be the house's master]; and (3)Catherine Earnshaw is a spectral demon with the power to return to earth in order to continue terrorizing those whom she once loved [Maybe she is; maybe it's only a dream], and so on. All of these errors in judgment are completely understandable, and during the course of the novel they are all satisfactorily explained. But initially, the situation Mr. Lockwood, as well as the reader, encounters is very, very confusing. Mr. Lockwood gets nearly everything wrong, and to a reader accustomed to lucid foreshadowing, Lockwood's mistakes are perplexing. What IS going on in this strange, strange house? Confusing the reader, however, is actually part of Bronte's strategy to transport Lockwood, and the reader as well, to a world of pure imagination, a realm of stormy passion where all thoughts are expressed in poetic speech (regardless of the damage they may cause), a world where one character is another character as well (&quot;Nelly, I am Heathcliff&quot;)--in short, a world that would be utterly abhorrent to the reader's rational faculties but proves irresistibly attractive to his emotional and aesthetic dimensions. So the novel's first few pages deliberately disorient the reader, encouraging him to abandon an everyday world where the apparent equals the reality, where most sane people restrain themselves, spending most of their days and nights in balanced, rational pursuits. Bronte's novel, restricted geographically to the Heights and the Grange, is a buttonhole in reality, through which the reader slips without fully realizing it from a more or less rational environment into a world where ghosts are not entirely unexpected, lovers dig up the corpse of their beloved, drunken louts drop their babies from stair landings, middle-aged men repeatedly curse--even brutally batter--younger women, and lovers punish each other to prove the depth of their love. &quot;Toto, we're not in Kansas anymore!&quot; Bronte's world would disintegrate if it were evaluated by generally accepted rational, moral precepts. Bronte instinctively realizes this fact and, within a matrix of purposeful confusion, seductively transports the reader from an everyday world of clearly articulated right and wrong where love is primarily a dalliance into one where love consumes entirely, lasts well beyond mere physical death, and is not the least bit concerned with traditional concepts of right or wrong, appropriate or inappropriate, acceptable or unacceptable. With meticulous attention to specific details and complex time frames, Bronte ultimately explains away all of Mr. Lockwood's and the reader's initial misunderstandings. If the reader--allowing for some intentional confusion in the novel's opening pages--continues reading, he will be rewarded by Bronte's ability to transport him into an utterly fascinating but repulsive, familiar but impossible world that is the essence of imaginative literature. Bronte's novel--populated by comic and tragic characters, set in beautiful but deadly landscapes, focused on restrained civility juxtaposed with passionate intensity--undoubtedly deserves its rank among the world's greatest romances and imaginative literary creations."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte is not as well-known as her sister Charlotte who wrote Jane Eyre, that, it must be said, far surpasses Wuthering Heights. I'd like to think that every book has a good, universal element we can relate to. And they do. Wuthering Heights is a story of revenge, passion and metaphysical love. It is a Gothic novel set appropriately in the bleakness of the Moors in England. Emily Bronte brings out a gorgeous narrative. It is confusing because it has the points of views quickly shifting from one personage to another. Nelly tells it for the most part. But the love story is incredible. Heathcliff and Catherine, as selfish and cold characters that they are, share a love that binds them even when they are apart in life and in death. It can be romantic. But the reason they teach this in school is because of the scholarly attention it receives, being a Bronte product. I think Jane Eyre may be of higher calibre but Wuthering Heights has its brilliant moments. It is a classic. I say it has many colors because we can be disgusted by the course actions of Heatchliff as he orchestrates his revenge on the people around him. We can also dislike the snobbish personality of Catherine and her choosing money over true love. But we can also sympathize for the lovers as human beings. This is a drama that can take place anywhere on earth. It is human drama. Bronte is as much in the same line as other universal writers including Dante and Shakespeare. Yes, Emily should be proud of her masterpiece. At times boring but worth reading on your own. I highly recommend this great work. Try to see beyond the boring parts and into the love and universalities !"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I read this novel when I was a junior in high school, and I really did not enjoy it. I was an avid Jane Austen fan and usually read the sweet, courtship novels. Now, as a college graduate, I decided to re-read this classic to see if I might enjoy it more now that I am older. I must say that I was really taken by the spectacular writing, and the poignant view of human nature at its worst. Although Heathcliff and Cathy's romance is disfunctional at times, the extreme hold that they have on one another (even after death) is compelling. I really enjoyed this book, and I recommend it to all of you who have a dusty copy sitting on your bookshelf. If you haven't read this novel since high school, my advice is to read it again, and see if it has some new meaning for you."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wow! my opinion really changed from the beginning of the book to the end. In all honesty, at first, it was boring, then it got better, and at the end I was a little confused.

Try it out, you just might like it!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"A good example of pseudo-Shakespearean tragedy written about the time of Jane Austen. Lacks the crackling wit and sparkling satire of Miss Austen's works, and focuses on a love between Heathcliff and Cathy (neither of whom can the reader relate to, for they are larger than life and their peculiarities are never explained)which is, of course, doomed. Lockwood is the only character whom we can possibly hope to understand, for he tells the reader about himself (he is the narrator, except when Mrs. Dean is telling the story to him) during the course of the story. Maybe it's just me, but I found it depressing. Now, I can cry over a realistic novel like Sounder or Bridge to Terabithia, but these dudes and dudettes (forgive the modern Yank term, I do that sometimes (&lt;:) are acting really stupidly for no apparant reason. Now, I understand that time period, and I understand love. But you must agree that there was no earthly reason for H. to marry Isabella. ?Ah, well.

I am a senior who had to read this for AP Lit, and I found it to be excellent. All of those people who claim it to be bad either are completely ignorant or uneducated (this is verified by their spelling and grammar in their reviews). If you have a choice to read this book or something else, read Wuthering Heights, because it will honestly change your outlook on so many things.

It doesn't matter how much time goes by, he will still love and remeber her. He is a total animal, but you will still love him."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I was having a very hard time with this book, as I found the characters to be unbelievably hideous and hateful. Only Heathcliff sparked my interest, as my heart went out to him as he was tortured by Catherine, who must be the meanest social-climbing b*tch in English literature. Finally, about halfway through, Cathy dies (thank God) and the book really takes off. I could not put the book down as Heathcliff returns to carry out his revenge, and destroys the lives of basically everyone. Heathcliff is a magnificent creation, with whom I have one small quibble: why does someone as astonishing as he fall in love with a vile conniving bit of skirt like Catherine?"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This was not an enjoyable book for me to read.

If I could I would have given this book 3.5/5 stars for the excellent use of language and talent for create a setting."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"It took me a few days to get over my initial distaste for the main characters, and this book in general, before writing a review. This book was not well received in its time and I understand why. Victorian England was not interested in perusing books with such irascible characters, as it didn't fall within their idea of how ladies and gentlemen of the period should behave. Heathcliff and Cathy are two people who are as twisted and tempestuous as the moors in which they live.Heathcliff is brought to live in Cathy Earnshaw's family as a small child by her father. He is greatly disliked by Earnshaw's son, Hindley, because he regards Heathcliff as an upsurper, and does all he can to torment the newcomer. Cathy takes Heathcliff on as her playmate and from that moment on the two are inseparable, running as wild and unchecked as the windy moors surrounding them. Heathcliff grows to love Cathy fiercely as he becomes a young man, but Cathy begins to take an interest in the quiet, refined way of life at Thrushcross Grange, the home of their wealthier, more respectable neighbors.Upon returning from an extended stay at Thrushcross Grange, Cathy is transformed from the wild, ill-mannered and incorrigible girl, to a seemingly calm and civilized young lady. She has caught the eye of her neighbor's young son Edgar and has designs to marry him. Cathy confides this to her servant, Nelly, who asks her if she does not care then for Heathcliff. Cathy expresses disdain for Heathcliff and remarks that she could never marry him. Unbeknownst to her, Heathcliff has heard this conversation and quits the house. Cathy continues to elaborate upon her feelings and reveals that though she finds Heathcliff coarse and unrefined, she loves him deeply to the extent of proclaiming herself to be Heathcliff. She cannot see herself ever separating from him because loving him is like loving herself--both are as one person. Nelly is exasperated with her talk and tells her that Heathcliff has overheard their conversation. Cathy panicks and stays up all night waiting for him to come home. He never returns and does not come back to Wuthering Heights for another 3 years.By then Cathy has married Edgar, but pines for Heathcliff. She is immensely happy with Edgar until Heathcliff comes back bent on revenge. He takes that revenge by running away with Edgar's younger sister. Despite the fact that both have hurt each other deeply, Heathcliff and Cathy continue to love one another with a dangerous, wild and destructive passion. That passion consumes and destroys everything around them and when Cathy finally succumbs to her end, Heathcliff continues his embittered path of hatred and destruction, revenging himself on his wife, his brother-in-law and their descendants.This was such a hard book to read because I internalized all the horrible feelings Cathy and Heathcliff exuded. I didn't like Heathcliff, I resented his love for Cathy. How is it that he can hate in such reckless abandon with the same heart that he uses to love Cathy and then treat her daughter with such contempt? How dare he profess to love when he hates and despises so cruelly. He has no compassion and, by God, I would have shot him if I was Cathy Linton.Emily Bronte wrote a book that breaks convention and draws comparisons between men and women, society, religion and class. It is superior to Charlotte's \\"Jane Eyre\\" and Anne's \\"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall\\" which though well written, are products of convention."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I should probably like this book more than i did, but every page felt like a labor.

Because who wouldn't like to see the nicely fitted, happy-endings of the Austen chick-flick genre of romance turned upon the issues and emotions of the real world, and with real world effect?Unfortunately, there are far more Heathcliffs out there than there are Mr. Darcys, and the sooner they are confronted, the more likely the Heathcliffs will be called to task.Thanks for the read, Ms. Bronte."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights by Emily BronteThis book is dark, despairing, passionate, and breathtaking from first page to last. This is a true classic. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This novel is far from what I expected.I had listened to many of my friends judge Cathy and Heathcliff very harshly, and I went into the book expecting to explore the evilness of human nature. Instead, I found that Bronte broke barriers by producing two very real characters.Cathy and Heathcliff's story explores the consequences to the character's decisions. Bronte does not gloss over the reasons for the decisions (money, greed, breeding, retaliation, etc), but those reasons play a minimal role. Instead, she chooses to show how a human reacts to a good/bad decision, and when life doesn't go his or her way.My suggestion for reading Wuthering Heights is to place yourself in Cathy and Heathcliff's shoes and figure out if there was another choice for their behavior."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"(Like the curmudgeonly CAT in the COMIC...get it?)Great old-style classic novel. One of Henry Miller's favorites; that's what attracted me to it.I liked the style of the narrative, largely told through the reminiscences of the housekeeper Nelly. This is one dysfunctional family!Like many novels from this period it's all about the interpersonal relationships; there isn't anything external happening to anyone here of any particular consequence. But the masterful storytelling and imaginings of the authoress really do make this a worthwhile and rewarding literary journey.Read it! Classics rule!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I have very mixed feelings about this book. While it's a beautiful book, and I will probably read it again, I could not stand the story! All of the characters are horrible people, in my opinion, and the only thing that kept me from throwing the book across the room was the last two chapters. If I had not had to read this for class, I would not have finished it at all - though I am certainly glad I did finish it.If you're looking to read the Classics, definitely do read this. Same goes for if you're looking to read a classic romance, or one of the Gothic classics. However, if you're looking for a \\"good\\" book, one that will leave you happy or going \\"aww,\\" you're at the wrong book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Okay, everyone has heard of this book so I probably don't need to give a review, but I will anyways.=) Some have seen the movie adaptations of this book as well so some already know the storyline and what this book is about.I absolutely loved this book. I couldn't stop reading until I reached the very end. I had seen both the 1939 and 1992 movie adaptations of this book so I already knew what happened, but the movies don't capture the essence and emotion of the story as well as the book can.Heathcliff is the gothic romance hero with traits that I think many romance writers use in their own heroes: brooding, mysterious, darkly handsome, and harsh (though of course, not so tortured and brutal). Cathy is gay-hearted and a wild beauty, but also selfish and manipulative in her behavior and actions. Both characters are so realistic in their human emotions and failings that you can't help but empathize with them and hope for that happily-ever-after you know will not occur (as the story is told in flashback so you already know their love was doomed). They are two people that are meant for the other, and each hold flaws and are not always the most likeable of characters.I found myself going through the \\"what-ifs\\" scenarios: What if Cathy hadn't spurned Heathcliff for the more wealthy and civilized Edgar? What if Heathcliff hadn't left to make his fortune to win Cathy? What if Heathcliff hadn't decided to seek vengenance and revenge on those who prevented their union?What made this book so tragic to me was the fact Cathy knew instinctly what she was doing (by accepting and marrying Edgar for position and wealth) was so wrong! She was going against herself by rejecting the fact that they were indeed soulmates and meant for each other. One half of a whole:\\"In my soul and in my heart, I'm convinced I'm wrong!\\"\\"I love him; and not that, not because he's handsome, Nelly, but because he's more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same; and Linton's is as different as a moonbeam from lightning, or frost from fire\\"\\"My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath--a source of little visible delight, but necessary. Nelly, I am Heathcliff! He's always, always in my mind--not as a pleasure, but as my own being\\"Despite her confessions of the heart, she goes through with her folly and dooms herself and Heathcliff and all those they encounter, and this passes on to the next generation. Her actions causes obssession and borderline madness in Heathcliff that continues long after Cathy dies. Even though he becomes so cruel and unlikeable in the second half of the book, I couldn't really hate him, knowing what he went through in the first half of the book. Although what he went through doesn't excuse his behavior and actions, you still understand the reasons behind them. You can hear the pain and anguish in his soul when he asks Cathy why she did what she did:\\"Why did you betray your own heart, Cathy?\\"\\"Because misery, and degradation, and death, and nothing that God or Satan could inflict would have parted us, you, of your own will, did it. I have not broken your heart--you have broken it; and in breaking it, you have broken mine.All in all, this book is dark, despairing, emotionally wrenching and passionate. Be warned, this book will make you cry."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is a true classic. No movie has ever done it justice. The parallel structure within the characters' genealogical table is phenomenal.Highly Recommended.James Conroyd Martin, Author of PUSH NOT THE RIVER and AGAINST A CRIMSON SKY Push Not the River"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This compelling story of hate has enthralled readers for generations with good reason. From the classic scene of Lookwood encountering Catherine Linton's ghost, I was hooked. Though the plot is not always fast-moving, it is strong and compelling. It is fun for readers to draw parallels between the two generations outlined in this novel. The atmosphere of the novel is one of mystery, set up early in the first few chapters. Though most of the characters are despicable in some way, hearing about their lives through Nelly's eyes is irresistible. The novel is littered with violence, and the \\"moral\\" of the story is unclear to the reader, as it possibly was to the author herself, yet it does make a few important points. Love is not everything, for example, is stressed from the moment that Catherine Earnshaw becomes a Linton. With vivid imagery and extremely psychological characters, Emily Bronte created a classic truly deserving of the title."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I thought Wuthering Heights was based on a great romance. That is how people had described it to me. I honestly don't understand what is so classic about this book. It was too dark and I couldn't enjoy it.I hated Heathcliff and Catherine. He was spiteful, miserable, and menacing. Of course this wasn't his fault. He had a tough upbringing and Catherine made it worse, by choosing to marry someone for convenience knowing that Heathcliff loved her and she loved him. Catherine was whiny, selfish, and spoiled. She was such a witch,I really hated her. I hated her more than Heathcliff. She married Edgar and had a happy marriage until Heathcliff re-appeared. It was all downhill after that.After a three year hiatus, Heathcliff decided to come back for Catherine. He made everybody lives miserable. I didn't understand this romance that existed between Heathcliff and Catherine. It just seemed like an obsession. I didn't understand the connection and what they saw in eachother.The only part of the book that I enjoyed was the romance that blossomed between Catherine's daughter, Cathy and her nephew, Hareton.I wouldn't recommend or read this book again."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"In \\"Wuthering Heights\\", Bronte subtlely presents to her Victorian audiences a condemning social commentary, and asks them to consider that the struggle between the good and the bad is not black and white. While Heathcliff seems the obvious steward of evil and badness in the novel, after careful introspection, the reader discovers that immorality and badness seep into the hearts of many other characters. Though perhaps not as insidious at the outset, most of the major characters experience a moral deficiency and by the completion of the novel, have acted in a way that makes the distinction between themselves and the clearly wicked Heathcliff more nebulous than before. Bronte startles the reader into the realization that regardless of conformity to Victorian social mores, each person nurtures a seed of immorality within themselves. Though there may be people who are excessive in their depravity, Bronte skillfully reminds us that an image of evil exists within everyone."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights is a classic novel from Charlotte Bronte and this unabridged audio recording is highly recommended to people who read the book and loved it and are interested in hearing the book being read. By the way, I strongly suspect that Anne, the previous reviewer who made the speed reading comment about this bookcassette audio recording from Brlliance Audio lisened to this recording without using the adapter or adjusting the balance on her balance control knob on her tape player. If listening to this on a walkman style tape player you need the adapter and you need to read the instructions before using it and if you are listening on a stereo or car tape deck with balance control knob then you need to follow the instructions on how to listen to it that way. If you follow the instructions you will find that the audio recording is good and sounds normal and not at all like the Chipmunks.

But I remember being let down by this book and the finishing with a sense of apathy towards the characters. Many people relate the theme and character interaciton in this book to the modern day soap opera, daytime talkshows or MTV reality shows and thus deaming the book to have some sort of everlasting social message. The problem is that for the most part all those things stink and always have so what are these comparisons saying about this book. Maybe there is a reason why everyone read's this in high school....becuase it is the only age that can appreciate it.Clearly Im not in the norm as most people disagree with me but if you are looking to get into a \\"classic\\" there are much better books you can turn to."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I am absolutly stunned. Why do I like this book so much? How did I manage to finish it? I am a 21 year old man living in a modern city and I somehow related to this book. I have nothing in common with the characters or the author or the story or the setting. I had to read this book for college but dropped out before reading it. Several months later I picked it up and gave it a try. I'm not sorry I did. Thinking about it now I start to realize what is so good about the book: it's author's compassion for humanity. All characters in this novel suffer a great deal (partly because of their own stubbornness) but retain their essential humanity: they still need to be loved. And while reading it you can feel the author's longing to be loved herself. So this is what made me read through the book: it speaks directly to your heart in a way you can not ignore."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I'm very partial to the novel itself, but this treatment of it in the Norton Critical Editions leaves much to be desired.1. One big advantage of the Norton Critical Editions is that they have footnotes. This one, however, is extremely sparing of its footnotes, only giving one every fifty pages or so -- and that's usually to clarify a Biblical allusion. You're supposed to know a lot of other things, such as that \\"bairn\\" is Scottish dialect for \\"small child.\\" Terms like that pass by unremarked on, so don't think this version is going to help clarify all those dialect words you've been wondering about.2. The font is small and uncomfortable to read.3. The essays in the back, the other reason to buy a Norton Critical Edition, are somewhat absurd. Part of the mystery of \\"Wuthering Heights\\" is that its author seemed to have zilch for sources: the whole composition seems to have sprung whole from her fertile mind. So what do they do? Print her juvenalia poems, her sisters' writings, etc. Not much that will actually help you achieve a deeper understanding of the text.The only advantage I can cite of this edition is that the footnotes (praise Heaven!) translate the ramblings of that screwball Joseph into plain, readable English.Boy, do they ever need to come out with one of these for \\"Wuthering Heights\\":The Annotated Pride and Prejudice"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is an amazingly dark and twisted romance novel containing the most repulsive characters you'll ever meet in all of Bronte fiction. . . . And I absolutely LOVE it! The Bronte sisters seem to have had real talent when it came to dark fiction romance and are quickly becoming my romodels in the genre.The story is about love -- but above everything else, it is about revenge. Heathcliff's revenge to be precise. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's start at the beginning, shall we?::SPOILERS::::LOCKWOOD:: Lockwood is, well . . . a bit of an idiot. He's the sort of idiot who's exceedingly cheerful and can not strain past his own nose to see that his company is unwanted. He is new in the neighborhood and has moved into Thrushcross Grange, an estate not far down the road from Wuthering Heights. His landlord is the master of Wuthering Heights, a sour, grumpy, very cross man named Heathcliff.Lockwood presses his company upon his grumpy landlord and is introduced to a number of startlingly unpleasant people. When a snowstorm settles in on the Heights, Lockwood is forced to remain among his grumpy hosts, whose sour dispositions are so frightening the tension in the air could be cut with a knife. Lockwood can not understand why everyone is so cross, snappish,and rude, and attempts to make several weak jokes at supper that fall into a miserable silence on his part.When everyone present refuses disdainfully to accompany him home, Lockwood wanders home himself and comes down with a bad headcold. At Thrushcross Grange, he enquires after his landlord and his sour company. His maid, a woman named Ellen Dean, is more than happy to tell Lockwood the unpleasant tell of love, revenge, and death. This is how the narration of the storyof Wuthering Heights really begins.::HEATHCLIFF:: I absolutely love Heathcliff. He is the dark villian but also the sad hero of our tale. No one knows precisely where Heathcliff came from. He was found by Mr. Earnshaw, the man who owned Wuthering Heights and happened to have two children already of his own. Mr. Earnshaw took the dark \\"gyspy\\" orphan Heathcliff home to Wuthering Heights and favored him so much that his son, Hindley Earnshaw, was roused often to violent jealousy and set out to make Heathcliff's life a living hell.Mr. Earnshaw's daughter on the other hand, a wild pretty girl named Catherine, found in Heathcliff the playmate and soulmate she didn't know she'd been waiting for. The children ran wild together on the moors and were as close as if they'd grown together in the womb. Both had short tempers and wild dispositions and were nasty, unpleasant people to cross.Heathcliff was very in love with Catherine, and she with him. But when the two of them grew up, Catherine decided that she could not marry Heathcliff: his station was too low. Therefore, the stuck-up girl reasoned that the best thing for her to do was to marry Edgar Linton (the young man who happened to own Thrushcross Grange just down the road) and by this young man'sriches so help Heathcliff rise on the social ladder.Heathcliff was so stung by this rejection that he disappeared into a storm one night and did not return for many years, at which time he exacted his revenge against Catherine and her overbaring elder brother, Hindley.Yet not only does Heathcliff later in life mistreat his decieved wife (he throws a knife at her face, I believe), but he also treats his son, Linton Heathcliff, with open scorn and distaste. For Linton has none of his father's looks, but his uncle Edgar's instead, and is very sickly and poor.Meanwhile, Heathcliff is so tortured by Catherine's departure that he thinks he sees her everywhere. He even returns to her grave and attempts to dig her body up with the intention ofholding her close again but decides that he will defy everyone and be buried beside her. Thus, the rest of his life is spent exacting his revenge on those who harmed him and their children.::EDGAR LINTON:: Tall, blonde, effeminate Edgar is as weakminded a fellow as can have been invented. He knows full and well that Catherine Earnshaw is in love with Heathcliff, that she brags about how wonderful Heathcliff is, that she stood outside in the storm all night when Heathcliff disappeared and called his name -- but Edgar Linton wants her anyway. It's like he's dying to be used and abused. And moments after Catherine has flown into an appalling rage and even proceeded to beat him violently about the head with her fists --Edgar asks her to marry him and she accepts. Oi.::CATHERINE EARNSHAW/LINTON:: There's only one way to explain the tantrums and absurd pleas for attention -- Catherine Earnshaw is an obnoxious brat. She drove her father to drink as a child and frequently commanded her way with tantrums that followed her straight on to womanhood.When Heathcliff returned from his travels to visit her, she bragged tactlessly of her love for him to her husband and even proceeded to go on long walks with Heathcliff alone. When Edgar finally got the guts to banish Heathcliff from Thrushcross Grange, Catherine flew into a rage and deliberately made herself ill. But her true love for Heathcliff was confirmed at last when the lovers held each other prior to her death and wept miserably cheek against cheek. Such a tender love scene I've never known until I read Wuthering Heights. I don't think even Jane Eyre compares.Catherine was angry that Heathcliff had married her brother's sister (Isabella Linton) just to get her back for marrying Edgar, and Heathcliff was angry that Catherine chose Edgar over himself. But they forgave each other just before Catherine died and Heathcliff was ever after half a man without her.::ISABELLA LINTON:: This girl is as much a fool as her absurd and abuse-loving elder brother. She falls headover heels in love with Heathcliff without the slightest encouragement on the latter's part and \\"provokes\\" her future husband with fond looks and sighs. Heathcliff, seeing opportunity for sweet revenge, leaps on it and has soon run off with Isabella and married her with the intention of horrifying Edgar (whom he, needlessly to say, hates with a passion) and his lover Catherine.Like most fools, Isabella Linton gets exactly what she deserves. She is treated very poorly by her husband, who curses at her and calls her by unkind names, and laughs with scorn in her face as he watches her realize he is not the \\"gallant\\" and \\"noble\\" creature she had imagined. Isabella soon learns that handsome men are not always kind and finally stands up for herself. Her sharp tongue is rewarded with a knife in the face, and she flees Wuthering Heights, the unhappy home of many by now.::HINDLEY EARNSHAW:: Hindley, of course, lives to see adulthood and even marries. His wife, however, dies giving birth to their son, Hareton. Hindley falls into a miserable state and begins to drink heavily -- so heavily that on one occasion he nearly kills his son by accidentally dropping him from an upstairs banister. He is still a dismal drunkard when Heathcliff returns to Wuthering Heights intent on revenge. With Heathcliff returned, Hindley (like most of the people kin to him) loses his mind and paces every night with the intention of shooting Heathcliff dead in his sleep. For Heathcliff has taken advantage of Hindley's drunkeness and has won over the whole of Wuthering Heights in several card games.The doctor of revenge has checked in!I've never been so astonished, so happy, so moved by any story than by Wuthering Heights -- and I've read some good books!This is an awesome novel full of romance and despair, and I recogmend it to anyone who could sit through my bantering and actually read my review! Enter the dark recesses of Heathcliff's mind and see what it's like to be the devil!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I have read this book at least three times. It seems to get better every time I read it. I read it for the first time in 8th grade. The novel is about a dark romance. I love the way Cathy's and Heathcliff's relationship is portrayed. They have a love that can never be because of Cathy's stubborn pride. There is a lot of suffering for all of the characters, but the book does end on a happy note. I highly recommend that everyone read this book at some point in their life."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a classic only in the sense that it was written in the 19th century. But it is a compelling story w/ dark, violent passions, and emotions of love and hate. Heathcliff's only goal in life is to seek revenge on anyone associated w/ the Earnshaws and Lintons. His love for Catherine is evident, but his hate is chillingly cruel and violent that touches everyone between the two estates. Only when he is w/ Catherine is he pacified. Catherine is torn between her true love Heathcliff, and her duties to marry someone of her station in life. But she doesn't understand her love and emotions for Heathcliff. (Which makes me believe she's too childish, spoiled, and bratty to handle her emotions rationally or she's a manic depressive). It's a dark passionate story that is compelling to read. Unfortunately it's also hard to follow in the third person narrators. The long winded descriptions makes the book drag (which explains the 300 pages). And what in heaven's name is Joseph saying? Are most uneducated people of countryside England so hard to understand? This book isn't for the light reader. If you want something easier and more light hearted, go for Charlotte Br&ouml;nte's &quot;Jane Eyre.&quot; Or books by Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bront happens to be one of the three famous Bront sisters and also the middle of them. She had led a dark life without parents but managed to get by with her siblings and each made it to literature fame in different paths. With \\"Wuthering Heights\\", Emily Bront had created a shocking romance that's been unimaginable and has been read for around 165 years.In 1760, we are taken to the title farm and meet a poor gypsy boy from the streets and is taken by a farmer named Earnshaw of the place and then makes him a part of his family and renaming him Heathcliff and while trying to be use to his new life. While his new family is uncomfortable with a poor boy in the family and mostly with his stepbrother Hindley he begins a relationship with the farmer's daughter, Catherine which goes off good. Some years later, Earnshaw and his wife are dead and Hindley is now married and plans to take over the authority of the family while Heathcliff and Catherine's relationship continues to grow. But as they grow into their adult years, more troubles fall into their lives and their romance is left in a tragic bind and will leave both of them in darkness.It's no Hamlet, Jane Eyre or even Romeo and Juliet. It's a novel completely in it's own creativity. The story takes many twists and turns that you'll probably find yourself lost in. The characters are very vivid and lifelike and the plot is so surprising and will shock anyone. It's a shame Anne Bront only wrote one novel, since we would've able to see what other novels she would create. But \\"Wuthering Heights\\" will always be a novel that will show a truly tragic tale of romance."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I read this book mainly because it was talked about a lot in Eclipse. I was shocked by how dark and Gothic it was. I can't imagine what people must have thought when it was published. If I could pick two words to describe Wuthering Heights it would be \\"passionate\\" and \\"bizarre.\\" I've never read anything like it. I knew as I was reading it that I wasn't supposed to like Cathy. She has a passionate temper that was very unlikeable and yet I couldn't hate her. In fact, I related to her in a lot of strange ways. I kind of agree with Edward Cullen's assessment of the book that it's not a love story but a hate story. The ending was what made me like this book. A lot of the characters are run madly by their passions and I thought for sure the ending would be nothing but a disaster. I was pleasantly surprised to be wrong. If Eclipse has made you curious as to what happens in this book, give it a try. You might actually like it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Re-reading this novel after 20 years I am still struck by its primal power, as if it erupted from the depths of Emily Bronte's soul and devoured its creator in its wake. This is the anti-Jane Austen novel. It is even the anti-Charlotte Bronte novel. Charlotte flirts with the darkness while Emily jumps into its chasm. The bond between Cathy and Heathcliff is forged in Earth, Heaven and Hell and cannot be sundered by all the efforts of humans or their institutions.Although never stated in the novel, the implication that Heathcliff is a bastard son of Mr. Earnshaw and, therefore, Cathy's half-brother has been hinted at more explicitly in at least one film adaptation of the novel. Even if such a thought entered Emily Bronte's mind, she was straining the limits of decorum and literary taste even without another scandalous level of meaning. She wisely omitted such a possibility. The Heathcliff/Cathy bond is so powerful that it frightens even the family that first witnesses it. Heathcliff's obsession is akin to Ahab's for Moby-Dick, created just four years or so later. Love/Hate are merged into one emotion that transcends boundaries of Good and Evil and this force runs roughshod and heedlessly destroys all the victims that happen to stand in its way.Like her doomed heroine Cathy, Emily Bronte died at a very early age, within one year of the novel's publication. One wonders what kind of follow-up novel she might have written had she lived. Would she have reigned in the primal inspiration and tailored her creations to suit the prevailing customs of her society? It is futile to speculate. The early death of the creator is perfectly matched to the dooms of the creator's characters and the one-of-a-kind quality of this wild novel.Although the novel bears a sophistication and complexity of narrative structure, especially for a first time novelist, there are certain weaknesses. The dialect dialogue of Joseph is a hindrance and absurdly out of place alongside that of other characters who speak without so many apostrophes. Later schools of realism might cast aspersion on the florid language of relatively uneducated characters. The power shines through the weaknesses, however, and this is a unique novel. There are echoes of it in later novels but few, if any, other contemporary novels exhibited such boldness of subject and structure."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights may be my all-time favorite novel. Heathcliff and Cathy's relationship resists - or defies? - categorization. It's as elemental and everlasting as the moors themselves. Love isn't a sweet confection in this book and is the all the more appealing for that reason."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Love is very painful and it is full of lust, want, and the things that made you go standing up in the morning when your mother introduced you to your future husband. It is very French, and it said, everything under the bright burning sun causes more money than you can shake a stick at. And it creates even more chaos than you wish for, still, no fond memory there. All said and done was a walk together in the grave undisturbed. Just once. It made an example of all those who loved must suffer a loss of conscience, and all that sweets and whatever the people who works must be driving all the tenants of Wuthering Heights into a crack wooden planck of a ship that is full of water 3 inches deep. When they do decide to take a chance on life, and fall for love, it does not catch them, but leads them into the most unromantic ideals of commitment ever. To be in faith with their long lost friend full from the beginning, end, and with no lacking in the middle. How was it possible, but that these people have no contacts with the outside world of travels to the continents, and little words such on this and this day, does not suffice. It is said lover takes in the shape of all form and shape, but it takes generations to heal a broken promise and mend the wounds. [Please, to have breath for a day, and to let escaped chances slip buy once again means that whatever your parents have gone through was not as romantic as you would imagined it. That seems to be the central message, beside peering through the soul.]"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This should be the \\"Book of the Year\\" for every year from 1847 to today - 154 years worth!

And yes it is rather bleak, but powerful nonetheless. The love of Catherine and Heathcliff transcends all concepts of earthly love and their deep soulful connection is rather more of a curse than a blessing for them.People either love this book or hate it, but don't pass judgement until you read it on your own.

I have notice though, that their stories have the common denominator of detailing the ugliest side of humanity. Whether it is unconquerable cruelty or the amount of abuse it takes to break a naturally good spirit and turn it black with bitterness and spite, both Bronte stories that I have read dwell solely on the darkest aspects of life. The only silver lining in this story is that eventually perhaps, after enough suffering, fate will turn your hand. Eventually. Maybe.If that is your thing, you will appreciate and perhaps enjoy this book. As for myself, I prefer books that vary in sentiment. Sometimes happy, sometimes sad, sometimes crazy, etc."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a different type of story. It follows the developments of two generations of families and the family dynamics within from the point of an outsider being told the story. It almost reads like a family history if not for the love story thrown in. For the time period, the portrayal of certain scenes was quite graphic, and it's interesting to try to gain that perspective from our current time period, where violence and sex are pretty much societal norms.A great book!

This is a well written love story and is about how tangled up love can become when you are denied to follow your heart. It's a sad tale but I enjoyed every minute of reading it.

The depth of the characters and their interactions heightened my senses. Bronte's words were so descriptive they inspired me to continue on my journey through rereads."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"That's how I would describe this novel. I first read it when I was 15 and hated it. I couldn't understand what the appeal was about these savage, ruthless, selfish characters. I was obsessed with Jane Eyre, but Wuthering Heights seemed a distant, incomphrehensible world. But now, nearly 20 years later, I have a better appreciation of it. It really is worth reading - just persevere through the first 50 pages or so, and you'll be sucked in.I haven't seen the Laurence Olivier film, but am curious now to see how this bleak and twisted world is portrayed on screen."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is not the creepiest classic in existance, but it is delightfully morbid, what with insane make-out sessions with corpses, and still has a beautiful ending and a bit of happiness in the last chapter. However, I have heard so many people call it boring or difficult to read that I have become apalled and have lost hope for the future of the human race.The characters of Wuthering Heights are the element of the book most frequently attacked. But Heathcliff is NOT evil!! How would anyone feel, never wanted by anyone in their entire life but one woman, and then to be cast off by that same woman? How would anyone feel in his shoes? He is a git and he is a dreadful person, but he is a complex and layered character, deeply troubled and very well written. As for everybody else, not a one is really likeable, but not a one is evil. They are only what they world has made them, Cathy the younger spoiled and Hindley abused. And if you still don't like them? Well, take comfort that most of them die.My second point is that this book is NOT hard to read. The gamekeeper's dialogue is, granted, impossible. But he hardly talks anyway. Also, the family tree is equally difficult, but it helps to draw your own as you go along. However, other than that the text is simple and the plot-line straightforward. The beauty is in the descriptions.This is a love story of epic proportions. It doesn't illustrate the beauty of love until the end, but also incorporated is platonic love of family and friends. Yet nevertheless, love triumphs upon the finale, and it does truly tell of true love. True love isn't perfect, but it is, in essence, everlasting. And this book tells of nothing if not everlasting love: \\"Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same.\\" - Catherine Linton (once Catherine Earnshaw), relating to Heathcliff."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"What a Morose book this is! This is the first book that I have read by the Bronte sisters. I was really looking forward to it. It begins with the story of Mr. Lockwood entering the house of Heathcliff (Wuthering Heights) and the reader finding out that the people inhabiting the house are just nasty. This includes Heathcliff, Hareton and Catherine (the younger).Some have indicated that this is a love story. I am not so sure of that. It is clear in the story that Heathcliff was in love with Catherine (the elder) and was deeply hurt when she married Edgar. He goes off for three years and returns with money. However, where and how he got his money is never explained in the story.Now that he has returned, it is Heathcliff's intention to get revenge on those that he believed have wronged him. This includes Hindley, Catherine's brother, Edgar, Hareton, Linton (his own son) and Isabella. If he cannot get his revenge on those that wronged him, he will get it on the children of those that wronged him such as Hareton and Catherine (the younger).Shortly after he returns, Catherine (the elder) dies but not before giving birth to her and Edgar's dauther Catherine. By this time though, Heathcliff has married Isabella, Edgar's sister. Heathcliff wants to get his hands on Thrushcross Grange since this is the home of Edgar and Catherine. On the day after he is married to Isabella, he basically tells her that he married her to get possession of Thrushcross Grange.It is at this point that I realized that Heathcliff was an evil person. It is also at this point that I no longer considered the novel to be a love story. Heathcliff's love has now been turned into hatred. He has one thing on this mind and that is to make those around him miserable.When he returns to Wuthering Heights, Hindley is a drunk and an gambler. Hindley's son Hareton will inherit Wuthering Heights but Heathcliff gives money to Hindley and now becomes the mortgagor of the property so that when Hindley dies Heathcliff becomes the owner of Wuthering Heights.If Edgar dies without Catherine being married she will inherit Thrushcross Grange. When Edgar gets a letter from his sister, Isabella (remember that is Heathcliff's wife) that she is dying and wants him to take care of her son, Linton (Heathcliff's son too), he goes and gets him from near London. On the night of their return, Heathcliff sends Joseph to get him. The next day Linton leaves to live a Wuthering Heights. Given his condition, he gets Linton to correspond with Catherine but since Nelly and Edgar are standing in the way of their marriage, he forces Catherine to marry Linton. Therefore, when Edgar dies Thrushcross Grange becomes the property of Linton. Linton, being sickly through the whole bood, soon dies and wills the Thrushcross Grange to Heathcliff. At this time, Catherine, Hareton, and Heathcliff are all living at Wuthering Heights and he rents Thrushcross Grange to Mr. Lockwood.At the time Catherine (the elder) dies, Heathcliff asks that her ghost haunt him. In the last couple of chapters, it appears that Heathcliff continually sees Catherine's ghost. Heathcliff fails to eat and eventually dies. At that time, Hareton and Catherine are falling in love, which is the only happy part in the book (other than Heathcliff dying).All in all, this is a very dark story. This is a story of love (at first) and then hatred. This is a story of how hatred can destroy a person as well as those around him. It is a good story but I don't consider this a love story. Heathcliff is an evil person that never changes his ways of making other miserable. He enjoys making other miserable. I liked the book but it is just a little too dark for me to give it a five star rating."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I was recommended this book under the theme of Love and Romance but its so not Love....hate or greed would better describe it.This book is beautifully written however,among the best I've read. It flows. Too bad that Emily Bronte only lived to write one masterpiece. This book has been on my mind for quite some time after reading it.If you like good drama...this is the book for you...love, hate, obsession,abuse,marriage,separation, death,.....yes...this is DRAMA. I loved it.Some points I wanted to stop because it was evoking too much emotions but the suspence was too much. Its that good."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I had to read this book as a part of a literature class I took. When informed of my assignment, I was neither enthused or diappointed. I am always interested in reading something new, however I was unfamiliar with Wuthering Heights and did not know what to expect. I started reading it and by the third chapter, I was hooked. This book it probably the most painfully romantic novel ever. Unfortunately, the emotions this book arouses are unable to be put into words. Like a previous reviewer said, this book \\"has a certain something.\\" That it does."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is the sad tale of thwarted love between two soulmates destined to be apart. Cathy and Heathcliff were one in being, but two in person and this was a torture neither got over.It's bitter sweet and painful to read at some points, but the love of Hareton and Catherine in the end makes one wonder if THEY were the ones destined for happiness, not Cathy and Heathcliff."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"There is a thin line between love and hate, and once Heathcliff crosses it, we see a grand, passionate and absorbingly interesting man turn into a fearsome thug. Thwarted in his love for his childhood soulmate, Catherine Earnshaw, Heathcliff turns his devastation outward, becoming a hateful -- and hated -- person all across the bleak moors that surround his Yorkshire village.Heathcliff courts and marries the sister of the man whom Catherine chose over Heathcliff, only to torture her emotionally as a way of getting even with her brother. Meanwhile, Catherine slowly wastes away pining for Heathcliff, for although she once rejected him, she eventually realizes that she has made an irredeemable error and can never be happy. Heathcliff sums up the tragedy of their lives in a single question near the end of the novel when he asks, \\"Why did you betray your heart, Cathy?\\"Sound depressing? It's not. Wuthering Heights is a grand and glorious novel that dramatically illustrates the power of love, for good and ill. But more importantly, it teaches us that the only path to happiness is to be true to one's heart, rather than one's head. Had Catherine honored her bond with Heathcliff and refused to bow to the social mores of her day, not only would the two of them been much happier, but all of the many people whose lives they stumbled into would have been much better off.Another reviewer said that those of us who love this novel probably have a strong identification with one of the characters, and for me that is quite true. That's the reason for reading a classic like Wuthering Heights, because when it speaks to you in the clear and true way that Bronte does, you know that you are not alone, and that some things transcend time and place.Think about it -- a prim, Victorian preacher's daughter living on the moors of England before there was electricity can reach across 150 years of time and speak to the heart of a wired American in the 21st century. Pretty amazing, and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"WUTHERING HEIGHTS was the most amazing book I have ever read. It's characters are so unique and unlike any displayed in any other novels. The characters are so realistic; so flawed, so horrible, yet able to be sympatized with by the reader. They leave us wondering why they take the actions they take while still making us feel emotion for even Heathcliff, the cruel revenge-seeker who spends many years divising a plan to ruin the lives of the people whom he hates. Emily Bronte is a genius and her book should not be insulted just because certain readers can not appreciate the beauty of this intense story of love and revenge."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"If you've always wanted to read one of the great works of literature, but was intimidated by the lengthy volumes, long-winded sentences and complicated language, then you may want to direct your attention toward \\"Wuthering Heights\\". Perhaps the most famous novel penned by one of the three Bronte sisters (though Charlotte Bronte comes a very close second with \\"Jane Eyre\\"), \\"Wuthering Heights\\" is reasonably easy to read, with straightforward narrative, fluid pace and of slim length. Though the content will definitely not appeal to everyone, it is an approachable novel in terms of readability.The story is predominately a love story, though a love story that is haunted by revenge, jealously, hate, greed and death; all the juicy stuff that people are magnetically drawn to. Heathcliff is a young foundling boy, brought to Wuthering Heights by his foster-father Mr Earnslaw. Mr Earnslaw indulges the small boy, but his wife and his eldest son Hindley are repulsed by the half-wild creature and treat him no better than an animal, though they are held back by Mr Earnslaw's influence. But it is in Cathy that Heathcliff finds his soul mate, and the children spend hours together, roaming the wilderness like gypsies, utterly inseparable. But the two are not angels: masters at manipulation and conniving, Cathy and Heathcliff are experts at shaping their household to suit their own tastes with total disregard to anyone beyond themselves; Cathy in particular delights in tormenting her father by doing \\"just what he hated most, showing how her pretended insolence, which he thought real, had more power over Heathcliff than his kindness: how the boy would do her bidding in anything, and his only when it suited his inclination.\\"But when Mr Earnslaw dies, the disgruntled Hindley returns to Wuthering Heights and immediately relegates Heathcliff to the servants-quarters. From here stems the rivalry and hatred that marks the central tragedy of the book, as Heathcliff and the two predominant families of the area: the Earnslaws and the Lintons, fight amongst each other in a bitter feud for power, love, the land and the estate, in a struggle that continues down into the next generation. Each individual seems to achieve a sense of power and control over others briefly, only to loose it again via a marriage or death, and the plot twists and turns though many intrigues and mysteries.It is Heathcliff in the centre of this storm, determined to avenge himself against those who have wronged him: \\"I don\`t care how long I wait, if I can only do it at last\\", and though he is the main character of the book, he is certainly best described as an \\"anti-hero\\", and many new readers are somewhat taken back with the idea that he is the central figure. In one shocking moment, he saves the life of his enemy's son - almost accidentally - and immediately regrets taking such action. He's an enigma that's for certain, as he has no last name and nothing is known of his past before he's brought to Wuthering Heights; his personality is unintentionally captured in the name his foster family bestow on him, reflecting the wild atmosphere of the setting: \`heath' and \`cliff'. Heathcliff and Catherine are a \\"heathen pair\\" as the narrative would say, and the reader is not expected to like or admire them; but as characters they are utterly fascinating and one can't help but envy the extraordinary bond between them.In terms of the narration, \\"Wuthering Heights\\" is indeed unique. Not told by an omnipotent third-person voice, the tale is told to a new tenant at Thrushcross Grange - Mr Lockwood - by the former housekeeper at Wuthering Heights, Mrs Dean. This makes the levels of storytelling quite complex, for at some points (for example) we are hearing Catherine's testimony, as told to Mrs Dean, as she narrates to Mr Lockwood, who then records it for the audience. Anyone's whose played Chinese Whispers will know that stories change in the passing on from one person to each other, and the reader is challenged to untangle the gossip of Mrs Dean and the blandness of Mr Lockwood's records to uncover the true passion of the lives involved. It is a challenge you should relish.In terms of genre, \\"Wuthering Heights\\" can almost be considered the \\"poster-child\\" of Gothic literature, as almost every component of it caters to the \\"dark and stormy night\\" mentality of the Gothic style and narration; from vivid nightmares to the rugged landscape to the almost insane desires and fears of its characters, this novel is the very definition of \\"Gothic\\". Whenever you're in the mood for a dose of the twisted and heavy tones of the Gothic, then you should definitely have \\"Wuthering Heights\\" at hand. The critic Richard Chase says it best when he says Bronte was inspired by: \\"the sheer romantic exhilaration of escape from culture itself, into a world where nature is dire, terrible and beautiful, where human values are personal, alien and renunciatory, and where contradictions are to be resolved only by death...\\" No other critical quote I've read better describes the sheer melodrama of \\"Wuthering Heights\\" than this.Ultimately, the book is about opposites and extremes, and the very fine line that exists between them; between light and dark, man and woman, humanity and animalism, the wild and civilisation, and love which exists to both heal and destroy people. In gentle comparison to Heathcliff's soul-consuming love that prays Catherine's ghost will return to haunt him, is Catherine's quiet but absolute declaration that: \\"whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same\\".Wow. I love this book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is one of the best novels I have evr read. The passions of which were intwined within the characters' was described so deeply that I could feel the pain so strongly as if I were the character myself.When Catherine and Heathcliff were blaming each other for breaking each other's hearts, I cried hysterrically. The love and friendship between the couple was so intimately written that you could feel the different melodies of their ongoing reasonings. Cathy accused Heathlcliff of murdering her, for having wanted her to choose between himself and Edgar. Cathy told Heathcliff that she did not care how he wold suffer without her for he broke her heart in such a way, that he did not even care for her sufferings. Heathcliff fired back exclaming that instead Cathy had killed herself for vowing to be with Edgar. He also said that forgetting Cathy would be forgetting his very existence. \\" I love my murderer, but yours, how can I?\\" This would have to be one of my fvorite quotes from the novel. Even thought that line is so short, it means so much. This line revealed the intensity of his feelings torwards Cathy; that it hurt him so much to see her in such a state of illness and emotional sufferings, felt for him.I hate to say it, but what made this story so interesting was the evil doings accomplished by Heathcliff. The vigorating acts such as the enforcing of the marriage of Cathy and Linton was thought out by Heathcliff so cleverly, that it amused me, in it's own devilish way.This novel touched emotions of passion, love and hate that it made me think deeper about the \\"inside\\" of a relationship between a man and a woman."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte sure knows how to write about destructive love! I thought both Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff the stupidest people ever! I could hardly understand Joseph's tongue...perhaps because my language is too polished:)Ok, maybe I'm being too harsh. Wuthering Heights really isn't that bad. I actually understood it (for a thirteen year old, you've gotta give me credit)It was written nicely as Ellen {Nellie} Dean for the orator of Heathcliff's complete past. Catherine is pretty stupid though. And Heathcliff stupider for not trying to convince her to marry him BEFORE she married Linton. But I felt pretty sorry for Heathcliff when he called for Catherine the night that Lockwood spent the night. My favorite character was Hareton because i loved his speech! It was funny when almost every time he spoke, he sweared. I have to say that I hated Linton for being such a weakling, even though he could hardly help it. Despite Heathcliff's trickery with Isabel and hatred for Cathy, I couldn't help liking him a teeny bit, because he's just so unique! I really wanted Hareton and Cathy to make the match, and i positively despised Heathcliff and Linton for making him look so stupid. And i just loved Hareton's &quot;thundercloud&quot; face! Go ahead and read Wuthering Heights. You'll probably both hate and love it. It was a rather exciting and tiresome novel. Then again, I may be to young to criticize this &quot;great classic&quot; novel :)"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is tale of deceit an forbidden passion.

The reader finds him/herself loathing each and every one of them. The only non-loathsome character is the doctor, and he's minor to the extreme. Heathcliff is of course abominable. Edgar Linton is appallingly stupid. Hareton Earnshaw is animalistic, but at least he's got the excuse of Heathcliff's abuse. Catherine Linton (the elder) is absolutely disgusting, easily and by far the most evil character in the novel, surpassing even Heathcliff. Even Nelly Dean is a waste of humanity. If it were not for her constantly making a hash of her meddling, none of the tragedy would have occurred to such a great extent. Whether her meddling is malicious or just through sheer stupidity is immaterial; she remains an awful character.That said, the story is absolutely riveting. Emily Bronte's one substantive work is truly a masterpiece. Her descriptions of the moors are wonderfully evocative, but it is her characters who are her main triumph. Despite the sheer horridness or stupidity or weakness of her characters, she nevertheless makes each of them - and their motivations - utterly believable. Even Heathcliff's excesses are believable, and the elder Catherine's petty maliciousness is also totally in tune with the selfish nature she is depicted as having. The younger Catherine Linton's stupidity is easily accounted for by her protected childhood and Nelly's inexcusable lapses. Everyone has a perfectly plausible reason for doing what they do, given the natures given them by Bronte. Is it then their fault that their actions create such misery?The only flaw with this book is the ending. One character has triumped utterly, and then inexplicably collapses with hardly a struggle. Another character overcomes a strong antipathy to a further character and changes attitudes utterly. Unlike the rest of the novel, the motivation is not believable. It is inconceivable that such a complete adjustment could have happened in so short a time. Perhaps it is true that the novel has come full circle, but I can't help but think that its grip on the reader would be still the stronger if it left us with the vision of the horror which appeared to be the future for its well-deserving characters."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book is a classic!

That is Heathcliff's main goal in WUTHERING HEIGHTS. Despite his love for beloved Cathy, Heathcliff wants a desperate revenge upon her family. After all, it was her family who supposedly ruined his life.Personally, this was a book much closer to real life than would be preferred. The main goal of a book is to transport you into another time, place, or dimension--a life beyond your own. However, this classic by Emily Bronte manages to bring to mind one's own everyday troubles. The writing is technically superb, but the story could be better. However, after more than a century of being a noted classic, the opinion isn't likely to change."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I am another one of the huge group of students who had to read this book for a Literature class, but unlike many, I loved it!

If you like to read then you will like this book!!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"As a high school student, I had a hard time relating to the book until I really looked into it. It's incredible story, that of Heathcliff and Catherine. It's amazint to me that their love transcends everything...even death. You don't see love in that sense today...to die for love. I thought the representation was terrific...the Grange being a wonderful colorful place...and Wuthering Heights remaining a desolate wasteland. The end, although depressing, followed the novel well. An excellent tale of love and suffering."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I loved this book.. It's beautifully written and well composed. A novel of passion, deceit, and forgiveness..

The characters were so enchanting, yet so real, I felt as though I could reach out and touch them. This book will capture your heart and never let you go until the end. I have to admit; however, that it was a little dark and depressing. I preferred Jane Eyre, which has, in my mind, a happier ending. But, read for yourself and decide. It's the best!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a tragic tale of lost love, rage between men, and the sorrow caused by broken hearts. Its author, Emily Bronte, led a reclusive and private life, much of which is revealed through the events and characters of the novel. I feel that it rightly belongs among the great novels of British Literature, due to the controversy and interest it caused upon its publication."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I had to read this book for my high school English class. Although I took the easy way out and read the &quot;Cliffs Notes&quot;, I found them absolutely enchanting. I later took time to read the book for myself. Bronte uses such magical words and compellingly tragic sentences to blend this book into a masterpiece of Victorian Literature. Through Heathcliff and Catherine she proves that hate, no matter how strong, will always be defeated by love in the end."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The best the millennium has to offer as the greatest tale of star crossed lovers. Also includes my favorite literary character, the tortured, sardonic, passionate, dastardly, impossible-to-imitate Heathcliff. The relationship between him and Catherine, who is herself a pretty unusual tragic heroine in that she is a selfish, bitchy girl with little to redeem her, is one that still grabs my guts after reading it so many times. I can see people getting confused at the beginning with Mr Lockwood/Nelly/Mrs Heathcliff, all that, but come on everybody, are we all too lazy in the 20th century to read a page twice if we don't understand? You'll get to the good stuff."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"As a high school junior, i was skeptical of reading an old book by an even older writer. I thought that it would be as dry and bland as all the other books presented to me in class. What 15 year old would look at a book called &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; and presume that inside it was every emotion and feeling that someone could ever experience? Now, as a senior, I have re-read it several times over. It has become a part of my permanent literary collection and a part of me. The words and emotions of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; have taken over my soul. As cruel and painful as some of the emotions of the book may be, I need them.

This is a story about Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff and the strange love that they share. Their love changes in many ways, taking many different forms, from anger, to happiness, to violence. Their love changes because of people who come in and out of both of their lives, making them different. Through the book though, Catherine and Heathcliff find ways to share their love. Wuthering Heights was an interesting book that I found getting stuck in, and I never wanted to stop reading. Bronte twisted the plot a lot so I found that you had to pay close attention. It kept me reading it"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I truly enjoyed this book. There were lots of twists to it, and I felt there was always something happening. There wasn't a bunch of unnesscessary descriptions. I really like Emily's style of writing. It isn't the victorian style, and it is basically an easy read. I don't like reading a lot of the 19th century books like Pride and Prejudice because the woman are all proper, but this story could have just as well been written today. Some of the characters horrified me, but unlike a lot people I did find a few characters that I could accept. I say give this book a chance."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I have to admit in high school when I was forced to read it I waddled through it and basically endured it. Years later now I've re-read it and I couldn't put it down. I'm glad that I picked it up again. It was a completley spellbinding novel. I don't think anyone in the story was likeable except young Catherine Linton, but it was definitely a fascinating story and worth reading."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I think Breadsticks and Blessing Places written by Candy Dawson Boyd is the best book ever written.

Or more acuratly I see something in a different light. This is a book about pure emotions, passions, and the cosequenses of feeling so strongly. It's a book where anybody can relate to at least one characters at least one time in there lives. Who wouldn't want to be loved the way Catherine was loved. Or how Heathcliff could have been.

It will bring out the passionate romantic in you."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I'm forever indebted to my mother for convincing me to buy this book. I thought,&quot;Another boring 'classic'.&quot; Boy,was I wrong! Although it's long and sometimes confusing,I soon couldn't put it down. It's deep,delving into human emotions. Many of the characters have love-hate relationships with each other,and I felt the same way about them. Heathcliff and Catherine were evil,but who can't identify with their romantic feelings? The book showed how deadly obsession can be and how far-reaching its consequences are. It's one of the greatest books of all time. If you want to read something that changes the way you think and expands your horizons,get &quot;Wuthering Heights.&quot;"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is indeed a classic. Truly a great book. It's kind of understandable that it received a lot of negative reactions when it was first published, because the lead character, Heathcliff, is one of the nastiest characters ever devised. And the second most important character, Catherine (Sr.), isn't all that nice, either. Still, this is one of the best books of its time period and a must read for anyone interested in 19th Century literature."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"After reading Wuthering Heights, my love for litarature and the &quot;classic&quot; books have increased impressively. No, i did not read this for school, I read it to broaden my list of vocabulary words. (my ideal goal in life is to be an author, and i will be one). It pains me to see the thrashing reviews of a great book by high school students who simply shouldn't be reading books like this, not yet, or perhaps never. You can't really call this a romance. or, not a Traditional Romance anyway. The love affair between Heathcliff and Catherine is obviously doomed from the start. People continously say they hated the characters. I didn't. I loved them! Heathcliff and Catherine the most. Not that i didn't hollar at them when they did the idiotic things that became repetitive, as I've seen happen in real life. In fact, the only character i disliked was Nelly Dean, who seemed determined to ruin the already corrupt relationship Heathcliff and Catherine shared. This story is so true to real life. It's so bitter, so gothic. There's not a happily ever after in this novel, folks. I love tear jerkers, and that is what this book is. One thing that Emily Bronte is marvelous at, is her description. Her words plant a vivid picture in my mind. And she doesn't need to go on and on with describing either. She can make a place seem real with one paragraph! Read this book. For whatever reason, read it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I LOVED Wuthering Heights. Although the book gets bad reviews for its crudness, I liked that the characters were real. It is refreshing to find a book that has the main characters with tons of flaws. This is a classic and a must-read for anyone."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"My 13-year old daughter loves this book so I thought that I would try it, fulling expecting to put it down after 30 pages or so. I couldn't! It's not perfectly presented, but the novel does entice the reader into the bizarre world of Wuthering Heights. I normally read war novels (lots of blood and violence) and honestly, Wuthering Heights in some ways is as violent as they are. It is both disturbing and satisfying. I recommend it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"If you are devoted to the Brontes and to _Wuthering Heights,_ you will probably want to swallow twice and pony up for this facsimile of the original edition of the novel. There's something breath-taking in seeing it as Emily Bronte, with only a year or so to live, saw her own work in 1847. The crudeness of the text--typos abound--somehow corresponds to the roughness of the sensibility that produced it. And since the original publisher wanted to spread it out so as to sell thicker book, it's easy on the eyes.The book is sewn in heavy, orangish cloth and feels substantial; in these days of flashy, cheaply produced volumes, this two volume set is a happy throwback."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"\\"Wuthering Heights\\" is, with Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" my alltime favorite book. I've read it several times, beginning at age twelve. Even when I was too young to understand all of its complexities, I still appreciated its highly atmospheric qualities and the magic that makes it timeless.Over the years, I've asked myself, time and time again, just what it is about \\"Wuthering Heights\\" that gives it such power. I've finally come to the conclusion that \\"Wuthering Heights\\" endures simply because its characters dare to feel things and act in ways the rest of us don't. We all have times when we're tempted by obsession and revenge, but most of us don't act on those temptations. At times, we all feel driven almost to madness and we all have a wild side (some of us more than others) that finds perfect expression in the character of Heathcliff. In this book, the characters are always threatening to break the bounds of respectibility and civility.While some people see \\"Wuthering Hieghts\\" as the ultimate love story, I've never found much love in this book, not even between Catherine and Heathcliff. What I have found are obsession and revenge. Love would have watered this story down; obsession and revenge crank it up. Love is an acceptable (even prized) emotion; obsession and the desire for revenge, though felt my many, are definitely frowned upon. The fact that Emily Bronte allows her characters to give in to obsession, to go mad, to exact revenge, gives her novel a distinctly disturbing, unsettling power.There are many criticisms of this novel that attempt to analyze what Emily Bronte was trying to say. Many compare the domesticity of Thrushcross Grange to the isolation and wildness of Wuthering Heights. These ctiticisms don't interest me in the slightest. No matter how educated Emily Bronte was or wasn't, she certainly didn't study psychoanalysis and she certainly didn't write her novel keeping the finer points of analysis in mind. Emily Bronte was, by all accounts, a highly imaginative girl who cared more for the world of fantasy than for reality. Approach her book as literature; enjoy it and don't attempt to \\"pull it apart.\\"Many people have said that the \\"second generation\\" in this book redeems the one that preceded it; i.e., Cathy and Hareton redeem Catherine and Heathcliff. I can't agree with that assessment. All of the characters in \\"Wuthering Heights\\" show themselves to be capable of violence and obsession (even Edgar). I think, in seeing the \\"second generation\\" as restorative, we deny many of the passions inherent in this book. Catherine and Heathcliff are the characters most given to wild emotions but they are not the only ones; all of the characters can and do resort to violence when it suits their needs.\\"Wuthering Heights\\" is one of those rare books: a truly inspired masterpiece. It has a very unsettling, disturbing, even fascinating quality about it because it touches the darkest regions of our soul. Heathcliff is the dark side in all of us; the side we don't enjoy even acknowledging and Catherine's failure to deal with her obsesion reminds us that we, too, can fail, we all are vulnerable to Catherine's fate.\\"Wuthering Heights\\" is a stormy, unsettling, often violent book that explores the darkest side of human nature. Its beauty is raw and savage; its emotions spill over the constraints of civility and common sense. It's a powerful book (one of the most powerful in all of literature). It's a work of genius that's truly unforgettable."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Before I put in my two bits, I made a point of reading other reviews and most of what I read I agreed wholeheartedly with, But for the other 10%, I was extremely dissapointed. For those of you who complained, and said that Wuthering Heights was a dull and boring book, maybe the book isn't the problem, and you are. Could it be possible that you need to open your narrow vision and broaden your veiw of this worlds literature? I am fourteen and I totally understood this book. I was wrapped up it the whole time, and there was never one part that I thought was boring. I admit, at times it was confusing, but never boring.This book is without a doubt the best written peice of work I have ever read. The description blew my mind, and as for the characters, they were fully developed and I was able to bring them alive in my mind as easily as I ever have in any other book.Brontte made it so easy to imagine Heathcliff that I had to make no effort whatsoever on my part to bring him to life. As for Catherine, she was developed so well that I can honestly say I saw her as a real person.This novel left me wanting nothing more but a sequel."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"It's strange that as a lover of literature (it was my major in college too), I haven't previously read Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte. I'm surprised that it wasn't assigned for any of my classes. I've read and loved Jane Eyre by Emily's sister Charlotte multiple times and Wuthering Heights has literally been on my shelf for years waiting for me to read it.Last week I decided to cross Wuthering Heights off my to-read list.I'm not sure exactly what I was expecting. You can't not have some expectations about Wuthering Heights. It's often a favorite novel of other literary/pulp fiction characters. A well-written, darkly romantic ghost story. That's what I was expecting. And in some ways, that's what the book was.The writing is really good once I got past the strange and sometimes confusing model of narration--the servant telling the story to a boarder who writes in his diary. This style removes the reader from some of the inner dialogue and thoughts of the main characters. However, if it had been narrated by Heathcliff, like Lolita's Humbert, I might be even more disturbed by his character. And who else could have narrated it? Cathy II, Hareton and Linton have no idea why their lives are being constantly manipulated by Heathcliff.There is a ghost. Her appearance early in the novel is the only moment of intense emotion and romance that I expected from the novel. It is the only reason I was compelled to continue reading. I was eagerly awaiting another such experience.The characters are either reprehensible and completely without merit or sniveling, abused pawns in Heathcliff's demented game of revenge.Needless to say, I was disappointed. Lovers of Wuthering Heights will no doubt claim that I have missed the point. Perhaps. Maybe you have to be younger to read and appreciate the immature and ridiculous passion of Heathcliff. Maybe I missed my chance to appreciate this novel. Still, I don't understand why so many teenagers actually like it. How is this an example of true love? How is abuse and vile retribution against others romantic?"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights, Emily Bronte's only novel, is very different from her famous sisters', and critical opinion in the last few decades has decided it is the best of them, which truly says much. It first got mixed reviews but has continually risen to the point where it topped a recent poll of the greatest love stories, showing that it is one of the few classics with true mass appeal. Wuthering is indeed a masterpiece with a thrilling story, superb characterization, stunning prose, and more than a little sociopolitical relevance. Its power has enthralled readers for over a century and a half and shows no sign of lessening.The story itself is one of the most immediately engrossing elements. Tightly plotted and deftly executed, it draws us in irresistibly and never lets go; those afraid of classic literature because they think it boring, pretentious, or portentous should know this is a striking exception. It is the kind of tale that does not come off well in summary, as the blank faces staring at me when I gave a college presentation on it prove. Though short for a Victorian novel at about three hundred pages, the complex multi-generational plot is told via flashbacks, nested narration, etc. Suffice is to say that the action is intensely dramatic and highly emotional; it is drenched in pathos and runs us through a gamut of other emotions. It reaches a fever pitch quite soon and hardy lets up - a story of true immediacy and intensity. With its time jumping and non-linearity, the complicated delivery creates significant suspense, and we become supremely interested.The key to the book's success, though, is surely its characters. Many are vividly and memorably drawn with stunning realism and often with great sympathy; we truly feel with and for them. Catherine, the initial female lead, is one of Victorian literature's more striking heroines; an essentially unconventional woman stuck in a time and place where convention reigned unchecked, she has great passions that find no vent. She loves Heathcliff but cannot bring herself to defy society enough to marry him. Her character thus subtly critiques Victorian society, showing how oppressive mores were detrimental to many, especially women, crushing their spirit and denying them happiness.Heathcliff himself is of course the most famous character and the one most attractive to many. As a heterosexual man, I have never been able to see his appeal; he seems overwhelmingly selfish and cruel with almost no redeeming qualities. However, I have seen women discuss him as if he were not only real but the Sexiest Man Alive - even ones who have never read Wuthering! He seems to be among many women's favorite characters ever and, I suspect, is a large part of the reason the book topped the poll. What makes him so attractive is a very interesting question; I assume it is a combination of his profound passion - along with its consequent romantic and sexual potential - plus his bad boy status. He is in some ways the prototypical bad boy, living by his own code and not caring what others think - bravely and boldly original. One may well wonder how or why women excuse his sadistic qualities, but he certainly stands well above the drab gentlemen populating most Victorian fiction. They are stuck in a time warp, but he is distinctly alive, as much a part of our day - nay, any day - as his own. Even putting subjective attraction aside, though, he is undeniably fascinating, if far from traditionally likable. This is in one sense because, like Shakespeare's Richard III, he is upfront about his villainy - nay, positively revels in it. He does not try to hide his nature, and there is something perversely admirable in how he carefully meditates and follows his plans. More fundamentally, he is more sinned against than sinning; his detestable qualities surely stem in great part from his brutal upbringing. This not only makes him a sort of sympathetic figure - and certainly one of pathos - but also raises very currently relevant questions about parents and guardians' responsibility for their children's actions later in life. The topic received almost no mainstream, much less legal, attention until the last few decades, showing just how far ahead of her time Bronte was here as in many other ways.Of course no one can discuss the book without mentioning the love story, which in its way is one of the most monumentally engrossing. However, that it was ranked first truly surprises because it has nothing like a happy ending and is indeed a thwarted love tale; Catherine and Heathcliff do not even get as much time together as Romeo and Juliet. The depth of their passion despite this is surely a large part of the attraction, but it may very well be that the lack of consummation - not just in the physical sense - is precisely what moves so many. Love is perhaps the most universal feeling, but the rarity of its being requited - much less reaching full mutual fruition - is truly tragic. The sad truth is that, whatever happy love stories' escapist value, far more people can relate to unhappy ones. Wuthering's is bitterly familiar to the countless people who have loved only from afar, displaying the wretched phenomenon's broken feelings and often fatal consequences with stirring verisimilitude and extreme emotional vitality. The many who have been in similar situations will feel a great personal connection, but even those who have not will have great sympathy for this unfortunately common dark side of human experience.Some of the novel's social criticism clearly comes into play here, and it is to society's credit that things have changed to the point where very few would disdain a Catherine/Heathcliff union. Yet some of the love's story's other fundamental elements remain just as relevant - are indeed as old as humanity and will surely last as long as we do. It shows the dramatically high pitch that passion and other emotions can reach even - or perhaps particularly - when they have no release. Many works show love's greatness, but Wuthering is remarkable for showing its dark side; the heart has terrible truths hiding just beneath ostensible calm that can storm out at any time - often with dire results. The novel does not flinch from displaying how our most primitive emotions can easily have savage effects; if love brings out the best in humanity, it can at least as easily bring out the worst. Perhaps no classic love story is less sentimental or otherwise traditional; this made it stand out distinctly amid many superficially similar Victorian tales, but it would be unusual in any era. Critics did not like to see the unadorned display of mental and physical cruelty, but less prudish later eras have seen its terrible truth. Bronte seemed to have a profound understanding of elemental feelings and stark knowledge of the beastly facts about men and women in love, which seems near-preternatural considering her sheltered life. It is almost enough to make one believe her muse was truly inspired in the external sense so often described by artists but so hard for others to even conceive. No one can read this without a sense of the incalculable loss to literature when such a genius was cut off so early; that she did not live to write more novels is truly regrettable. However she did it, she clearly drew inspiration from a well at human nature's very heart, which is why the book continues to strike such deep chords so powerfully.The younger generation's love story is of course far more traditionally placid. It is nearly as compelling in its way and introduces important poetic justice and irony issues but takes a definite backseat. Those not as responsive to - or who repress - stormy passions may find it more relatable, but it serves primarily as a useful contrast for most readers. If nothing else, it proves Wuthering is more nuanced and subtle than one might think given its melodramatic reputation.All this implies a strong realist perspective, which the book certainly has, but it also belongs to the gothic school so common in the nineteenth century with all its associated supernatural overtones. Requisite ghost aside, we get among other such elements an immense storm that is not only a pathetic fallacy but seems to have some kind of paranormal, perhaps divinely-controlled, significance. The vivid North England moor setting contributes substantially to all this; the novel imbues the strongly, if unconventionally, picturesque setting with a near-magical air, describing it with great believability and stunning originality. Wuthering is one of the main reasons that the area has long had great, near-occult sway in the popular imagination. As all this suggests, the book also has more than a dash of Romanticism. Like most great works, it is hard to classify, the mix of genres and styles forming a magic all its own.A final noteworthy aspect is the deceptively simple prose. Despite the relative conciseness and lack of the florid description that turns so many off to Victorian fiction, Bronte manages to describe her setting at least as clearly and memorably as authors with far thicker works. The landscapes and manors are drawn with stark beauty; no one who reads Wuthering will soon forget them. The narrative, especially in the direct first-person segments, impresses with a spare yet lush style. Bronte knows exactly what words are needed to make her points not only clear but memorable - and, in the case of the immaculately worded and brilliantly portrayed last paragraph, simply unforgettable. Hard as the book is to summarize, it is easy to read in the best sense; those who have had trouble getting into other classic works may be at ease, as this is one of the few books as great as it is accessible - which removes the final excuse for the small number who have not already read and loved it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is a well-red audiobook- the pacing is good, the enunciation is clear and the reader varies the vocal color enough to make individuals identifiable during dialogues.

I hated the story and mostly I really hated the characters. I wanted every one of them to die and wished they had done so sooner. And, honestly, I don't think it's very good writing.The main characters, Heathcliff and Catherine, are impossible to like. Heathcliff is cruel and vindictive, and Cathy is petty and weak. They are both so selfish that it's hard to believe that they're even capable of loving, and it's impossible to want them to be happy. This takes the angst, tension, and hope out of reading their story, and there's nothing to replace those key aspects of reading a novel like this but disgust. Most of the secondary characters are equally unlikeable or at least unsympathetic, so there's no one a reader can identify with in the real story. It's hard to believe that so many people's lives could be ruined so dramatically and irrevocably, which makes the book seem pathetically melodramatic and more than a bit ridiculous. It's unrealistic but not at all fantasy, it's tragedy with no one to feel sorry for and romance with no one to love, it's gossip that no one wants to hear. Furthermore, while reading this I was disturbed and surprised to find grammatical errors!I expected to love this book, and really wanted to, because Emily Bronte's fantasy world from her youthful writing really appeals to me and I wanted her to become a favorite author of mine. But this is just awful."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The Bronte sisters were extremely remarkable women. They have left a literary place in history. Charlotte Bronte was the most popular one; she wrote Jane Eyre, one of the most popular fiction novels in history. But there is definitely room for Emily Bronte. Wuthering Heights, Emily's only novel is -- without a doubt -- the work of a genius. The tragic love story of Catherine and Heathcliff is one of the most memorable ones I have ever read. Also, I love the backdrop of the story. The story took place on the untamed Yorkshire moors in England. It symbolizes their wild love -- or more specifically, Heathcliff's wild ways. I love a story with symbolism. It saddens me to know that this is the only novel of Emily Bronte. She would have written other books if she hadn't died the way she did. I am consoled with the fact that she has left us this incredible book, a book that will be treasured forever."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This edition is the first i have ever read, im sure there are better ones out there. However i enjoyed this book thoroughly. It was a little hard to understand the text as im not used to way things were written back then, but overall it was a very good read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I stumbled upon a song called Wuthering Heights a month or so ago. It's an eerie, etheral composition speaking through the voice of Cathy to Heathcliff. The first time I listened to the song I thought the singer, Kate Bush, was speaking a bizarre and foreign language. I cannot say I enjoyed the song initially, but I admired how the singer had crafted such a haunting, vivid, and singular melody. You should listen to it--I must warn you that you may dislike it.I read the novel, Wuthering Heights, years ago in middle school and have forgotten most of the story. The song piqued my interest in the novel, and I began reading it yesterday. It has been described as, perhaps, one of the most original novels in the English language. Its wild and untamed story, written on the windswept canvas of the moors of northern England, is written in an excited and lyrical manner. Heathcliff and Cathy are so vivid in the imagination of the author they they violently spring to life in the conciousness of the reader--at least that has been my experience. I wonder if I will ever experince such overwhelming passion, though I guess it's well that I haven't, as it borders on the psychotic. Even the fundamental boundaries of one's own being are broken down in the cyclonic relationship of Heathcliff and Cathy.It has been a long while since I read any fiction, and I am truly enjoying this fine example."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Bronte's Wuthering Heights is a haunting story of love and hate, where human emotions and passions are presented through a range of excellently developed characters. The story is taut, the narrative is engrossing, and the novel has all the drama to make excellent movies. The novel is an underrated study of human psychology, of love, of jealously, contempt, revenge and of character and how it transforms through time and relationships. People call it the greatest novel of unrequited love; it definitely potrays love, hatred and melancholy in the same vein. Perhaps Heathcliff, who loves and hates with all the harshness of his character, leaves a lasting impact on reader's fancy, to make a memory of this novel as one about only hatred and unrequited love. Read it to discover the passions that makes this Bronte novel a classic."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The movie American Beauty reminds me of this book. Both pull off the near impossible task of presenting the reader (or viewer) with horrible nasty people and then at the last moment making us see them as simply angry human beings fully capable of redemption and understanding, even if its too late to do anything with their lives.The book starts out with one of foppiest of English fops touring the Manor with a utter contempt for these people and their ways. The stories that he hears from the servants only confirm his view, but they are intriguing. No one tells what they want to tell and there are times when you want to strangle the servants telling the stories (especially the one that PURPOSELY hid a note that would have eased some of the tensions because she didn't feel that it would be right. How many interfering old bitties like this are in the world? Probably more in the Victorian era.)The love between Heathcliff and Catherine might have worked out in different circumstances, if Heathcliff had not been the hated adopted gypsy child, if Catherine's brother hadn't been an idiot drunk, if Catherine hadn't been pledged to marry the idiot next door. Of course, then it wouldn't have been such an intriguing novel. Heathcliff comes back the conquering hero to find that Catherine is married and her idiot brother is still a drunk and he can't have her so he plays dangerous games with people's hearts and gears everything to his twisted revenge. Included in his schemes are the marrying of Catherine's sister-in-law and the corrupting of Catherine's nephew (the son of the drunken idiot).It's pretty rough going and you want to like Heathcliff at least more than the rest of the people in this book, but he gives you no room to excuse his actions. He's just horrible. Then like Kevin Spacey at the end of American Beauty, he reveals himself and comes to a point of self-reflection and repentence that fulfils the hope you had for him at the beginning of the book. It's very rare that this happens and its believable, but in this case it's very believable."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte was well ahead of her time in writing this incredible love story. The plot was very complex, yet the intricacies of revolving a story within a story within another story never created an error. The author wrote on some very specific issues of the day and one would need to formally investigate the book in order to find any mistakes. This is a story by Mr. Lockwood who really comes in at the end of the story. He meets his new landlord Heathcliff and is able to discern some very strange happenings at Wuthering Heights. His servant, Nellie Dean, narrates most of the story as she lived it. She and Joseph are the only people to live through the three generations and the only one able to recount first hand knowledge. This is a love story, ghost story, and story of oppression all in one. Emily Bronte was able to describe the ill-effects of English property law in the 19th Century. Primogeniture--the law of inheritance, where only the eldest male child could inherit family estates without a contrary will, often could result in the younger siblings being turned into mere servants. This is how Hindley came to own Wuthering Heights and why he was able to ruin Heathcliff. There is much effort from various forces to keep Heathcliff and Catherine seperate. There is also much symbolism regarding various images such as locks that represent keeping people prisoner, or of dogs that demonstrate the character of their owners. Much forshadowing is accomplished with great sophistication. This was written from a &quot;Realist&quot; perspective and yet there are elements of &quot;Post Modernism&quot; included as in the case of ghosts and supernatural happenigs. One might question whether or not Emily Bronte Believed in the Supernatural and considered it as real and natural, which would then relate it back to Realism. There are many twists and turns and the symmetry is flawless. We have two seperate parents who are neighbors. Each have an elder boy and a younger girl. Heathcliff is a foundling who is regarded as a &quot;gypsy&quot; (possibly a slave child or illegitimate child of Mr. Earnshaw), The son of the Lintons (Edgar),marries the daughter of the Earnshaws (Catherine), and they have a girl named Catherine. Hindley, the son of the Earnshaws marries outside of the family and produces a son, Hareton. This helps to keep the incest down a bit. Heathcliff who was raised in the Earnshaw home marries the daughter of the Lintons (Isabella) and they have a child Linton Heathcliff. This child ends up marrying the younger Catherine and when Linton dies, Catherine marries Hareton. So in effect she has married two first cousins. The characters grow up in a very oppressive atmosphere. The servants are actually treated better than the children who are often whipped or starved. This is &quot;Gothic&quot; like in the dark, dreariness that seems to envelope the families and the frequent use of punishment. Even the environment is unfriendly often times. The moors are dangerous and the weather is often rainy or cold and snowy. It is a sad story with the only hope coming in the end when Hareton and Catherine marry and reclaim rightful ownership of Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange, which had been taken from them by Heathcliff."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I am repelled by the absurd peregrinations of Bronte's spiteful, petty-spirited, self-absorbed characters. The character of Heathcliff is that of a nightmarish beast, and Catherine isn't much better. And yet Emily Bronte wants us to LIKE these people. I read this book at the same time as OTHELLO, and to be honest I found my self liking even Iago better than these shallow fools -- at least Iago probably deserved to be a lieutenant! If this is a classic, then so's the phone book. It's ludicrous, witless, and excessively overwritten to boot. At one point, the reader of WUTHERING HEIGHTS will realize that there have been five (or so) mawkish death scenes, some fights and scuffles, and countless effusions of absurd and overblown emotion. And yet one is less than halfway through the book, and Bronte's still wuthering along as if the reader were yet awake. Again, I must compare it to OTHELLO, and find that in all respects it comes up short -- Othello even has better Moors. It's not a classic -- it's a really old British romance novel."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Love this classic story by Emily Bronte and loved reading it on my ipad.

The basic story was good, the characters complex but most were not likeable. The moors where it took place were so isolated, there wasn't much interaction with any others except at W. H. and at the Grange. I felt everyone was mentally afflicted in one way or another. The ending was suppose to be a happy marriage but it didn't seem joyful, just thank goodness the story ended. This was over many years proclaimed as the greatest romantic novel, the love was too painful for me to be appreciated."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"THis was a great book.

The movie version of Wuthering Heights was deceptive in regards characteristics and behavior of the characters.

I have heard of it since High School but never read it until now. Good classic reading."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte must have had a great imagination, yet a brilliant sense of reality when writing Wuthering Heights. I say this because so many real problems are apparent in her slightly modified storybook characters. Problems that are faced all the time-orphaned children, undying love, and more than once characters are stuck between a rock and a hard place. Bronte's characters are unlike any I've come across. They are multi-dimensional, and unpredictable; they can be shady and suicidal.Events can unfold in the novel abruptly, or very slowly. At the turn of the page, the main character could be dead, or a new one brought into the world. Nevertheless, the events of one hour could take up two chapters, at the least. Some can be surprising, and quite disturbing, others awaited and welcomed. But, these events are almost never predictable.Many things are repeats of volume 1 in volume 2, but Bronte somehow manages to make a totally different story of the second volume, and you are not bored. There are parallels between the houses, characters, and events. Some of which will most likely be talked about in your language arts class. :)In conclusion, everyone should read Wuthering Heights at least once in their lives. Yes, it's fairly difficult to read and the tests may lower your grade substantially, but you will have attained something from reading it that no other novel can come close to. So whether you read it on your own time, or for a report, along with someone, or all by yourself, just read it!~ L ~"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Okay, maybe that's a bit harsh. Heathcliff is not satan, but he does possess many demonic attributes. I have to say that he is what dragged me through this story. His evilness is nearly absolute and bent on destruction of everyone in his life. But I still have to ask myself why, which may go to say that he is unsatisfactorily explained in the novel. I understand his love for Catherine and the hatred inflicted on him by Earnshaw, but I still can't grasp the depth of his cruelty. The moral freedom he possesses is also astounding, as he worries not about heaven or hell, only about his own personal heaven, in the ground, with Catherine by his side. To me, that may be where his true strength lies.My next favorite character would probably have to be Ellen"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"How could a girl with little or no contact with the outside world write a novel such as this? I was spellbound. My heart just wrinched in pain when I read the words of Catherine &quot;...I am Heathcliff&quot;. This is the story of two proud and passionate people. I looked all my life for a love like these two shared. I was told more than once that it is just &quot;fiction&quot;...real lives never have emotions and dramatics such as this. They were wrong. It took 32 years...but I found my Heathcliff. I recommend this book highly. Give it to your daughters. Share the gift of words. Rich and beautiful words. I can help but gush over this novel. Lovely. Truely lovely."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Ah, Heathcliff and Catherine. Literature's first twisted, truly dependent couple, coming together in one of the most original books in the english canon. What a treat.Emily Bronte's first and only book details the generational struggle between the Earnshaws, a poor farming family, and the Lintons, a wealthy group at Thrushcross Grange. The tragedy's catalyst is Heathcliff, a dark and rebellious boy of unknown parentage whom Mr. Earnshaw brings home and raises as his own child. Earnshaw's son, Hindley, hates Heathcliff with a fierce passion, but young Catherine is immediately drawn to the boy. As they grow older, they realize they are soul mates, but Catherine, attracted to the power and wealth at Thrushcross Grange, marries foppish Edgar Linton, incensing Heathcliff so greatly that he leaves Wuthering Heights for years, traveling the world and becoming a wealthy man. When he returns, it is for revenge, and soon his hatred tears apart the lives of not only Catherine, Edgar and Hindley, but their children as well.This has to be one of the most intense, fiery novels ever written. Bronte describes her wild, moorish surroundings with such vigor and passion that the moors themselves become a character. She also steers clear of nineteenth century melodrama and typical characters; there is no 'winsome heroine' or 'dastardly sneak' or 'good guy.' Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses. Though Heathcliff and Catherine are the primary focus of the novel, you will find yourself rooting for them one moment, then rooting for someone else the next. Bronte makes her characters real people, with a psychological depth and acuity uncommon in most nineteenth century literature; indeed, in literature in general. Everyone has their faults and their virtues. You will feel anger and sorrow for everyone at least once in the book.Bronte's dialogue burns with passion and intensity. When Heathcliff and Catherine allow themselves to finally express their love, it's with as much scorn and fury as adoration. Heathcliff seems to be straddling the line between embracing his soul mate and strangling her. Catherine, even at her most vulnerable, is still an impassioned and taunting lover. Each character has his or her own distinct voice; Nelly Dean, the childhood nurse of Catherine and Heathcliff and the story's primary narrator, immediately comes across as a pleasant, solid and mundane creature, while the villainous Hindley makes you want to black his eyes at least twenty times before the book's over. Bronte created characters of flesh, blood and SOUL. These are real people, really real people. You don't see that often. The characters and the brilliant description and evocation of the Yorkshire moors drench the story in a gorgeous, wild, dark mood. This book gets the heart racing.Emily Bronte wrote one of the great novels of all time on her first and only try. Wow."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"For some reason I expected this to be a Pink novel. Much on the contrary, it's rather black. It is a little masterpiece with no true Romanticism (or maybe yes). It is more of a Gothic novel, at least in tone and atmosphere. A man recently arrived to the Yorkshire moors is told, by his maid, the story of neighbors Earnshaw and Linton, and the Earnshaw's adopted and misterious stepson, Heathcliffe. The story spans decades of pure hatred, envy, horrible offenses and revenges, as well as despise for the human race. Each character lives immersed in their own bitterness and pain, with very little communication between them. BUT, beneath this surface there is love, the love between Catherine Earnshaw and her step brother Heathcliffe. In a way, it is a pure love, but it is also somewhat twisted and inevitably star-crossed. Out of this ill-fated love, a more normal and hopeful love will be born, but that you'll have to find for yourself.For me, the best thing about this novel is the creation of an environment, the handling of the medium within which the tormented characters live. It is constantly tense, brooding, foreboding, with periodic explosions of anger, agression and grief. It is somber, macabre and rainy, like the place where it occurs."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Opion of Book:The book was pretty good, but a little confusing. Her language was a little out dated and hard to understand, but nothing to bad. The writting style is sort of informal because she has a narator and they lived and visited Wuthering Heights but a little hard to understand though.Support of Opinion: It was confusing because there were two Catherines and many people came from the Earnshaw family or were related in some way. She used very big words but ones taht went with what she was saying. It was about true love and more so romantic so that was a plus. Nelly helped narate the story and she was Catherine's maid so that was a little informal basis.Personal Preference: I like this book because what can I say, I'm a hopeless romantic. Some parts were sad though that was the only bad part..Recommendation: YES! I would recommend this book, exspecially to anyoe who likes romance and believes that true love will win out no matter what."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"To those who wish a first contact with the British literature, I invariably recommend reading the novel Wuthering Heights. After readind such book, one grieves the excessively early death of Emily Bront, and, yet, wonders seriously whether she would have been capable of producing another masterpiece to equal her first, had her fate been different.The characters of this incredibly intense story acquire so vivid a uniqueness as the narrative goes on that the reader, sometimes, even becomes unable to distinguish the characters from the \\"real people\\" around him, for he is inevitably beguiled into feeling for them all kinds of sentiment; from love to contempt, from pity to hatred; in a wild kaleidoscope of feelings which no sensitive reader will ever forget.But probably, the greatest triumph of this story is the character Heathcliff. Emily Bront creates a being singular in all its ways, especially its revengeful impulses. She renders Heathcliff something more than human, a true entity!, as she describes his life in that ingeniously exerted gossip fashion. By revealing to us only as much information as the closest person to his whole story (Nelly Dean) has, the writer presents him more as a legend of a superstitious countryside place than an ordinary person.Besides the gossip fashion used throughout the book, there is another element that helps make Heathcliff rather inhuman: his emotions; the consuming love he feels (which becomes more than idolatry for a godess after Catherine's death; she becomes the whole purpose of his \\"unlife\\"), the savageness of his worst outbursts of anger, the malignity he had to infuse to his personality in order to endure the harsh live that succeeded his misterious being born, and other traits which the heedful peruser shall most certainly divine from the many passages of the book.I just entreat that the new readers beware calling Heathcliff essencially evil; you try to analise the life he was forced to bear since his beggning, even before his being rescued from the streets of Liverpool by Old Earnshaw, ere trying to draw any unfair conclusions about this quite unfortunate being.Not only Heathcliff, but all the other characters call our attention in this heartfelt romance: It is quite impossible for Catherine Earnshaw's fierce wildness to pass unnoticed to us; she is the true representation of the unbridled spirit of those moors in her fits of passion, and her actions can reverberate as a thunderstrike on the people who love her, thus casting on them shadows of despair and sadness as swarthy as the ones that dwell in her soul at the moment. It is also interesting to perceive that the fact of her being a woman, a simple wife, and therefore having no great pihsical or social power of which to avail herself, does not render her harmless to the hearts of those who dote on her, for she has, and knows how to use, the power to hurt them in the most grievous way anyone could ever hurt; by degrading the greatest idol and reason of their lives, which is herself. Curious indeed is to notice that both the whole of her hate and the whole of her love are always bestowed upon the same people; another trait that leads back to her main one: her heart brimful with wildness.Actually, one could make thorough analyses concerning each of the rich and allegorical characters of this book; the puritan curmudgeon Joseph, the sweet younger Catherine, the noble - hearted rustic Hareton Earnshaw, the standard good - natured housemaid Nelly Dean, and so on; this is only a space for a brief review and recommendation however, and thus I ought not to indulge with composing an extensive critique on this amazing and unforgettable work of art; even because I would refuse to consider any article I could write in the moment completely worthy of being bestowed upon such a masterwork due to my having less time to spare for the performing of so important a task than I should now.Finally, i wish to praise and call the readers' attention to the skillfully written end of Wuthering Heights; with Heathcliff lying as an unearthly, unnamed interloper beside Edgar and Catherine; as what he had always been throughout his hapless life."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Let's admit it, as good a writer Emily Bronte was, she wasn't as good a writer as her sister, Charlotte. Her only major work, WUTHERING HEIGHTS clearly illustrates that. The writing is superior to most fiction that one reads today and the story is rather interesting. Yet, it failed to catch my attention as easily as JANE EYRE did. There are very few likeable characters in the story (the young Catherine Earnshaw, the housekeeper, and the narrator) and the ending seemed rather hasty. Nevertheless, WUTHERING HEIGHTS is a classic and for good reason. It examines a love that defies death, how important our relationships with other people are, and the value of words. It takes awhile to get into the book, but once one passes the first few chapters, it's hard to put the book down."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book is exciting and interesting, a good combination.

The novel was good, but it didn't interest me. The relationship with Catherine and Heathcliff wasn't a relationship that I appreciated.

So in my opinion, the novel was too mature for me and I'll probably be interested in the novel when I get older."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Interesting to say the least... took me a few chapters to really get into it.

When Lockwood visits Wuthering Heights for the second time the area sees heavy snow and he is marooned there over night with Miltonian ice and snow around him, his hades complete with a half dozen four footed fiends like the hounds of hell inside. Catherine is even pretending to weave some black arts to tease Joseph. So we see that Bronte has painted us a picture of hell at Wuthering heights with, as we shall see later, Thrushcross Grange it's polar opposite. Dante Rossetti said of this novel: \\"The action is laid in Hell, only it seems places and people have English names there.\\"After retiring for the night Lockwood reads the names Catherine Earnshaw, Catherine Heathcliff, Catherine Linton written on a window ledge. This series of names tells the story of Catherine Earnshaw to her relationship to Heathcliff and then to marriage to Edgar Linton, read in the opposite direction it is the story of her daughter Catherine Linton who marries a Heathcliff and ends up an Earnshaw. Lockwood goes to sleep and dreams of going with Joseph to hear a Reverend Jabes Branderham preach on Seventy time seven and the first of the seventy first which was in a book he had been reading, and that Catherine had scribbled in. In a truly funny scene Lockwood is exposed as the first of the seventy first sinner: \\"'Thou art the man!' cried Jabes ... Brethren, execute upon him the judgement written. Such honour have all His saints!' With that concluding word, the whole assembly, exalting their pilgrim's staves, rushed round me in a body; and I, having no weapon to raise in self-defence, commenced grappling with Joseph, my nearest and most ferocious assailant, for his. In the confluence of the multitude, several clubs crossed; blows, aimed at me, fell on other sconces. Presently the whole chapel resounded with rappings and counter rappings: every man's hand was against his neighbour; and Branderham, unwilling to remain idle, poured forth his zeal in a shower of loud taps on the boards of the pulpit, which responded so smartly that, at last, to my unspeakable relief, they woke me\\".Bronte paints in Heathcliff as a goblin that digs up graves and torments the living but she also lets us look a little deeper and we see his torment at the loss of Catherine. Symbolically, I suppose, Wuthering Heights represents Romanticism in decline while Thrushcross Grange depicts the emerging Victorian values. Bronte gives us two main narrators Nelly Dean and Lockwood and we see most of the story through their eyes. Virginia Woolf said \\"It is as if Emily Bront could tear up all that we know human beings by, and fill these unrecognizable transparencies with such a gust of life that they transcend reality.\\" Emily Bronte's numinous and gothic Wuthering Heights compasses a literary zenith as the finest English novel."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Perhaps it is the signature of excellence that the character reviews of this novel are varying but the accolades given to the novel itself are not.I think the essence of the novel is in the housekeeper Ellen herself who tells most of the story. She herself had a hand in the senior Catherine's death. When Catherine was gravely ill, Ellen believed her to be a hypochondriac. Again and again Ellen speaks as negatively of the senior Catherine as she does fondly of the junior Catherine. Like all the characters, even the storyteller Ellen needs further examination. I, for one, found Heathcliff to be a sad, depressed man with many regrets.This novel is not an easy read, but an incredible one that has some of literature's most intriguing characters."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights By Emily BronteThis book is mainly about a love story.A servant,Heathcliff,falls madly in love with a woman that lives in the house,Ms.Cathy.

Wuthering Heights is a work of genius, and a work of art. It is a well-written novel with an original, unique and solid plot, extremely well-done setting, good action, dialogue, etc. All these aspect alone would give the book 5 stars.What makes me say it needs an extra star are the characters. No other novel I know of describes its characters better, or makes them more realistic and belivable. You will never forget Heathcliff. He's a person so set in his cruel ways as to be almost unbelievable - it's hard to imagine someone like that could exist. And yet Emily Bronte pulls it off with her writing. She makes you BELIEVE. And as far as I know, that is the primary purpose of a novel.Don't be fooled by the fact that it's old and a classic. Reading it, none of that is noticeable. The writing is fresh, original, and beautiful. You won't be able to put it down.

And even though if the story happened today, the principle characters would probably end up on a talk show, I found it to be highly articulate as well as entertaining!I'm not sure why many people said this was a slow paced book, I found it to be quite the little page turner! The only thing that slowed me down at all was trying to decipher Joseph's speeches, but even that adds a bit of comedy to the story.I feel as though the narrative is being told as one sits eagerly in a sewing circle awaiting juicy details about their boss. I found that even though the double narrator makes me wonder greatly about the reliablity of the story, I also think it adds a great deal of the entertainment! I don't trust the condescending and conceited Lockwood, nor the flighty, biased words of Nelly, but they are what makes this story so great!It's fabulous to see a book that still holds a reader's interest today, (instead of just spouting off long tangents of philosophical thought) to be in the canon of great literature!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I loved the story.

She also offers us deep psychological insights into human nature. She also makes the characters fairly convincing. Emily Bronte also does a pretty good job in helping us to see why the characters act the way they do, and she does keep us in suspense.

I know it's a classic and I know I'm supposed to revere the writers of old, but this was a waste of time. Nothing against Bronte, just not my cup of tea.

Well, it is to a point... but mostly it is just depressing. They both die near the end and they never get married. She marries an entirely different man, and after she dies he basically goes crazy with sadness. This story is extremely confusing, as well as slightly boring at times. It is hard to understand because of the time frame it is supposed to be in.This book is probably not for young readers, because of the difficult vocabulary and small print. It was hard for me to understand, so i can imagine what it would be like for, say, a ten year old. I do not recommend this book to someone who has a short attention span, because it is hard to follow and hard to get into. If you, by chance, like older literature and are good at comprehending, go for it! But it is not the best choice for someone who is used to reading newer, easier reads. Wuthering Heights is defiantly not a thriller."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The savings were beaucoup! This was a required reading book for school.

But, it was a little tedious to read.Margo, a former college professor, enlightened me with some thoughts on the book which I am quoting here. This is from her comment below dated 2/4/09. \\"Younger readers are fans of the story because they see in it the tumultuous passions of lovers obstructed by \\"outsiders.\\" I think they \\"get it.\\" My college students love it because they are mesmerized by the slow, agonizing destruction of one of the lovers as he takes his vengeance.\\" Thank you Margo.Sexual language: none.

Genre: Gothic Romance (romance about obsession)."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Perhaps the author, Emily Bronte, had the need to write an anti-Jane-Austin story, because this sure qualifies. This tale of interleaved sociopaths is the antithesis of Jane Austin. The people of Quality and Breeding are all mentally disturbed, only the female servant is with sense (she declares herself so in Volume I, chapter 12, page 1). Given the continuum: Perfect Family - Normal Family - Dysfunctional Family - ?? (my vocabulary fails me), these folks rate the \\"??\\". Clearly the quality of the literary effort is superb, the writing and characterization is terrific. The story does have a useful function in illustrating the Darwinian nature of life, but don't read it for its ability to elevate. Is this book entertaining? Yes. But it raises a disturbing question about ourselves that this should become a Classic (think gawkers at a terrible car wreck). The story does conclude by throwing a contrived happy ending as one might throw a bone to a starving dog. (November 2012: I gave this two stars? One was too many. What was I thinking?)"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"After reading Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte, I was looking forward to reading this work of her sister's. I was mortally disappointed. It was like an extremely bad soap opera, with pointless obsessions and passions ruling the lives of the characters with an iron grip. With pathetic, dying lovers, doom, and desperation, it has no redeeming virtues."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I'm sorry but I just did not like this book. It feels sloppily written at times and sometimes I wonder if she wrote the book just to compete with her sister (hey you never know). The only thing that I can compliment this book on is it's character development, by the end of the book (if you can stand to read the whole thing) you feel like you know them personally."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"There is little I can add to the body of work devoted to this excellent novel. But who doesn't love Healthcliff - the prototype for all tortured, romantic souls after him. A wonderful read that should be required for all. Bronte, like all great authors, is as much psychologist is she is an artist, and her writing could even be placed quite neatly, if one so wished, under the mantle of the attachment theories that came after her time."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"First of all, this is one of my all-time favorite books. Wuthering Heights in general gets 5 stars from me, and there are plenty of other opinions about the story for you to read. I just want to add something about this particular edition, because it made me laugh in surprise when I opened up my package. This edition is very elegant, but it's very different from your average hard-backed novel. It's very compact and the pages are very thin, like a pocket Bible. The only reason I don't like it so much is that since the pages are so thin you can see the ghost of the words of the preceding page through the page you're reading. You get used to it as you read, but I prefer a print of more substance. Other than that, the cover is pretty, it's hard-backed, the pages are edged in gold coloring and it comes with an attached ribbon bookmark. The print is also average sized, so it's definitely readable, and the small size is advantageous if you want to carry it with you in a purse or on a trip."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"These books are wonderful!

I'm glad I bought it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"So I'm definitely a fan of the romantics, Jane Austen, Charlotte Bronte, and this book by Emily Bronte was by far my favorite bookwise. I was completely submerged in the world that she created and tangled in the emotions and desires of its characters. While I prefer the story of Pride and Prejudice, I wasn't as steeped in the story when I read it as I was with this classic novel about forbidden love. Just don't watch the movie adaptions they are bleh. Even with the handsome Matthew MacFadyen who plays Hareton in one movie and Mr. Darcy in the p&p movie with Keira Knightley. But this is a classic for a reason, read it! I read this paperback by the way"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I call this the worst book ever, but that's largely an assumption on my part. Perhaps an extrapolation. I have not read all of the books ever written. But this book is horrid.If you are a tween girl, this might be a good book for you, though. If your dream fella is one of those dark and broody types, the kind that seems mysterious but turns out to be just a basic kind of jerk. It's a shame that some people find this book romantic. The dark, disturbed guy in this book is called Garfield and he's a lousy person.If you like this time period for fiction, you should try Anne Bronte. She wrote two fantastic books. But avoid Charlotte Bronte. She, too, is a terrible writer.Full disclosure: I do not know Emily Bronte, nor would I care to."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The story about a low class guy (Heathcliff) in love with a rich upper class girl (Catherine) is a classic theme. I could deal with that because it reminded me of a movie. but, after Catherine dies because of giving birth the book just looses interest. It is obvious that Heathcliff is a Psycho! he does so many bad things that you go from feeling bad for him for not ending up with Catherine, to hating his guts and wanting him to die. There really is no protagonist in the story to take on the antagonist of Heathcliff because there is no way that he is the antagonist. There are much better books in British Literature that I would have rather read in high school than this one. Overall it was a very dissapointing book. I was expecting to read a real classic but I was dissapointed."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I love the classics as much as anyone but I really can't get into a novel that makes me hate the main characters. Catherine is a petulant, spoiled ***** and I never wanted to lay into anyone as bad as I did Heathcliff. He is a deranged psychopath, and there is nothing remotely 'romantic' about his character. I'm not sure why the novel caught on the way it did, it was 300 pages documenting spoiled, self absorbed people and their unrelenting quest to destory any trace of happiness around them. Not my idea of a good read, but it was worth it to get to the end just to see his ass DIE. Good riddance!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I am reading Wuthering heights in preparation for and AP English course, and am finding it to be the most tedious book I have ever read. I used to think that Hemingway's Old Man and the Sea dragged, but i was sadly mistaken. This book is a drawn out and dreary affair. I have enjoyed &quot;classic&quot; literature in the past but this is unworthy of being dubbed &quot;classic&quot;. I would never reccomend this book to another living person, but maybe I'm just and &quot;immature&quot; reader."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Hi there, it's me again with another 'Classic'. You probably don't know I recently made a resolution to read some of the 'Classics'. I had avoided them successfully for decades and then decided that perhaps I was missing out on some really great stories. So, I carefully selected some novels that sounded like great 'Classics' to read. 'Wuthering Heights', 'Pride and Prejudice' and 'Jane Eyre' rose to the top of the list.They all sounded like fabulous stories, everyone raves about them, the book jackets make them sound like the absolute be all end all for engaging fiction. And maybe they are for the vast majority of people, but not me. Jane Eyre being the exception of the three.I did LOVE 'Jane Eyre', love, love, loved it. However my strong feeling for both 'Pride and Prejudice' and 'Wuthering Heights' swing dramatically in the complete opposite direction.I really strongly disliked (okay, I hated) almost everything about Wuthering Heights. I thought the characters were absolutely horrid and rotten, the only exception being the innocent and unrelated tenant, Mr. Lockwood, who Ellen Dean tells this awful tale to.The relationships were completely dysfunctional, violent, abusive and destructive. I can not comprehend how this came to be called \\"one of the most romantic novels of all time\\". I have no idea who said that but in my opinion whoever it was should have their head examined. If this is what people call romantic it is no wonder that 1 in 2 of all marriages fail.Perhaps, I have some sort of completely unrealistic expectations when it comes to the classics and my expectations set me up for failure...? Perhaps. But I am going to stop searching out any more 'Classics' for the time being.One more hostile note that some of you will appreciate. I swear I wanted to cudgel the servant Joseph who spoke in a northern dialect and could only be understood by reading the notes to the text in the back of the book.I would have to place this book at the top of a list for 'Most Likely to Create Hatred of English Literature'."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"If you don't know anything about Emily Bronte or you don't like her style of literature, then I would warn you to stay away from this and look up one of the many other classics like &quot;Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;. Here's why:Confusing -- Several characters all share the same/similar names which sometimes makes it confusing.Unsympathetic characters -- I felt that Heathcliff was such a total jerk that he didn't deserve any sympathy whatsoever. So that made it hard for me to sympathize with the woman who loved him, which in turn forced me to reject the concept of this being a love story. Even the most vile villans of all time usually exhibit one small redeeming quality. I felt that Healthcliff didn't and thus I didn't care what happened to him or his love interest.Boring -- Nothing good happens.If you like Emily Bronte nothing I say here will change your mind, but if you don't or are reluctant, then stay away from this one."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I am torn on this one but mostly negative. The language and the story were both excellent (though the Yorkshire lines were tough at times) but all but one of the characters were annoying to the point of distraction and the book was not well edited for length. She could have told this story with the same impact, had she dropped scenes and words.She has a gift for darkness and moodiness though, and the book, in general is a bit of an elaborate Victorian ghost story. The opening scenes and set up of the novel is quite masterful but the story rambles and everyone and everything seems just a bit watery by the end of it.Trivia: This book ranks pretty high on the \\"books in which characters catch a chill from wet feet and die\\" list. All the characters sound like my mother not wanting me to swim after eating."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"i dont know if i would love or hate this book because i couldnt read it because im not the best reader and have to sound things out sometimes and i couldnt understand half the words on the first page alone and so i had to keep looking in the dictionary half the time to under stand and so i gave up and deleted the book but other people tell me its a good book i just coldnt understand it i hope other people like it"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Although it took me 2 tries reading this to understand who the heck was the narrator, once I figured it out, I loved it!Listening to the stories being told with Heathcliff and Cathy..it's sad yet amazing."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I used express delivery and it left the warehouse the same day I ordered it and I received it promptly. Thank you for an exceptional sale. I will do this again."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I picked this book up again some 35 years after reading it in high school, and what I found was quite different from what I remembered. Our &quot;cultural&quot; memory of this great English novel is that it is a story of romantic, wild passion, and unrequited love. No doubt our preconceptions are heavily influenced by the famous film made many years ago. The reality is quite different. Catherine is a rather vain and willful girl who rejects Heathcliff because of differences in their class and upbringing. Heathcliff is full of hatred and resentment despite the great kindness shown him by his master in adopting him literally off the street. There is nothing romantic about the relationship between these two--they hurt each other constantly despite their almost spiritual bond. After Catherine's death, which occurs only halfway through the book, things turn bleaker still, as Heathcliff wreaks revenge on all around him. The wild, harsh countryside and climate, beautifully evoked by Bronte, echo the violent emotions that drive the lives of the characters. How cruel these people are to each other--how hard is Heathcliff's heart that he hates Catherine's daughter most of all. I confess that I found the unrelieved bleakness hard to take at times, and the redemptive conclusion a bit contrived, but it's a great work of English literature nonetheless--and to imagine this book was written by a young woman with virtually no experience of the world!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"WUTHERING HEIGHTS is without a doubt the greatest romance novel I have ever read. Anybody who has ever had a hopeless love for somebody else will understand the torment that Heathcliff and Cathy went through. The love shown here is everything that love involves: infatuation, lust, longing, and even hatred. Simply put, this novel is an absolute masterpiece! You owe it to yourself to read it! Also recommended: THE LOSERS' CLUB by Richard Perez"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Amazing book. I have to admit when I first started reading it for my British Lit class I wasn't at all interested. I found the beginning slow and tedious. But once I got into the flashbacks from Nelly I was engrossed and couldn't put it down. The book is dark but a great read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is the best book ever. I absolutely love it. It has so much feeling and passion in it that you can't help thinking about it long after you finish reading it. And, odd as it sounds, I think that Elton John's song &quot;Original Sin&quot; fits it very well. I love it so much and definately recommend you to read. Definately."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The book is written wonderfully, you may call it gothic romance, but the book's really got a style and genre of its own. Now, I only say this for GREAT romance novels, like the Brontes. The language greatly affects the way the story is expressed. It is told in a subtle and bumpy manner, going way ahead of the reader, its many pauses for the narrator gives the reader time to think the thing over, like the guest. Basically, the style and format is a fascinating one, it truly does intrigue the reader to a certain level. Now, it is hard to say if Heathcliff is the kind of man a girl would want( not that I'm a girl ), he is, if you want someone who truly loves you, he's not if you don't want someone to go CRAZY over you. It is--I think--clever of Emily Bronte, to leave this question for readers to consider as they sit comfortably in their beds reading this romance. But if you read it carefully, you will see that the narrator does not form a very high opinion of Heathcliff, yet the latter did deserve the revenge he got. Now, here we have another controversial point for us readers. Thus the novel is a quick one, without all the slow( at least very slow )descriptions and it forms different points of interest as it moves along just pulling the reader in. As the reader gets to the end he/she will feel a shocking yet not surprising end. The ending is a satisfactory one after chapters after chapters of points pointing toward the end. After all, the end is a slope for the way the novel is going. All in all, the book is satisfactory, and something that will--in a way--haunt the reader in later times. It is a masterpiece with all those interesting formats which I will never forget."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I see Bronte's classic novel as the celebration of imagination and the boundless possibilities that dreaming and strongly believing in the make-believe of dreams, as children can only do so well, presents to the reader. Heathcliff and Cathy were happiest when they cast off all of the pretentious cares, and embraced the simplest of things together. As with most classic novels, death is misunderstood; Death was only symbolic of that passage into a reality they both shared all along- a realized spirit of happiness. If anything, it is a strong and encouraging message that the flawed things we most trouble over in life are the very things not all that important. As one modern book puts it, &quot;Don't sweat the small stuff. It's all small stuff.&quot; One might argue that even in death, the romantic flaws would carry on; the distractions still beckoning. To the contrary, this classic novel is the celebration of whatsoever things are beautiful, gracious, carefree, simple, and worthwhile in right here, right now living. In biblical terms, Except ye be as little children..."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I'm thirteen years old, and a HUGE reading fanatic. So one day I pick this up, and start reading. At first, it's pretty hard, but then you start to get along with the writing style. This took me a LONG time to read, but it was definately WELL-WORTH it! It's hard to explain what it was about, but I'll help you best I can. So there's this guy(Mr. Lockwood) and he is the current tennant of Thrushcross Grange. Through the whole story, a servant named Ellen(Nelly) Dean is telling him the history of the people who lived there, and in Wuthering Heights. I'd say that the story is mostly how Heathcliff ruined the lives of the Earnshaw and Linton families, but that is just my point. The story basically starts off about Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff. Then, to the point after that, it comes down to start about Catherine Earnshaw's daughter, Catherine Linton. It's really good, and really hard too! Consider it a big accomplishment to have read it, cause it is amazing!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"It's been a while since I've read this book, but I remember that I was entranced by it. It's a wonderfully tragic love story. I found it very romantic and a suprisingly easy read. Once you begin it you won't want to put it down. However, my only complaint is that some of the characters have the same name so it's harder to keep track of who's who."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"All of the novels of the Bronte sisters exhibit a genius of passion well surpassing their age. Emily Bronte's WUTHERING HEIGHTS, however - though perhaps not quite so endearing as the novels of her sister, Charlotte - possesses the most adeptly pondering prose, egregiously fathoming the terrifying extremes of love and hate.Born amidst the feral landscape of England's Yorkshire moors, the Earnshaw family and their ramshackle farm estate, Wuthering Heights, are at the center of this manifestly heartrending story. Mr. and Mrs. Earnshaw, with the help of several servants - most notably their poignantly observant maid Nellie, and their pious and stoic manservant Joseph - are raising two children: a son, Hindley, and his younger sister, Cathy. On a cold and drizzly evening, when Hindley's but a teenager and Cathy still a very small child, Mr. Earnshaw returns from Liverpool carrying a young urchin he'd found starving in the streets. Despite wary opposition from his family, he adopts the four or five year-old child and names him Heathcliff. Mr. Earnshaw, over the next several years, develops a fond affection for Heathcliff that surpasses even that which he feels for his own son. Mrs. Earnshaw dies not long after Heathcliff joins the family, then Mr. Earnshaw dies several years afterwards. From thereon, Hindley relentlessly vents a deeply embedded bitterness borne of jealousy upon his adopted younger brother.Hindley's hatred of Heathcliff is the force that drives this story on. His sister Cathy, however, from a very young age is as drawn to Heathcliff's quiet thoughtfulness, as he to her flighty impulsiveness. The two of them nurture a very deep friendship as children, which grows to an almost otherworldly love as young adults. This tempestuous love gets devastatingly shaken not only by Hindley's efforts to keep Heathcliff in the drudge, but also by wooings for Cathy from a wealthy blue-eyed suitor from Thrushcross Grange, a neighboring estate. This young strapping is Edgar Linton, and he as well as his sister Isabella cut a very severe contrast to Heathcliff. The Lintons are fair-haired, refined in manner, and have very openly expressive countenances. Heathcliff, on the other hand, casts a dark, gloomy aspect: intensely handsome despite dirty, messy hair and thick-browed brooding eyes. Truly Cathy's audacious, tempestuous spirit, wild as the blustering wind on the Yorkshire moors, is pure soul mate to Heathcliff's moody, devil of a gypsy, hot-blooded heart. \\"My love for Linton is like the foliage in the woods,\\" she says, \\"time will change it, I'm well aware, as winter changes the trees. My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath: a source of little visible delight, but necessary.\\" Never - in all of the novels I've ever read - have soul mates been so intensely, so uncannily written.The only fault I find in this story is the utter lack of endearing qualities in either Cathy or in Heathcliff. Each displays, at turns, some form of careless frivolity or ruthless cruelty in either their actions or their words. And though I certainly cannot help but feel for their struggles and their pain, neither are the type individuals with whom I would possibly want to become a friend. They are amazingly self-absorbed, and wholly blinded by the radiance of each other.Mistake me not, though - reading WUTHERING HEIGHTS was indeed a wondrous experience. The writing interweaves the earthly elements, the people, and the landscape haunted by their ghosts with a deftness that's extraordinary. There is undeniable genius here - a brilliantly intense story of a love that refuses to be thwarted, coursing through the heart and soul of the next generation, thence onward, and beyond the grave."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"\\"Wuthering Heights, by Emily Bronte is one of the greatest romances in history.\\"-Kristen Murphy.Within the text of this book, Emily describes events that take place revolving around a romance. The main characters of this book are: Catherine, Cathy, Edgar, Linton, Hareton, Hindley, Isabella, and Heathcliff. Isabella is very spoiled, and soon has a son that dies (Linton). Heathcliff's love life turns into a mess and turns into a lonely old man. Hindley is a jealous and rebellious child that soon becomes jealous of Heathcliff. Hareton is Hindley's son that eventually marries Catherine.Throughout the book the characters run into a lot of problems and adventures. For example, there is a tremendous amount of tension that burns off Heathcliff. My favorite character in the book is Heathcliff. The reason that I like him so much is because he keeps your eyes open. He is always changing, his appearance and his location.The themes that are reveled within the book are: Good vs. Evil, Revenge, Crime and Punishment, Passion vs. Rational Love, Ignorance vs. Education, and Selfishness. The characters display these themes in many different scenes and emotions.My overall opinion of this book was excellent. I would not change anything at all, and I believe that the ending is perfect. I would recommend this book to anyone that in joy's romance novels. It is a novel that keeps you wondering and not knowing what is going to happen next. You may think that you know how this book is going to end, but really you don't. This book sits way ahead of all the other romance novels."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"There is only one way I can understand this story, and it is to read Wuthering Heights as a parody of all other romantic novels. Just think about it: what would a typical romantic hero look like in real life? What would dark, intolerable passion look like in real life? What kind of ends would said hero be willing to go to in order to satisfy a love so intrinsic to his being IN REAL LIFE?Trust me, if you read the book from this point of view, you're going to want to continue reading just to see how far Heathcliff is willing to go to satisfy his desire.YMMV."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I had always heard about the 'classic' love story in Wuthering Heights, but I never thought to read the novel until a few months ago. The main character Catherine Earnshaw is an idealistic, strong willed girl on her way to becoming a well-respected lady. One day her father brings Heathcliff, a brooding and mysterious orphan, into their home, and Catherine is immediately drawn to him. After her father dies, Catherine's brother Hindley takes over their home, Wuthering Heights, and Heathcliff is forced to be a servant. Heathcliff is in love with Catherine, and Catherine apparently feels the same way until she betrays Heathcliff to marry Edgar Linton. Outraged and hurt, Heathcliff leaves Wuthering Heights.Heathcliff returns a year later with the intellect and money of a gentleman. Heathcliff stays at Wuthering Heights with Catherine and Edgar. Heathcliff elopes with Edgar's sister, Isabella, finally getting his revenge on Catherine and Edgar. Isabella eventually regrets the marriage because Heathcliff really doesn't love her and abuses her.Catherine become pregnant, but she dies while giving birth. Before passing away, though, Catherine talks with Heathcliff, and they forgive each other. Catherine gives birth to a daughter who is named Catherine after her mother. The young Catherine grows up with Heathcliff planning a romance between her and Isabella's son Linton.As I was reading the first few chapters, I couldn't figure out why the book was a classic. However, I continued on and became completely engaged in the description, the characters, and the intense love story between Catherine and Heathcliff. Once I got past a fourth of the book over a few weeks, I hit the fascinating part that starts with Catherine's betrayal of Heathcliff and his subsequent revenge. I finished the rest of the novel in less than a day because I couldn't stop reading until I knew how it ended. The language sometimes is a little heavy and hard to follow, especially in the beginning, but once you read about the tumultuous relationship between Catherine and Heathcliff, you'll be sucked into the story. The characters are all well-developed and realistically flawed, so that you can really imagine this story taking place in another time and place. The love story with Catherine and Heathcliff is probably the strongest and most significant love story I've ever read, for there are so many thing wrong with their relationship -- Catherine can't embrace Heathcliff for who he is even if she does love him, Heathcliff is set on getting revenge on Catherine for marrying Edgar -- but the thing that is the foundation of their whole relationship is a fateful, unbreakable bond."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Did you, or did you not, want to kick Heathcliff and bite Cathy? Because I did. Yes, indeed, I did. No other book people have irritated me half so much, by just doing what I didn't want them to do. Kudos to Miss Bronte for such engaging characters, but one star off for spite because I like happy endings best. ;)"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"They might as well call it a Soap Opera From Hell---Heathcliff's married to the sister of the woman he loves, Catherine. Catherine loves Heathcliff, but couldn't marry out of status, so she marries this Ergar guy for the money.Then, Heathcliff goes nuts and plots vengeance on everybody, taking the kid, Hindley, and teaching him to hate his father, making everyone alcoholics, chasing his wife off in tears and fits of misery, ruining the half dozen lives of the people around him.How can they call it a romance novel?! Days of Our Lives has better plotlines, Dante's Inferno had more heroic characters.This book's great---interesting to English Majors and Gothic [people] alike."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Did it ever occur to you Heathcliff might be the illegitimate child of Mr. Earnshaw, the 'surprise' he comes home with. Didn't it cross your mind how awfully coincidental it must be to join two complete strangers who are in fact, in no time, 'soulmates', at one point Cathryn even says: I AM Heathcliff. In fact, they feel so much alike mentally, they therefore love eachother beyond the grave. There is never a scene where they actually love eachother physically. I think they are half brother and sister. It would explain so much.....For why would a middle-class farmer come home with a boy, an orphan? And his strong feelings for him, he must be treated as their brother...Well people, that is because HE IS!! They look alike (mentally) too much to be coincidental,unaware they recognize eachother, and not as lovers but unconciously as real family. The extent of their resemblance can only be genetic. The book itself is a masterpiece because it leaves everything in the dark and the reader may guess the real circumstances. When your book is finished, it still 'haunts' you. Please read it and have a nice time with it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I am sorry for even hearing about this novel and i am very upset that it was required reading in my high school. It is horrible out-of-date novel about a guy named Heathcliff, and that's where i fell asleep. The description of things in this book take up 8 lines at a time and are unecessary! I don't reccomend this book to anyone!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I recently read the novel Wuthering Heights, by Emily Bronte. As a student, I would not recommend this book to other readers. Unless falling asleep after every chapter of a book classifies it as good, Wuthering Heights is only good as a bedtime story. In the novel, it is said that Heathcliff and Catherine are in love, if this is so they wouldn't have spent their times together trying to hurt one another for pleasure. Heathcliff would have not wished that Catherine not rest in piece because she didn't mention him in her last breaths of air before dying (even though she was unconscious). This relationship that the author portrays as love, really is not love. It is more of a hate than anything. Another thing about this novel in which, I did not quite enjoy was its exaggeration in descriptions of everything. It is great to describe things well enough for the reader to create an image on what is happening in the story, in their mind, but don't push it overboard. For example, Liam O'Flaherty an author of short stories and novels uses great descriptions in his works. In his stories, he was able to create a mental image of the story in reader's imaginations, without letting the story get boring, and without over doing it. The thing is in Wuthering Heights, Bronte explained things out far too well and made the story less interesting. So coming from a student, I would not recommend this book to another student."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is supposed to be \\"one of the most famous love stories in the English language\\" (this is what the back flip of the Oxford University Press edition says), but where is the love? The characters are all selfish and self-obsessed, especially that monster Heathcliff, who even tortured his own son to death for he is hellbent on his imaginary revenge. The other characters are not much better, they are all psychologically immature and unstable, relishing on mentally and sometimes physically abusing others. As a book it also has little about the social institutions of the period, the story takes place within two households, which eventually merged into one with a couple of (I would say incestuous) marriages. The characters are also not very believable (for example, how do they earn their living? How did Heathcliff make his fortune in a short three years? The author does not say). They die far too easily from grief and anger. They have just one thing in mind: to hate and torture others around them. They have little interactions with other people except within their shrinking inbred gene pool. They seem more like the manufacture of a mentally ill social recluse, which I think more or less fits the description of the author herself. It is altogether a very dark and sordid story.I think Emily Bronte could actually write, but what a waste of her gift!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I gave this book 4 stars because after having read it 1 week ago I'm still thinking about it. I still can't decide whether I loved it or hated it. Many people think this book to be about love but I think it's about the opposite...hate. Pure evil takes shape in this book in Heathcliff. Heathcliff's obsession with Catherine is palpable and turns him mad with hatred for everyone and everything in his path. This book is dark, cold, unfeeling and wicked. The death can almost be felt and smelled from the pages. If you enjoy books about death, illness, hatred and obsessive love then this book is for you."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"actually, i didn't find this to be the book that it is pumped up to be. I braced myself for an exciting deep love story, tragic..instead i was bored. The style was not for me, I found it difficult to read, and in the end was just plain dissappoited. Maybe my generation is too tained by TV, James Patterson and Danielle Steele for us to appreciate the finer works."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book is not for people that like happy endings or people that don't appreciate the works of Poe and other \\"dark\\" authors. This is probably my favorite book. What I loved about it? Everything. This is a book about unresolved passions and how they managed to ruin everything and everyone around them.Heathcliff is a \\"dark\\" solitary man whose only interest is winning the eyes of Catherine Earnshaw, a beautiful young girl, who is also his best friend. When she marries Edgar Linton, Heathcliff is resolved to (literally) make their lives hell. And he does, but also destroys himself in the end. It's sad, tragic, passionate, a perfect book really."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"i had heard mixed things about Wuthering Heights, but decided to give it a try on daily lit to see if it could hold my attention. since i've been busy with school i haven't had the chance to read any other way, so it's been a good way to at least feel like i'm reading something.anyhow, the first half or so was rather boring for me, with lots of background and overly descriptive passages. i was definitely glad to be reading it in the daily lit format. i don't think i would have stuck with it otherwise. but, after that, it really picked up, and i found myself clicking for the next installment often.in the end, i can definitely say i enjoyed it, but the dull beginning lent the lower rating. it was quirky and fun and the character development was wonderful. i particularly enjoyed the style of narration and will be much less leary of picking up another bronte book in the future."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I had already known that 'Wuthering Heights' was going to be a dark love story. Therefore, I was unsurprised when I read it and discovered that it was THAT twisted. However, it was also gripping and very interesting. You do not expect a woman in the 1800s to write a book with such romantic passion - because that is where the darkness comes from, the passion that two of the characters have for each other.I really enjoyed this book, though I must admit I was feeling a bit down after I read it. This book will definitely have you re-think Romance. Do you really want that all-consuming love? A love that causes anger, hatred, even death?If you are a fun of romance and old-century books, do not hesitate to pick this book up. If you like gloomy moors, and tales of strife, you shall like this book, too. This is a perfect combination of the two genres.Good reading!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I especially enjoyed the add-ons at the end. Teens will find this fun and interesting."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I both love and hate this book. I've read it twice and every time it breaks my heart.It's wonderfully written and a must read for anyone that hasn't had that pleasure yet."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is beautifully written. I fell in love with Emily Bronte and her cadence of language from the very first chapter.Sadly, I loathed the characters. I sympathized with Heathcliff in the first half of the book and was disappointed to find myself hating him in the second half. I despised Catherine Earnshaw from her introduction in the story until her death. The only character I liked at all was Hareton, and I was happy for the way things turned out for him.Reading Wuthering Heights made me appreciate Jane Austen so much more than I already did! Emily Bronte's female characters continually made me wistfully think of Austen's Elizabeth Bennett, and long for her to inhabit Thrushcross Grange instead of Catherine Earnshaw. The difference between Austen's female characters and Bronte's is shocking. I definitely take the existence of strong willed women in modern fiction for granted, and this reminded me how ahead of her time Jane Austen really was. I would love to read a piece of Austen fanfic in which Elizabeth Bennet bashes Catherine Earnshaw over the head with a frying pan, usurps her as mistress of Thrushcross Grange, and gives Heathcliff AND Mr. Linton a sound thrashing.I was surprised that some describe this story as romantic; I didn't find one word even remotely romantic! I appreciated the Gothic and supernatural elements and the wonderful, descriptive writing style. I have a beautiful image of Thrushcross Grange and Wuthering Heights in my head; I can picture the houses and their rooms, the landscape, the gardens and the hills. Despite the personalities of the characters, I really did enjoy this story and I'm glad to have finally read it.I especially love this new Penguin Classics Deluxe edition. Ruben Toledo's cover is even more gorgeous than the Amazon picture portrays, and the pages and binding are high quality. I definitely plan to purchase the rest of these Deluxe Editions that Penguin has released."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I will refrain from giving a plot outline. Many have already done this and it is such a well known story that many people are familar with it having not even read the book. It is one of the greatest stories of love between two people that are too much alike to really understand each other in the English language. Is it an easy happy read no is it a realistic view of a violently passonate love that is doomed yes. You don't read this book for moon light and romance you read this book for the complete realism in it. We all want happy endings in life. Wuthering Heights gives us a more realistic view of what we all live through. Emily Bronte was over a century before her time."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights has been reviewed ad infinitum, but I wanted to say that this is one of the most beautiful books I own.I was looking for a series of classics that I could purchase in hardcover to spruce up my personal library. I stumbled upon these special editions from Penguin Classics, with covers designed by Coralie Bickford-Smith. I love books, but these books still make me giddy with delight when I pick them up. The covers have so much character and they're sturdy. The fonts are classic and easy to read, and the paper is substantial. The ribbon bookmarks, that match the cover, are a really nice touch. The only bad thing I can say, and it's so minor, is that the binding is a little stiff when the book is new. It loosens as you read.There are more titles available, though some are still exclusive to the UK. I truly hope Amazon and Penguin make all editions available in the US and keep them coming!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is about the relationship between two people named Heathcliff and Catherine. Now, from everything I knew about this book before I read it, I thought the novel was going to be a great love story full of romance and hugging and declarations of devotion. Boy, was I wrong. At the heart of the book is a revenge drama carried out by a man so consumed by hatred that he makes Palpatine from the first Star Wars trilogy look like a nice guy.Heathcliff was raised from childhood with Catherine Earnshaw and her older brother Hindley, but Heathcliff was not related to them. Mr. Earnshaw brought Heathcliff home with him one day after finding him living the life of an orphan on the streets of London. I kinda suspect that maybe Heathcliff was a secret love child Earnshaw had with a mistress in the city. But that's just my take. Heathcliff rapidly becomes Earnshaw's favorite, even more so than Hindley, much to the son's disgust, which fuels an intense hatred and jealousy that only gets worse after the elder Earnshaw dies. Up to that point, Heathcliff had always been treated as a member of the family, but afterwards Hindley treats him as nothing more than a common servant to be abused and made to work his hands to the bone. And by abused, I do mean actual physical beatings. Catherine, the great love of Heathcliff's life, decides that he has nothing to offer her and instead marries Edgar Linton, the son of one of their neighbors. Hindley too, gets married. The only one left out of this whole lovefest is, you guessed it, Heathcliff, and he leaves the windswept moors only to return years later to exact his revenge on both families Monte Cristo style.I was really caught off guard by this book. Like I said, I was expecting a romance instead of a Shakespearean revenge tragedy. That's not to say there isn't a happy ending, but that it takes a long and convoluted path, wrought with broken lives and bittersweet death. What turns Heathcliff into such a monster is that both he and Catherine know that they were meant to be together but she makes the decision to reject him based solely on improving her social standing. And let's be frank, the supposed social mobility she craves doesn't amount to squat when you live out in the middle of nowhere in some backwater Gothic swamp. To me, I can almost see precursors to Faulkner's decaying nobility. Something else that really struck me about the novel was its haunting theme of sexual frustration. What Heathcliff and Catherine feel for each other is very sexual. There isn't any idealistic or poetic flowers growing out of each other's imagination. They see each other for what they are and love each other for what they are. Neither of them were cannibals but I almost felt like if they could find a way to eat each other, they would have.Bronte does a virtuoso job of moving between time periods and showing different generations of the Earnshaws and Lintons as the children of both have to deal with the legacy left them by the destructive failed love of Catherine and Heathcliff. The main narrators of the story are not the two main characters. Instead, the tale is told by Nelly, a maid just a little older than them who was a witness to everything that happened. She tells the story to a certain Mr. Lockwood, a man who is renting a house from Heathcliff many years after all this has gone down. Emily moves from present to past to future and back again during different chapters that really seems a more postmodern way of looking at things. This book was far ahead of its time in terms of novelistic technique.Bronte even takes up the issue of racism in Wuthering Heights, as part of the reason Hindley and the Lintons look down on Heathcliff is because of his \\"dark gipsy skin\\".I look at Catherine as a coward who recognized that Heathcliff was who she was meant to be with, but in her superficial thinking, she was more worried about marrying well (weren't all women of that time the same) than marrying for love. Marrying for love was for peasants. If you had money or land you had to marry an equal or someone higher than you. She chose wrongly and a lot of people had to suffer for it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Beautiful book. I love the fabric cover.

I have a lot of people who want to borrow it, and would if it wasn't on my KINDLE."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a beautiful novel dealing with the human condition connected with love. Emily Bront&#1105; masterfully illustrates how love can dictate human emotion, devotion, and action in everyday life. Through Bront&#1105;'s use of juxtaposition between life and death or heaven and hell, we are introduced to the how love is one of the strongest metaphysical emotions humans acquaint with. This metaphysical passion transcends Mr. Heithcliff's daily routine and drives him to rash decisions of revenge, as well as producing an idea of active and passive forces throughout the novel. This includes the ideals of nature and society being such a force in the development of Catherine as she is unfairly controlled by the forces of Mr. Heathcliff. Bront&#1105;'s use of diction throughout the novel only reinforces the theme through an elegant Yorkshire style. Hefty English accents are thoroughly used, even to the point of confusion. This can most pertinently be noticed with Bront&#1105;'s character Joseph, who carries a heavy accent. All of these devices accumulate to form the imagery of underlying passion that is threaded page by page. Personally, her ability to use such complex and yet detailed imagery to advance the plot astounds me. I would wholly recommend this novel to any individual seeking an understanding to humans' mysterious and controversial collision with love."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Recommended by several friends & was well worth the effort! Found this book to be timeless. Will reread it in the future"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Four stars.

Chose this one because i remembered it to be a love story and i had enjoyed Pride and Prejudice."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Amazon almost always send an email asking customers to review books they have recently purchased. When I recieved one such email asking me to review Wuthering Heights my first thought was that I would not dare to even try to say anything about such a classic book. But I have just finished reading it again after many years and I had forgotten how wonderful and musical it is. The words flow on the pages like music to your ears. The characters are so engaging, even those you love to hate, and the settings are so real. I feel like I have spent the last few days in an eighteenth century manor house, in the kitchen, near the fire, listening to an amazing story being told by a humble house keeper. I think that sometimes today we forget how inspired beautiful prose, can really make us feel, for hours at a time I forgot all my modern day worries and my hectic work load and just enjoyed a truly wonderful reading experience. Do yourself a favour and reread this book, and if you have never read it then do so you wont be sorry."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I didn't care for this book, I found it quite boring, although I had wanted to read it for years and never had the opportunity, it just wasn't my kind of book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a beautiful tale of love and hate. It's a powerful novel, full of emotion and thought. It is a true insight to the human mind and soul. The story begins with Mr. Lockwood, a tenant for Heathcliff to live in Thrushcross Grange. Mr. Lockwood sees Heathcliff and goes home, only to ask one of the servants, Nelly, about Heathcliff's past. The story then is told from her narrative until she decides to end the story to allow Mr. Lockwood to sleep. The story continues in this manner, with Mr. Lockwood going back to Wuthering Heights to see Heathcliff, getting stuck there, etc, etc."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte brings forward the true masterpiece of her era in this novel. While many consider this novel to be one of hate, it is really the story of a love that cannot die, even in the grave.Catherine's slight of Heathcliff is one of the great moments in all of literature. He then goes about making himself worthy of her love. In so doing, he makes many enemies, but anything worth achieving is going to come at some cost. He hates Edgar Linton; he avenges himself through him. His entire purpose in the novel is to prove that he is indeed the true soul-mate of Catherine. All the destruction of earthly morals and customs is indeed okay if only he can be with Catherine for eternity.The ending of the novel also comes to bear. Showing young Catherine, who has the best traits of both her parents being married to Hareton Earnshaw. The story ends in light rather than the bleak atmosphere at the beginning. This point is in keeping with the importance of setting in the Gothic novel.The narration is well handled. For all the people who ascribe nefarious motives to Nelly, I say pshaw! She tells the story from the only point of view possible to a maid in her situation. Lockwood handles the beginning and the end with verve. What makes Emily Bronte so good is that she actually changes the characters in the narration. Nelly is not confused with Lockwood at any point in the story.I highly recommend this novel. I think it is the Masterpiece of English fiction of its era. I think you will like its many layers and its timelessness."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is a novel you will not be able to put down once you started reading. It's very engaging!

I have read it countless times. It is ingrained in me now as part of my own personal myth. I carry Heathcliff and Cathy inside like some people carry The Virgin Mary or Allah inside of them. I read it when I was young because I had to for class and hated it, then years later, I was about eighteen and read it again, and this time Cathy and Heathcliff blew through me and knocked me down as surely as if I were a Linton. Years later it still exerts its strange force over me. People are right, it is not a 'nice' book: its emotional terrain is pitted with violence and terror, brutality and abuse. Wuthering Heights isn't about star-crossed love or the endurance of love over death, Emily Bronte was not concerned with such trivialities. It is about what happens to a person who feels intensely, about how a person who endures such intensity of feeling survives. Heathcliff and Cathy respresent two sides of one thing that Bronte was trying to tell us about. She tells us in such a way that we come back to her only novel time and time again to seek the meaning. Not to be confused with 'Jane Eyre'. Jane Eyre is the tale of an insipid who finally gets her man (big deal) despite puritannical hardship, and though its crie de coeur touches the heart, it never sets it alight. If however, you are interested in being burned, and if some teacher isn't force-feeding you this text, Wuthering Heights might just be the book for you."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book was a little boring at first.

I remember at the time being captivated by the star-crossed lovers Heathcliff and Catherine. I decided recently to reread the story because it had been so long and I had forgotten what had drawn me to it.If this had been my first time reading the story, I would probably give it no more than 2 stars. It is definitely a mood piece. As an angst-filled teen, I can understand my former attraction to brooding characters and missed opportunities. As an adult, with much less angst, I have grown to pity the characters I once held in admiration. To say it plainly, Heathcliff is a d*ck. He was so hell bent on his own vision of revenge that he not only wastes his own life, but ruins the lives of others. The bad boy I was so attracted to 20 years ago is in actuality a loser. So is the story of the teenage girl.I have given this book 4 stars due to sentimentality. If you're looking for a happy ending fairy tale, this is not the book for you. If you're 15 years old with a chip on your shoulder, then this will probably become your favorite classic of all time."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Gotta love this classics.

First of all it was hard to keep up with because the author jumped around to many differnet characters.

The prose is overwrought and the characters . . . for the life of me I am unable to explain other readers' adoration of either Heathcliff or Cathy.

It's told in the first person by different narrators but as I was bored and so unfocused a lot of the time I was sometimes not sure who was narrating. Heathcliffe the 'hero' was annoying and in some ways pathetic and the heroine Cathy seemed like a spoiled brat. I didn't like the use of dialect either- It's a lot easier to read English as it should be written and imagine an accent to it rather than see these strange alien words in print.

Far from being the romanticized feminine icon she is portrayed to be today, the real Emily Bronte was a very lonely and timid young woman who lived 39 years on this planet and accomplished nothing- leaving behind no friends or family to mourn her short time on this earth. She WAS however a precursor to the modern liberal movement in that she too lived in a fantasy world, the only difference being Ms. Bronte actually named her's. She called it \\"Gondal\\"- and described it as a magical place where everything worked out just the way Emily liked and no one could say or do anything she didn't agree with. Yes, this the hero of feminism... If ONLY there had been a literary critic in Gondal, we might have been spared the Wuthering Heights! I usually enjoy \\"classics,\\" those books that, as Clements so astutely pointed out, everyone wants to have read but no one wants to read. But Wuthering Heights? Ach- I hate this book with a passion. The characters are almost all either pathetic, melodramatic, overly hateful, stupid, incredibly annoying, or some combination thereof. Women have a strange tendency to have babies with no prior warning. Live dogs are randomly hung from hooks, apparently to die. And the plot becomes ridiculously predictable once the simple premise is accepted that the hero has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. It was an awful, hateful book- I spent almost the whole time hoping the characters would die of syphilis so I wouldn't have to read about them whining all the time. On the plus side- Wuthering Heights could make a good movie...if they totally changed the dialogue...and reworked the characters completely. Basically, they would have to film an entirely different movie and just keep the setting (and the name) the same. By the time I finished the book I wanted to take my soldering torch and burn it. My only fear was that if I did, Catherine might be resurrected and proclaim her love for Heathcliff profusely as the book burns away. Actually, that would have been a better ending to the story. Alas I suppose I'll just end up using the book as a clay pigeon."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"the book arrived in a short time and in excellent condition.

It wasn't the best book that I've ever read, but it was okay. I thought that the story was very dramatic, and tragic. I loved the language that is used throughout the book. I would recommend it only if you like drama, and romance.This book follows many stories, of basically 3 families. This story gets really complicated. It's really hard to explain without spoiling the book. The best way that I can explain, is that a rich girl falls in love with a servant, and is \\"not allowed\\" to be with him, because of the standards of the time, (the late 1700s). The story follows the lives of these two individuals and what happens to them in their lives.Like I said before, this was an interesting plot.

I was impressed by Bronte's work.. I like how she illustrates the passion and love evident between Cathy and Heathcliff... it is one of the most moving storylines I've read. It's a good classic, and although it's tragic, there are glimpses of happiness here and there in the novel, and the novel ends on a peaceful, concluding note.However, the Yorkshire accent nearly killed me... it was hard to read--I skipped the Yorkshire dialogues almost completely. Also I felt like strangling Cathy and Heathcliff... it was all perfect, but then she had to go do her thing... Yes, I know this was the whole point of the story--conflict--but still, it could have been happier. The novel was very touching and I was left speechless as I quietly closed the book, because Ms. Bronte knows how to describe two people in fervent (though at times.. rampant?) love and how it will endure the tests of time."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"When I first read this book I was a little confused at first.

Their passion is so burning, yet so forbidden that you want to burst.Heathcliff is the best romantic hero of all literature. You just want him to succeed in his good or evil deeds.I think EVERYONE wants a love as strong as Catherine and Heathcliff's. A must read!If you love the book, the best movie version is the 1939 one.I don't get the people who didn't like this book--what were the words too big?But all in all, there is a reason why Wuthering Heights is called one of the greatest love stories and pieces of literature of our time!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"If one wants to be bored into tears, one should invest in this unreasonably terrible.

Dear Bronte, if you're going to write a book, add more to the characters and don't just state the obvious.

I was sorely disappointed. True, the violent love between Heathcliff and Catherine is heartwrenching; however, the most difficult part of this novel for me was that there was no character that was lovable, or sympathetic. Just when I started to think that Heathcliff was not so bad after all, he would commit another shocking deed of horrific cruelty. Catherine was just annoying. I also found the plot hard to follow, what with a third person telling the story, and then swinging back to first person narrative. If you want a really powerful, uplifting love story, read Jane Eyre, or The Blue Castle by L.M.

Do yourself a favor and read Jane Eyre instead."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights great example of mid-18th century literature but lacks the hook needed to engage the reader. The overly dramatic love scenes and long drawn out sections provide the periods of ennui. The characters are poorly developed, and the lack of minor characters leaves the reader wandering. The novel seems to start off sluggishly, and then it picks up, only to be followed by the slowness again. If anything, Wuthering Heights shows the destructiveness of love and revenge through the character Heathcliff. The novel seemed to be one long drawn out soap opera, where the characters rarely changed and new characters were rarely added. Overall, this novel does not meet the adoration that it is constantly given."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"And just why would Ms. Bronte write a book with not a single likeable character? In fact, everyone in the novel would be rejected by Jerry Springer as being too degenerate for his show. No doubt the writing is facile enough, but by page 5, the story itself descends into what has to be the most turgid potboiler imagineable. It's all there: lynching a litter of puppies,hanging a springer spaniel,unceasing child abuse, the brutalization of women, and pretty descriptions of the seasons. Highly recommended for the budding mass murderer."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"What a waste of time, precious time in my life that I will never be able to get back.

It's style is unique alright, if by unique you mean a brand new alternative form of euthanasia. Nevermind the fact that Bronte's \\"paragraphs\\", which are actually composed of one or two extremely long sentences, have superfluous clauses slapped on top of each other repeatedly. The syntax of these sentences is not stiff or constipated, but in fact, it is just the opposite. It is more like the imbibement of heavy laxatives, and the resulting inducement of loose and watery diarrhea that runs across the pages, unpredictable in its rampant tides that sends everyone over the hills. When do the prepositional phrases stop Emily? When? Unfortunately, this was a book that I was required to read for school, and I managed to read a grand total of half of the book before I shut it, never to bother it again. However, what do I know, I'm just a high school student that is just following his personal intuitions about Wuthering Heights. For a more thought-provoking and relevant book in modern-day society, go read George Orwell's 1984. You'd be surprised at how its content trumps the romantic trainwreck that is the brainchild of Emily Bronte."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a book filled with many complex characters, ranging from a self-righteous servant, to a dishonest housekeeper, to a saucy young lady, to a bitter old man. Emily Bronte did an excellent job of creating interesting characters and a riveting plotline. The book starts out in the \\"present\\" which is in the early 1800's. A couple chapters in, Mr. Lockwood, the tenant at Thrushcross Grange asks his housekeeper what the deal is with his landlord, Mr. Heathcliff, and the others that Lockwood has met at Wuthering Heights. His housekeeper, Nelly, proceeds to relate the story of all that took place, going back three generations in time to begin the story. The book is filled with characters that you both like and hate at the same time, and the story is also an interesting study in betrayal, revenge, and forgiveness. The only negative comment I have about the book comes about the character Joseph. Joseph's speech is written in the dialect of the hills area of 19th century England, and is extremely difficult to read or understand. Many times, you as the reader will be able to infer from the surrounding text the general idea of what is being said, but it is often difficult. Overall, I think Wuthering Heights is an excellent book, and definitely worth a buy!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a tale of romance, bitterness, and forgiveness. It is a story that will leaving you feeling sorry for some characters and even bitter towards others. The beginning of the story introduces Heathcliff, a young boy who has had a hard childhood and been left alone. Bront leads you to feel sorry for him. Much of the book is the story of Heathcliff's life, and how it plays into the lives of the other characters. I see through Heathcliff's life a life lesson: through our difficulties in life, we have two choices. We can let these things make us stronger people, or we can let the troubles ruin us. Let's just say that Bront doesn't choose the \\"storybook\\" path for Heathcliff's life.This novel is one I would recommend reading. On this note, don't get discouraged reading the first few chapters--they were the most difficult of the book. Once you get past these, and begin to understand the story line, Wuthering Heights is an enjoyable book. If you don't like a typical romance, read this book anyway! There's nothing typical about it. Bront filled her pages with anger, passion, romance, and various emotions. She will capture your attention as you become entangled in the web of confused relationship between Edgar and Catherine, Catherine and Heathcliff, Cathy and Linton and others."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a tale filled with love, hate and the unexpected on every page. Three generations of characters are portrayed, each having a distinct personality and story. The main character, Heathcliff's situation and position as a young child causes the reader to have sympathy. It may even leave the person with a sense of grief and sorrow for the child who seems to be the victim of the plot. Don't be fooled! Heathcliff deserves not to be seen as a victim but rather a villain for the agony, grieve, and heartache that he inflicts on so many lives. The novel picks up rather slowly and takes a number of chapters before the reader is best able to understand the major characters. The plot twists and turns and is filled with enticing details to keep the reader engaged.I would highly encourage reading this only work by Emily Bronte. While this book will cause the reader to feel a mixture of emotions it is definitely a must read. Determine for yourself whether you feel sympathy for Heathcliff or you think he is the heinous villain who causes the unease and chaos found in almost every chapter. This work left me cringing at many of the terrible details but all and all it is a tremendous piece of literature."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a book about love and forgiveness. Emily Bronte keeps our attention through the passion of the main characters and powerful quotes such as, \\"My greatest thought in living is Heathcliff. If all else perished, and HE remained, I should still continue to be.....Nelly, I AM Heathcliff! He's always, always in mind: not as a pleasure......but as my own being.\\"Bronte's book starts out kind of slow, but as you continue reading through, the story picks up and captures your attention. The dynamic of the characters and their relationships with one another brings such enthusiasm to the story that as you read through, you find yourself becoming a part of the story- you find yourself wanting to tell Nelly Dean to speak up and stop withholding information and you want talk to Catherine and tell her to give Heathcliff a chance and you want to tell Heathcliff that he needs to forgive so many people in his life so that he can have a chance at a real and peaceful life! Bronte does an excellent job bringing her characters to life.The story also has an element of surprise woven throughout- which keeps you coming back to continue reading through each chapter. Bronte goes through three generations of this particular family in a way that is captivating and exciting. As the story unfolds you get to see how each character is related to the other while discovering why they are like they are- you realize why Heathcliff is so bitter and why Hareton is so under-educated and why young Catherine is living with her father-in-law and cousins.The ending is not as satisfying as the rest of the book, but it does end in a uniquely mysterious way.http://www.amazon.com/review/create-review?ie=UTF8&nodeID;="},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The first time I heard of Wuthering Heights, was honestly when I was reading one of the Twilight series novels and the main character was reading it. So, I was glad to have the opportunity to read this and see what it was all about. After finishing it, I still would recommend reading this book. It is truly an interesting love story. Now, even though it is a love story, I bet you have not read about this kind of love. It is a tragic and dark story of a passionate and consuming devotion. Emily Bronte had the ability to intertwine the love between Catherine and Heathcliff in every scene and relationship the characters shared. Bronte uses great description of her characters as the narrator, Nelly, tells the of the lives at Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange. What you should know before you read this, is that some of the language of the servants is hard to understand. However, try to push through it and you will be able to get a rough understanding of what the character was trying to say. Besides this, Wuthering Heights will keep you entertained and wondering who's love is true and how the novel concludes."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights by Emily BronteI wasn't sure exactly what to expect when I picked up Wuthering Heights to read from my one college course, but I was, over time, pleasantly surprised. The first five chapters proved, for me, to be the most challenging, simply because I was adapting to Bronte's writing style. Honestly, if you frequently read literature from this time period then you will have no problem settling in. It took no time to realize that Emily paid close to attention to the development of her characters. After finishing the book I felt extremely acquainted with each character, and felt almost a loss when I had to say goodbye. One of the things I struggled with was Joseph's dialogue throughout the book. He was hard to follow, and I can't help but say that it almost distracted from the plot in comparison to enhancing it. Bronte told one of the strangest love stories in relation to how each individual expressed their affections. It's a story that leaves the reader at times a little bit baffled at the outcome, but it also creates unprecedented twist in turns throughout the book. It's also a book that I believe has a huge amount to say about forgiveness, and can shed light on its importance through learning from others who make poor decisions. To be honest, there are very few books that transport you directly into the world of the writer like Wuthering Heights."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I would definitely classify Wuthering Heights as one of the best books I've read. Packed with drama and intrigue, this piece of art will keep you riveted throughout. Written in old English, it is absolutely fascinating how Emily Bronte pieced this intricate storyline together. Besides the slight difficulty in visualizing Joseph's speech, with a strong Yorkshire accent, I found it relatively easy to read. The chaos and insanity that pursues throughout this novel kept me coming back for more, with sadness when I reached the end because it was over. The characters are developed well through different circumstances, depicted through the eyes of the housekeeper, Nelly Dean - a conniving participant in the drama. Be prepared to have your emotions run away with you as you get caught up in the action. It's a great book to sit down and sift through on a cold, winter's day. I found the story very realistic in the portrayal of everyday choices made through these diverse, strange characters, and could even relate to them in some senses. This controversial book would be a great choice to use in a book club where you would have the opportunity to discuss the outcomes and potentials Bronte confronts."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Passion for the passionless: A battle of the hearts!Emily Bronte, though only in her 20's, manifested one of the most unforgettable dark love stories of all times. Though her book was not well received after it was first published, the volume and the positive feedback she has received hundreds of years later speaks in volumes for the masterful quality of Wuthering Heights! Standing in stark contrast with a fairy tale love story, Bronte embarked on a difficult quest of being realist lessons and qualities into the passion she was skillfully gifted with.Bronte developed and heighted this sensational love story through numerous characters in the story and throughout three generations. Such love unfolds with a girl named Catherine, raised in the moors of England, and a gypsy boy named Heathcliff, a homeless starving boy that was saved from death by Catherine's father. Through the years, their affection for one another turns into a wild passion that will stand through the tests and the trials they create. At the ages of 16 and 17 years old, a misunderstanding occurred between the two lovers and created a permanent wedge between them forever. Heathcliff had disappeared for three years and Catherine had married a passionless man, Edgar Linton. Tension picks back up when Heathcliff suddenly reappears on Catherine's doorstep, eager to rekindle the passion that he is so determined that they both shared. From this encounter, Catherine's heath declines and she later dies, but the last kiss she bears is Heathcliff's. Through her death comes life, as Catherine's last contribution to this world was a daughter named Cathy. During this time a young boy, Linton, was born to the wife of the miserable Heathcliff. After Catherine's death, Heathcliff becomes more revengeful and manipulating than ever. Though his aching from his heart adds fuel to his actions, Heathcliff soon masters in manipulating young Cathy to marry a sickly Linton when they get around the ages of 16 and 17. Though one can see the parallels in linking this relationship to the first, one also sees the difference of a selfless love that goes deeper than just emotions.As you read this novel, you will encounter many of the symbolic and realistic themes that are embedded throughout this novel. The forgiveness theme from this novel has impacted my life, for one can see that the revenge, bitterness, and hurt that Heathcliff lived under this whole life only put him in his grave faster and did not allow him to produce anything successful or hopeful. In addition, one can see a glimpse of what true love looks like. True love is not an emotion, an appearance, or even an action. It a selfless love that penetrates one's soul, like that of young Cathy and Hareton walking in the moors that looks beyond the faults and seeks to better the other person involved. As a fellow Christian, this love reminds me to that of the Biblical love in a marriage that we are too represent. Though I liked majority of the book, I disliked how Bronte used the old dialect for Joseph. I would highly encourage readers of this amazing book to get a published form that will have side notes at the bottom revealing what Joseph is talking about. I found that he didn't have a huge role in the book except for stability, but he does make some key statements that I felt the dialect lessened the importance of their intended impact. I would encourage anyone who is interested in this book to buy a copy and read it! It truly is a classic on every level. It gives a whole new light into the human depths of a romantic tragedy."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is the name of the house where the love story between Heathcliff and Catherine takes place.

Here's why:Confusing -- Several characters all share the same/similar names which sometimes makes it confusing.Unsympathetic characters -- I felt that Heathcliff was such a total jerk that he didn't deserve any sympathy whatsoever. So that made it hard for me to sympathize with the woman who loved him, which in turn forced me to reject the concept of this being a love story. Even the most vile villans of all time usually exhibit one small redeeming quality. I felt that Healthcliff didn't and thus I didn't care what happened to him or his love interest.Boring -- Nothing good happens.If you like Emily Bronte nothing I say here will change your mind, but if you don't or are reluctant, then stay away from this one."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Well as if the Nineteenth Century weren't bad enough we now have Penguin shoving it down our maws every other day with another re-issue of some tepid &quot;classic.&quot; Miss Bronte has done it again and wielded her magic pen as a wand and cast her net of sleep on the unsuspecting reading public of America. The only consolation the non-preteen girl reader can get form this sack of slumber is the final realisation that &quot;wuthering&quot; is British slang for &quot;your eyelids are getting heavy, why don't you just nod off?&quot; I really have to say to Miss Bronte that I did not find Garfield's antics convincing in the least."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I know this is a classic loved by many. I, however, did not enjoy reading it. I read it through to the end, but it was tough. I did not like any of the characters except for Nelly, & Cathy (the daughter). When the dialogue was of Joseph, it was extremely difficult to read. I had to force myself to read it aloud just to figure out what he was saying. I don't like to work that hard when reading a book. For its time, I know it was a grand book. The writing was fine, but it was depressing and almost all the characters too flawed for my taste."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Brilliantly written; I'll give the novel that much. The plot masterfully contrived, characters well developed, settings enigmatically constructed, the novel as a whole was from a literary standpoint a success. However, the language is consistently dark throughout. The wording carries heavy negative overtones and a depressed, pessimistic and even evil mood pervades from the first to the end. Relief from the darkness finally breaks through only in the end when one character steps beyond herself and assists another in elevating himself. Otherwise, bitterness and selfish ambition drive the story. The depravity runs rampant from bad to worse as characters systematically use, degrade, and abuse one another to work out their bitterness stemming from one father's mistakes and failed parenting.If you love unique, dark characters, twisted plots, and the study of the effects of family dysfunction on a multigenerational level than the novel will not only be worthwhile, but also enjoyable as few would disagree with Emily Bronte's genius as a writer. However, I would caution that the book might not best be read in the dead of winter or over a prolonged rainy spell as it is rather depressing. But on a sunny, warm day, with ample positive diversions, the novel may not only be a challenging companion, it will likely make you very thankful for the companions you personally have that are altogether so unlike the characters in the story."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"'Wuthering Heights' by Emily Bronte is a dark, brooding novel of unfulfilled love. Most everyone dies young and unhappy. Everyone seems to fall in love with first cousins, which has me believe their strange behavior is in part due to in-breeding. And there is our lead male character, Heathcliff, who leads a vindictive and sadistic life after losing his honey, Catherine (..she was also a bit loopy, and died young). This book is whole-heartedly depressing, and not at all romantic ... unlike the famous film adaptation with Merle Oberon and Lawrence Olivier.So I really cannot see why this book is so highly rated. Oh, the prose itself is okay. The dialogue is fine. But the story is so narrowly focused (the romantic failings of two intermingled families in rural Yorkshire circa 1800) and the characters morose. Healthy amounts of anti-depressants and a Majorca vacation are needed for these fools.Bottom line: almost laughably dark and twisted. Emily Bronte must of been one very unhappy woman."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"&quot;It is as if Emily Bronte could tear up all that we know human beings by, and fill these unrecognizable transparencies with such a gust of life that they transcend reality.&quot; -Virginia WoolfDamn straight, sister! I gotta tell you, read this book in the *summer time*. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT, read this in the gloom of winter, as I stupidly did.The epic story of Catherine and Heathcliff plays out against the dramatic backdrop of the wild English moors, and presents an astonishing vision of fate and obsession, passion and REVENGE.This classic book is a bummer. Not that it's bad writing, but my oh my.. it makes you so sad! Your heart just goes out for Heathcliff and the depression he faces. But also, the um... &quot;inter-breeding&quot; (*blush*) is quite disturbing!! One cousin marries one other cousin and they have kids who marry their other cousins, I was just surprised that the whole lot of them weren't, &quot;messed up&quot;.I really wouldn't recommend this book for happy people. If you want some romance and a historical novel, read &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. My favorite."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"It was very hard for me to get into this story. The words were very old-fashioned, and some scenes seemed to go on for a long time. I thought it had a good plot, but I really only liked the first half. It took me a long time to finish this, and when I finally did, I felt that it ended abruptly."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I just can't past the boring words to understand the plot. There is this guy who wants to take revenge on everyone, but he loves this one girl, that he can't have, and he marries this other girl to get her money. What is going on here? It sounds like a season of All My Children or any other day-time soap opera. Maybe everyone from the Heights and the Grange should appear on Jerry Springer and fight it out. Needless to say, I did not like the gypsy orphan and the bratty little princess whining about everything that came their way. I bet Geraldo could get them to confront each other about thier problems."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"My high school students liked this edition of Wuthering Heights because of the slightly larger print and the glossary and vocabulary section in the back of the book. They felt that this edition was easier to read and, because of the additional information in the back of the book, understand."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Although some of the plot elements seem preposterous today the story remains a great read. What a love story! A great tale of people sometimes setting in motion awful events due to their desire to do what they see as right in their own eyes. Recommended. Well-written."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Instead of focus on sad love story, I have quite differnet perspectives to approach. I have a view that their tragically unfulfilled love was something that they could have overcome sufficiently by themselves although there were a lot of psychological and social pressures. Those external factors were merely a word 'pressure'. True obstacle was existed in Catherine itself. Even after she married to Edgar, her fluctuations of mind was psychologically abnormal and very egoistic in some point of view. For fulfillment of metaphysical areas, she was always craved the Heathcliff and for materialistic basis she wanted the Edgar. It is a typical ambivalent feeling that we should avoid. In addtion, it is pretty romantic but these excessive histronic characteristics of this prose made me tired partially. Thus, we should not only focus on sad love story affairs but also about implications that truly inculcate matters between human being throughout this long fable."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Brot's \\"Wutheting Heights\\" is a two sided coin. The whole narrative is contructed over doubles and juxtapositions -- with elements arranged into pairs. From the basic conflict of love against hate, the writer brings up the most and lest noble feelings and actions -- always making pairs and putting one against the other.To begin with, the narrative is divided into two distinct poles, each representing a different generation. Structurally speaking, the first part -- the one that includes Catherine, Heathcliff, Isabella, Edgard -- is stronger and more important, while the second segment works as a sort of anticlimax dealing with the love of the second generation --young Catherine, Linton, Hareton. Another double point is that there are two Catharines, being the second one the daughter of the former. They both have many resemblances, physically and psychologically. But the young Catharine is an amalgam of her mother's and father's personality.\\"Wuthering Heights\\" is a generational drama. Two generations have to face the same problems that they parents had. But at the same time, Bront deals with the gap of one generation to another. The same dramas do not have the same conclusion. Time has passed, minds and behavior have changed. In this fashion, the book tackles life as a process that is in constant change.Places are also battling against each other. The main stage for the action is the Wuthering Heights, while the other part of the narrative happens in the Thurshcross Grange. The first, as the name gives away, exploits the wildness, the extremity, the unstoppable love. On the other hand, the Grange represents the social status and the aristocracy. At the same time, they represent Catharine inability to choose between Heathcliff (WU) and Edgard (TG).Despite not being a success when first published in 1847, Brot's \\"Wuthering Heights\\" became a cult with time. Nowadays it is considered one of the most important novels ever written. Not a bad change for a book that received much critics when published and the writer had to use a masculine pen name in order to be considered serious.As Gothic novels go, not only structurally is \\"Wuthering Heights\\" a very brave effort, but also thematically this book defied its genre. Following the gothic tradition of the late XVIII Century, the books has elements like supernatural aspects, moonless nights, valorization of the grotesque. But, despite these strong points, what remains more popular in the book is its characters and their love story, Catherine and Heathcliff.The narrative is told by many different narrators from various sources, like letters, diaries entries etc, therefore there isn't an unbiased narrator. Nelly tells most of the story to Mr. Lockwood. She watched most of events she describes, however she remains as an unreliable narrator, once she injects her own view of the facts and characters. That is why it is so important to read between the lines in this book.Thinking of more contemporary concepts, \\"Wuthering Heights\\" is like yin and yang, dealing with two basic principles of the universe: love and hate -- both inhabiting the same people. Since the novel deals with the human nature, Bront's single novel is timeless and appeals to most readers."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"In addition to the complete text of Wuthering Heights, this volume contains selected poems of Emily Bronte and articles of criticism by such noted authors as E. M Forster and Mark Shorer. Shorer's essay is an introduction to another edition and provides background information on Emily Bronte and her family, a valuable \\"family tree\\" of the characters in W. H., and a perceptive interpretation of the novel."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"bronte's story of life on the moors in england revolves around the earnshaw and litton families. the \\"adopted\\" son of the earnshaw's, heathcliff, and his passion (i'm reluctant to call it love) for catherine, the legitimate daughter, is the centerpeice of the novel.heathcliff is probably one of the most evil characters in literature. he destroys everything in his path, including catherine. his motivation appears to be revenge, but his actions go well beyond a reasoned response and continues thru subsequent generations to innocent offspring. the imagery surrounding heathcliff and the moors helps create the ominous setting. heathcliff actually appears to be possessed either by the devil or by catherine as she exclaims, \\"i am heathcliff.\\"the story ends somewhat ironically in that all that heathcliff has achieved in his revenge is overturned by the next generation.the shortcoming of the story is that heathcliff is beyond the pale. how can catherine love him when he is the devil incarnate? the story which takes on a ghostlike quality particularly at the end, would have been better as a haunting of heathcliff rather than a tale of revenge. heathcliff could have been a very sympathetic character and you would have then cared about what happened to him.but then again who am i to challenge a classic. read it on your own and decide."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is my favorite book. The characters in this book truly touched my heart. The characters, the story, the setting, are all so realistic, gripping, profoundly touching, it's hard to even describe the range of emotions one goes through when reading this book. I've read a wide variety of books: modern, classic, mystery, romance, suspense, drama; this book stuck with me more than all others. The last time I read it was several years ago, but I can still picture the scenes and hear the dialog. It is an amazing book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is truely a classic novel. Bronte's wonderful tale of Heathcliff, mainly, is an excellent though provoking novel. It contains everything, and a reader who indulges in any genre of novels will no doubt love this story.This novel takes place on the moors in the late 1700's into 1802 England. Heathcliff is taken in by Mr. Earnshaw, owner of Wuthering Heights. Heathcliff, becomes beloved by Cathrine Earnshaw, but despised by her brother Hindley. Catherine, however falls in love with Edgar Linton, heir to Thrushcross Grange. She denies Heathcliff's proposal, for she claims it to be too much of anm embarassment to marry him and marries Edgar Linton. The novel tells of tells of the characters and their intense fellings toward one another, as time goes on and their childern grow."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering heights is remarkable. No other book was able to characterize the human behavior in such a way.a love story that shows all sorts of feelings like hatred, revange, friendship...A book that has been well received for so long and in so many places, can make you feel happy, angry and many others along the reading because you can actually see yourself in the character\`s shoes. There is no doubt that Wuthering heights is a master piece."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The writing is descriptive yet very structural, which, in turn has a lack of smoothness. The Yorkshire accent could have been better but all in all the story was a turn since quite a few that told me the story is sad. Sad indeed, but it didn't trigger my emotion. A story pleasantly told, it lacks little. The characters are brilliant; they're realistic and very human if not humane.It is a story to remember and a story to remember is a story worth reading."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Though this may be a romance, it isn't one in the Nora Roberts sense of the word (thankfully). Rather, it is a romance in the Shakespearian sense that it is neither comedy nor tragedy. It does have romantic aspects sprinkled throughout, but that is not the most important aspect. Rather, it is a dark, brooding novel that focuses far more on loss, revenge, and the deterioration of the human soul than it does on love or anything else the average person might conceive of as \\"romantic.\\"In many ways, it parallels Milton's Paradise Lost, if in a metaphorical sense. We have Heathcliff as the devil (as he is often referred to throughout) and his fall from grace. We have both Catherines as Eve-type characters in slightly different ways, and as I explain below, it is their choices (often under the infernal influence of Heathcliff) that determine the future of the narrative, much as Eve's choice determines the future of humanity. We even have the loss of paradise toward the end, but with the hope of eventual salvation and a return thereto (i.e., as Paradise Regained is suggested in the last book of Milton's epic).The characters of Wuthering Heights are a generally unlikable bunch of flawed human beings provoking and being provoked by each other. Strikingly realistic for a \\"romantic\\" novel. It is the strong, independent women of the novel who are the foundational characters around which the book revolves. They are the focus of attention, and it is only through them that the male characters are able to accomplish whatever ends they set out to accomplish. In fact, one of the main struggles of the book can be seen as the attempts of the women to remain independent of the male characters' repeated attempts at subjugation and control. Interestingly, it is always the women who end up with the choice as to result will prevail in each battle of this war.In this sense, Wuthering Heights can be seen as a feminist novel, but not as a preaching one. Rather, Bronte seems to strive for the reader to understand the strength and resiliency of her women through their subtle control of the narrative and their resistence to the constant pressure that the male characters exert from attempting to take that power away. One final example of this is through the framing of the narrative itself. Though superficially told by Mr. Lockwood, he is initially relating Ellen Dean's story verbatim through the first half of the book. However, halfway through, he discards Ellen and \\"summarizes\\" the story she told him off-screen. In other words, he attempts to dominate the telling of the narrative as Heathcliff, Edgar, Hareton, and Hindley attempt to dominate the women of the novel at various points. Yet, like all the other dominations throughout the novel, this narrative domination fails as well. Ultimately, Ellen is able to reassert herself as the official storyteller over the last few chapters, but what was the effect of losing her immediate voice for the intermediate period, I'll leave up to you to interpret. I'm still working it out myself."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I have to say it: I did not like the book. I willingly admit that Emily Bronte had heaps of talent and writes beautifully, but I couldn't bring myself to like any character in the book. They all seemed, rude, selfish, and insane to me, and there were very few or no aspects in which I could relate to or sympathize with them. In short, I have nothing against the writer, and her style, but the plot and characters in this story, are in my opinion, overdone and stretched beyond believability."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wow! I may be only twelve, but this is a wonderfull book! I enjoy reading classics, this one especialy. Despite the author growing up with an excentric father in a house far removed from the rest of humanity, she was able to create a wonderfull book of friendship, love and tragedy."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I don't know what people see in this book. I found it irritating from the start -- all the characters are thoroughly unlikeable. After slogging my way through a quarter of the book, I found I still couldn't care less what happened to these people.The writing is also painfully verbose and florid. For a better story, I would have been willing to cope with it, but here it was just another reason to put the book down and never pick it up again."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I thought I was going give this a bad rating because I hated Heathcliff and Cathy Earnshaw so much that I couldn't bear to read any more, but that's the reason why I gave it high marks! It's been awhile since a novel has brought out such feelings in me! Frankly, Cathy and Heathcliff deserved one another; I hated Cathy because she was so selfish she did not deserve to be loved by anyone with a good heart, like Edgar; I hated Heathcliff because he was such a monster with no heart towards anyone else other than Cathy. I was sick to my stomach the way he punished those around him. I don't know why Heathcliff was so fond of Cathy either. There was nothing about her to love! I loved Missus Dean though. She had the strongest spirit and I found her a refreshing character amidst the madness of all the others. This book was incredibly tragic and even hard to get through because it is such a downer. It's like when you think it couldn't get worse, it does! I didn't give the book 5 stars, however, because I found the ending weak and abrupt. Other than that, a worthwhile read!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I recommend the novel Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte. The plot is clear and simple to understand but it is charged with energy throughout the whole book. When Emily Bronte writes there are no questions as to what she means about scenes that she describes. She does this through her choice of words. She always gives a clear description of places and people. Heathcliff and Catherine are her most passionate characters in this novel. She expresses their love and devotion to each other by their actions through out the whole novel. She does not come out and tell the reader things, she makes them use their imagination and interpret scenes and characters themselves.One of the negative aspects to this novel is the ability to understand the vocabulary. Bronte uses a lot of extensive vocabulary through out the whole novel and this makes some of the sentences and scenes hard to comprehend. This is because Bronte knows exactly what she wants her readers to get or see out of Wuthering Heights.One of the main themes in this novel is love and hate. Catherine is a prime example of this theme. Her feelings for her husband, Edgar, and her feelings toward Heathcliff should be in reverse. Through out the whole novel she loves Heathcliff. The hate comes into play because Heathcliff hates Edgar because he with Catherine and he is not with Catherine. He hates anyone that tries to come in between him and Catherine.The characterization of the characters by Bronte was very excellent. She lets the reader know certain characteristics of the characters by scenes and background information. She demonstrates certain connections between different sets of characters very well. For example the scene when Heathcliff and Catherine went to see the two Linton children it compares both sets to each other.Overall this book is interesting and has many different themes and interesting topics. I recommend this book to anyone that enjoys reading and likes different characters and plots. Although the vocabulary at times is hard to understand it can be dealt with."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Of all the things committed to paper, why on Earth was it this? Having been forced to read this tripe under penalty of death in high school, and then once again in college, I must say that death is welcome. Oh poor poo-poo Heathcliff the Brooding and Catherine the ill fated strumpet. Yawn. Emily Bronte lived one of those lives like that of the other Emily, you know, Dickenson, who is another pile of rubbish altogether. Lonely days and cold nights with her father, and no hot little encounters with a horny gardener from Spain. All Emily Bronte needed was a good tango, but I fear that she was too chaste. And so the world must bear the weight of this tragedy, of its endless reprints which will mark the end of Time. Of course you can love this book and curl up with it at night as if it were your secret lover, or teddy bear, (Even if your teddy bear is your secret lover.) and listen to that song by Michael Penn, or whoever wrote that piece of yack. I don't care. I believe that this book sucks, and it is not worthy of being in the Canon. It should be banished to the realm of Cheesy Teeny-Bopperazzi Romance Goo in the back of a used book store somewhere in Northern Alberta."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I was put through this 'book' when studying Higher English. It is undoubtedly the single worst piece of literature I have ever had to read. What is worse that I had to read it twice, take notes, answer questions, memorize quotes, and in 9 days am sitting an exam in which it will feature rather heavily. You cannot truly hate a book until you have studied it in detail. The problem with it is the fact that about half the words in the book are adjectives. E. Bronte spends so long lavishing useless and totally superfluous descriptions on every scene that I dozed off and missed any point that the events may have had. Then there is Heathcliff, who actually does very little, but merely has circumstances favour him about a dozen times - and he's supposed to be one of the most evil characters ever? The rest of the characters are not much better - they are flat and predictable, although I can't imagine why anyone would be interested enough to wonder about what's going to happen. By the end, I was wondering if I'd fallen asleep and missed the climax - which would have been possible - but I could account for every excruciating page and therefore I can only conclude that the trivial, unsurprising non-events that the narrative lurched between were supposed to be climactic. If this is a classic story, then so is an eight-page picture book that's only strength is very detailed - but not well-drawn - pictures. Please feel free to send me mail to argue about my review."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I began reading--&quot;though you mayn't believe it,&quot; to quote Lewis Carroll's Mock Turtle--at the age of 1 and 9 months. Since then I have read literally thousands of books. And of them all, &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; is my least favorite. The characters are so unpleasant and cruel to each other that reading the book is a seemingly endless nightmare. It seems that almost everyone in the story eventually dies some physically or psychologically horrible death, and the two major characters other than the two first-person narrators get engaged to each other at the end in an attempt to give the book a bizarre happy ending. About the only good thing about the book is its intriguing narrative structure, in which a man sets down in his diary a long first-person narrative told him by a woman who sometimes repeats briefer stories told her in the first person by others, such as Catharine. Even this, though, is rendered irritating by the fact that the diarist is such an boring and annoying character. I would never have continued reading this book beyond the first few chapters had it not been a school assignment, and I felt a greater sense of relief when I finished it than on any other occasion in my life. To quote what C. S. Lewis once wrote on the last page of a book he had read (I forget which one), &quot;Never again.&quot;"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Don't buy this book without reading carefully the description.

I purchased this to read it again. That should tell you how much I love this book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"RIVETING PLOT. HARD TO PUT DOWN AND WHEN YOU DO YOU WONDER WHAT WILL BE NEXT SO STRONGLY YOU HAVE TO START READING AGAIN. I LIKE THE THIRD PERSON STORY TELLING FORMAT."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I found this book quite confusing at first, as you are just thrown into the situation and most of the story is disclosed through a narrative by the housemaid to a new tenant. I'm also just starting to get used to the way people were referred to back in those times. One character can wear many names: Miss Earnshaw, Miss Catherine, Missy, Cathy, Mrs. Linton; makes it appear there are five characters right there instead of just one. Although I did eventually figure out that Cathy was actually Catherine's daughter, but I still have a hard time keeping characters straight in classic books.While I probably wouldn't classify this book as a page turner, when I do set it down, I don't set it down for long. I often can't wait to pick it up and hear more of the story, hoping it will all makes sense eventually. One is told the characters at the present time of the book, the housekeeper starts her story with a completely different situation, and as the story unfolds I cannot help but wonder what could possibly transpire to get the cast of characters where they are \\"today\\".I'm torn between hatred of Heathcliff and pity. Was he heartless because he was a scoundrel or because his heart had been broken to bits?I still find it hard to understand dialogue when it is spelled phonetically based on the character's speech patterns. Mark Twain is also known for doing this. I find it easiest to read these passages aloud and pray my family doesn't think I am nuts. But still I found that I couldn't understand a word that Joseph said. The gist of what I did get from him, he probably wasn't saying anything very nice anyhow. It doesn't seem that he had ever heard the adage \\"if you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all\\". I'd have sacked his sorry butt and sent him packing if I had been lord of the manor.Is it just me or were people more apt to fall ill back then? The housekeeper/narrator had been out in the rain and gotten her feet wet. As a result she was bed ridden for THREE weeks. Jane Bennet, in Pride and Prejudice, was sick for months after getting caught in the rain. One could argue that we have better doctors today, though I'm not sure I would agree, or that they didn't have Nyquil back then. Personally, I often get caught in the rain without need of either a visit to my general quacktitioner or over the counter cold medicines. There were other illnesses where the cause of which seemed strange to me, but I don't want to go into specifics for fear of giving away too much of the book.One thing I found humorous, the main female character compares a situation in her life to a passage in another book which I just finished."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I disliked this book thoroughly--it was completely different from what I thought it would be. I couldn't even find a character that LIVED that I liked and was rooting for. By the end, I really disliked them all. If you are looking for a nice romantic read like Jane Eyre or Emma or Persuasion then DON'T read this book. I am sure it is classical literature and makes a nice commentary on society, but as I was not reading this for an English class, I wouldn't know about any of that. I was not analyzing it, I wanted to read it for fun but didn't enjoy it at all."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"A classic, indeed. For someone not too fond of reading, this book has recaptured my interest in the activity. It is a significant and profound notch on the belt of the ever-enrapturing theme of the tragic love triangle. The 1992 film version of the novel is what first captured my attention. After seeing that film I had to pick up the book. It was the first book I've read in months and I'm glad that this was the read I chose. For some, the language may be a bit of a stretch to understand at first, but it quickly becomes 2nd nature (it's no \\" Nadsat,\\" courtesy of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE). The archaic punctuation and diction, as well as the unwarned flip-flop of narrators may lead to some turbulence in the read, but that's nothing a good dose of patience and willingness to reread the page won't cure. A plethora of the more critical reviews have pointed out that many, if not all of the characters are unlikable at least part of the time if not continuously, but I argue that it's their flaws and the causes of their flaws which make these same cruel characters interesting and worthy of our sympathy (sometimes). The novel draws upon very human emotions and very human reactions to those emotions which should satiate any readers' unconscious internal hunger for the exploration of human depth and dynamics."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I read this book because is a must read and I heard it mentioned in many movies/shows that I thought I had to give it a try. I was not interested in the beginning but it turned out to be a page turner although I was disappointed at how it ended, not sure there was any other way to end it but while reading it I wondered if there was a movie about it (never searched to see)...some how I kept picturing Gerald Butler as Heathcliff."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I certainly liked it.... I guess the only thing that is so very frustrating to me and most surely the point of the novel, is the destruction of all involved in this story. The love is not love at all but total obsession and selfishness. Its a cautionary tale. I used to think it was supposed to be romantic, but after reading it and also seeing the BBC version of Wuthering Heights I am convinced that Emily Bronte thought to diadactically show the writer that what some call love is no LOVE at all."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I've always been a sucker for reading the classics and finally got a chance to read this one.

These hoary old classics such as WH or JANE EYRE or Thomas Hardy's output or Dickens along with hundreds of others have withstood the test of time for a reason, and although they may not be to everyone's taste, they won't need any help from me to keep their place on bookshelves. My problem has always been one of 'familiarity with a book's cover breeds contempt'. I've seen copies of WUTHERING HEIGHTS for about as long as I've been able to read; I've seen it so often there comes a point where I convince myself that I already know what the novel is, since I know (from dust jacket material) what it's _about_.WUTHERING HEIGHTS also suffers from the image of its film adaptations (none of which I've seen). Still, it's hard to have lived anywhere but under a rock and not have seen at least snatches of Merle Oberon and Laurence Olivier in the 1939 film, or any of the more recent remakes. Those glimpses have always made me consider WUTHERING HEIGHTS as a ghostly gothic romance, although it is really nothing of the sort. Instead it is a wildly fierce tale of obsession and revenge, implacably engineered by the monstrous Heathcliff, who seems more a force of nature than simply a human. And yet, the revenge motif - while guiding the bulk of the tale - is in itself only part of what constitutes the power in the novel. The mix of primal emotions and the veneer of civiliation together standing out in stark relief agains the unearthly backdrop of the moors suggests mythic archetypes in the mold of Tristan and Isolde. To think that this novel came from the mind of a twenty-nine-year-old 'reclusive spinster in a rural Yorkshire parsonage' (from Diane Johnson's introduction), is at once baffling and intimidating.For those readers who may have looked at this book over the years and passed by from a mistaken idea - as I did - that you already knew the contents, I would highly recommend taking a few days to actually crack the covers. While it isn't a perfect book, there's no question of its forcefulness, and even if it doesn't exactly strike your fancy, you'll know for sure why it is that you've avoided it. For other, younger readers, I would also recommend it as an excellent addition to your reading list. In my few years of reading, I don't think I've read anything quite like it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Who knew the classics could be so entertaining! I enjoyed the warring families, showing not all the old times as wonderful."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"first, allow me to say that i am quite enjoying these puffin classics editions of some of my favorite novels!'wuthering heights' is full of mystery, romance, and winding ghost stories; atmospheric moors and the winds rushing over them. you can practically feel the english countryside and its beauty and harshness (it is a character unto itself). i would love to delve into the plot, but would hate to give away any plot points.a bonus here with the puffin classics is the addition of backstory included at the end of the book. here you can learn more about the author, the story, the characters, and so much more. what a delightful thing to include!i have purchased most of these puffin classics editions, and will certainly look for future additions to add to my collection."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"It is always an interesting experiment to read a book some 40 years after the first time one read it as I did with Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights. My recollections of the great love of Cathy and Heathcliff's turned to impatience with the angst filled duo and a shocking realization that I did not like either of these individuals well.But that being said, I found I appreciated the second half of the book much more than my first read which I must have barely skimmed with the great love being physically impossible. Nor did I forgive Heathcliff as I once did, because my enthusiasm for bad boys has waned over the years.But the question remained for me, when I was forced to rebuild my thoughts regarding this classic novel, was what made it so, what did it have to offer over the centuries to us today? It is a truly atmospheric novel that presents the cold and cruel world of the Yorkshire moors, which seems to shape people in its own fashion. But the value of the book perhaps, is a look at the many faces of love, and what people will do in the name of love.Bronte's Wuthering Heights is a true classic in that each reader can take a lesson from it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The story is depressing and confusing, if you are to believe the adaptations. If you are to believe the 1978 one, also tremendously long-winded and boring. The book, however, is not long-winded and it's not confusing either. It's got decent pacing, good characters (even though there are a number of DSM-IV labels that can be distributed liberally amongst them) and passion. Lots and lots of passion. Not necessarily of the bodice-ripping kind, but passion and fury. Especially the latter.Problem is, as much as I enjoyed reading the book and Emily Bront's writing, which is a lot more succinct than her sister Charlotte's, I don't like any of the characters and I have no sympathy for any of them, save for narrator Nelly/Ellen, because they're all a bunch of b*st*rds who deserve a good slap! I know, I know, it was written a long time ago, but I get the feeling that Emily didn't particularly like the people she wrote about either. They're either violent, drunkards, narcissists or just plain emo. But yes, aside from wanting to give the majority of the cast a good shake and yell \\"wake up and smell the coffee!\\" at them, it's still a good read. Yes, even though it's a little bit depressing and everyone hates each other and people die. Some people you're quite relieved to see the end of.The edition I have (Wordsworth Classics - cheap and cheerful!) comes with a glossary to be able to interpret ye olde English. Some of the words feel a bit unnecessary, because they're either fairly common knowledge or you can grasp the meaning by the context, whereas others ... well, any time poor old Joseph opens his mouth, you need a translator. Yorkshire dialect, 18th/19th century, oww. English isn't even my first language, so it was a tad bit difficult to read. The rest of the book wasn't a problem, just the bits in dialect.The book is actually a lot better than any of the adaptations I've seen. Emily's prose is atmospheric and timeless. Some of her words keep being repeated in the adaptations because, well, they're worth it. Notably this one, which is very passionate:\\"My love for Linton is like the foliage in the woods: time will change it, I'm well aware, as winter changes the trees. My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath: a source of little visible delight, but necessary. Nelly, I am Heathcliff! He's always, always in my mind: not as a pleasure, any more than I am always a pleasure to myself, but as my own being.\\"See, that's goosebumps right there. How profound, how passionate, how... obsessive and bordering on deranged! But that's what I like about it. It tells a compelling (and rather violent) story of a couple of star-crossed lovers who live miserable ever after. What would it have been like if Cathy and Heathcliff had decided to get married? That's what I'd like to know.Anyway, it's a book that exceeded my expectations. I thought it'd just be weird and confusing like the adaptations, but no, it was actually pretty good. It was well written, and to think all of that came out of a parson's daughter living a fairly sheltered life in a small Yorkshire town. Just shows how good her imagination was, and her skill with a pen."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This was recorded by Ruth Golding for librivox.org and is available free, gratis and for nothing at that site - as 80,000 people have already discovered."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I read this book because I had to teach it in a literature class about three years ago. The novel is poetical in nature, but it uses simple words to unravel the romantic twist in the novel. Catherine who is the center of the novel is in love with two men in her life one who she loves dearly and the other who she married for money. The two men in the novel Edgar Linton and Heathcliff are definitely in love with her. Edgar Linton shows his love for her by staying as a widower even after Catherine's death. By contrast, Heathcliff seeks to revenge his treatment by the Earnshaw family. At the end of the novel the two men who are in love with Catherine are buried close to her.One theme that stands out in the novel is that of love. What does it mean to love someone dearly? How does loving someone manifest itself in the lives of women and men? Is it possible to carry out nefarious act because of love? The responses to these questions are answered in the way the plot of the novel turns out. Through her prose, Emily Bronte answers these questions. Love to her means to be faithful to a partner despite the person's flawed character. Love can be seen as delicate subject which can lead to someone conducting baneful actions, as well as conducting acts of kindness.In a sensational group of compound sentences, Bronte shows her readers how love can be convoluted sentiment in women \\"My love for Linton is like the foliage in the woods: time will change it, I'm well aware, as winter changes the trees. My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath: a source of little visible delight, but necessary.\\""},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I bought a set of these books for my 7th grade English class. The book is designed perfectly for the young readers, especially girls. My students were very excited about reading the novel when they saw the cover of the book. The font of the novel is quite large and because of this the book is almost 500 pages; this put off some of the students because they were worried about reading such a large book. However, I explained that it made it easier to read and to take notes in because of the larger print and margins. There is also a pedigree chart in the book and a character reference section that certainly made it more understandable to my students. Also, as we read it, they got more and more excited when they saw how far they would get in just one reading. This book has a Lexile reading score of 880, which is a 6th grade beginning reading level, however, it is quite a difficult read for younder audiences because of the period grammar. My students read quite far above their grade level and most had difficulty with comprehension. I don't know if I will read it again next year because of the grammar, it does suit an older reader, but I do love sharing the story. After we completed the novel, they did complain about the words, but they really loved the story and were sad when we finished the novel."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"SummaryWuthering Heights is a dark tale of enduring passion and violent love. Set on the wild, rugged Yorkshire moors of northern England, this classic gothic novel follows the story of Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw, adopted siblings and lifelong lovers. Narrated through the diary of Mr. Lockwood, a tenant of nearby Thrushcross Grange, this strange and fantastic story tells of a love that transcends all boundaries--even death.Mr. Lockwood is paying a polite visit to his landlord, Heathcliff, when he is expectedly stranded there during a snowstorm. Forced to stay the night at Wuthering Heights, despite Heathcliff's clear displeasure, Lockwood finds an unoccupied room in the grand house. Unable to sleep, however, he stumbles upon the diary entries of a young girl named Catherine Earnshaw, who writes of adventures with her young friend Heathcliff. After nodding off to sleep, Lockwood is awakened when the Catherine's ghost appears at his window, pleading to be let in.When Lockwood returns to Thrushcross Grange the next day, he asks his housekeeper, Ellen (Nelly) Dean, to tell him the story of Heathcliff and the others at Wuthering Heights. Nelly begins her story thirty years earlier, when Mr. Earnshaw brings home an orphaned Heathcliff to raise with his own children, Hindley and Catherine.Though Catherine and Heathcliff are, for many years, inseparable despite Hindley's cruel persecution, eventually the two seem to drift apart. Catherine becomes a proper young lady, and since Hindley forces Heathcliff to work in the fields after their father's death, Heathcliff becomes ignorant and angry. Catherine chooses to marry Edgar Linton, a rich neighbor whom she naively believes will take care of her and Heathcliff. However, Heathcliff interprets this move as rejection, and he runs away for several years.When he returns, he has mysteriously acquires wealth and prestige, though his brooding nature has not been appeased. He has vowed revenge against all of those who have wronged him. When Catherine is confronted by her two loves, Edgar and Heathcliff, she falls ill and dies after giving birth to Cathy. Before she dies, however, she and Heathcliff reassert their undying love to each other.Now, many years later, Heathcliff is more embittered than ever, and he lives to torment the offspring of his long-dead enemies. But he is constantly conscious of Catherine's post-mortem presence, and he is pulled toward eternal love and happiness with her beyond the grave.AnalysisDespite the many narratives-within-a-narrative (the story is a diary entry, often recording Nelly's narrative, who in turn often relates the detailed speeches of others), I found the story surprisingly easy to follow on audiobook. I enjoyed listening to the heavily accented speech of Joseph and other characters, though I also checked a paperback out from the library to understand what they were actually saying!Nelly's judgmental comments about the devilish behavior of Catherine and Heathcliff, which only seems to worsen with time, make the pair seem irresponsible and deserving of any punishment that they receive. Nelly supports this viewpoint with the opinions of Edgar Linton and Hindley, both of whom despise Heathcliff and become frustrated with Catherine, and she portrays the lovelorn couple as ungrateful and spiteful.It struck me as odd that such a seemingly selfish and cruel pair would feel so deeply for each other. In my experience, relationships between truly destructive people such as Catherine and Heathcliff never end well. But their love persists and even grows stronger with each passing year.All of the other characters in the story judge the actions of Catherine and Heathcliff quite harshly, but their persecution only serves to strengthen the depth of feeling between the two. Every time Nelly criticizes their irreverent and even cruel behavior, I felt more sympathy and understanding for them and I began identifying with the persecuted couple. No one believes in them but themselves, and that is what makes their love so powerful and endearing.I found Wuthering Heights to be an enjoyable read; even more than Jane Eyre. Such a powerful story of love and loss ages well, and the unconventional use of an unreliable narrator had an interesting effect upon my view of the characters and story.The very subtle addition of Catherine's ghost, which could be interpreted as real or could be read as merely a figment of Lockwood's and Heathcliff's imaginations, does not diminish the credibility of the story. On the contrary, the supernatural elements throughout the novel only serve to add to the dark, intense feelings between the two lovers."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book is like nothing I've ever read. Beautifully written yet filled with hateful characters and depressing scenes. Yet...yet, I loved it! Emily Bronte does what few authors are capable of doing successfully; compelling you to care for people and situations you otherwise would not. So unlike her sister, Charlotte, who created a likable, strong character in Jane Eyre, Emily creates Cathy, Heathcliff, and the rest of this brooding, spoiled, and somewhat selfish cast of characters driven to depression and madness by the pitfalls of love--both familial and romantic--and makes you want to never stop reading about them. A true classic and one that everyone should read and keep in their library."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Book arrived very speedily and was in excellent condition, would certainly purchase from this seller again."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wow. I actually really liked this book. It wasn't flawless, but was certainly enjoyable for a classic.The Things I Didn't Like:1. The narration. It was just a mess. It would be a narration inside a narration inside a narration. I had no idea who the \\"I\\" was whenever it was mentioned. And I just find it a tad bit unbelievable that Nelly Dean was a witness to it all. I kept cracking up because I would imagine Nelly hiding under tables or behind doors, listening in on all these intense conversations. I would have preferred it in third person.2. The names. I can't count how many time I was confused because I lost track of which Catherine, Linton, or Heathcliff, Bronte was talking about. I think I ended up guessing more than once.3. Joseph's accent. Oh, Lord. His dialogue was practically in another language. I ended up kind of skimming his parts because it wasn't worth the five minutes it took to decipher one paragraph.The Things I Did Like:1. All the characters. They were just so crazy, flawed, unlikable, dramatic, and awesome. I loved them and I hated them.2. When it was written. It just blows my mind that this was written 150 years ago. Besides the language, it just seems so modern to me. Not the setting, but the plot seems like something people would enjoy today.3. Romantic but not romantic. I loved how every action and conversation was so filled with passion. It wasn't a romance in the traditional sense, and that made it seemed more realistic. Heathcliff was both the antagonist and protagoninst. He definitely wasn't swoon worthy like the other heroes of his time, but he was darker, more coplex.I'm really surprised by how much I liked this novel. I wish Emily lived to write another one."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I don't think there is another book as famous as \\"Wuthering Heights\\" where the perception of its contents and the reality are so different. The unbridled, doomed and forbidden love between Heathcliff and Catherine would seem to be the original Harlequin romance. How NOT true. Instead of a love story the real \\"Wuthering Heights\\" is conflict, anger, evil, betrayal, loss, mystery, revenge, debasement, regret with a large unhealthy dose of bonding.Having seen the 1939 movie when I was 7 or 8 years old and not knowing what I was watching for many years I was struck by the story. But the producers of that version win the award for most creative re-interpretation of a book in the 20th century. For fun I looked at 5-10 minute clips of the the 1992, 2009 and 2011 versions on YouTube (I read there are 17 screen versions to date). In those short passages it's clear that each film tries harder to reach the emotional pitch of the book by being more true to the storyline. None beyond the first have been commercial successes and I think it's because the intensity of the book is in the narrative not the dialogue. While Heathcliff is increasingly dark and willingly evil with each version the films cannot bring out what he's thinking because - well we don't know what he's thinking. All we know is he's very angry and would really like to have Catherine back. The movies create monologues that don't exist in the book. By filling in the blanks it takes away from the mystery that is forced on the reader to speculate on Heathcliff's character and motives.I found appeal in Bronte's willingness to portray Heathcliff as nearly the devil; a man wronged and willing to exact revenge for eternity even on his own family. It's painful. Heathcliff's bitterness goes on page after page and year after year. No \\"victory\\" seems to satiate him. It's incredibly intense and he only gets worse as he goes after more innocent victims. His villainy has no bottom.I started the book thinking I was in for a more elaborate version of the 1939 movie. I finished knowing I had read something far different, more challenging, provocative and modern. Much is made about Bronte's ability to write this - where did the ideas come from? what was she thinking? If she were a man would there have been as much focus on the writer instead of the book? Fortunately those debates have receded while the freshness and originality of the story have remained."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"It's unfortunate that Wuthering Heights often gets lumped into the category of Victorian chick lit, because it probably has more in common with Dickens or Balzac than with Jane Austen. The various film adaptations often make much of the love between Heathcliff and Catherine, but that doesn't begin to cover the scope of this book. Wuthering Heights is no conventional romance novel. It is in fact an epic examination of human wickedness involving an ensemble cast that spans two generations over the course of almost 50 years. Filled with powerful imagery and unforgettable characters, it makes for a profoundly entertaining read.Heathcliff, a gypsy-looking street urchin from Liverpool, is adopted by the Earnshaw family, who live among the moors of northern England at the secluded estate of Wuthering Heights. Mr. Earnshaw treats Heathcliff as his favorite, much to the consternation of his eldest son Hindley. When the father dies, Hindley seizes the opportunity to retaliate against Heathcliff, revoking his favored family position and forcing him to labor in the fields. Meanwhile, Heathcliff and his adopted sister Catherine develop a love for each other, but due to his servant status, dirty boots, and surly demeanor, she spurns him for her more elegant and refined neighbor Edgar Linton. Heathcliff resolves to revenge himself upon all who have hurt him, and the following generation of Earnshaws, Lintons, and Heathcliffs must also suffer the repercussions of his passionate vengeance.The joy of Wuthering Heights is that there isn't a single character in the book who could be described as a good person. They are all at best selfish and petty, at worst deplorably evil. All are set on destroying each other, not through murder or violence, but by making each other's lives a living hell until one by one they gradually drop dead of sorrow or destitution. Emily Bronte's unrelenting audacity in depicting the cruelest, basest aspects of humanity is so refreshing it's a joy to read. Yet over and above its sensationalistic pleasures, Wuthering Heights is undeniably a meaningful piece of literature with an intricately constructed plot and keen insights into human nature. It offers important lessons on the poisoning effects of resentment and vengeance upon the soul, as well as the resilience of the human spirit to rise above adversity and degradation.The one drawback of Wuthering Heights is its narrative voice, as told through the perspective of a visitor, Mr. Lockwood, which results in some rather convoluted constructions (Lockwood says that Nelly said that Cathy read in a letter that Linton wrote that Heathcliff told Hareton . . . ). The story would have been better served by a third-person omniscient perspective. Nevertheless, Wuthering Heights deserves its renown as a classic of English literature. It's a shame this is the only novel Emily Bronte ever finished. Let the chick-lit label be damned; real men read Wuthering Heights too!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"(Spoiler)Wuthering Heights is one of the most perfect novels I have read. Here are my thoughts on what makes Wuthering Heights an outstanding read and why it's considered a classic:Characterization:There are no extraneous characters introduced into the story. Each person serves a purpose and is often complementary to another character in the book, like a mirrored reflection or a duality, sometimes the same, sometimes opposing; i.e., Catherine and Heathcliff, Edgar and Isabella Linton, Hindley and Heathcliff, the younger Catherine and Hareton, Mr. Lockwood and Nelly, Nelly and Joseph, the two families at Wuthering Heights and the Grange, the mother Catherine and the younger Catherine, and Isabella and Heathcliff. The relationships among the characters are complicated and evolving. If you were to take one of the characters out of this story, the plot development would be negatively altered. The plot is character-driven and tightly woven throughout the story.Tone:The tone of the story is brooding and dark. The sensuous feeling is foreboding, first exhibited in the setting which Emily Bronte describes in detail. There is an element of overarching suspense and aversion to the characters: the morose Heathcliff; mother Catherine who dies of a brain disorder; the drink of Hindley; the tragic life of Isabella following her marriage to Heathcliff; the delightful younger Catherine who succumbs to depression after coming under the control of Heathcliff. The depressing scene and dysfunctional characters that greet Lockwood's arrival prompt him to ask Nelly to explain the history behind Wuthering Heights.Societal:I was struck by how Emily Bronte weaves the social status of the characters into the story: Joseph and his barely intelligible English; Nelly, the servant and principal narrator, and her portrayal of others from an inferior social position; the many differences between the upper class Lintons and the middle class Earnshaws; the emphasis on social structure with less opportunity for upward mobility, which impacted the \\"heart\\" of the story -- mother Catherine sacrifices her desire for Heathcliff to achieve a higher social status by marrying Edgar. The characters' traits, flaws, and attributes within the structure of society make for believable people that the reader both loves and hates.Multi-generational:The differences between the generations were striking: Heathcliff and mother Catherine seemed unable to change with the passage of time or grow as individuals. They were locked into extremisms that became dead-end roads. Eventually, their flawed natures doomed them to early deaths, providing an opportunity for the next generation in Catherine and Hareton to overcome the past. In contrast to their parents, they were able to adapt and redeem the past, and through their transformation, the reader is filled with hope for the future. The multigenerational aspect of time adds to the completeness of the story--this is a family with a history, a past that threatens to destroy the future.Spiritual/Psychological:Emily Bronte probes deeply the psychological aspects of people's behavior and the ramifications of the dark side of human nature. The story touches on the spiritual nature of the individuals, with references to the small church, the recurring battle with death, the repeated references to ghosts, and Joseph's incessant recitation of Scripture.Themes:The many themes are timeless--love that is forbidden, prejudices that hurt people, the meaninglessness of life without hope, hate that destroys, the vindictiveness of human nature, and the darkness of the soul without God.Setting:Established in the first paragraph, a \\"perfect misanthropist's heaven. \\" Right away, I am told a lot about this story in a unique way which encourages me to keep reading.Classic Author Similarities:I am struck by the fact that many classics, like this one, have been written by individuals who have experienced tremendous suffering. I wonder if there is a relationship between a giftedness to write great stories and the degree to which one has endured hardship. Perhaps the strong emotions that are pent up in a tortured soul find solace in the pen as a healing balm.Risky:Creative, original stories take risks. For instance, there isn't one protagonist versus one antagonist in Wuthering Heights. Ninety-five percent of the story is dark and unsettling; the story reinforces negative stereotypical issues and characters. The orphan is the troublemaker and destroyer of the family, perpetuating a common \\"myth\\" with adoptees. Joseph uses the Bible in a beguiling way to demean people, contrary to the Good Book's ultimate purpose. The submissive role of women and their inability to escape from abusive husbands or families is also perpetuated in Wuthering Heights, reinforcing the long-held notion that women are inferior to men. Despite these risks, Emile Bronte creates a masterpiece.Fictional Dream:Emily Bronte immerses the reader into a world that is vivid and dream-like, with colorful characters and a complex plot. She uses literary techniques that make this is a compelling read, one worth pondering after the last page is finished. It's a shame she died so young--what other books might she have written?"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is timeless literature. I read this piece when i was about fourteen, and, although difficult to follow and differentiate between the Cathies and Lintons in the beginning, Bronte unraveled this work very thoroughly and revealed a ghastly and revealing story about two selfish lovers.Heathcliff is truly the most despicable character imaginable, and for his feisty spirit he is one of my favorite characters.Catherine is selfish and a character i feel a strong connection to on some levels.Together these two complete a classic tale, which i would have fallen in love with no matter who the author. However, I am truly impressed with Emily's gal to have written this grizzly tale. For its time, this type of literature is a bold one, and for a women to write? Forget about it! That's a piece beyond the story I absolutely relish.I advise anyone interested in reading this to pick it up and enjoy (possibly making notes, or just trudging through the beginning like i did, ha) But definitely read it twice over, at the very least, for a truly enjoyable (and understandable) read.Anything below five stars for lack of clarity is no fault of the author, and is simply a problem with anyone reading the book. Yes, it is confusing sometimes, but there are pieces to that which complete the complex puzzle of revenge and human indecency."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I really liked Wuthering Heights. Heathcliff is a \\"little\\" disturbing. When I first started reading it, I was like what? But, once I got to chapter 2 or 3 things started making more sense and I couldn't hardly put it down. Once I finished the book, I went back and read the beginning and it makes sense because you know the whole story. Very good, if you like the older, classic style. I would recommend it!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The first thing a lot of people who have read this are probably going to ask is \\"Why not 5 stars?\\", and indeed, one may be subjected to stoning for giving only 4 stars to such a well respected piece of classic literature. However, I have my reasons: for one, the book becomes a bit difficult to follow at times- when you have Cathy Linton Earnshaw, and Cathy Earnshaw Linton, and the one who is dead won't stay dead, that gets a bit confusing to begin with. There are a couple of other similar instances when the reader may have to turn back to see just which character is involved in a given encounter. Also, it seems to never be very well established just how Heathcliff went from having nothing upon his departure, to being wealthy upon his return. Perhaps not necessary for that to be fully explained, but at least some explanation would be welcome. Emily Bronte does one thing exceptionally well, which is painting a picture of Yorkshire and The Moors with words. Maybe people who are better readers than I will enjoy this more. I did enjoy it, by all means, thus the four stars, but I was not as enthralled with it as many others have been."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"A young lady, 29 years of age, published a book under the name of Ellis Bell. It was so abhorrent to the public, critics wanted the 400 pages of \`pure repugnance' to be burned. Yet as the horror and outrage grew throughout the world, so did the number of copies. How had this young, sickly woman who lived a life of desolation and strife, caused such uproar in our hearts as she led us through hers? Wuthering Heights can be examined through the events, ideas, and personal observations within the text to decipher our own personal experiences with reading this novel.The book begins through the narrative of a man named Mr. Earnshaw. Earnshaw is a tenant for a man named Mr. Heathcliff. From the beginning page of the novel, we find Heathcliff to be rough and with a dark presence in him. The man has come to stay the night before heading down their land to his recently purchased house. Yet the owner of the land makes a very unwelcome first impression on the young Mr. Lockwood. Immediately entering the house, Lockwood get attacked by dogs, and laughed at for his fright. This dreary setting to start off a book happens in a residence named Wuthering Heights. The place Lockwood has recently bought is called Thrushcross Grange; the book will solely revolve around these two houses. Thrushcross Grange is 4 miles away from Wuthering Heights, and Lockwood, returning from his visit from the heights, tries to return to the Grange during a storm. Yet he is unable to make the journey and is force to stay at the Heights until morning.A maid leads Lockwood upstairs into a room that Heathcliff has forbidden. While he lies in the eerily dark room, he finds that names have been carved into the wall next to the bed. Deeply carved into it are 3 woman named Catherine with different last names. A quote on age 35 describes the mood in which the chilling names rang into the night, \\"In vapid listlessness I leant my head against the window, and continued spelling over Catherine Earnshaw--Heathcliff--Linton, till my eyes closed; but they had not rested five minutes when a glare of white letters started from the dark, as vivid as spectres--the air swarmed with Catherines.\\" He also finds a diary written 25 years earlier, and with curiosity for the strange inhabitance of the household, he ventures to read it. Within the diary, a girl named Catherine Earnshaw writes about a day she experienced at Wuthering Heights. She talks about how her and Heathcliff must suffer through long sermons and put up with the hatred her brother has towards Heathcliff. We now are aware of 3 major characters--- Catherine, Heathcliff, and her brother named Hindley. Lockwood falls asleep soon after, and has a frightening nightmare in which a hand grabs him and cries the name \\"Catherine Linton\\" and demands to be let in through his window. She will not let go of him, until he continually rubs her wrists on the glass she broke trying to get in through the window. He wakes up screaming, and tells Heathcliff that there is a ghost named Catherin in the room. Heathcliff runs into the room and as Lockwood shuts the door, he is heard crying out for his apparent lover. Following this occurrence, Lockwood asks a maid named Nelly to tell him about these people's lives. The story begins there.Nelly begins by telling us of her own experiences at Wuthering Heights. She is the nurse of 2 young children--- Catherine and Hindley Earnshaw. Their father is expected to come home one day with presents, yet he brings home a young gypsy boy instead. He is quiet, yet with a strong-will. His name is Heathcliff and the father favors this boy above his own children. Throughout the 3 children's childhood, Hindley is jealous of Heathcliff. Yet as strongly as Hindley and Heathcliff hate each other, Catherine loves the boy. The two were inseparable, and their connection went deeper and deeper with age. When their father dies, Hindley is the head of the household and Heathcliff is turned into a slave. This strong connection turns from childhood playmates, to a deep emotional attraction towards each other. They were both alone in the world, trying to only protect themselves and each other. The connection is so strong, that no amount of physical force could drive these two apart. She was the rebellious teenager, eager for adventure, and ignorantly falling for the boy. Heathcliff was a dark character, who was hardened by the cruelty he received, yet utterly infatuated with the girl. The two young lovers plan to run away together until one night, when they sneak over to Thrushcross Grange to spy on the upper-class family. Yet they are heard, and as the two mischievous trespassers run away, a dog catches Cathy's leg and severely injures her. Cathy stays there to heal for months, and Heathcliff is banished from their property. She becomes close to a formal and respected man named Edgar Linton.As Nelly tells Lockwood of these events, she seems to have an eye for every happening, and an ear for every story. She observes that after Cathy returns home, she is changed. She is now dressed in fine clothes, and an air of superiority. A quote in chapter 8 shows the effect of her changing her affections for Heathcliff to Edgar Linton, \\"Doubtless Catherine marked the difference between her friends, as one came in and the other went out. The contrast resembled what you see in exchanging a bleak, hilly, coal country for a beautiful fertile valley; and his voice and greeting were as opposite as his aspect.\\" The young girl is attracted to his wealth, and reputation. While their relationship grew closer, her and Heathcliff grew farther apart. Eventually it came to the point that Linton proposes to Catherine, and she talks to Nelly about it as she tries to decide her answer. Yet as they discuss, Heathcliff is listening the entire time. Catherine says that she cannot \\"degrade\\" herself to Heathcliff's level; it is then that Heathcliff leaves in a rage. However, he departs right before Catherine says one of the most important lines of the book. She says in chapter 9, \\"would degrade me to marry Heathcliff now; so he shall never know how I love him; and that, not because he's handsome, Nelly, but because he's more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same, and [Edgar's] is as different as a moonbeam from lightning, or frost from fire.\\" With this reference, we learn that she is literally stating, \\"she is Heathcliff;\\" their persons are so similar that they are the same.Throughout this entire time Hindley marries a woman he is deeply fond of, and she becomes pregnant. However, his wife gets sick and dies while giving birth. Hindley becomes a different man after the death of his wife. He turns into an alcoholic, and vows that if he ever sees that baby he will smash its brain. While a life went out of the world, a new one came in however, and the baby boy was named Hareton. Nelly is the sole caretaker for the baby, and treats him with loving care as he grows up.Yet after Heathcliff leaves, Catherine spends the next few days searching for him and sickening herself. She waits for her childhood companion to return for 3 years, but eventually marries Edgar. Thus Nelly and Catherine move from Wuthering Heights to Thrushcross Grange, leaving behind baby Hareton with his drunken father.While the new couple settles into Linton's beautiful, fresh, and crisp home, Nelly starts to notice some aspects of their marriage. Linton listens to everything Catherine says otherwise Catherine will get extremely upset. He gives her everything, and she constantly complains to him. The entire story changes when one day Heathcliff arrives again. He has a new \\"darkness\\" in his eyes, and is now very rich. We will find that his personality has changed from being a boy with anger towards his oppressors, to a man with a psychopathic idea of revenge and love.Immediately, the two have a passionate connection that Linton cannot even compete with. Eventually it gets so bad that Heathcliff threatens to kill Linton, and he must call in help. Linton banishes Catherine from seeing him again, and she fakes a disease to try to get his attention. Eventually however, Linton grows frightened with his wife's health and nurses her night and day. This causes her to keep up with her illnesses and starve herself.Throughout this time, Heathcliff revenges upon Catherine for marrying Linton so he eloped with Linton's brother, Isabella. Isabella is utterly in love with Heathclifff, however he despises her. When Linton hears about his sister's elopement, he disowns her and vows that he cares nothing for her. Catherine is so utterly caught up with jealously with Heathcliff's action, that she grows into a new person. She would lay in bed and stare blankly at nothing for hours. Within 7 months after Heathcliff's return, she becomes so frail and weak that she can no longer move. She is also 7 months pregnant, but Nelly never mentions that until after the baby is born. Heathcliff finally finds a day where Linton is absent to come into her house and find his Cathy. Upon meeting each other, they are overcome with this attachment and lust that completely controls their bodies. Heathcliff lifts Cathy in his arms, not fully aware of the severity of her condition. This roughness causes blue marks in the lady's skin as the maid observes from afar. They kiss repetitively, apparently not aware of anything around them. Yet as hours pass, Linton makes his way home. Nelly pleads for Heathcliff to leave; yet Cathy pleads for him to stay. He leaves Cathy just as Linton comes into the room, and he is overcome by horror at how rabidly her strength had decreased. She died in her husband's loving arms.While this story ends, a new one begins with the child born in the hour of its mother's death. The baby is name Catherine as well. Edgar mourns for his wife for weeks, yet eventually he welcomes the baby in. Nelly calls her \\"angelic,\\" and everyone loves her at the Grange. Yet during the happy days of the baby Catherine's growth, treacherous things take place at Wuthering Heights. We so far have been unaware about anything that has happened at the Heights. Yet Isabella arrives at the door on a frigid winter day, with a deep gash on her neck. She ventures to tell Nelly her entire story from the day she elopes and onward. She tells Nelly how she was attacked, and banished from sleeping in the same room as her husband. She was made fun of, and kicked around. The day that made her run 4 miles through a blizzard, while bleeding profusely from the neck, was a shocking revelation of events.Hindley Earnshaw had told her on a previous date, that she had better make sure her husband's room was locked, because Hindley would shoot him the night it was not. This chilling experience shook the young lady up, and she tried to stay out of the two men's evident hatred towards each other. Hindley plans to kill Heathcliff, but Isabella warns him of coming into the house. Heathcliff believes she is trying to kill him as well, yet is able to attack and almost kill Hindley. Afterwards, she gets into an intense argument with Heatchcliff, and she tells Nelly of her feelings towards her oppressor. She says, \\"it is better to be hated by him than loved him.\\" As she departs, he savagely throws a knife at her neck. Isabella runs away and gives birth to a baby boy named Linton.13 years later, young Catherine grows into a beautiful lady, loved and nurtured by everyone around her. Yet as she grows up, she yearns to go outside of the walls of the Grange. They hear news that Isabella is sick, and she wants to give her nearly 13-year-old son to her uncle. However, the day he arrives, Heathcliff sends for his son and the frail boy never gets to live in a house of safety and solitude.4 years later, as Nelly is out looking for Catherine, she finds that the girl has escaped and ran up to the Heights. Nelly retrieves the foolish girl, and notices that Linton has become extremely sick and frail. She is very angry with Catherine, yet Catherine continues her interests with the Heights and Linton. Catherine and Linton start sending letters to each other, and become romantically interested.. We find through the course of events that Heathcliff manipulates Catherine into marrying Linton while her father dying. He grotesquely locks Nelly up in a room for days until finally she is released and her and Catherine are able to return to see Edgar before he dies. Nelly is not allowed to follow Catherine to the Heights, and finds a few months later that Linton dies, and Catherine is left trapped into a lifestyle under her insane father-in-law.The story ends here because Nelly has no more information to portray. Lockwood, who has been patiently listening, returns to the Heights to find that Heathcliff died, and Catherine is now in love with her other cousin Hareton. Hareton grew into a strong, muscular, mysterious, and rather illiterate man of 23. Heathcliff had bribed the man burying Catherine's coffin, to attach his coffin to hers--- much to the neighbor's detest. That way, he claims, \\"Edgar will not be able to tell us a part.\\" The book ends on somewhat happy terms now that Heathcliff is out of his misery and the new lovers are now together.In my opinion, the book was harshly realistic to what we live through today. It captured not only my attention, but also my emotions. Heathcliff was such a threat to society within the novel and outside of it that it was shocking to read about how strongly his heart was displayed just through words. When reading along, your entire being went into his character. It was repulsive, and horrific to imagine the things he did, but somehow understandable. When we can truly understand how he loved, then it is somewhat clear how he hated. Our villain of the story is not the man that viciously threw a knife at his wife's neck, or tore a young lady away from her dying father. Instead the true villain lies in what love can be turned into. Young Catherine did not love Linton, she only felt sorry for him. Heathcliff did not have the kind of love that will stay by you always, with compassion and gentleness. Heathcliff only attained the emotion of the past--- clinging on to the deep attachments of the wrongs people had done to him, and the only person that ever treated him right.When Heathcliff forces Catherine to stay at his home, and abuse his son and his nephew's emotions towards their cousin, I saw a similarity in Heatchcliff's own experience. He told Hareton to take Catherine out into their garden, \\"but try not to stare when she isn't looking.\\" Yet while she is out with him, he would try to make the sickly Linton jealous. In my opinion, I saw a pain in Heathcliff that he could only suppress by making others suffer.When examining the author of the book, we find that Emily Bronte lived on the moors of Yorkshire, England. The moors are deserted, stormy, and dangerous. The moors can represent Bronte's own life, and also the characters in the novel. All main characters of the novel can be compared to the bleak yet fierce aspect of the place where they live. It says Catherine Earnshaw Linton was buried \\"in a corner of the kirkyard, where the wall is so low that heath and bilberry plants have climbed over it from the moor.\\" She was neither buried in the church with the Linton family, or in the Wuthering Heights graveyard. This can be taken as the idea that she was caught between her wild childhood lover, and her caring protective husband. In our lives today, we can live two lives and get caught in the middle. Whether it is a person in love with two people, our faith, or our character, we can all struggle with living in two different worlds. Following Catherine's death, both Edgar and Heathcliff followed her to her grave. Edgar lived a life of happiness; he moved on with his life. Heathcliff lived a life of despair and solitude, only finding comfort when the ghost of Catherine haunted him. Our lives can be defined by how we are treated, what we lost, and who took that away. Yet we also can move on, and choose to forget those things--- not living in the moors of our devastated, uncivilized emotions. This brilliant novel can truly open up to one's heart and mind as you allow yourself to experience the words of Emily Bronte's inner being."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"reviewer:alysalovesbooks:)I am 16 and I thought this was going to be pretty boring and just...blah.But it was actually pretty good!I admit I only read this book because I had to do an assignment for my English Honors Literature class.It was slow and uninteresting at first but NEVER GIVE UP ON A BOOK right?Well, as I read on,it became more interesting. I really reccommend this and all the other classics because these books set the foundation of a well written book.After all, thats why they are called classics,right?Oh,and for your information.....this was my inspiration to write a novel in the future.....By the way,The Wuthering Heights was a really tough book to write an essay about.hahahaha. Literature is an Awesome class!=)"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I first read this book as a senior in high school and I absolutely adored it. I think one of the most amazing things about this novel is that the characters aren't exactly likable and yet you love them anyway. I love Heathcliff, though admittedly I wouldn't ever want to date him. I think Heathcliff is one of my favorite likable bad guys in literature along with Severus Snape. I would really recommend this book to anyone looking for a love story that transcends time and life. One of my favorite things about this book is that it's not just some simple love story where the guy falls in love with the girl and then something bad happens that threatens the relationship but it all works out in the end. I think it is even more tragic than Romeo and Juliet and definitely more complicated. Anyway, I highly recommend reading this book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"For the quality of the binding - it's fair at best- the pages at the end sit jagged and uneven. But this was quite inexpensive, and it didn't bother me terribly.The book itself was good. Personally I think Jane Eyre was better, but Wuthering Heights has unusual, headstrong, and not always pleasant characters even in the role of the lovers in the story which makes it very unique."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is one of those extremely rare books that it is nearly impossible to put down. For a week, I went around a near zombie because the night before I had stayed up for hours saying &quot;Just one more chapter, then I HAVE to go to bed&quot;. I was completely entralled. It never got boring or slow, and the tale it told is unlike any other I have ever heard before. If you're tired of boring old romance stories, I promise you - this one is different. It is truly a shame that it was Emily Bronte's only novel.Toni"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I found Wuthering Heightsto be a very good novel. I had to read it for 11th grade Honors English. At first I thought it was just average but after I got to the second half the book I enjoyed it so much more. I was amazed at how Emily Bronte was able to weave the two generations together. It was a very in depth book but a also very rewarding one."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I went into reading this book with the mindset that I was reading an 18th century english romance novel, which isn't exactly the genre that I would choose to read. I chose to read Wuthering Heights because I've heard of the acclaim that this novel receives for being one of the greatest pieces of English literature ever written so I casted aside my stereotpes and read it. It is a very tragic obsession between CAtherine and Heathcliff that lasts well after the latter dies and one can really feel the love between them. And the most riveting character in this story is the demon that Heathcliff transforms into as the story progresses. He is truely one of the most sinister characters I have ever read. Oh yea, as mention earlier by another reviewer, kudos to anyone who can sucessfully understand Joseph on a consistant basis throughout the story!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Like many, at the age of 15, I believe I was too young to read such a story; I was bored reading it, I found the writing to be dull and the plot to advance too slowly. To be honest the only way I could survive the book was to read the cliff notes. But halfway through the cliff notes I was struck by the developing relationship between Cathy and Heathcliff, and my opinions altogether changed. I re-read the entire book, and could at last understand the story, the torment, the love, the fury, the power of what Emily had written, a real love story, with the real sentiments that occur when people of different upbringings clash, and somehow, in spite of such brutal hatred and jealousy, love dawns, and it survives the storm of hatred that continues for many years and a couple of generations. This story epitomizes true and unconditional love. For this reason,seven years later, I gladly rate this book five stars our of five."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I have no memory of Northern England late 1700's. I don't no if characters such as Heathcliff or the younger Linton actually could exist. But this whole story is so unbelievable that it goes way beyond fiction. Not only that but one of the basic requisites of any successful novel, or movie for that matter, is to have at least one character that the audience likes or will root for. There is not one character in this book that I pulled for. Not one that I wanted to see come out on top. I just finished this book so maybe my viewpoint will change with time (in five months will this novel have any impact on me) but for the time being this hardly rates as a &quot;classic&quot;"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"My overall impression of this book is that it is a well-written depressing novel. The characters were well portrayed but the cruel and/or twisted natures of the characters made me feel dreary inside. The abominable Heathcliff is a prime example.

I LOVED (became slightly obsessed) with Jane Eyre and figured this might fall in the same category. Unfortunately, I was very wrong.The writing is so utterly dull. I cannot understand where this great love comes from between Catherine and Heathcliff - they are just in \\"love\\" and we are supposed to believe it. Maybe I would have enjoyed it more if it was not told by Nelly's accounts, whom I find extremely annoying, overly motherly and controlling for a servant. I felt no sympathy for any of the characters and just wished they would all die already, as seemed to be the prevalent theme throughout the novel.I also found it somewhat disturbing how easily people married their first-cousins back in those days. I get it - it's the 1800s, but really does Cathy have to go from marrying one first cousin to the next? Is there no one else in this town that she is not related to?!I was really hoping to enjoy this book - especially considering this is such a \\"classic\\".

And I absolutely loved this. I have never read a book told in such a way as this one is, from the perspective of those who aren't really the main characters; it was such an interesting way of telling the story. The characters were all so intriguing: I loved how I could pity and hate Heathcliff at the same time, and find Cathy frustrating yet endearing. And of course, the love story was passionate, heartbreaking, and engrossing.Regardless of your age, I recommend that you read this book. I'm 14, and this is definitely one of the best novels that I have ever read. My only regret is that Emily Bront? did not write more!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"While I know this is considered a great Classic Romance, I failed to see the romance or the greatness. I decided to read this because I had never done so. I regretted that decision within three chapters. I was determined to finish it to find the wonder of this work that I had heard so much about. I failed to find it in all of it's almost 400 pages. It was a tedious read and nowhere near the great romance I was led to believe. While the last few pages were a payoff, they were not worth the torture of the previous ones."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Not what I was expecting.

The narrator did an excellent job bringing the characters to life. This is a wonderful story though a bit depressing. Many classics from that time are written with a an overwrought, tradgic mood. If you can handle that, it is a good story of a dysfunctional family, revenge and love."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Anyone who is a frequent reader of this blog knows of my aversion to classics. I don't typically enjoy them, I always have to force myself to finish them, and I usually just end up giving up before I finish altogether. This book started out similar - it took me a really long time to get invested in the story and characters, I read it very slowly, and I was pretty sure I was going to hate it by page 50. Fortunately for me, though, I ended up enjoying the story when I (sadly) forced myself to continue on. (Thanks, Classics Challenge, for that little push!) I am SO proud of myself for getting through this and actually feeling like I somewhat enjoyed the book. Someone described this book to me as almost like a soap opera (can't remember who...), and that individual is completely right. There is so much drama in here... it's crazy. I definitely felt attached to the characters, even with all their unpredictable drama, and I'm glad that I finished the book and got to appreciate it. I can't really say that this is one of my favorites, but it is a pretty decent book, and I can see why it is dubbed a \\"classic\\"."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"After reading \\"Jane Eyre\\" by Charlotte Bronte, I knew I had to read her sister's only novel. Quite an interesting contrast to the love story of \\"Jane Eyre,\\" but unique and worthwhile nonetheless. A great classic by a 19th century female writer...read it!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is an interesting book in that people tend to take it in one of two ways. People either feel that Ms. Bronte is drawing a love story between Heathcliff and the 1st Catherine, or that Ms. Bronte is pointing out the 'terrible truth' of the failings of romantic love. I myself lean towards the latter. For one thing, the 1st Catherine dies 1/2 way through the story.The story is basically this. Mr. Earnshaw (father of Hindley and the 1st Catherine) brings home an abandoned child. (Heathcliff) At the risk of oversimplifying, Heathcliff is basically responsible for rifts in the Earnshaw household. (For one thing, Hindley, with some justification feels that he has lost his father's love to Heathcliff.) Heathcliff seems to bring out the worst in both Hindley and Catherine. While we may sympathize with Heathcliff from time to time, he basically represents vengeance and destruction.Moving on, you will probably notice that while that while certain characters display passion for each other, the happiness DOES NOT last into the marriage. We may be tempted to think that Nelly Dean is in fact Emily Bronte herself scoffing at the characters she created.Moving on, the 1st Catherine (who married Edgar Linton) dies leaving behind one daughter Catherine (2). The widowed Hindley dies leaving behind a brain damaged son (Hareton). The story then switches focus to Hareton, the widower Edgar, Edgar's daughter Cathy (2), and Heathcliff's son Linton. It is interesting that Edgar is the most likable once he is a widower trying to raise his daughter. Heathcliff remains a character of darkness and vengeance bringing pain and torment to the surviving characters. (For someone who is famous for loving the 1st Catherine, he sure doesn't mention her much. Nor does he seem to have any problem treating her daughter wickedly.) There is something called false imprisonment, as well as kidnapping!I don't want to ruin the book for those of you who haven't read it. But there is an interesting resolution that to some extent gives the romantic at heart what they want. However, at the same time, Heathcliff's expansion of character is limited. While many see this as a romantic novel, Miss Bronte is offering us an interesting reality check. (Passions are often short lived, and do not often last once marriage and reality set in)."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"When I first started reading this novel I thought it got off to a somewhat of a slow start, and when it switched the narrators I got a bit confused. As the novel progressed and told about the relationships present between Heathcliff and Catherine I got very interested. Throughout the novel I noticed the absence of mothers present in the novel. I found that part of it very interesting and really wonder why Emily Bronte made it so that all of the children lost their mother figure. I recommend this novel to anyone who has to read a \\"classic\\" novel for any type of educational purpose. My only advice to anyone who reads this book is wait like 50 pages before you decide to give up on the book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a classic love story between dark, handsome Heathcliff and beautiful, lovable Catherine Earnshaw. The differences they had in life never came between their strong willed love. This is a book for EVERYONE. I believe that this should be read by each person sometime during their lifetime. There were things I liked about the book and things I didn't, but the good outweighed the bad.I loved how Emily Bronte, the author, switched from the point of view of one character to the other because it gave me a better idea of what the story was about. In addition it was nice to know what all the characters thought everything that went on. That made it hard for me not to put down the book, although I had to in order to live my life.My next praise of Wuthering Heights is the way that the setting and the characters are described. With all of the vivid words in this story it made me believe everything that was happening. I really began to see the surroundings and feel the way Heathcliff and Catherine did about each other, and how much hatred Hindley and the rest of the world had towards Heathcliff, with the many astounding words that she used to write this wonderful book.Now to the one thing that I disliked about Wuthering Heights, it was hard to get into. The first, oh maybe, 5-6 chapters were gloomy and not to exciting. It seemed as though it would never get better and more interesting. Surprisingly, it gets better every second you read on.To wrap it up, Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte is a stunning book. I recommend it to everyone to read in their lifetime. This book proves that it doesn't matter if a book was written a long time ago because it will still capture readers for many years to come. The good outweighed the bad in this story because of the vast description and how well it is written."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte is a brilliant and flowing writer, but there were definitely times when I was completely lost and confused. However, I think it's because of the way that she writes this novel that makes it so captivating. It's terrifying and romantic, it's seemingly unbearable and it's light and easy. It's definitely the best of both worlds. A romantic and thrilling tale of love and evil. Who doesn't love that? Not to mention the writing is second to none.But, regardless of how much I love this story, I did have to take a star away just because of how many times I had to stop and go, \\"wait ... wha? erm ... but I thought ...\\" And yes, in the long run, it makes the book that much greater, but it can get frustrating (especially for one not used to that type of reading) and confusing.But, yeah, a true classic."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I recommend this wonderful book to almost everyone! I especially love reading novels that take place in the past yet can be related to now. One thing I do recommend - when you start reading this book, as you piece character personalities and profiles together - write them down! Make a family tree! That is the one confusing part of this book but by getting things down on paper you help yourself to enjoy the book more and not worry so much about who is who ;)"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights can easily be compared to a soap opera. Personally, I do not have an inclination towards soap operas, but this novel, written by Emily Bronte, was done beautifully. One of the most complex characters in literature is perhaps Heathcliff. His motives are sometimes opaque but his emotions are so real. The reader can identify with his heartbreak and anguish. The despair created by the love triangles throughout this novel is breathtaking. There is symbolism on every page, making Wuthering Heights an in-depth work of literature. This novel is truly a romantic classic, and personally, my favorite."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I think this book evokes controversial responses from readers because of the ending and because of their failure to interpret this piece of literature. Wuthering Heights is not just a love story--it's a story of relationships, class struggles, the angst of the soul, passion, remorse, and regret. It is about everything that makes us human, e.g. the power to choose between good and evil. It is about obsession and how it can kill the soul. The story is masterfully written, filled with symbolic representations. The reader must read between the lines to truly appreciate and understand this great classic!!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The symbolizim in this book is great, Heathcliff compared to the moors, the blooming trees at the end are Hareton and cathy, etc. This book has everything, from hate, to the most passonate love!

I cannot express how thrown i was by this classic tale of disturbed love and torturous passion. It knows no bounds!! The most amazing experience for me was to read this book, Cathy is beautiful and ghostly, Heathcliff is dark and still, yet undercurrents of black, storm his character like a great tempest! The relationship between Cathy and Heathcliff could be explained as so: Cathy is Heathcliff's light and Heathcliff is Cathy's eternal darkness, these are two characters who love what they have learned to fear! AMAZING!!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I would never have read this brilliant, fascinating, and whirlwind novel had it not been for my English teacher. I can't believe what I would have missed out on! The narrative is not at all confusing - it's simply 1st person limited. The frame narration is wonderful, it adds to the mystique and ambiguity that surrounds the whole situation. Heathcliff inexorably attracts and repels as does Catherine. It's one long huge piece of poetic prose. It disturbs, it frightens, it causes one to look at a darker side in a new light. The book is amazing, Emily Bronte was a woman way beyond her times. I would reccomend this book to everyone - even those annoyed with the characters etc simply cannot argue with the mastery of the book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is simply the best book I have ever read. You can't just read this book, you have to feel it, breathe it and live it. I simply love it....."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I read this book when I was 15 or16, I think, out of curiosity, I had heard so much about it. Three years later it is still my favourite book. I lost track of the number of times I had read it. To me it is the greatest love story ever written. At first, I felt it strange that the hero of this story should be an unbelievably evil villian, but I later understtod that Heathcliff was not your conventional love-sick melodramatic hero, and how Emily Bronte could make this character appear deserving of sympathy and even a little admiration, is nothing short of literary genuis. I had come to that conclusion years ago- you had to love a man who could love like that. I felt his character was more rounded than any character I've known. Some people might find the book depressing, gloomy, even a bit morbid-no doubt it is, to a cerain extent.I found it to be the most realistic, passionate and romantic love story I've ever read or will read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I am writing my senior college thesis (currently) on this brilliant novel and everytime I pick my much-loved copy up I discover something new and fascinating. My copy has notes in the margins throughout, often followed by an exclamation marks to indicate my excitement. This excellent novel is saturated with deep thoughtful symbolism, the colorful beautifully-created characters (despite their cruelty) have our sympathy throughout (if they deserve it). The emotion Emily Bront is able to convey through her words defies description itself. I love this book so incredibly much; I consider it to the best of the Bront novels and I've read nearly them all."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I spent most of my life avoiding books like this. Now, nearing 50, I have been finding that many of these old English novels are great fun and can occasionally even be very moving (&quot;Silas Marner&quot; knocked me clean out!). What you will find distinctive about &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; is its surprising violence. The title tells it all: Yes, &quot;wuthering&quot; is an alternative spelling of &quot;weathering&quot; -- we have entered the heights of wearing-down. You will find it incredible the depths Heathcliff sinks to in order to exercise his obsession. Bodily violence, to be sure, but also, and mainly, torture of the soul. You will shake with revulsion and frustration when reading of the wrongs Heathcliff perpetrates. Can anything good come out of this Hell on Earth? Will the violence follow its winding path ever downward? Ah, but that's for you to discover. Hunker down and go for it. This ain't no sippin' novel."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is written with such charactorization, that well after reading the novel, I am still deep in thought about the psychology of Heathcliff, and those that tell their interpretation of their interaction with him (Lockwood and Nelly Dean). This novel is great for someone who has ever loved and lost, and not had their way, as life often does not turn out the way we intend. I love the way Bronte writes, with the deep meloncolic undertones. It makes me yearn to read another of her novels, however, that is not a possibility. That's all she wrote (besides a collection of poetry). My favourite quote from the book is when Catherine Earnshaw confesses to Nelly that she really loves Heathcliff despite her agreement to marry Edgar Linton: \\"So he shall never know how I love him: and that, not because he's handsome, Nelly, but because he's more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same; and Linton's is as different as a moonbeam from lighting or frost from fire.\\"To me this distinquishes the love of soulmates, between the casual love we create in order to socially fuction; fear from remaining single, money, social status. Brilliant novel!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"It is a shame Emily Bronte didn't live to see her novel gain the success it deserved, but it is fortunate for the rest of us that she at least lived long enough to write it. Wuthering Heights tells a fascinating story that is extremely difficult to put down despite it straying well outside the traditional territory of novels.The story offers very few sympathetic characters, and much of what it relates is horribly distasteful. Yet the characters are so interesting and the writing so skilled the reader sticks with Bronte through all the trials and tribulations of the inhabitants of Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange.The story covers about a 25-year period of time in two families whose destinies are tied together by a horrid orphan named Heathcliff. Heathcliff is arguably one of the most despicable villains in literature, as for the sake of his twisted love for Catherine he quite thoroughly and deliberately ruins the lives of almost everyone in those two families, not even sparing his own son his vicious rage. The vengeance he wreaks for his perceived wrongs is thorough and brutal, almost impossible to imagine, yet fascinating to watch.My one complaint would be Bronte's use of phonetic spelling for one of the secondary characters. Joseph's dialogue is virtually impossible to understand in sections, although fortunately his character is not vital to the story. The rest of the writing is quick and entertaining, making the story move quickly and keeping the reader's interest.The reader may assume, as I long did, that a novel written so long ago would be likely to be of more interest in some high school English class than to be read for pleasure. Such prejudice should be set aside, as Wuthering Heights is too good a book to be so ignored."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Jane Eyre is a classic novel from Charlotte Bronte and this unabridged audio recording is highly recommended to people who read the book and loved it and are interested in hearing the book being read. By the way, I strongly suspect that Anne, the previous reviewer who made the speed reading comment about this bookcassette audio recording from Brlliance Audio lisened to this recording without using the adapter or adjusting the balance on her balance control knob on her tape player. If listening to this on a walkman style tape player you need the adapter and you need to read the instructions before using it and if you are listening on a stereo or car tape deck with balance control knob then you need to follow the instructions on how to listen to it that way.

Now many years later I have again found this truly remarkable novel. Its style ranges smoothly from horridly wicked, to loving and caring, to darkly comedic. Heathcliff is perhaps one of the most wretched characters in literature, and his love affair with Catherine is truly unique. This is almost like \\"Jerry Springer\\" for the 19th century. If you skipped this in school, do yourself a favor and pick it up again."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I've been on a quest this last year or so to read (or re-read) the ladies of English literature that I so sadly ignored in high school. How could I have been so silly. I started my 'tour' with Jane Austen's \\"Emma\\" and quickly went from there to \\"Pride & Prejudice\\", \\"Mansfield Park\\" and \\"Sense & Sensibility\\"...and just recently I picked Emily Bronte's \\"Wuthering Heights\\". I absolutely loved this. I'm not going to give you a great literary dissertation here. I just have to say I loved it. There was love, destruction, reconstruction, sorrow, mindlessness, drunkeness...all marvelously narrated to the reader. I was truly impressed. I'm forever kicking myself for not reading Austen & the Bronte sisters earlier on. The saddest thing about reading these (and other) classics is that you know going into it that the author won't be writing anymore wonderful works. Take the time to read this..."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Though 'Wuthering Heights' has garnered a reputation as an overly romantic sentimentality, this is not what the book is about at all - and this nonsensical assumption has pervaded popular culture and discouraged new fans. Though 'Wuthering Heights' is, above all, a love story, it is sordid, melancholic, shocking, and filled with characters that are markedly maniacal, self-centered, and cruel. This is, of course, peppered with Early Victorian verbosity, dramatism, and rambling plot, but its content, and the memorable anti-hero that it creates in Heathcliffe, are far less so. Violent, emotional, yet touching, the book creates its indelible charm in its slightly overblown examination of the darkness, but vulnerability, of the human soul."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This story is one of revenge. One day, instead of returning from town with gifts for his two children, the main patriarch instead brings back a \\"waif\\". This street kid, Heathcliff, who is the ridiculed underdog upon arrival, attempts to destroy two families and take their land.I always felt that Heathcliff was an illegitimate child that was claimed one day by his father for some unknown reason (mistress mom died?). For me, this explained the \\"lost soul mate\\" type comments made by his step (or real?) sister and her instinct not to marry him as the right thing even though she did not love the man that she did marry. You decide.Heathcliff is on of the most evil antagonists you will ever read about. He not only wants to win, but wants to destroy absolutely everything that his enemies value.The story itself has three stages which correspond to the three generations of characters. While this in and of itself is not interesting, the way Bronte manipulates the timeline is very effective. Most of the book is told not by the narrator, but by one of the family servants.Also interesting is the prevalence of mysticism versus traditional religion given the backdrop of both when it was written and the time period in which the story was set. The spirit world is front and center.This is not an uplifting book, but the talent of the author should not be missed."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I have to say that I never would have read this book, had I not read \\"The Well of Lost Plots\\" by Jasper Fforde. There's that once scene where Thursday and her boss appear at that \\"Anger management meeting\\" at Wuthering Heights, and the characters originally invented by Emily Bronte all explain why they hate Mr Heathcliff so much. It made me curious - who is this Mr Heathcliff, and why is \\"Wuthering Heights\\" in constant danger to explode from the emotions it contains?So I got me a copy, and I was fascinated. Not only have I never read a story that contains so much hatred, and revenge, and wild emotions - the characters all seem so real, and so fatal in their set ways - and Mr Heathcliff surely is a wonderful, interesting, enchanting character. Emily Bronte might not be as well-known or famous as her sister, but this book definitely is almost as good as Jane Eyre.If you're not sure whether you want to read this yet - read !The Well of lost Plots\\" first, and then you won't be able to live without!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"In Wuthering Heights the characters and households are so easy to visualize, yet when you get further on your perspective on the novel change dramatically. The relationship between Catherine and Heathcliff and Cathy and Hareton are so similar you'd believe they were the same people. Both catherine and Cathy, although they loved Heathcliff and Hareton, turned to Edgar and Linton for status, which played a very important role in the mid-ninteenth century. Yet Catherine was never able to follow through with her love for Heathcliff, while Cathy was able to wed Hareton after Edgar and Heathcliff's passing. The households of Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange are extreme opposites. Wuthering Heights is on a bleak, desolate hill, tormented by extremely rough weather. Thrushcross Grange is located in a warm, cozy valley. The inhabitants of Wuthering Heights, most likely due to the morose attitude of Heathcliff, are very gloomy and not welcoming to strangers. Thrushcross Grange is a very open, inviting household, with cheery inhabitants.In a simple page, all your views of the characters and the surroundings can change. When going through the novel, you must feel some pity for Heathcliff. But when the novel begins and ends, he can disgust you with his horrible ways and actions. Upon his death, Wuthering Heights, always a gloomy household, became cheerful and inviting.The relationship between generations is almost invisible. You'd come to believe Catherine and Cathy were the same people, and Edgar and Linton could be brothers. As with Heathcliff and Hareton. You see Cathy follow in her mother's footsteps in her love life, and Edgar and Linton were both frail growing up. You notice those characters have almost everything in common, yet there is always one difference. In Cathy and Catherine's case, Cathy was able to marry the one she loved, but Catherine died before she had the chance. Edgar was more refined than Linton, and was better able to stand up for himself. And Heathcliff, unlike Hareton, had some education, and was smart enough to stand up for himself.I thorougly enjoyed reading this book, it would've been even better without horrible deadlines*ahem*, but all in all I found the novel's characters and settings to be so creative and ever changing. I don't think I could've written this book in a lifetime. Of course I'm a VERY slow writer. Especially when there are deadlines, but... that's another story for another day. Too bad, you might have found it really good. Oh well. It might make you laugh too. But I shall not say anymore. I'm just going to make you ever so sad. Maybe you'll hear it someday. Wow, I'm really managing to drag this out. This should be worth extra extra credit. The suspense is just killing you I'm sure. Anyways, this was an excellent book, and I'm very glad I read it. Not to mention we're going to read Great Expectations next. Yay!? Goodnight, America."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I have just recently finished the book Wuthering Heights and have found it is a very interesting book.In the novel, Nelly Dean is telling Mr. Lockwood the story of Mr. Heathcliff, who is the landlord of the houses Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange.Mr. Heathcliff was a young, poor child when he was adopted into the rich Earnshaw household. As Heathcliff grew up he fell in love with Catherine Earnshaw, daughter of Mr. Earnshaw, and loved her throughout the rest of the novel. Once Catherine is old enough she decides to marry Edgar Linton for his social status (i.e. money, looks), and hopes to bring Heathcliff up out of the power of her brother Hindley. Heathcliff regrets her decision and runs away for three years.When Heathcliff comes back he is very wealthy and wishes to see Catherine after his time away for so long. After meeting with Catherine, Heathcliff is very upset at the fact that she married Mr. Edgar Linton. Heathcliff finds out that Isabella, Edgars sister, has fallen in love with him and he thinks it will be a perfect way to get revenge on not only on Catherine, but also Edgar Linton. Heathcliff marries Isabella and takes her to live and Wuthering Heights with him, where she is quite miserable due to the lack of hospitality. During this time period Catherine dies after she has her daughter Cathy, and Heathcliff is miserable because he never got to show his love towards her. At this point Isabella runs off to Gimmerton, the local village, and has a child named Linton which she asks her brother to come pick up so that Heathcliff could not torture him with the anger he had towards Isabella. After Edgar picks up Linton, Isabella dies and Edgar comes back to the Grange. The next day Nelly brings Linton over to the Heights because Heathcliff says its \\"his property\\". Young Cathy falls in love with her cousin Linton, even though he is always sick and moaning, and eventually marries him. Linton dies one night and Heathcliff taks control over both Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange. Young Cathy falls in love with Hareton, son of Hindley Earnshaw, and marries him. Heathcliff eventually dies and everyone lives happily ever after.I personally wouldn't have picked up this book myself if it was up to me, but my teacher had us read it in his class and im glad i did.

I immensely suspect that confederates of Heathcliff have either not read the second half of the story or are ignorant to the terrors of domestic violence. Where the plot lays asunder, I'd remark that Bront's ability to truly abhor me in the chilling degradation of Heathcliff and the ghastly haunting story that ensues, greatly pulls together an all around unsettling finish to an otherwise unremarkable tale. Over all while I can only fault the book for the story, the writing was much to my liking and I may very well come back to it in later years with a different eye. I think it's worth venturing a read, but I'd say not to get your hopes up on everything everyone sells Heathcliff to be."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I usually stay away from classics since most likely I won't like it at all, but since I like romance and heard that Wuthering Heights is a great classic story, I decided to give it try.I just don't see how can this be a great classic romance story.

Why did Mr. Earnshaw bring the boy Heathcliff home with him? Was Heathcliff his illegitimate son? Why does Catherine Earnshaw marry Edward Linton and not her true soul mate Heathcliff?As an English teacher, I am always reminded that sometimes the great novels of classical literature, like Wuthering Heights and to Kill a Mockingbird, would not get past the inquiry letter to the literary agent stage today. Why? Because both books have horrible beginnings. The reader must persevere in order to get to the meat and bones of the story. In the case of Wuthering Heights and to Kill a Mockingbird it is worth it.Catherine and Heathcliff are undoubtedly selfish human beings, but their love for each other is so powerful and damaging the story is a must read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I don't know if I can add much to what has aleeady been said about Wuthering Heights.

It centers on the relationship between Catherine and Heathcliff, or rather the lack of a real one...the basis of their passion for each other is pretty thin, which makes the depths of Heathcliff's obsession with her pretty hard to understand. That characterization didn't seem true to life to me anyway---rather than being passionate about one thing to the exclusion of everything else like that, people are usually passionate in general or mean all around, not this precarious mixture of the two.The story really picked up for me in the latter part, when Heathcliff attempts to continue taking out his grievances on the subsequent generation, whose ultimate fate redeemed the novel for me. So, definitely worth a read, just make sure to stick with it all the way through to the end. Still, I definitely didn't love it as much as I did Jane Eyre."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This was one of my favorite books when I was growing up.

Cannot find these classics in the stores and this way my kids will be able to enjoy as well."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I first purchased the novel a couple of years ago while I was still a teenager, and the book was difficult at first read. Over the years I've reread the pages again and again, in particular the beginning pages, which introduces us to Lockwood, who is first person narrator. The book is still difficult because of the layers, reading into first person commented. There is also a chronology in the narrating, and a complicated connection between past and present. Also the diction is complicated because two people are telling the story at the same time, because mr Lockwood is listening to Nelly most of the time.Nelly is a clear narrator of story between Catherine, Heathcliff, and always includes the involvement of everyone else (Edgar, Hindley, Isabella, Nelly herself), and also the second generation (Hareton, Linton, the young daughter of Catherine who shares her name).Catherine passes away very soon since giving birth to daughter Catherine, and her ghost lives on, in the spirit of her daughter, and in Wuthering Heights. Her ghost touches Lockwood early in the novel, before he reads her diary material, and he possibly closest sees her in the daughter, whom he says is beautiful. Lockwood has never met the first Catherine, but he has met Heathcliff. Lockwood is intrigued by Heathcliff, and by the story Nelly tells. We find out that Nelly is only two years age difference with the first Catherine, and apart from being the objective story teller, she is also passive narrator, because she is immediately involved with the subplot at the same time. She talks to Catherine and Heathcliff, she doesn't understand their love, but she looks after young Catherine at Thrushcroft Grange since her mother passes away. Also the relationsip between Catherine and Heathcliff is platonic, as told by her, and there is never physical or sexual interaction told by Nelly. Catherine had her daughter with husband, Edgar, not Heathcliff, but she never kisses, sleeps with or has sexual or physical interaction with Heathcliff, and critics sometimes pay attention to that happening when they read the novel. Less of the elder Catherine is told because she passes away under halfway through the course of the book. Most of the connection readers continue to feel is still platonic.The novel is very beautiful, because of the nature described about Wuthering Heights and Thrushcroft Grange. We know it is a world removed, as young Catherine marries Linton first (first cousin through Isabella and Edgar being siblings), then she marries Hareton (first cousin through Catherine and Hindley were siblings), but being married to cousins is still a taboo today. This makes it less surprising the novel was so controversial when it was first released, and critics sometimes still find it difficult to get interpretations around Catherine and Heathcliff's love, but although the novel was heavily criticised when first released, it found a place in critics' hearts over a vast amount of time. Readers can eventually come to understanding the book after reading and retracing, and in the end it was always worth the effort of rereading."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Everyone I know who read Wuthering Heights hated it. Said it was sad and the people were horrid. I actually enjoyed it. Yes, they were silly people who held in their feeling until it was too late and concentrated on revenge other than trying to make the best of life, but that's what makes it so great. Plenty of life lessons in this novel. I loved the ending. How one person could find a way and make everything right. Of course, I don't want to spoil it for you, just know that it is worth reading it through to the end to see how Emily brings everything full circle."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"When I ordered this book, the \\"Bed Book\\" was not clarified very clearly or I missed the point of what the bed book meant.

I dreaded the prospect of reading a Victorian romance. I think I may have even seen the Hollywood interpretation with Olivier. ( A poor pale and distant echo of the novel as it turns out). I read it because I was forced to. I was determined to dislike it. Even after starting the book I continued to criticize the foppish Lockwood wandering inanely about the moors in the classroom.There is no comparable book I have ever read. Its impact stays with you forever. Other reviewers are for more eloquent, but the vivid imagery and violent emotions of the protagonists is unparalleled. I have recommended this book to family and friends over the years, badgering them into reading it. The result is often the same. It was not what they were expecting and simply a great book. Perhaps they were being polite, who knows.If you have yet to read it, I envy you. That first reading is so memorable and surprising.You too will come to wonder \\"how any one could ever imagine unquiet slumbers for the sleepers in that quiet earth.\\""},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book is nothing special. I personally don't see why everyone considers this to be a masterpiece. First off I can't see how Bronte can turn such a stupid story into a 300 page novel. Another thing that bothered me was the narrative. The story was almost completely told in flashback and that flashback often broke into another flashback and a couple of time broke off into a third flashback. Another thing that was bad was the referce to the characters. One sentence she wold call Isabella Mrs. Linton then she would call Catherine Mrs. Linton also. Same situation with Mr. Heathcliff and Linton Heathcliff. Not to mention the fact that there were two Catherines which just added to the unproffesionalism of this book. What the heck was Joespeph saying!!!! Overall I believe reading this book was a complete waste of time and I would defenantly not recommend this book to anyone else. If you are looking for an enjoyable book from that era I strongly suggest you read Jane Erye by Emily's more competent sister Charlotte."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"No doubt about it, this book is a well written classic that generations continue to enjoy. I did in fact enjoy this book and got absorbed in the story. I was told this book was a love story; however, it is not just any love story. This book had depth and angles not only about love. In Wuthering Heights, as the years went by the Earnshaw's and Linton's became very dysfunctional. It seemed that there was no order in the family households. Most of all, I enjoyed the characters Emily Bronte created. Catherine Earnshaw was such a passionate character, her words moved me like no other book had. I was inspired greatly by Cathy's passion, &quot;It would degrade me to marry Heathcliff now; so he shall never know how I love him: and that, not because he's handsome, Nelly, but because he's more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same; and Linton's is as different as a moonbeam from lightning,or frost from fire (73).&quot; That paticular passage has always been my favorite. I felt so sorry for Heathcliff even though he became revengeful; however, I believe he was driven by passion himself. Catherine and Heathcliff were my favorite characters, but all the other characters were very important too. Altough the book is 'wordy', I throughly enjoyed the storyline and characters. So I have decided on ranking Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights an eight. Futhermore, I recommend this novel to anyone searching for a good book.

Sometimes I like books that others do not and sometimes others like books that I dont. This book lacks the hope and sense of awe for life that I desire in a novel. For me the hero and herroine must be worthy of my time and attention. Something good in them must prevail. That just doesn't happen here. This story is really sad because it is a love story writen by a woman who never know what it was like to love and be loved in return. IF she had she would never have writen this abusive version of love. But you know as well as i do that some women truely belive that abuse is love. So like I say to each his own.P.S.

The book is a masterpiece with unforgettable characters and a great and swift-moving plot. I bet that anyone who has read this book has not forgotten Catherine and Heathcliff.

It is very well written, the plot is interesting and all it wants is a story book ending. Throughout the book the reader finds that the misery of the characters is because of the selfishness and hatred that some of the characters have for one another. One sees that the hatred of one man for a small orphan child carries into the second and third generation of his children and grandchildren. Although Emily Bronte masterpiece can never top her sisters book,&quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, it is worth reading, and contamplating its message."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"wuthering heights is a good story, but some things seem to be repeated several times making it some-what boring. it took me a long time to finish because of this."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Just when the book starts getting interesting, someone starts whining and complaining about their illnesses!

It's a timeless book for everyone, combining elements that make it enveloping for both men and women. I must confess I have a hard time keeping myself interested in many classics I have read, but this one was different.

It is creative, intelligent and in a bizarre way romantic. Heathcliff is a powerful character as are both Catherine's. Unfortunatly for me I do have to write an essay on it. Under most circumstances I wouldn't care but I have to write about the storms in the novel and what they mean. According to my teacher there are 43 but I have not found that many. This makes me detest the book. Which bites because it is a magnificent piece of literature and it is terrible that Emily was not around to know of it's success or that it could have been a success when she was still alive."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Very passionate, a flavor of undying defying love.

It was not until 1850, when WUTHERING HEIGHTS received a second printing with an introduction by Emily's sister Charlotte, that it attracted a wide readership. And from that point the reputation of the book has never looked back. Today it is widely recognized as one of the great novels of English literature.Even so, WUTHERING HEIGHTS continues to divide readers. It is not a pretty love story; rather, it is swirling tale of largely unlikeable people caught up in obsessive love that turns to dark madness. It is cruel, violent, dark and brooding, and many people find it extremely unpleasant. And yet--it possesses a grandeur of language and design, a sense of tremendous pity and great loss that sets it apart from virtually every other novel written.The novel is told in the form of an extended flashback. After a visit to his strange landlord, a newcomer to the area desires to know the history of the family--which he receives from Nelly Deans, a servant who introduces us to the Earnshaw family who once resided in the house known as Wuthering Heights. It was once a cheerful place, but Old Earnshaw adopted a \\"Gipsy\\" child who he named Heathcliff. And Catherine, daughter of the house, found in him the perfect companion: wild, rude, and as proud and cruel as she. But although Catherine loves him, even recognizes him as her soulmate, she cannot lower herself to marry so far below her social station. She instead marries another, and in so doing sets in motion an obsession that will destroy them all.WUTHERING HEIGHTS is a bit difficult to \\"get into;\\" the opening chapters are so dark in their portrait of the end result of this obsessive love that they are somewhat off-putting. But they feed into the flow of the work in a remarkable way, setting the stage for one of the most remarkable structures in all of literature, a story that circles upon itself in a series of repetitions as it plays out across two generations. Catherine and Heathcliff are equally remarkable, both vicious and cruel, and yet never able to shed their impossible love no matter how brutally one may wound the other.As the novel coils further into alcoholism, seduction, and one of the most elaborately imagined plans of revenge it gathers into a ghostly tone: Heathcliff, driven to madness by a woman who is not there but who seems reflected in every part of his world--dragging her corpse from the grave, hearing her calling to him from the moors, escalating his brutality not for the sake of brutality but so that her memory will never fade, so that she may never leave his mind until death itself. Yes, this is madness, insanity, and there is no peace this side of the grave or even beyond.It is a stunning novel, frightening, inexorable, unsettling, filled with unbridled passion that makes one cringe. Even if you do not like it, you should read it at least once--and those who do like it will return to it again and again.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Rather than delve on the contents of this strangest and strongest of English novels, so intensely poetic in its haunting darkness and otherness, I'll comment briefly on the best editions available for a good first contact:A) Text oriented editions (that is, editions with few materials added: normally an Introduction, annotation, and perhaps Charlotte's Peface and Biographical Notice and some bibliographical indications).1. Oxford World's Classics: authoritative text, good annotation,excellent introduction.2. Penguin's Classics: same as above, everything looks a little shorter but is excellent nonetheless.3. Wordsworth Classics edition. This would be a rather fine edition as befitting this collection, if it had a good 1847 text and not the heavily tampered-with Charlotte's 1850 edition. The text itself reflects accurately that of the 1900 Haworth Edition -a careful one-. The wording changes aren't perhaps so worrying nor is the toning-down of the dialectal tirades -although funny and useless-. What is worrying is the disappearance of more than six hundred paragrapph entries (I mean just the paragraphing, not the contents itself!), that makes for a different -and worse- reading experience. Very good and full -if brief- annotation. Mass-market, glued paperback.4. Heather Glen's for Routledge. One of the finest text-oriented editions, especially for the excellent Introduction and Epilogue together with its good annotation, out-of-print for rather obscure reasons. If you find still a very good to fine copy at amazon Canadian branch (or at abebooks.com, it would be a good buy.5. Orchises two-volume facsimile reprint of the 1847 edition. No notes nor any additional material. the books are well produced if a little expensive. Very interesting item, but only suitable for textual scholars or would-be scholars, or otherwise for fetish-oriented WH-maniacs.B) Study-oriented editions (i.e. editions that contain additional contextual information: early reviews, selection of Emily's poems, critical essays, chronologies of the novel or of the Bronte family...).6. Norton's Fourth Edition (current item): OK, the text is still a little idiosyncratic, but the notes are much improved, and so is everything else (with the anthology of poems, and the critical essays). A very fine study edition but also suitable for a first contact, although annotation is still on the scarce side. Good paperback production without flaps but signature-sewn (or so it seems) and good paper and printing quality (albeit with a rather small type).7. Broadview edition by Beth Newman: it's one of the best study editions overall. There are some minor textual foibles and the annotation is decidedly scanty (to make amends for Heywood excesses) but good and accurate, and both Prof. Newman ecellent Introduction and the selection of the additional contextual material is, arguably, the finest ever (including the very interesting document on \\"Brain fever\\"). Materially speaking, it is a good paperback without flaps with good paper and printing quality (like Norton Critical, although I can't ascertain without tearing apart my copy of Beth Newman's that it be signature-sewn instead of glue-only \\"perfect binding). In any case a very good buy.7. Alison Booth's for Longman Cultural. Other of the very best study editions available. The text is deadly acuurate -except for some 1850 unobtrusive detail- on theClarendon 1976 reference critical edition, although the punctuation -like Norton Critical, Broadview's Newman and Oneworld's one- has been silently lightened and modernized throughout. It looks like glue-only \\"perfect binding\\" paperback, but perhaps it is signature-sewn. Paper and printing quality are good enough. The only misgiving I have is the overdone fragmentation of contextual material (good and relevant material though it is): there are 40+ items, many of them very short or they wouldn't fit into 430 pages. One of the best possible buys.8. Onewold's Classics edition. A fine paperback edition with flaps, very good paper and printing quality and (I rather surmise than know for sure) signature-sewn. The text looks like 1847 in paragraphing but it takes in toomany of 1850 \\"improvements\\" and is wrong at some places: it's short of a disaster, but rather non-reliable (in spite of the well-meant efforts by the almost anonymous editing panel who perpetrated it). Annotation is good and comprehensive enough, but the contextual material is rather scanty and run-of-the-mill non-commital.9. Barnes&Noble;'s Tatiana Holway edition (hardcover). To say it promptly the only fault with this lovely edition (but, as stated above in wordsworth Classics edition, a really big fault) is its accurate and reliable 1850 Haworth Edition text. Other than this, it looks as a popularly oriented edition, but with quality marks. The Introduction by Daphne Merkin is good enough, the annotation by Holway is really excellent. Supplementary material is very scanty: the \\"Charlotte's prefatory materials\\" of 1850 (prefixed to the text, which is a pity), and some comments about film and TV adaptations as well as some chosen excerpts of reviews. Material production is outstanding: nice hardcover with dust jacket, good paper and printing quality, the only good available edition in a becoming format (Clarendon Edition is very hard to come by nowadays: say one to three years to pin it down). Don't forget the Franklin Mint editions of the sixties and seventies if you are interested in a very beautiful book with a reliable 1847 text and illustrations by Alan Reingold (and nothing else)."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"There is a thin line between love and hate, and once Heathcliff crosses it, we see a grand, passionate and absorbingly interesting man turn into a fearsome thug. Thwarted in his love for his childhood soulmate, Catherine Earnshaw, Heathcliff turns his devastation outward, becoming a hateful -- and hated -- person all across the bleak moors that surround his Yorkshire village.Heathcliff courts and marries the sister of the man whom Catherine chose over Heathcliff, only to torture her emotionally as a way of getting even with her brother. Meanwhile, Catherine slowly wastes away pining for Heathcliff, for although she once rejected him, she eventually realizes that she has made an irredeemable error and can never be happy. Heathcliff sums up the tragedy of their lives in a single question near the end of the novel when he asks, \\"Why did you betray your heart, Cathy?\\"Sound depressing? It's not. Wuthering Heights is a grand and glorious novel that dramatically illustrates the power of love, for good and ill. But more importantly, it teaches us that the only path to happiness is to be true to one's heart, rather than one's head. Had Catherine honored her bond with Heathcliff and refused to bow to the social mores of her day, not only would the two of them been much happier, but all of the many people whose lives they stumbled into would have been much better off.Another reviewer said that those of us who love this novel probably have a strong identification with one of the characters, and for me that is quite true. That's the reason for reading a classic like Wuthering Heights, because when it speaks to you in the clear and true way that Bronte does, you know that you are not alone, and that some things transcend time and place.Think about it -- a prim, Victorian preacher's daughter living on the moors of England before there was electricity can reach across 150 years of time and speak to the heart of a wired American in the 21st century. Pretty amazing, and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"\\"Wuthering Heights,\\" Emily Bronte's only published novel, is a saga of two Yorkshire families who live in the remote Pennine Hills of England's North Country. To me the book has always epitomized the best of gothic fiction. The narrative is filled with intensity of feeling, especially Heathcliff's passionate love for his Cathy and hers for him - a love which endures beyond the grave. More than would be lovers, however, the two are soul mates and have been since their childhood. Cathy once told Nelly, her servant and friend: \\"My greatest thought in living is Heathcliff. If all else perished, and he remained, I should still continue to be... Nelly, I am Heathcliff! He's always, always in my mind: not as a pleasure... but as my own being.\\"Yet, the novel is more than a love story. \\"Wuthering Heights\\" is about hatred, cruelty, delusion, frustrated yearning, obsession, deep despair and vengeance. At times its very darkness is depressing and painful. Yet love and faithfulness, which endure beyond death, bring hope and much needed light to this tale; as does a second love story, born from the seeds of the first. The author also addresses the issues of social class here. Both Linton and Earnshaw families are considered gentry. However, the Linton's are a more educated, cultured group and appear to be of a higher class than those who reside at Wuthering Heights. Some of Catherine's most crucial decisions involve moving up in society.The story is told in a series of narratives, none of which are entirely reliable. During the winter of 1801, a gentleman named Mr. Lockwood rents a manor house called Thrushcross Grange in Yorkshire. He has a natural curiosity, and in time visits his neighbor and wealthy landlord, Heathcliff, a grim, forbidding man who lives at Wuthering Heights, a few miles from the Grange. Lockwood also makes the acquaintance of Heathcliff's housekeeper Ellen Dean, called Nelly, and asks her to tell him about her employer and the history of those who reside at Wuthering Heights. He documents her narrative in his journal, and his written recollections make up the main portion of the novel. Much of Nellie's tale consists of memories from years before, her observations of life with the Earnshaw family, her recollections of the Lintons, and her own conclusions, which are subjective. Lockwood, gets his information second hand, from Nellie's perspective. He continually interprets, and misinterprets the relationships and actions of the characters who play such major roles here. So, it is up to the reader to make sense of it all - which is what the author intended.As a young girl Nelly worked as a servant at Wuthering Heights for Mr. Earnshaw, the owner, his wife, and their two children, Hindley, and Catherine. Earnshaw returned from a business trip to Liverpool with a gypsy-like urchin, a dark-haired, handsome orphan boy. He had taken quite a fancy to the lad, a quiet, stoic child, and names him Heathcliff, after a son who died. Earnshaw decides to raise him with his own children. Catherine befriends Heathcliff almost instantly. They share a love of nature, and an emotional intensity unknown to most people. They are able to communicate with each other easily, even as young children, and both possess tremendously creative imaginations. The two roam the moorland wilderness, where they're most at home, like wild creatures of nature, and become inseparable friends. Hindley detests Heathcliff from the first. He is jealous and goads the boy constantly. Eventually, after the death of his wife, Mr. Earnshaw begins to show preference for Heathcliff over his own son, which exacerbates the hostility. Finally, Hindley is sent away to school and Heathcliff is kept at home, at Earnshaw's side.Hindley comes into his inheritance some years later, at age twenty, when his father dies. Cathy is eleven years-old, and Heathcliff about twelve, when the heir returns to Wuthering Heights, and seeks vicious revenge for having his rights usurped by a wretched boy from the slums with no means of his own. Obviously Heathcliff cannot defend himself and is totally dependent on Hindley. He is forced to work as a laborer in the fields, and is treated harshly, as less worthy than an animal. He and Cathy maintain their closeness. They still wander the wild North country and she shares her studies with him. One night they pay a clandestine visit to Thrushcross Grange, home of the Linton family. Cultured, spoiled and very well behaved, young Edgar and Isabella live there. When a dog savagely bites Cathy, it is discovered that she and Heathcliff have been hiding in the brush spying. The girl is seriously injured and is forced to stay at the Grange for several weeks to recover. During her time with the Linton family, Mrs. Linton becomes intent on turning wild, mischievous Cathy into a young lady. She encourages her to become a young woman with manners and actions appropriate to her social standing in society, rather than the wild, headstrong creature she is while roaming the moors with Heathcliff. By the time Catherine returns home, in elegant new clothes, she has become infatuated with Edgar Linton. Needless to say, her relationship with Heathcliff deteriorates significantly, as he feels he is losing the only person he ever loved.Edgar pursues Catherine relentlessly, and eventually, the young woman's desire for social advancement, and an inexplicable fey, self destructive quality about her, prompt her to accept his proposal. However, she really does not love her fiance. She may care for him, but her feelings are much less than what her passionate nature requires. On the other hand genteel women of this period were supposed to have neither \\"passionate\\" nor intense feelings. \\"'Here and here!' replied Catherine, striking one hand on her forehead and the other on her breast: 'in which ever place the soul lives. In my soul and in my heart, I'm convinced I'm wrong!'\\" Thus Catherine acknowledges to Nelly that her marriage to Edgar cannot be one of love. Although she knows that Heathcliff is her true love, however, she cannot marry him because he has been so debased by Hindley. \\"It would degrade me to marry Heathcliff now; so he shall never know how I love him: and that, not because he's handsome, Nelly, but because he's more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same; and Linton's is as different as a moonbeam from lightening, or frost from fire\\". Her powerful connection to Heathcliff is always present, no matter how annoyed she becomes with him. Heathcliff leaves Wuthering Heights a bitter man. He knows that if he had come from a better social class, or had wealth, Cathy would have married him. When he finally returns, years later, a self-possessed, successful, wealthy man, he is obsessed with revenge, and is more adept at exacting it than Hindley ever was.Nelly continues her increasingly complex tale, (which I won't spoil for you), of three generations: of births, marriages, deaths, traumas, complications, a second more hopeful love story and redemption. The most recurring theme is the great love and friendship, the everlasting connection, between Cathy and her Heathcliff, whose difficult nature is almost impossible to understand and to accept - unless, of course, one thinks about his unknown origins and early childhood as a homeless waif in Liverpool. One can only imagine the horrors he experienced wandering the streets of the rough port town, with neither protection nor kindness. What cruelty and meanness of spirit did he learn there? His terrible, inhuman treatment at Hindley's hands certainly played a part in Heathcliff's lust for revenge and lack of mercy, as did Catherine's decision to marry Linton, which must have been devastating for him. Heathcliff remains a dark, brooding, cruel man throughout his adult years and never reforms. He is an anti-hero, at least in my eyes, as he also possesses good qualities, along with a terrible sadness, an emptiness and longing which he shows to Cathy alone.Emily Bronte's extraordinary prose is filled with powerful imagery. Miss Bront spent most of her short life at home, in Thornton, Yorkshire, where she was happiest. She loved the surrounding moors - the wide, wild expanses, unsuitable for cultivation, and full of danger. There are bogs and wetlands on the moors, which can go virtually unseen, and where one can drown. It is also a place of great beauty. The author spent much time walking there with her dogs and was terribly unhappy when she was away. The similarities between the author's natural environment and that of the area around Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange are obvious. Ms Bronte drew inspiration from the regional Yorkshire architecture also, as well as her own personal experiences and her amazing imagination, a gift Charlotte, Emily, Anne and Branwell Bronte shared - with each other and with us. I have read a few Bronte biographies and always felt that the character of Catherine Earnshaw, certainly her intensity and love of nature, was based on Emily Bronte.Keep a box of tissues handy throughout your reading of \\"Wuthering Heights.\\" I wonder if this is the first tearjerker?JANA"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I'm 16 and fall into the vast catogory of Wutehring Heights readers who had to finish it for a highschool english assignment. If I hadn't been, er, forced to read it, I never would've encountered this amazing book. The themes that it encompasses, love, hate, revenge, isolation, are so masterfully blended in this book that I found it extremely powerful. True, it is not a romance - it is so much more. I didn't find it confusing, although Joseph's lines had to be read allowed several times before they were actaully understood. The doubling-up of names just increases the sense of isolation within the book, something which I think is rather important to the story. I hardly find this book boring at all, it's passionate and full of action, something which took me completely off guard. Please, give it a chance. And even though he was a complete jerk, my favourite character is still Heathcliff. *G*"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Is there anybody out there who hasn't heard of Heathcliff, the dark villian/hero of this high pitched and utterly committed work of madness? Oh, I love it. It was difficult for me at first. I'm a writer, but not a natural reader. But once I was into this book, once I stopped asking questions of the narrative and just entered the shadowy world of Catherine and her doomed household, I was quite literally spellbound. Bronte died believing this book was a failure. What a dreadful irony that this quiet, disciplined woman who lived out her life in a cold parsons' house with her brilliant sisters, her drunken brother and her eccentric father (The man memorized Paradise Lost: imagine. And outlived all his children!) never even had an inkling that this outpouring of her heart and soul would become a classic, overshadowing even her sister's highly successful Jane Eyre. Both Bronte sisters had the capacity to create archetypes -- to imprint upon the culture seminal patterns that endure to the present time. One last point: the father was Irish. Madness and genius in the blood, indeed. Enjoy it. I read it over every year or so, sometimes twice in a row. I study it; I watch all the film versions. I just love it, the way it works, its strange cruelty and enchantment."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The fact that this novel was written when Emily Bronte was only 28 years old, two years before her death, makes one wonder what she would have been capable of had she lived longer and continued writing. I must admit, this was one of those books that I appreciate for its literary merit more than enjoy for its pure reading pleasure. But if the true test of a novel is how visceral of a reaction the reader has to its characters, then this is certainly a fine novel. Each of Bronte's characters is exquisitely developed in his or her own way. And each evokes powerful emotional responses from the reader - mostly negative reactions of anger, frustration, disgust, etc. - but reactions, nonetheless. A well-written character, remember, does not have to be a character that you admire or love; pathetic, self-centered, cruel characters can be the product of exceptional writing, as long as they evoke genuine feelings of revulsion from the reader.And this novel is full of characters that will earn little admiration from readers. Indeed, the only character that was really \\"likeable\\" was the temporary tenant of the Wuthering Heights estate, to whom the story is recounted by Ellen, the servant. Ellen gives her account of the events that she witnessed as the domestic employee of Catherine, a self-centered, melodramatic eccentric who falls in love with Heathcliff, the gypsy who under somewhat mysterious circumstances is brought by her father to live in their home. Despite her love, Catherine marries Edgar, causing Heathcliff to devote the remainder of his years to exacting revenge for her betrayal. What follows is a dark, brutal, sometimes frightening tale of a pathological love affair and its tragic consequences.Bronte certainly did not view the world through rose-colored glasses, if Wuthering Heights is any indication of her personal world view. It can be a difficult read at times, only because the few redeemable qualities of the main characters are so powerfully overshadowed by their flaws, their cruel intentions, and the bleak outlook that Bronte portrays. It certainly deserves its place, however, among the classics of English literature, and its characters, despite their shortcomings (or perhaps because of them), will live long in the readers mind after the final page."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Jane Bronte wrote Wuthering Heights not to show what love IS. But what love can DO to those who are encompassed by desire. This novel is simply brilliant and by far the greatest novel of the Brontes and (in my opinion) the greatest novel ever written. I say this because Emily laid aside all the conventional types of victorian writing and imbued her novel with persons and events that are not ordinary, but utterly fascinating. Almost completely unrealistic at times, yet perfectly sound in their meanings. Some say to me that Wuthering Heights is impossible to enjoy. While others say they dislike the characters so much that they had to stop reading. I also hear that they cannot figure out all the plot twist and turns. But I say, is this not what REAL-LIFE is? There is no certainty of happiness in the lives of Catherine and Heathcliff. Certainly there is no certainty of happiness for ANYONE in the novel. (Which goes the same for all of us.) As wretched as this seems, Emily (in my opinion) did not write a full blown epic of true romance, despite what many say they love about this novel. She took humans and turned them into what is surprizingly MORE realistic. Emily filled them with faults and turned Cathy and Heathcliff into selfish and undeserving people who destroy each other, not out of love, but out of greed and their own unharnessable animal-like behaviour of what love was TO THEM. What they do and say isn't romantic, but a sign (or even a warning from Emily) of what self indulgence and obsession can do to people pushed beyond their limits of common sense. Cathy and Heathcliff brought themselves to believe that their love was REAL, when in fact their grasp of love was (as Charlotte said, PERVERTED.) Unrelenting in it's destructivness, thus leading to the various calamities their actions bestowed upon the (somewhat) innocent people surrounding them. As brilliant as this novel is, the greatness lies in the story telling of the many different characters we meet. The many different view points from Nellie to Edgar to Isabella and Hindley, spread across the pages and show you how they interact and react with one another as they expierence the situations which seem so very wild and incredible yet ring so very true. This (to me) is not exactly a novel about unbending love. But more of a study of the weaknesses that is stored in everyman. Emily gave us a written guide to show that following your instincts and passions is not always the best path to take. And Emily accomplished this with the most brilliant and unsurpassed written novel in history. It's pages burn with life and it's characters speak in tongues which, even now, I cannot always fully understand. Wuthering Heights can be looked upon as a fascinating study of a particular human race (at what could be any time frame) covering the ground of but a few persons, admist the many open miles... Thank you for your eyes..."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"As with other Wuthering Heights editions, I will not delve into the depths of this strangest and strongest of novels, with its haunting poetical intensity, its everyday realism, its display of physical and psychical violence, its metaphysical contents and its eerie beautiful otherness. As the noted critic C. A. Swinburne put it in 1883:\\"It may be true that not many will ever take it to their hearts: it is certain that those who do like it will like nothing very much better in the whole world of poetry or prose\\".By the way, whatever the edition you end up with (or none), don't forget to havea try with Emily Bront&eacute; poems, or a sensible selection from them. I realize that this review is by far too long: so, if you are in a hurry, I think that you can skip safely to the last paragraph (\\"SO WHAT?\\") for practical recommendations.The real issue that we face now is: how much does THIS PARTICULAR EDITION of Emily Bront's novel measure up to its intended goal? How does it compare with other editions currently available?Beginning with the bottom line, THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST \\"STUDY\\" EDITIONS EVER, together with Beth Newman's one for Broadview Press and Dunn's one for Norton Critical (4th edition). By a \\"study\\" edition (in roughly the same sense as a \\"study\\" Bible), I mean one that is richly annotated, with an interesting Introduction and a variety of context-oriented documents, such as critical reviews or essays, biographical or chronological items, a selection of poems or other writings... Such an edition must be evaluated firstly by his handling (more or less scholarly or careful) of the TEXT(s) involved, then by the choice of supplementary materials (whether interesting or not, balanced or else), in third place by the quality and accuracy of the Introduction and notes, ending with very important issues of design (user-friendly, beautiful) and material production (durability, paper and print quality, binding).IN SUMMARY, lest I get too long and formal, this is a well cared for, accurate and reliable 1847-type text, springing out of the University of Virginia electronic texts, but tightly controlled by the 1976 Clarendon Edition one (by Hilda Marsden and Ian Jack), and silently adapted as punctuation is concerned (resulting in a friendly version, which the scholarly reconstructed punctuation of Clarendon is not).THE INTRODUCTION is short (11 pp) and well planned so that it opens ways for understanding, but can be read before the novel without spoiling anything.It sounds a bit like run-of-the-mill material, but this is a deceiving image(Alison Booth's command of the material is always there).THE ANNOTATION IS VERY GOOD and extensive enough, with full and right glosses of the dialect tirades, and accurate, to-the-point information on biblical or literary references, or contextual ways and means.In that most elusive of references, the one about Milo (of Croton) in Chapter IX, however, Alison Booth edition slips a little, like many other good ones (with Clarendon doing a little better, the ones getting the story right if not in full are Barnes&Noble;, Wordsworth Classics, Penguin/Nestor, Broadview/Newman, Oneworld Classics and the excellent but ill-fated Routledge edition by Heather Glen). According to the Geography of Strabo, Book XII, which is the only source for this story, Milo in his old age tried to tear apart in two a tree half split and with a wedge to retain it open. He then exerted all his force with his hands, opening the gap wide enough for the wedge to drop off; the tree closed (it requires an ever increasing force to continue opening the trunk -this is Hooke's Law in physics-) and trapped the hands of Milo, who was then devoured by wolves.It is regarding this story that we read in the novel:\\"Who is to separate us, pray? They'll meet the fate of Milo!\\" (who also tried unwisely and deadly to SEPARATE something). Saying in a note, as Booth does, \\"In the classical fable, Milo, an athlete, tried to pull a tree up by the roots\\" is a little misleading (not only do we lose the \\"separation factor\\", but also accuracy. Milo is neither a fable nor a myth, but a real human being with a place both in time and on earth, mentioned with consistent witness by two of the best historians of the time, other than Strabo. As to the stories connected to him, nothing is known for sure when we go into the details, and so the label \\"legend\\" is most appropriate).The CONTEXTUAL MATERIALS are well chosen and presented. The only problem, and I think THE GREATEST PROBLEM with this otherwise excellent edition, is that there are 40+ items of this material and only 130 pages to fit them in: it looks hopelessly like a motley medley of maddening fragments, with, say, ONLY FIVE OF EMILY'S POEMS, which is both a pity and a blunder. There are interesting curios as the \\"Table of the average yearly wages paid to domestics... according to their rank in a household\\".More important are the pages devoted to Yorkshire dialect (too scarce) and ballads (very good). There is also a fair amount of space (11 pages) allotted to \\"cultural dissemination\\", that is, works of art (songs, theatrical or musical adaptations as well as TV or movie ones, sequels...) deriving from or related with the novel.The data included are very good and complete except for the chapter on translations in which, just as an example, only two translations into Spanish are listed, and only one in current use although it is barely acceptable: there are by now no less than TEN Spanish translations easily available; some are very good, some are rightly annotated, none is both things together and none is based on the 1847 text (but on the 1850 one).MATERIAL PRODUCTION is... fair enough, as far as I can tell without ripping apart my copy. A not-too-bad paperback, perhaps even signature-sewn but without flaps (with cover corners and even front-edge vulnerable). Paper quality looks good (time will tell) and printing quality is excellent. Design is clear and user-friendly(I will not comment on the typeface they use for big headlines, perhaps somebody will love it).SO WHAT?If an accurate and reliable text and a rich annotation are a must,then stick to this Longman Cultural Edition (by Alison Booth).If you can make do with a generally reliable text with a few errors, some idiosyncratic readings and inconsistencies and, besides, you don't mind a scanty annotation (but with full dialectal glosses), and you will appreciate the finest choice ever of contextual materials (but with only EIGHT OF EMILY's POEMS) as well as a MOST INTERESTING and thought-provoking INTRODUCTION (29pp), then choose the Broadview Press edition by Beth Newman (be sure not to pick their earlier one by Christopher Heywood!).If, on the other side, you may accept a generally reliable text and a very scanty annotation (but with full dialectal glosses), and you would appreciate the best presentation ever of early reviews and similar materials (Charlotte's prefaces for 1850, and some letters by Charlotte) and you would enjoy a really good and wide enough selection of EIGHTEEN EMILY's POEMS, then don't miss the elegant and no-nonsense Fourth Edition of Norton Critical (by R.J. Dunn, with almost the same text, for good and worse, of the late and mourned William M. Sale 1963 1st edition).Have a haunting reading!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I read this book aloud to my wife 23 years ago. At the time, I was working as an apprentice at a winery on the Rhine River. There was an old medeival castle across the river from our room. It was the perfect setting, as we two were the only English speaking people in the town. I think now is the right time to review the book, because I can only recall the feelings left behind by this powerful work of literature. Most of the plot and many of the characters have been long forgotten, leaving only the residue of strong emotion. I have read many works of powerful fiction by the world's great authors since then. But not one of them affected me emotionally the way this extraordinary tale did. I remember one gray German morning finishing the chapter where Heathcliff digs up the body of his beloved Catherine because he has gone mad in his desire to hold her close once more. And then off to the Altenkirch Schwanenkellerei I went. I spent the rest of the day working quietly in the cellars of the winery, deep inside the mountain with mold hanging all about, and brooding over the maniacal behavior of these highly romantic, insane characters. I've never been able to shake the feeling entirely. There is something so entirely timeless about this work, as though it were a piece of ancient literature, old far beyond the 1840s setting, something so utterly classical and piercingly primordial, it's as though you already had the genesis of this material in your DNA and it only required this story to bring it back to life within you. You recognize the spell it weaves because it speaks to the humanity in you so clearly, it is as though you have been secretly drugged. The English language has rarely been utilized as well as it has here, and I dare say you would need to go back to Shakespeare to find its parallel. Romanticism reached its high water mark with this novel. Ms. Bront has now become immortal because of her creation, and in the Pantheon of world literaure, she stands among the Titans. If you are a native speaker of the English language, you can hardly consider yourself educated if you have not read this astounding novel of romantic love and uncontrollable passion."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"It is a dark book, almost a ghost story - the kind of thing that must have inspired our modern-day Anne Rice, minus the fangs. It is also a great illustration of the ultimate dysfunctional relationship: Intense passion and misery; haunted souls. Love can be very powerful, but don't try this at home kids!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Well this book is was very interesting but everyone had the same name so that made it confusing. But once you figured out who was who it was a very good book and totaly worth reading."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I thought the novel was an excellent classic. I feel that Bronte wrote from the very core of her heart. She uses a humongous use of setting. The way she describes the Heights and the Grange , you can see it and almost feel the difference between the two places. It is a very powerful love story of two people who love so strongly. I love this book and would recommend this to anyone."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I was supposed to read &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; for a college humanities class. Well, . . . ummm . . . I didn't.It wasn't until almost ten years later, when my wife recommended this book to me, that I finally &quot;bit the bullet&quot; and read it.&quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; is a dark, sometimes tragic, love story. The characters have a depth to them that causes the reader to become emotionally involved with them. I found that I was cursing Heathcliffe on one page, and pitying him on the next.My only regret concerns myself more than the book. The ever-decreasing attention span of Americans today made me feel at time that the book got a little long. Perhaps if I weren't so distorted by a sitcom mentality where conflicts are resolved neatly in thirty minutes (minus time for commercials), I wouldn't have felt this way. In other words, the fault here is with my reading of the book, not with the book itself. Just be prepared when reading it.But read it nonetheless!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"this is a really good book that i had to read for school and i have not finished it yet but i look forward to an ending that is even more twisted then the previous chapters"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering heights is a book whitch everyone should read. it is a facinating love story between two wild individuals.

Bront didnt get deep enough into the characters thoughts and emotions because she wrote it from a third person perspective, that of Nelly Deen. And what was Joseph saying?! I just skipped over his infrequent lines. Also, she should have made it longer, she just zoomed right through the lives and loves of Catherine, Heathcliff, Edgar, Miss Catherine, and Linton, who were all very interesting characters. Those characters were so interesting that the reader should have gotten to know them better! But, it is a classic everyone should read. Also, I found myself quite enraged with Nelly throughout most of the book because she was the main hindrance in the loving relationships between Catherine and Heathcliff and that of Miss Catherine and Linton. She was stern and not understanding of the young mind and definitely not a romantic. And, I thought she was mostly exaggerating about Heathcliff, untill the end where I saw how he treated Hareton and Miss Catherine so poorly, and then i saw that maybe Nelly was right!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Amazing book. Truly amazing. The story keeps you gripped until the end, and the dark, driven obsession within the characters (especially Heathcliff) is rather fascinating, as well as the uncertainty it inflicts in the reader of whether to call Heathcliff the protagonist or the antagonist, which makes him one of my all-time-favorite novel characters."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is the most devastating, romantic book ever written. Emily Bronte is a magician, and her magic entraps you through this book.

If all else perished, and HE remained, I should still continue to be...Nelly, I AM Heathcliff!&quot;"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is the best book that I have ever read (and being an English lit graduate, you can believe I've read a lot!).

Neither Heathcliff nor Catherine are heroes--rather they are the villians who want to love each other, but are thwarted by circumstance.

Great value."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"One of my personal criteria of a \\"classic\\" novel - and a reason these certain books are read and re-read throughout the years - is some kind of illumination of our human nature. 'Wuthering Heights,' in my opinion, is one of these novels. On the surface, it is a love story. But deeper than that, the characters could be any of us. How many times have we been our own worst enemy? In this story, the characters make decisions that we, as the reader, know are the wrong decisions. Yet it is easy to identify with the mistakes that the characters make. Any of us could (and have) made those same wrong decisions. Perhaps this is why this novel has resonated with so many readers and made the story so timeless.Read it for a good story, then think about it later and put yourself in the character's shoes. I think you'll find it illuminating and something that will stick with you a long, long time."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is almost unique among classic literature for the point of view from which it is told. Various people who are not principal to the story are telling what they saw to a man new to the area. So the amount available for telling is much less than were the story told from the all-knowing point of view of most novels or the first person point of view. It is astonishing how well the author uses this limited point of view to relate the passions and fears of the principal characters. Anyone who has not read Wuthering Heights as an assignment in high school or college should read it for the enjoyment. It well deserves its reputation as a classic of English literature. The book has been made into movies a number of times, so many people who have never read the book are familiar with the story, or at least to the end of the first generation. Even if you know the story, you will enjoy the beauty of the book as literature. The book is also a powerful statement against the limitations in legal rights of women at the time. It is this powerlessness which produces the tragedy in the second generation. So the book can be read as a women's lib argument; I have no idea if the author intended to make such an argument; it's not being in any way a polemic makes the point in a very matter of fact way, but the reader is aware nonetheless.Read Wuthering Heights if you can; you will not regret it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I have to disagree with previous reviewers who called Heathcliff evil. I dont believe so at all. He is a driven man full of passion and emotion. And when his life is shattered he scrambles to find some dignity, pride and content. It is through unfortunate circumstances surrounding him that he never finds them no matter how hard he searches for them.Heathcliff grows up with Catherine. They share a special connection throughout their childhood and adolescence. Catherine is the only person who can talk him out of a mood, cheer him up and make him laugh. He shares his dreams and secrets with her. Heathcliff is deeply in love with her and for a time believes that love is returned.But Catherine is a foolish and sometimes cruel girl who is a product of her upbringing. She knows Heathcliff is a poor nobody of dubious lineage and she doubts that he will ever amount to much. She wants to marry someone who is her social equal, someone who will keep her in style and give her social standing. So she selfishly marries Linton without even once giving a thought to anyone or anything else. The fact that Linton is Heathcliff's sworn enemy doesnt bother her for a second.Heathcliff is completely devastated by the marriage. Not only does the love of his life becomes completely out of his reach, she also becomes the wife and the lover of the man that he hates. His heart and innocent youthfull illusions shattered, Heathcliff leaves and doesn't return for many years.Catherine meanwhile realizes her mistake. She is completely bored in her marriage, more she is a very strong woman and runs roughshod over her husband. Her husband's weak character disgusts her, but she is trapped. There is no way out of the loveless marriage. She has made her bed and now must lie in it.Heathcliff spends years yearning money and accumulating a fortune just so that he could prove to Catherine and to everyone else that he is in fact worthy of her. He comes back to rub the fact in her face. He wants to make her hurt as she made him hurt, to show her the kind of a mistake she made so that she could regret it for the rest of her life. Heathcliff comes back a harsh and a bitter man bent on revenge. He wants to get his back after having his heart ripped out.But revenge does not bring him any satisfaction, for Catherine is near her deathbed. She dies giving birth to her daughter. And now Heathcliff is left with nothing. His life has no more meaning without Catherine in it, for the second time in his life he has the rug yanked out from beneath his feet. He vows to bring revenge on the Lintons and that becomes his only reason for living. The hate and the anticipation of revenge sustain him through years.Many years and many deaths later, Heathcliff has achieved no satisfaction. His life is empty and he is all alone. He lives with Catherine( the daughter) and his knephew. He hates them both, Catherine because he blames her for her mother's death and Hareton because of his father. All of his attempts at revenge have brought him no solace. He is just a shell of a man, sustaining from day to day with no real purpose. All of the people he hoped to bring revenge against are all dead and he is tired of living. And so ends a life full of passion and volatile emotion, anger and hearbreak. Only in death does Heathcliff finally achieve his peace.There are no words to describe how much I loved this book. It took me on an emotional roller coaster from page one and until the bitter end. I could not help but symphasize with Heathcliff and experience emotions as he was feeling them. The book is incredibly powerful, emotional, dark and brooding with some light relief at the end. Its heartwarming to know that Catherine's daughter at least found some happiness. But the thought remains, Catherine and Heathcliff never did..."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book is often unfairly labeled as a &quot;Gothic romance.&quot; Well, obviously that is one way of looking at it, but I don't see what &quot;romance&quot; has to do with it. The main characters, Cathy and Heathcliff, have one of the most twisted and obsessive relationships I have ever seen. I wouldn't exactly call it a romance;more of some bitter love that the orphaned Heathcliff cannot let go of when Cathy marries another, has a child, and dies. He spends eternity taking out his revenge on the later generation, making this one of the darkest ideas of love that I have ever read. But then, that's why I like it. It shows that sometimes romance is not that pretty. In fact, it's pretty darn self-destructive. A great read, my favorite out of any I have ever read before."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a surprisingly modern novel given that its authorship predates our modern understanding of psychology. Like many modern novels, Ms. Bronte has also explored the darker side of human passions and psyches more thoroughly than the sunnier side. Heathcliff will remind you of classic characters whose lives were twisted by fate like Captain Ahab in Moby Dick, Erik in Phantom of the Opera, Quasimodo in The Hunchback of Notre-Dame, and the mysterious prisoner in The Man in the Iron Mask.If there were ever two star-crossed lovers who have captured the world's imagination since Romeo and Juliet, they must be Catherine and Heathcliff. Yet, unlike, many such pairs, their unhappiness is heavily influenced by themselves.As you contemplate their story, you are constantly drawn to the thought, \\"what if\\" thus and such had occurred differently? That's part of the great power of the story because it has so many unexpected twistings and turnings. A reader's expectations from a love story are turned upside down, sideways and diagonal from where those expectations normally rest. As a result, you'll probably decide this isn't a love story after all . . . but a tragedy. Taken from that perspective, you'll find yourself hearing echoes of Lady Macbeth and King Lear as you contemplate what occurs when the natural order is disturbed. Few English authors since Shakespeare have captured that sense of what can happen when the universe is disarranged.What's great about this story? It's pretty simple: Emotional intensity in the writing; deeply memorable characters; doomed lovers; and a haunting glimpse at unshakeable obsession.What's not so great? The story development itself is pretty awkward. Much of the story is told in flashback which steals power and immediacy from the narration. If ever a story cried out for being told in the first person (by Heathcliff, Catherine, Edgar Linton, Hareton and young Catherine), it's Wuthering Heights. The transitions from one key moment to another are often very abrupt. Sometimes it is 150 pages later before you get the full sense of what Emily Bronte meant to convey in some of those transitions.What's less than great? The characters aren't nearly as appealing as those you'll usually find in a novel dealing with these issues. In that sense, the novel is more realistic than fictional . . . which helps create some of its immense power. It's probably a worthwhile price to pay.Whatever you think of Wuthering Heights, you owe it to yourself to read one of the most moving tales that has ever been written. Pick a time when you're feeling reasonably happy to start the book. Otherwise, you may find your mood to be more than a little darkened for a few days."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"As the editor of this volume, I wanted to point out its differences from many other editions of Wuthering Heights. This one contains the short story, &quot;The Bridegroom of Barna,&quot; believed to be the most influential source for the novel. It also collects essays about Emily Bronte that are not published elsewhere with the novel. I may be biased, but I think this is a great edition of the novel and is particularly good for college classes on the book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"How do you define a classic? Some might say that which stands the test of time. By that definition alone Emily Bronte's \\"Wuthering Heights\\" merits the designation of classic. To the best of my knowledge it has been made into four films. I've not seen them all but would surely recommend the version starring Sir Laurence Olivier, Merle Oberon and David Niven. It has been assigned reading in countless high school and college classroom, and printed throughout the world in numerous editions.Now, Penguin Audio gives us the opportunity to enjoy this story of love not meant to be in a superb audio edition read by Prunella Scales and Samuel West. Fans of the incredibly popular BBC series \\"Fawlty Towers\\" will remember Scales as Sybil. Here, she is Cathy incarnate and a prime narrator when assuming the voice of Nelly Dean. A popular actor with the Royal Shakespeare Company, West brings both pathos and drama to the hopes and final bitter heartbreak found in Heathcliff.As we hear in the voices of Mr. Lockwood and housekeeper Nelly Dean, Heathcliff was an orphan with no home to call his own so he came to Wuthering Heights where he is not only given shelter but also friendship by Catherine Earnshaw, daughter of the wealthy owner. But, eventually Heathcliff asks for more than friendship - he proposes marriage. When he is cruelly rebuffed his love turns to a desire for revenge.How sad that Emily Bronte lived for only 30 years. How fortunate for us that her legacy is the incomparable \\"Wuthering Heights.\\"- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights, considered a defining work of Gothic Romance literature is essentially the narrated story of two individuals at the end of the 19th century, Catherine and Heathcliff, and their passionate love for each other which is never consummated. The story takes place basically in two estates in Yorkshire&iexcl;s moors, and its intricate plot involves two generations of characters living in these houses.I found Wuthering Heights to be very a very enjoyable book mainly because of the unbridled emotional intensity present in the story. Each of the characters are bounded by love or hatred, often to a very twisted and irrational extreme. The passions of these characters eventually lead to great acts of cruelty and vengeance, creating a very vibrant, tragic, and intense storyline.I also liked the fact that there very few actual characters in the book, however Bronte manages to make them very vivid, and their personalities and relationships with other characters consistently changes throughout the story as a result of events. Often I would really pity certain characters, or feel shocked and angered at many of their actions; it&iexcl;s simply very hard to not be almost pulled into the book&iexcl;s setting. Until the last few pages of the book, it really seemed as if the anguish and torment of the characters would continue endlessly. Therefore I was quite amazed Bronte managed to create a tranquil, satisfying ending, however I do feel that the ending was just a bit TOO satisfying, since it didn&iexcl;t leave me with very much to think about.Overall, it&iexcl;s a very beautifully written book vivid even in its descriptions of the beauty of the Yorkshire countryside, and one that really stirs the reader&iexcl;s emotions and feelings. This is definitely a great read for anybody in high school or above."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I read this book last year for my AP English class. That was the ONLY reason that I finished this book. It was a huge task just to finish a page of Wuthering Heights; it was almost impossible to complete it. I enjoy characters that I can care about. I like to be able to really feel like I want something for a character. If that happens, then I want to finish the book; I want to know what happens to the character. I found with Wuthering Heights I hated Catherine and Heathcliff. I wanted them to die. I was supposed to be sad when things went wrong in their lives, but instead I was so happy. They were selfish, cruel, horrible people and I wanted them to DIE! Was I really supposed to like these selfish people? Since when is love a selfish thing? This is supposed to be a marvelous love classic, but where is the love? Love isn't just about what makes oneself feel good. Love is a kind, caring, sharing thing. Catherine and Heathcliff were selfish, cruel people. They deserved each other simply because they would make each other miserable."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I'm not ashamed to admit that a good half of my personal library is comprised of classical novels and plays and that I read them because I genuinely LIKE them.You heard me right. I LIKE them. I read them for ENTERTAINMENT, not because they were assigned reading in classes (although I've made \\"friends\\" with a great title or two via that route as well).The Bronte sisters' novels enjoy love and hate from readers. I don't think there's a soul who just feels lukewarm about their works. I've read a couple and liked and kept most of them.\\"Wuthering Heights\\" stands out to me as one of the WORST novels I've ever read in my ENTIRE LIFE. Given the number of novels I've read in my entire life that's saying a lot.WH is very well-written. Emily Bronte CAN write. Style/technique isn't the issue. What is the issue is her abysmal failure to engage the reader because of her deplorable characters.Heathcliff and Catherine are frequently cited as one of the \\"power couples\\" of literature along with Rhett & Scarlett, Romeo & Juliet, Antony & Cleopatra, etc. They may be kindred spirits but there is none of their behaviors ever signifies they know a thing about love.Catherine Earnshaw isn't even an interesting character. She is a charming, selfish and silly young woman who fulfills the Victorian stereotype of choosing \\"a good match\\" over wild love on the moors with Heathcliff. This may have been the sanest thing she did. Maybe she recognized H's bizarre fixation on her as unwholesome and knew she'd never live up to it in reality.A lot of women get swooney over Heathcliff as a sort of alpha-male anti-hero. I'm female and I CAN'T STAND this guy! He isn't alpha, he's WEAK as skimmed milk.How psychologically disturbed is he, let me count the ways. Inferiority complex, obsessive attachment to uninterested female (Cathy turned him down whatever her \\"real feelings\\" might have been) that borders upon incest (they're not blood kin but they are raised together); inability to \\"forget the one that got away\\" and MOVE ON; child abuse/neglect with clearly murderous intentions; wife/spousal abuse; kidnapping and coerced marriage and even theft of personal assets...Give me a break this is no alpha male, this is a psychopathic CRIMINAL!If you sigh and say, \\"Oh but he did this all because he LOVED Catherine!\\" I will slap you. Truly I will.A REAL alpha male would be broken-hearted by the rejection of his \\"true love\\"...then he would have moved forward and continued with his life and discovered \\"true love\\" (as in love that was returned to him without bizarre psychological games).Heathcliff is a loser in every sense of the word.

Also the writing of the local dialect of one of the characters I could not understand a single word. I hope that his converstions were not pivital to the plot point because I had to keep skipping every part in the book because I had no idea what he was saying. All I can say is Catherine needs to grow up and Heathcliff needs to get a life. Classic, yeah right!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I first read Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront at the tender age of fourteen, and remember quite clearly that it was my birthday, and my mom and dad took me out to the movies. One glance at the poster and I declared we'd go watch Wuthering Heights starring Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche, and that was that. I was transported by the thwarted romance that played out on the bleak Yorkshire moors. Of course I had to go read the book straight after, and while my youthful self probably didn't \\"get\\" half the relationship dynamics or the full depth of the dialogue, I nonetheless knew this is a book I'd need to reread at some point.Fast forward 20 years (gee whizz, it's been *that* long) and I downloaded the book from Gutenberg.org - a far cry from the battered paperback copy I inherited from the family home, and was immediately transported - again.Wuthering Heights is primarily a story about relationships, and of people who wilfully twist and allow others to twist them. We are first introduced to our narrator, a chap by the name of Lockwood, who has rented the grand Thrushcross Grange (complete with its own park lands). I get the idea the chap is a bit of a poseur, who's quite oblivious and gauche when it comes to how he relates to people. Self-absorbed. I missed this in the first read. Kudos to Bront for having a narrator I'd cheerfully slap. I mean, the fool goes blundering in to visit the inhabitants of Wuthering Heights when it's perfectly clear to anyone else with half an ounce of common sense that they do not appreciate the intrusion of a stranger.But Lockwood is our narrator, and it's clear the mystery presented by the relationships he encounters captivates his imagination to the point where he's determined to uncover they mystery that has presented itself. (My inner cynic cheerfully comments: \\"Well, what do you expect? They didn't have reality TV in those days.)Not one to take a hint when he's not wanted, Lockwood plays voyeur, and an ill-timed visit results in him having to spend the night at Wuthering Heights and subject himself to the ghost of Catherine - one of the key scenes.But the story's layers get peeled back. Lockwood's housekeeper at Thrushcross Grange is none other than Ellen (or Nelly, as she's know by those who're familiar with her), who grew up with the main participants in this drama. Her narration of past events is then retold by Lockwood, so once again our perceptions as readers are coloured by the lens of yet another viewpoint. We are faced with not only the opinions of Lockwood, but that of Ellen. Unreliable narrators both, but in their opinions, we view our main players with a degree of separation. We vicariously live out the unfolding tragedy from a safe distance while debating on characters' true motivations.Most often, Wuthering Heights is pegged as a romance and, to a degree I agree that romance is an underlying theme but I prefer to view it as a tragedy, of characters denying their true natures and being destroyed by the prolonged act of revenge.We enter a complex interconnecting web of relationships and the intermingling of two families. Always, Heathcliff is the outsider. Bront suggests that he is dark, perhaps of gypsy stock, and Catherine and Hindley Earnshaw's father brought the foundling home. The lad was closer in age to Catherine than her brother, and the two were soon inseparable. But when Catherine's path intersects with that of the wealthy Lintons, and specifically their son, Edgar, she is soon torn.The unsophisticated Heathcliff is her dark half, an animus as such, wild and unfettered, yet Edgar represents culture and an artificial construct of what \\"love\\" is supposed to be. Catherine is at a quandary, and it is her decision to marry Edgar that sets the wheels in motion for the unfolding drama.Yes, this is a tale of thwarted love, but it's also an illustration of how individuals will consciously choose a path that can only lead to damnation. What I found fascinating was comparing my initial response as a teenager to how I felt about the novel now, twenty years later. I recall feeling so sorry for how rotten Catherine's life turned out. Now? Well, I'd dearly love to shake some sense into the girl. All the characters are unlikeable. There is nothing romantic about Heathcliff's all-consuming passion for Catherine. And Catherine is a wilful, stubborn girl who's used to bending everyone around her to her whims, unmindful of the damage she is causing to herself and those around her.This made me think, however, about the relative ages of the characters in the story. They were but teenagers themselves, who behaved as such. The only difference is that in those days, folks getting married as young as eighteen was not unheard of. Now, you sit back and think about how your life would have turned out had you married your first sweetheart (you're excused if it's two decades later and you're still happily married to your first love).I think about my first love and where we'd be now if we were still together, and probably miserable as all hell to boot. Let's not go there. I'm glad I never felt obligated to marry someone, and that when I did finally get married (yes I married young at twenty-two) I'm still very much in love with the man but glad I'd had experience with other relationships.And lastly, Heathcliff. Wuthering Heights is really his story, if you ask me, and he suffers a bit of a dog-in-the-manger syndrome. He cannot have happiness, and has focused his entire existence on ensuring that no one else will have happiness. Heathcliff is ultimately tragic, but I don't pity him, as he mastered his own fate. In the end, he cannot bring himself to carry out the final act of his schemes, and loses the taste for revenge. Instead, he turns the sickness inward. The world continues without him, in spite of his machinations, and he consumes his own heart.Wuthering Heights falls under the category of the Gothic novel, along with the likes of Frankenstein. Supernatural elements are hinted at, and I suspect it's left up to the reader to decide whether these exist. This is one of the novels that I recommend to all aspiring authors to read. As a study on character development, Wuthering Heights is essential. Yes, the language usage takes a little getting used to but if you can get into the story, you'll gain an appreciation as to why this is one of those classics that has inspired film and music.

I tend to like other Bronte novels better just because this book gets dark and stays that way until the last few pages."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"One of my favorite teachers told me this was her favorite book. She must have gotten something different out of it. I mostly despised the main characters, especially Heathcliff. The best part of the book is the last 20 pages when the daughter finally finds happiness but the rest was almost unbearable."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is in many ways a remarkable novel, but also a very dark one, which makes it difficult to really love. It centers on the relationship between Catherine and Heathcliff, or rather the lack of a real one...the basis of their passion for each other is pretty thin, which makes the depths of Heathcliff's obsession with her pretty hard to understand. That characterization didn't seem true to life to me anyway---rather than being passionate about one thing to the exclusion of everything else like that, people are usually passionate in general or mean all around, not this precarious mixture of the two.The story really picked up for me in the latter part, when Heathcliff attempts to continue taking out his grievances on the subsequent generation, whose ultimate fate redeemed the novel for me. So, definitely worth a read, just make sure to stick with it all the way through to the end. Still, I definitely didn't love it as much as I did Jane Eyre."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"i was so glad to find this amazing edition for such an affordable price! it was in great condition, exactly as the description said. thanks so much!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book was mentioned in several of the other books that i have read so I thought I would see why it was referenced so much. I really liked this book. Emily creates these characters that have depth and strong emotions. Cathrine and Heathcliff are doomed from the get go, their chilhood spares them no humanity for them to retain in adulthood. Heathcliff is horrible and is often referred to a an evil man, true but Cathrine still loves him. Though she loves him she is so concided and horrible herself she refuses to be with him. I cannot tell you how horrible each of the characters are in Emily's novel you must read it for yourself. Please don't misunderstand me when I say horrible I mean the behavior and attributes of the characters not that they are poorly written or lacking in depth. Even thought this characters are the complete oppsite of good I found that I wished for their pain to stop. Each of the characters were in such a constant state of torture I could not really blame them for acting the way they did. They say that misery loves company and Emily's novel could not paint a better picture. It does take some adjusting to the way it is written the wording and phrasing are not of this era. But once you get started and get a feel for the writting style you will become consumed by the characters and their pain. I thought this book would be just another one of those old dull reads but it is so much more. I know its old and hard to understand at times but is so worth the read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"It took me a long time to get around to reading Wuthering Heights, and I have to admit, it was a slog. It's not that I have anything against novels from that time period; I count Jane Eyre and the works of Jane Austen among my favorite books. But Wuthering Heights did not live up to its reputation. The characters were universally unlikeable and unsympathetic. The story was meandering and ultimately unfulfilling. And the \\"love story\\" - more of a story of unreasonable obsession - did not move me. So count me among the few who did not fall in love with this novel."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a love story, driven by an undying love. The two main characters, Heathcliff and Catherine, are in love with each other; not in an earthly form but rather there souls are united as one. Heathcliff loves Catherine not for her body, her apperance, her money, her status but rather for her soul. He is one with her in a way every soul desires to be understood. In this novel love is shown in forms and extents that are so much of what people in our culture are deprived of it makes for a wonderful read. One often longs for a soul mate to connect with and be loved by for being them and when Heathcliff shows this affection towards Cathy I believe it draws in a person and captures his or her heart.Wuthering Heights isn't just a fantasy though. It isn't a fairy tale everyone knows will never come true. Wuthering Heights is very much now and here. Heathcliff loves Catherine with his heart but she denies this love and tries to suppress her own feelings toward him for she thinks it will receive her scorn from society to which she is right. This is so heart wrenching because it is so much of a reality. Many times we meet our soul mate yet let them slip away because we are to worried about what others will say. Wuthering Heights shows picture and makes you think about when you might have not loved someone only because the culture didn't approve of him or her.Wuthering Heights is a wonderful book because it illustrates a love people yearn for so dearly. If you have the chance to read Wuthering Heights I would definitely say take it because it will speak to your heart."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The novel Wuthering Heights may sound like another cliche book of love and hate. The general audience would think this book would follow the same romance plot. Man falls in love with woman, woman feels the same, something terrible happens and in the end they solve the problem and live happily ever after.When in all actuality it is about a man whom driven by pure love for hatred on a path of vengece. The man known only as Heathcliff. *Don Don Don!*The novel starts out in an unusual manner of telling the end of the story in the beginning. Surprisingly all the substance plays right in tune with the style of writing. The characters of all very complex and intricate to the point of instanity. The story is all centered around a man who is rejected from society from adoption and is only loved by a one soul. Unbeknownst to his step sister Catherine, Heathcliff has fallen madly in love with her. Heathcliff ,since rejected from society, has developed deep hatred for everyone who maltreated him or loved Catherine.Heathcliff's revenge is so cold and rotten to the point were you want to rip the book apart and burn it. Later on Catherine finally confesses her love to Heathcliff whom after this was overjoyed with passion. Sadly this Catherine,Heathcliff's only true love in life, dies a most unusual death.Heathcliff plans to make Catherines daughter the puppet or weapon if you may to take revenge against Edgar the one who stole Catherine from Heathcliff's reach. To do this he tries to force Catherine's daughter to marry his own son.Although the book is very entertaining I highly suggest this for and audience of some background knowledge of the Victorian era. Another tedious thing of this book is it is not intended to those of an average vocabulary so at often found myself having to grab a dictionary. Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights novel shows how love can eventually turn into hate by just adding a few essential ingredients.[Redsponx5]"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Don't read the review from Monika \\"equestrienne_23\\" below.I have never read this book and was looking at the reviews online to see if I could get an idea of what it was about.

The power of the book is that it evokes the entire gamut of human emotions and contemplative introspection from its readers according to each individual's inclinations. It is for the reader to label.

A must read for all!Evelyn Horan - teacher/counselor/authorJeannie, A Texas Frontier Girl Books One - Three"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights makes Jane Eyre (more popular, but untimately predictable) and Austen's book look like schoolgirls wrote them. Everything about it is bitingly real. Though most of the novel is bent on Heathcliff's revenge, it is more about how far a person would go acting on the powerful love they feel for another. Some might say his character shouldn't exist (absurd! He is more real than the pining Edgar or the dashing men of what I call 'heaving bosom' stories).Cathy, the heroine, who never acts like the typical one, does a typically human thing: she marries a man she has mild feelings for because he's rich and Heathcliff is MIA.But her death scene: all I can say is read it! Haunting.It is a little awkward because we are removed from the story, hearing it from a maid's point of view and the parts about Cathy(Jr. her daughter) and Linton and Hareton are not as moving as Cathy and Heathcliff's destructive love, it's still absolutely amazing! I've read it three times and I still get chills at the end!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I have always considered Wuthering Heights the best offering from the Bronte brood. It may be a soap opera, but WHAT a soap opera--and besides, the writing, dark and Victorian though it is, is superb and more than a little mad.The two most over-used adjectives used to describe this book are \\"dark and brooding.\\" So I won't use them, but it will be hard. Because out of the ashes, almost literally, of a dark, dreary, oppressive estate on the English moors flames the love affair of all time: the daughter of the house, Catherine, and the wild foundling brought into the family as a child--Heathcliff. Catherine and Heathcliff have a special bond, even as children, but when adulthood arrives, their bond flares into unbearable passion.Tortured Heathcliff wandering the moors calling for Cathy; married Cathy dying in her bed for love of Heathcliff; ahhhh. Nothing better. One wonders, of course, what forbidden thoughts churned beneath the genteel breast of Emily Bronte as she wrote of this unmistakeably sexual and erotic relationship. I have also wondered more than once if Heathcliff was modeled on the Bronte Sisters' wild and untameable brother Bramwell. But I am no literary historian. I am only a lover of books, and this particular one resides on my all-time top ten. If you have never read it, or if you consider it one of those dreary required assignments you fled in high school, give it another chance. There is nothing else like it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Why? Because it sickens me to death.Can't stand false reviews.I'll just say one thing- if you ever wanted to have a perfect black pearl, flawless and completely spherical, with beautiful glow and precious value, read this book. The pearl's there for you, waiting for someone to take it out and absorb it forever.It might be a hard reading, but it will move you deeply and make you pound your chest and cry out."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a novel that oozes with romance. It is a story of unbridled love that has no boundaries and no restraints. The love that exists between Catherine and Heathcliff is an all consuming almost maddening love. The way Emily Bronte attacks your senses and emotions is both exicting and devastating. Her style of describing the surroundings and landscape is gothic in style. It is rugged, isolated and atmospheric. It gives you a sense that the Earnshaws and Lockwoods are the only two families in existence. The landscape seems to be a direct reflection of the personalities of the characters. It is a clever way to describe the families in a atypical way. Because of the unusual style of this romance novel, it may be hard to dive into at first, but it will soon capitivate your attention. It is hard to determine who you should hate and who you should pity.Healthcliff is a dark and mysterious man who you absolutely want to love, but every word he speaks and every action he makes drives you to despise him. Catherine whom you want to side with, drives you mad with her selfishness and snobbery. It leaves you with a feeling of desperateness for a happily-ever-after ending, yet a sense it may never happen. Wuthering Heights is a passionate, all consuming pyscho-romance. It made me want to jump into the pages and set things straight. I really enjoyed the use of love and hate and how it is able to bind people together in a circle that never ends. Once a wrong has been committed, it is so hard to break the cycle. Once someone has been hurt it is so hard to forgive and forget. Healthcliff's emotional side had been trampled on at such an early age that his whole life was soon consumed with revenge towards anyone that was involved in the mistreatings. I despertly wanted Catherine or at least someone to break through the shield that Heathcliff had built, but if someone does want to be loved they never will. The saying goes, you must love yourself before you can love someone else and Healthcliff was not able to accomplish this.The combination of love, love lost and love denied makes Wuthering Heights a romance that I fully recommend. It is a mixture of life and death, twists and turns and vengence that would attract all genders and all ages. It leaves you confused and frustrasted in a way that books do not do anymore. It may have you puzzled in the beginning because it does not follow the norm of a modern romance, but by the end you will feel that every romance should have this quality. I feel that everyone should sample the taste of a tragic romance."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I can't recommend Wuthering Heights enough. It tells the story of the doomed love between Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff, a foundling adopted by her father. There is an implication, which not everyone may have picked up on and in never confirmed, that their relationship is inscestuous and that Heathcliff is the illegitimate son of Catherine's father. This idea is based on the fact that it seems highly unlikely that Earnshaw would have picked up a strret child to adopt without some sort of motivation. The gothic genre was also fascinated with strange relations etc and whilst authours would not have been able to look at inscest openly they would have been able to get away with subtle undertones that many people would not pick up on.There is an immense sense of landscape within Wuthering HEights and I feel that the title and setting reflects the unbridled passions of the characters within the novel. Emily Bronte's beautiful descriptions of the rolling countryside reflect her love for her home at Haworth. The plot can be a little confusing because of the way the characters all seem to have the same names (two Cathys, Edgar Linton, Linton Heathcliff, Heathcliff etc) so if you can get hold of a family tree it'll really help you to follow the plot. Like all classics, Wuthering Heights takes a bit of time to get into but keep going and you won't regret it.:)"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Fresh off of reading &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, I was interested in reading &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; because I had heard it was this great romantic story. Could it surpass &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, I thought? Hmmm... I went in search to find out. Well, after reading &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, I have this to say: If you think that &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; is about lovey-dovey romance, think again. If you are expecting it to be in the likes of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, think again. If you think Heathcliff will be like Mr. Rochester, think again. &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is a novel filled with a fitful, satisfying romance. It is a beautifully written novel, and Mr. Rochester will always be my favorite hero, and Jane, my favorite heroine. &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; is, on the other hand, a complete 180 from &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;. &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; is a disturbing novel filled with disturbing characters. It is a gothic tragedy which is very dark and depressing. Not one single character is likeable, although you hope that Heathcliff turns around at the end and turns good. It is about obsession and it makes you wonder if you can define love. What is love? I did like how the author is completely distanced from the novel, and that a lot of the story is left up to the reader's imagination, but there were times when I was thinking, &quot;What is the point of this novel?&quot;. Yet, at the end, I realized it was a good story-- very spooky and it sucked you into their own world. I think this is a mood-novel. It will make you go into a very dark place, and leave you kind of depressed! I suggest watching the movie adaptation of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, featuring Timothy Dalton as Heathcliff. I know that I actually gained a greater appreciation for the novel after watching this film. Then after that, go read &quot;Villette&quot;!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I am in love with this story and will forever be.

When I received my new Kindle Fire a few weeks ago, I downloaded some free books to test it out and among them was Wuthering Heights. I enjoyed the eloquent language and writing used, but the characters, all of them, were mean, hateful, self-centered people. I thought it would be another book where the good guy gets tramped on as a child but comes out on top as an adult, but that never happened.

If I could have fiercly stabbed his character to death I believe I wouldn't hesistate in doing so. The person he loved more than any thing and his only reason for living died yet I can feel no pity at all for him.This book was to me horrifing. I gave it 4 stars because I will NEVER forget it. Such a sequence of terrible, cruel events inflicted by one person in a life long pursuit of vengence goes beyond words. The depth of the sorrow of the characters and pain in this book amazes me. I can barely believe that this was publised in 1847, it does not startle me at all to learn that it did not do well at first.As you read this book you feel as if every decent thing is being obliviated and sucked off the face of the earth and you're left only with cruelty, pain and a longing for revenge.This is by no means a light read. It is incredibly depressing and I'm in awe of the complete horror of it at the same time.There is no other rbook like it, however, I doubt that reading it has made anyone's existance a happier one."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"A wonderful example of how a book should be written!Enough tantalising family scandals and shocking behaviour,and this book was written in the 1850's!!!

For instance it was apparently common for cousins to marry each other in that society. It was also not unusual for farmers to employ servants as was the case with both the Earnshaws and the Lintons in this story. That was true even though an obvious class distinction existed between the two families.WUTHERING HEIGHTS is a love story in spite of the Gothic horror which permeates the novel.

The story crashes along with melodrama and emotional episodes galore; and when you set all that against the impossibly lonely and picturesque backdrop of the English moors, it's enough to snare any romantic heart. I won't give you the particulars of the plot... it is at its core a love story, but also a great deal more complicated than that. The relationship between Heathcliff and Catherine is all at once pure, spiritual, sexy, intensely stormy and destructive, in a way I've never seen done before in fiction.This is one novel that I feel like I could read over and over, submerge myself in the minds of each of the characters multiple times, and still not plumb the depth of its meaning. The writing is gorgeous, of course, with complexly-constructed but damn near-perfect sentences. This is an emotional, overwhelming, entirely un-sedate book -- a remarkable thing to emerge from Victorian times, from the impenetrable mind of a reclusive female poet. We'll never know what Emily Bronte was truly like, but she was clearly an incredible artist who deserved vastly more recognition than she ever got in her lifetime.

And to be honest, it would not normally have made my reading list. But having read the Twilight novels three times, and Wuthering Heights being featured and quoted so many times, after a while I got curious and thought the only way to better understand the comparisons made by Stephenie Meyer, I just had to read it. At first, the old fashioned language took some getting used to, but once I'd gotten over that, the first third of the book started to really interest me. The characters created by Emily Bronte are certainly very unique, and the depths of their evil surpassed any characters I have come across to date. I was intrigued and started to really enjoy the novel, to the point where I was quite unable to put it down. In the end, I have to admit I was totally disappointed. What promised to be quite an exciting tale of unusual characters and a touch of haunting, left me completely unsatisfied, and questioning why this has become such a classic. I thought it was extremely well written, very interesting characters and well thought out, but in the end it was just someone's life story, that never really \\"got going\\". Given when this was written, I can certainly understand the waves such a novel would have made in the world of literature, but it just does not measure up to the modern day offering. I would say it is a good novel to read to have a better understanding of how this has shaped authors over the years, and perhaps us as readers too. I was just left feeling like there should and could have been more..."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I purchased this for a college class. It was shipped on time and arrived in perfect condition. I didn't love this book, but I am not a huge Bronte fan. However, it is a classic for a reason and a good edition to any library."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Right, so either your love it or you hate it.The main characters, Heathcliff and Catherine, are impossible to like. Heatcliffe is vindictive and cruel and Catherine is a weak and cruel character herself. Not only that, they're both selfish and angry narrowminded. It's difficult to not be moved.And being moved is what this story does to you. If you cannot separate yourself from the Characters, and see the book just as a book, you're going to hate it. You WILL hate the characters and wish they would all just burn in methaphorical hell...But if you do manage to just enjoy the story as a story, which is difficult, then it's a thrilling book with many interesting characters, who submit themselves and each other to odd desputes and whatnot due to their odd character traits. Forgiveness is not really a word in this book and most of the story is about the frustrations from their social places.You might even enjoy the... erm... the social... Oh whatever. It's difficult to separate your feelings from what you're reading. And you keep wondering why they're so stupid and cruel.I aged 10 yrs from reading this books."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"As CD production and quality was very good, good quality, pleasant reader.But the book it self I did not like. It gave me a completely non romantic glimpse to the middle class society of that time, where women were extremely dramatic and manipulative, using pitty to get or keep men, and men who abused women, children and animals.I'm glad I don't live in that society"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"To get this book for free, it is a must read. If anything just to say the you have read it.I have read this book several times and I still don't see the appeal. I love books like this one(A Long Fatal Love Chase, Louisa May Alcott) but this one I just can't get into it. It seems very hard for me to follow the story. I would say read it and be you own judge."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I bought this book and it took almost 3 weeks to get to me 2 states away. Should not have taken that long."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The REAL Housewives of Victorian EnglandMr. Lockwood comes to Wuthering Heights in order to rent Thrushcross Grange. He gets stuck there, with Mr. Heathcliff, a rude gentleman, a young woman, and several other strange people. While there, he stumbles upon the diaries of Catherine Earnshaw. After a strange dream, he runs back to town, where Ellen Dean \\"Nelly\\" tells him the story of Wuthering Heights.I'm sure most of you are familiar with a TV phenomenon called \\"reality TV shows\\", particularly ones like \\"Jersey Shore\\" and \\"The Real Housewives of OC/Atlanta/wherever\\". I think it would be a compliment to say these shows cater to the lowest common denominator. They are primarily packed with drunken escapades, unbridled fights, and lots and lots of sex. And you know what? People like these things because of the sheer stupidity. Hell, I'll admit to watching a few episodes of Jersey Shore, and not just because it was the only thing on my hotel TV (although the latter is true too).I've heard copious things about \\"Wuthering Heights\\": it is a classic, it is a love story, it is wonderful literature, it has great imagery/themes. They may be true, but for me, \\"Wuthering Heights\\" is a freakin' riot book--the Victorian equivalent of the reality TV shows we enjoy today.The characters are vicious, back-biting dogs, continuously making life miserable for each other just for the hell of it. Catherine marries a man she sorta loves just for the title; Heathcliff has an insatiable thirst for revenge; Hindley is weak; Hareton is an evil child; Cathy a ditz; Linton a wuss; Edgar powerless; and Nelly a meddle-some gossip. Probably about the only character not painted in such a poor limelight is our narrator, Mr. Lockwood, who is boring beyond belief. Lock these characters up in a room, and expect them to rail and complain and slap the hell out of each other within moments. They are all sadists and masochists, and I'm not just talking about the obvious Heathcliff. They would make PERFECT fodder for a low-brow reality TV series--I can just see Isabella (post-marriage) b!tch-slapping Heathcliff, Heathcliff and Edgar tearing off each other's shirts and brawling on the living room floor, and Linton and Cathy slipping off to nail each other in one of their rooms.For those that say this is a great love story: Huh? I mean, I get that Heathcliff and Catherine \\"love\\" each other, but it almost feels like more \\"obsessively lusting\\". As for Isbella loving Heathcliff, he doesn't turn around, love her and marry her; instead, she lives in abuse until she finally grows a pair and runs off. Linton and Cathy are constantly being thwarted in their relationship, and it is Heathcliff who forces them to marry. And on...and on... It's more of a \\"How NOT to Love\\" story than a pure romantic love story, like \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". NOTE: If you love A so much, marry A. Do NOT marry B and then excuse it by saying you \\"love\\" A so much that you want to *fill*in*the*blank* for A.Also, I found myself wondering several times: how much of this story is Nelly warping? Is she purposefully making these people look bad (even her own mistress, Catherine, she insults regularly)? What parts did she not hear? How would things have been different had she kept her big nose out of the drama?All the complaints I've read are 100% true. The characters are vile and overdramatic; their actions are drastically mean and seem bent for the sole purpose of causing more drama; the framing device threatens to fall apart (particularly when Cathy is narrating through Nelly who is narrating through Mr. Lockwood--can't tell you how many times I forgot who the \\"I\\" was).All the compliments I've read are also 100% true. The writing is very well-done, the story is interesting, the characters are different and not stereotypical, the outcome isn't predictable, and the imagery is vivid and dark.In short: No wonder this was such a controversial book when it first came out!I think this book is definitely more interesting in audiobook format, because the author can differentiate voices, give inflections, and bring to life the arguments and vicious remarks that fly back and forth. Maybe I'm a sadist or masochist like the cast, but I rather enjoyed being a fly on the wall, listening to Nelly's gossip about these sad people and their self-induced miserable lives. It's not a book for everyone, but it's definitely one of a kind.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is a great classic read. It is a dark book with a good ending. If you look at the background of each character, you'll understand how they have come to act the way they do in the book. Maybe to the extreme in their actions and hatred, but you can see cause and effect to the situations that occur. Also, if you read about Bronte, you can see why the book is so dark. She had not such a happy life. I wish Bronte would have written more books. Again, a great book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"After spending an interesting night at Wuthering Heights in the company of a group of people that seem an abnormally miserable, vile bunch, Mr. Lockwood, the new tenant of Thrushcross Grange, asks his housekeeper to divulge their history. She does this gladly, and so we get the tragic story of Heathcliff and Catherine.I often find the classics to be tedious and boring. Wuthering Heights is neither and I found that to be a nice surprise. From the beginning, the book oozes drama and it stays that way until the very end. For some reason, I've been under the impression that this is a love story. I guess in a dark, twisted way it is, but it focuses more on cruelty and revenge. None of the characters are very likeable. As a matter of fact, a majority of them are quite appalling. Instead of this making me dislike the book, I think it made me like it more. Strange, I know, but it did. Wuthering Heights kept me captivated and has earned it's spot as one of my favorite classics."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I'm a man in his fifties and managed to avoid reading \\"Wuthering Heights\\" for all these years. I don't like romance or gothic novels and I had seen the 1939 film version with Lawrence Olivier and thought it ridiculous. I only read the book now because it was an assignment for my adult school novel-reading course.The story needs little summarization as it so well known but suffice it say that the principal draw of the book is the romance between Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff, a story that is over at the time the novel begins but nevertheless haunts the entire book. To call Catherine a heroine and Heathcliff a hero is stretching those definitions more than should be allowed. Catherine a tempestuous narcissist who dies for spite and because of childbirth. Heathcliff is worse, torturing his wife because she isn't Catherine and children because they remind him of her. Yes they aren't quite villains as they have tremendous courage, honesty and energy which make them powerful figures despite their many flaws.In our class discussion, people took Heathcliff's evil nature for granted. To me, it wasn't that clear. He was cruel and vengeful. Heatlhcliff was stubborn and difficult but is that evil? If evil is to have no regard for human life then clearly Heathcliff doesn't fall that low, he does appear to value human life. This debate over human evil is one of the fundamental values of Wuthering Heights as literature. The book creates wildly extreme qualities that inhabit the same person. This allows us a prism to view into the psyche and get clear for ourselves how we evaluate good and evil."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is a wonderful classic -- so much going on in the novel on every page that it is a pleasure to read and experience."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Though the performances are very good, I am very frustrated with this purchase, as Amazon describes this set as unabridged. It is, in fact, substantially abridged, so buyer beware."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"When Wuthering Heights first came out, readers were shocked by the violence and the passion of its story, that is the strange romance between the mysterious Heathcliff and Catherine Earnchaw, the daughter of Mr. Earnshaw who adopted Heathcliff. The scandal was so much that Emily Bronte, when she died, thought that her book was a failure. Fortunately for her, and for its first readers, the story's reputation grew among literary circles, became an important reading for people like Virginia Wolf, and even became a movie in 1939, starring the great Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon. As such, the book's reputation has now become an important piece of art around the world, influencing important artists in their works (ex:Jane Campion's The Piano, J K Rowling's Harry Potter, etc.)Most people tend to focus solely on the romance between Heathcliff and Catherine and they tend to think that the story is simply a love story, which is what they did with the Laurence Olivier movie. However, Wuthering Heights must be considered, at least that's what I think, as a tragedy which shows how a simple act of kindness from a good man brought forth discord, jealousy and a story of revenge whose victims, the Earnshaw and the Linton families, soon suffer the wrath of someone who never received the most decent sense of love. Not only that, Wuthering Heights shows how certain families, in distant regions positioned far from big cities, act between themselves as they bring upon each other their own laws. Having had grandparents who lived in regions resembling as much as the moors surrounding Wuthering Heights, I wasn't that much surprised by the cruelty that some of the Earnshaw and the Linton brought forth on Heathcliff.So for me, that book, was a pleasure to read again and again.One thing that surprised me with this book is how Emily Bronte managed to transcript the dialects of the countrymen of that region. Indeed, certain character's dialects are written according to how the characters pronounce them. Though reading it straight on for the first time, might be difficult, I suggest to those that may be rebuked by this type of dialogue transcription to read the dialogs aloud. To me it felt much more easier to understand certain conversations and have more pleasure reading that book.As such, I recommend this book to everyone who would be interested to read a great piece of literature or to discover the original material that brought forth the movie adaptations that they love to watch and rewatch."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I must admit that I went into this book completely unprepared for what hit me. I was expecting something vaguely along the lines of Jane Austen, but darker; I didn't realize just how far into the depths of sadness it would go, and it was incredible.Wuthering Heights is the story of Heathcliff, a child brought into the respectable Earnshaw family. He and Catherine, the daughter of the Earnshaw patriarch, form an immediate, permanent bond, one that will bring years of sadness into their lives when Catherine decides that she cannot abandon her station for Heathcliff, instead choosing to marry Edgar Linton, a privileged child from the neighboring Thrushcross Grange.The interesting thing is that this basic love story, for which the novel is best-known, is only the first half of the book. The second half follows the ramifications for all of the characters, as Heathcliff's cruelty reaches a fever pitch and he destroys everything with any connection to Catherine. This part, for me, was the real meat of the story. It's incredibly dark and occasionally terrifying, written in excruciating detail... but also full of a savage beauty. Heathcliff's chasing after a ghost will simultaneously make you cringe and break your heart, and that is the ultimate measure of success; Bronte created a character that manages to be sympathetic, even when you wish for nothing more but his death.It is not without flaws (I found Catherine and Heathcliff's relationship underdeveloped) but the sheer force of the story is almost dizzying, heightened by the interesting (if occasionally limiting) structure, and I would easily recommend Wuthering Heights."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"As with most people interested in classic literature, I had known of \\"Wuthering Heights\\" for years and years, but for some reason, I had never made the effort to read it.

Not many writers can paint characters with this same level of depth. Some you will love, and others you will love to hate. While the book is not what I would label \\"an easy read,\\" it is quite readable considering when it was written. Give it a try and you will not be disappointed.

Yet, we must read it if we are in an English Literature survey course.It is ponderous going... a classic of dreary proportions, encumbered by a depressing plot, set in dismal surroundings and peopled by dysfunctional characters.However, many other readers, many teachers and professors, many literature critics, genuinely love this book.- Perhaps it appeals to their current mood, or it speaks to having shared, in some way, the experience of one or another of the characters?- Perhaps they have loved long and deeply and found their love unfulfilled? Then Heathcliff speaks to their hearts.- Perhaps they have moved beyond a deeply felt love, for reasons that they cannot fully express or understand, all the while, still keeping deep in some hidden recess of their psyche, that love that will remain first or best or purest? We can see, then, why that reader might be drawn to identify with Cathy.A sad aspect of the book, however, is that it seems so hopeless, so dark, so fatalistic, so depressing. An over identification with these characters might have an adverse effect on a susceptible reader.The reality is, if you are more or less happy in who you are and who the other beloved people in your life may be, then you will probably find very few connecting points with these benighted main characters. If so, I will offer you this hint......Watch the DVD of Larry Olivier and Merle Oberon, dear student, before you read. They play fast and loose with the plot, so you still have to read the book to ace your test or write your essay. But at least you will have some visual hints of beauty to keep in mind as you labor with this challenging novel.If you find this review helpful you might want to read some of my other reviews, including those on subjects ranging from biography to architecture, as well as religion and fiction."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"When my English teacher assigned this piece of Gothic literature instead of the prescribed novel \\"Frankenstein,\\" my curiosity was piqued. Though I had questioned her taste in literature throughout the year, I felt that this novel would be her redeeming point, the thing that would bring her class together.I couldn't have been more mistaken.Wuthering Heights is the story of a man who rents a small mansion from another man, and decides to pay his landlord a visit. Or so it seems. What the novel truly is can only be decribed as a farce on human emotion. It follows the passionate, and often violent, semi-romance between Catherine Earnshaw and her adopted brother Heathcliff. Bronte's poetic language eased the physical reading of the novel, but shrouded the actual plot in deeper mystery and chaos than it had managed to do itself.A novel filled with one amazing plot twist is intriguing; one with several shockers is unexpected. Wuthering Heights, however, conatins more curves and unexpected turns than a New Orleans back-road. This would keep the reader alert and willing to continue . . . if the characters were not blatantly predictible, and completely imhuman. The love-struck heroine/antagonist Catherine Earnshaw declares at one point that \\"Nelly, I am Heathcliff!\\" While intended to be a moving statement, modern psychology student would be more likely to call it stage one acute paranoia. Indeed, this particular educational slave had to struggle through only six chapters of poorly created characters, morose settings, and a plot that seemed more thrown-together than created, before literally guessing his/her way to passing every exam.Back to Ms. Bronte's plot devices. This novel is almost like watching a child play with dolls while talking aloud. Listen to your young daughters; \\"Suzie came home, and did this.\\" A thoughtful pause will follow, and then something else will hapen to Suzie. Then something else. Whatever comes to mind will happen, regardless of whether it makes good storytelling or not. The novel takes the same approach, with a plotline that could only be deemed a line in Lovecraftian geometry.All in all, Wuthering Heights demonstrates fluid and powerful use of the English language . . . but isn't that the purpose of poetry? With predictably unpredictable characters, stale settings, and a plotline that almost refuses to exist, Wuthering Heights could be summed up only in the words of another English teacher: \\"It's General Hospital with an English accent!

Cathy and Heathcliff are two lovers, but when Cathy marries Heathcliff's rival, Edgar Linton, he vows revenge on both of them. The protagonist of the book is without a doubt, the narrator of the story, Nelly Dean. The antagonist is the vial, Heathcliff. She write the characters with such description, it is like they are right in the room with you. The plot is so well writing, it keeps you guessing at every turn.This book is written in the perspective of Nelly (Ellen) Dean. She is the care taker to Cathy through out the book, and one of Heathcliff's close friends. The theme has many interpretation, but I think the most noticeable is of the jealousy Heathcliff feels towards Edgar. It warns you of the dangers of jealousy and that i can drive anyone to the very brink of insanity.

While I have read gothic works like Edgar Allan Poe and Mary Shelly's \\"Frankenstein,\\" Wuthering Heights tramples them with it's intense passion of the central characters, Heathcliff and Catherine. Not everyone's going to love this book, most, if not all the characters, are amoral and cruel people isolated from society. Heathcliff is the classic Byronic Hero; brooding, passionate and driven by vengeance, definitley better than today's wannabe gothic characters(cough...Edward Cullen). Other than that it is poetically written, an open field of meadows and lonely households, snowy storms, etc. If gothic stories are your thing, then pick this up, be warned that despite being hyped as the archetypal story of forbidden romance, that is only half the tale which is filled with bitter revenge; buy this."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"haven't read it yet , its in good shape and it came in a timely fasion! thanx."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Depressing, obsessive, tormenting and heartwrenching.

I have just a few seconds ago finished this book and I am completely speechless...but not with admiration.Yes,PERHAPS Emily Bronte might have written this well but EVERY other aspect of this books is extremely flawed. Good literature it may be to some but good characters, morals, story it is most certainly not. I completely 100% agree with a reviewer who wrote that she hated Heathcliff being described as some alpha male. Reader, believe me, he is the farthest thing from it. How can all these people talk about WH as being a love story? Some call it Powerful Love, Passionate Love, Strongest Love that Could Ever Exist, etc etc. Believe me when I say Heathcliff has ABSOLUTELY NO LOVE for Catherine. Nor she for him. All of it is just a matter of obsession. Their \\"attachment\\" to each other is purely selfish. This book has not ONE admirable character in it. All are either foolish or wicked. Heathcliff is nothing good and honest but obsession, jealousy, cruelty, baseness, dishonesty, and selfishness are the elements of his character as well as Catherine's I might add. Perhaps if Emily Bronte would have brought out all the folly of the characters and spoken of their error it would have had some merit. But the book starts off in bad and till the end no one grows or improves their moral characters. If the wickedness of a person can only be erased by extinguishing the the person himself what moral is there to be learned at all? I had not the slightest big of emotion except relief when I finished this. When I read a book I feel so engrossed in it, almost as if I know every character and am part of their world. HA!

Examining it from a technical point of view, the narration is stilted and poor, the characters are flat, the writing is childish, and it's much too bloated. The entire story could have been summed up into about forty pages or less, and I think it would have been more \\"passionate\\" and surely much more believable if Emily Bront had written the book in third person, not first person.Mr. Lockwood begins narrating the story, which is perfectly fine. I'd thought it would be a normal first-person narrative, until I discovered that the true narrator is Nelly Dean. In everyday speech, or even in telling a lengthy story (as Nelly is), no one actually speaks like they're writing a book (\\"'Yes,' she said, looking at me.\\"). People speak like, well, people. They stammer and stumble and interrupt themselves, especially when they're trying to narrate a story. Now, this sort of stilted narration is tolerable for a certain period of time--- the real issue I have with this book is that each and every character has the same style of speech. Each of these flat, poorly developed characters speak and narrate in the exact same way--- except for Joseph and the other uneducated characters, whose rare bouts of dialogue are generally incomprehensible.Heathcliff is supposedly the main character, but he is anything but a hero...although I do admit he is the most human. That doesn't say much, however. I really can't imagine any of the characters being portrayed as heroes. And the ancillary 'narrator,' Mr. Lockwood, is nothing but a stand-in for Nelly Dean. Of all the characters, he is the flattest, and he seems to have very little purpose in the story.To top all that off, the story isn't nearly as \\"amazing\\" as it's made out to be. It is advertised as revealing some of the \\"terrible truths about men and women,\\" but the characters are so unrealistic and childish that I can't even think of them as being true men and women. 95% of them fail to act their ages, by the way. The book is about thwarted love, yes, I understand. But the passion is just as believable as the characters are, and there is a disturbing lack of justice in the story. The whole book screams, \\"Who cares?!\\"Overall, I don't recommend Wuthering Heights to anyone, even though it is hailed (for whatever reason) as being a work of searing beauty and one of the most wonderful classics today. It is one of the worst books I have ever read, technically and metaphorically and creatively speaking. But who knows--- you may enjoy it.[EDIT: This review expresses my opinion about this book...my opinion only, and nothing more. I don't think it's mature for people to make illogical judgments (for instance, \\"people who thought Wuthering Heights was badly written aren't such great writers themselves\\") about others simply because they do not agree with them about a book. Everyone is entitled his/her own opinion, and therefore, no opinion is right or wrong.]"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Letters formed, words flowed, as Emily Bront moved the ink across the pages. In 1847, around the age of 28, Emily saw the culmination of her writing, Wuthering Heights, published. Emily also heard it bashed, criticized, and spoken of as worthless in her life time. As the year 1848 rolled around Emily perished from the earth. We do not Emily's personal opinion of her book when she died, but her sister, Charlotte Bront, around 1850, wrote an introduction to Wuthering Heights. It was then that the book burrowed its way into the hearts of society. Since then some have admired Emily Bront's intricacy of characters and format of plot, while others still hold to the idea that the book is morbid.Set in 1801, the story travels back in time to the beginning of Heathcliffs entrance into Wuthering Heights, it then once more progresses, ending in 1802. Emily Bront's novel, Wuthering Heights, weaves the lives of Catharine Earnshaw and Heathcliff. Mrs. Nelly Dean, for the bulk of the novel, is relating their lives to Mr. Lockwood, a new tenant at Thrushcross Grange (which is owned by Heathcliff, who lives at Wuthering Heights when Mr. Lockwood arrives). Intertwined with other impressionable characters Catharine and Heathcliff's lives are poured out. Catharine, a stubborn, saucy, selfish girl, grows up with her parents, her brother Hindly, and Heathcliff - a young starving gypsy boy brought home to Wuthering Heights by Mr. Earnshaw to live with the family. Mistreated and degraded by Hindly and scorned throughout life by all, save Mr. Earnshaw and for the most part Catharine, Heathcliff grows bitter and vengeful. As time progresses and Heathcliff's bitterness thickens his love, his life, his Catharine, dies. She dies married to another man and giving her last breath baring her husbands child. All that Heathcliff then feels is left, is to live sadistically and desperately grieved among the ashes of his life.Wuthering Heights depicts love, loss, hurt, dread, selfishness, brutality, vengeance, and in a strange way a restoration of peace. As one reads the tale, one is aghast at the behavior of the characters' and nauseated by the plot. Yet, one is intrigued by the intricately woven details and structure of the novel.The novels strength is its style; personable characters that are intermingled with larger then life characters; and its tangible setting on the moors of England laced with a supernatural essence. Emily Bront captures the Romanticism ideation of the 19th century in such a way that one gets pulled into the era, into the lives of those at Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange.Regardless of the well written tale and excellent method of describing the mind set of those in the 19th century, having this idea of the supernatural intermingled with the real; the novels weakness is loud spoken. The characters of the novel are insufferable, and the plot dark and selfish. Leaving one sick to the stomach and ones mind plagued by terrible images after reading certain portions.Through the strengths and weaknesses of the novel a lesson is brought forth. If one lets selfish ambition and revenge rule their lives, they shall live a sad desperate life among ashes. Instead of a pleasant life, by forgiving and moving towards reconciliation and freedom from the chains of abuse. It teaches that each person has a choice; to do good and bring happiness to themselves and others, or to do evil and bring pain and suffering upon themselves and others. Though the novel in totality impresses this upon its readers and concludes this in the end, I feel there are other ways of learning this lesson.I can not recommend the book; for although the conclusion brings about a lesson reaching that lesson is inner torture. I was excited to read Wuthering Heights for the title intrigues. Now that I have finished the novel I am even more excited to let it alone, to let it die among the ashes.I rate this book with one star because it is well written, not for its content."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"These books should still be required reading.

With just a bit more passion, or shall I say obsession, this book will touch the hearts of teenage females more than Jane Eyre.

For poker-faced die hard pessimistic readers, this isn't one you'll want to try."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I am in the middle of the book right now, so far it has been boring but some parts were interesting.

Sure it is written in a lovely matter, but there are 15000 people with various English majors who can write beautifully as well. It's hailed as a love story, but at the core of it there isn't any love at all. Just an assortment of angry childish people all who are developed as a still birthed child.Heathcliff and (old) Catherine love each other. But WHY, they love each other is never granted in any regard. They are in love simply for the sake of having a story a write about. That's it. Then the characters themselves aren't just underdeveloped, but they're TERRIBLE people to add on top of that. I am not one of those people who feels the need to love each and every single character, or any of them actually, but this must at least backed up with something to frame the character.Heathcliff is a horrible person simply because, based on what was given of his character in the book, he was abused. Now this aspect of course warrants some sympathy for him. And even though he is vengeful while he is a child, this is completely understandable given how he is treated. However, as a man he does not grow at all. He degenerates to a sadist simply because he didn't get what he wants, why he wants Catherine is anybody's guest.I'll just stop here because I honestly can't go on. The book is far too terrible for me to even go through breaking down each miserable character paragraph by paragraph. To put this book simply; it's basically like an emo's version of a Tyler Perry story. The conflicts exist simply because the characters will it to."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This was a terrible cut up version of the original which had little of the beauty of the real story. It was not worth the paper it was written on."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I've read a lot of the reviews below and many have said that this is a love story. If this is a love story then it is definitely is not my kind of love story. I felt that overall it was a very dark novel about horrible things happening to a variety of people. It was very difficult to get into any of the characters and overall I was fighting to get through it to the end. I love classic novels and Pride & Prejudice is my favorite but this one is not even in the same category...too dark for me."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I read this book on the recommendation that it was the finest English language novel ever written. Well, I can assure you, it is long and boring and I could care less if Katherine and Heathcliffe get together in the end anyway, if they are dead. It's pretentious and long winded and just awful. I must give Miss Bronte credit for writing a long love story that holds its continuity until the end and doesn't take you on ridiculous tangents and sub plots. But the main plot is boring and it hurt me to read it all the way through."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I realize many would contest my opinion in this feverently, and I've argued first hand with many a Wuthering Heights fan, but I have to say with all honesty, this is the worst book I have ever read.The dryness of the plot is second only to the dryness of Emily Bronte's style. For a story attempting to establish themes of love and hatred, passion and apathy, the book is sure dull as hell.I simply can't see any saving quality in this book whatsoever, save the fact that nothing at all happens so you can skim through it without missing a single element of the non-existant plot. The climax of all action within the book is a scene one third of the way in the book where young Heathcliff hurls applesauce at his effeminate and whiny rival, and it just goes even further downhill from there.It is very obvious in her writing that Emily Bronte has never left her home, as her characters are all pallid one-dimensional reflections of her own disgusting parasitic victorian life. Never in a book, even with the most despisable of villans, have I let out such a cheer as a character died, because with the dying of each character in Wuthering Heights there is a feeling of, &quot;FINALLY.&quot; Every character is dying from page 1, in one way or another, and Wuthering Heights is the &quot;journey&quot; of seeing them to their graves, and breathing a sigh of relief, interlaced with mindless whining from one character or another about how the tea and scones are too cold today.If the use of the adjective &quot;Wuthering&quot; is not a warning enough, then read the first five pages. THe only thing I can thank Emily Bronte for is the knowledge that I'll never face pain as great as she has given me in trying to force my way through her book, and I am probably now able to withstand any sort of torture or physical torment by looking back and rememebering, &quot;It could be worse... I could have to listen to Joseph speak again, or Catherine whine.&quot;I realize there's going to be multiple posts debating this, in an &quot;Emperor's New Clothing&quot; sort of fashion of only those who are smart can see the meaning in this book, but the only meaning this book has is what literary critics and English Professors try to stuff it with, no different than the stuffing forcefully injected into a long-dead thanksgiving bird. For a moment, put away your pride, cast down your defensiveness at the view that you're supposed to enjoy this book, and ask yourself: Is there really anything of value in this entire novel? The critical mind will find the answer. The coward will continue to uphold the sanctity of victorian cow-dung. Enjoy your reading :)"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Gah!

Is a great story if you like stories with depth."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"'A masterpiece' probably sounds like a clich&eacute; for this novel, but that is exactly what it is. From the start, one is captivated by the story; at times shocking, disturbing, but above all, amazing. After I finished reading it, I came to realize that it was a tragedy that Emily Bront died at such a young age, leaving behind her poems and this one, magnificent novel. Yet, even if she had lived long enough to write other books, this one would still have outstripped them all.The language used in the novel is lyrical and beautiful. Once you start reading it, you can understand why 'Wuthering Heights' is often regarded as the most successful poetic novel ever written. Emily was, after all, a poet, and I can't imagine how difficult it must be to write poetic prose and manage to do it right, yet this is what she has done. Her settings and characters are well described, and the plot is masterfully executed.As to the characters themselves, they are remarkably believable. We can identify with them in their struggles, their hopes and fears, and we feel the same emotions that they feel. Heathcliff is an outstanding literary figure, whilst Catherine, despite her faults, is and remains a classical heroine.Although there are many film and television adaptations of 'Wuthering Heights' (and a new one will soon be coming out), I am proud to say that I haven't seen any, and that I never will. The last thing I would like to do is spoil one of my favourite books with some trashy, messed-up Hollywood movie or television serial. I have a unique image of how I see the story and characters, and that's how it's going to stay.Simply put, everyone should give this book a try, even if they don't like classic novels. It has a thrilling plot, remarkable characters and beautiful language. Condemed when it was first published in 1847, 'Wuthering Heights' stands out today as one of the greatest novels in the English language.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I read this (like many of the other classics that I got) because I had never read it before.

Think I will be reading it again."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I don't know what really needs to be said about Emily Bronte's 1847 novel, the brilliantly plotted, superbly structured, & extremely engrossing WUTHERING HEIGHTS, 'cept maybe, \\"if you haven't read it, you really ought to becuz you're in for an amazing treat\\". Quite frankly, I'm jealous of the \\"uninitiated\\" who are about to embark on such a fantastic \\"journey\\", given the great road that lies ahead.For the sake of prospective first time readers who need a bit more info to tempt them into taking the plunge, I'll just say that THIS is the book that made famous the idea of rambling about on a moor with someone whom you fancied. Need more? Well, the protagonist is named Heathcliff (you've probably heard that named tossed about somewhere) and it is he who dominates both halves of this two generational story. Still not enuf? Okay; while it has been viewed by many as a great love story, WH is actually - in the words of Bronte biographer Lucasta Miller - \\"more Romantic (as in the literary style) than romantic\\". Furthermore, while new readers may have already experienced - perhaps, in reading other novels and certainly in watching tv shows and movies - the particular \\"twist\\" on the traditional method of narration that Bronte employs, it must be noted that SHE was the FIRST great writer to use it and, all these decades later, WUTHERING is still unsurpassed in its use. That's about all I dare say so as not to spoil it for new readers.In any event, the primary reason that I am writing this review is to note on the wonderful - albeit relatively short - introduction that is included in this Penguin Classics edition, one that was written by Monash University (in Melbourne) prof Pauline Nestor. If you're like me and enjoy reading intros and other critical pieces about this impressionistic romance AND don't like \\"spoilers\\", I will, as in the case of the novel, keep my comments about the content (of the intro) to a minimum. Indeed, it will be enuf to say that those WUTHERING fans who are tired of seeing Marxist, feminist, revisionist, or any other \\"ist\\"-type reading on this novel will be delighted by Nestor's take on this masterpiece, one that largely focuses on its \\"transgressive power\\". She also briefly critiques many of the various \\"popular\\" interpretations of WH that have been embraced over the years.So, while first time readers will delight in this novel's power - in regard to both its craftsmanship and its ability to rouse the emotions - those who have already read it will enjoy the intro's study as to WHY it has such power, including the power to maintain such a hold over those who have experienced it.Also, like other Penguin Classics editions, this one is annotated, which is particularly helpful in the case of WUTHERING HEIGHTS becuz, as newcomers will quickly discover, the Yorkshire dialect of a certain character is - to put it mildly - difficult for most modern readers to understand.Enjoy"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The first time I read this book, I was 11.

Going into it, of course I knew of its reputation. But I also knew of its size. And at the same time, one can't help but think how a Victorian Era woman could cross time and gender conflict to get in touch with a 17 year old guy.Boy, was I wrong.Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte is a book to get lost in. The multi-layered, time jumping story absorbs the reader quickly and effortlessly, and doesn't let go until long after one's stay in the English countryside. A lot of the characters in this book are bad people, but none of them are bad characters. From powerful, crystal clear motives to mystery and revenge, Wuthering Heights has it all. And it's not going anywhere, so you might as well hop on the bandwagon and read it.For those of you not in the know, Wuthering Heights is centered around a man named Heathcliff, who rents a house to a certain Mr. Lockwood early on in the book. Lockwood, our narrator, is shocked by some of the conditions Heathcliff is living in, and then asks his maid, Nelly, about it. Lockwood transcribes Nelly's words, creating two narrators.At one point in the novel, Lockwood is writing down Nelly's words about Isabella reading Heathcliff's letter. That's four narrator's at once. Oh. My. Gosh. But don't you worry. Emily Bronte is no lightweight, and she can manage each and every character and story thread. I've touched upon this once and will continue with it for a while: there's a reason this book is a classic and so widely read.On top of the plot, which is all consuming and entertaining (It's almost likeHarry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Book 1),A Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 1), or some other fantasy novel the way it creates its own world), there is this fierce underlying theme of love. But what's so great about this books theme is that its not a thesis statement. This book is a discussion of love, what it can do to man, what it creates, what it destroys. You'll find more academic truth in this novel about man's condition than you ever will in ay bare bones medical text book.The strongest point in this book is the characters. Isabella, Linton, Heathcliff, Catherine ( A woman after my own heart), and many, many more stick with you for a long time. Nelly, especially, who isn't just a lame narrator. She truly brings some stuff to the table, and I've known a lot of people like her, so I have a soft spot for her in my heart.It's hard to write a review of this novel because it's literally just so good. And that sounds cheesy, because its a classic and if you're here, you know its supposed to be good. But I cannot stress enough how this one not only lives up to, but it exceeds expectations for how good its supposed ot be. Don't pass this up."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I've read this several times. It is a good read, but it's more of a story about how NOT to treat people.

The depictions of passionate love affairs on the moors, cruelty and hatred were considered to vulgar and too shocking for audiences of the day. Wuthering Heights is now considered a classic of English literature and one of the best novels by a woman writer of the nineteenth century.There is something outright haunting about the characters of Wuthering Heights. They complement the eerie moor setting entirely. None of the characters is likable really, but there is something about them that hypnotizes the reader. Heathcliff's passionate love, rage, hatred and unbelievable cruelty, Catherine's puerile and fickle nature just to name a few.Wuthering Heights is not a happy love story by any stretch of the imagination. It is dark, yet passionate. It explores both sides of human nature. The characters can love passionately, then hate completely and cruelly.It is a bit difficult to get into. The opening chapters are very dark and Bront takes a while to set up the characters, especially with the frame story involving Mr. Lockwood, but if the reader sticks with it, the characters are great, the plot is twisted and the raw emotional language Bront uses are worth waiting for.See more of my reviews @ [...]Bottom Line: Wuthering Heights is a must read for English literature lovers and dark romance lovers alike.

What would one say of a book that disturbs and grips you and at the same time moves you as no other romance story has.It is a dark story. Twisted characters.Despicable and inhuman characters even. The narrative infuses in us a feeling of dark stormy nights. There isn't much depiction of romance in here. But I remember it as the most passionate romance I've ever read. The romance between Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff. The power of their feelings for each other is so real and forceful, I feel they might still be roaming the moors in Yorkshire together as spirits.And Emily Bronte's narrative is gripping.The only shortcoming I felt was the ending which was rather convenient and this convenience leads to a predictable happy ending."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"If Emily Bronte's intention was for us to have some feeling for her characters, because I think that is one of the marks of a good writer, then she hit the mark beautifully. Catherine and Heathcliff must be the most infuriating characters I have ever had the displeasure to read about. They are two selfish beasts continually arguing over which one is selfish! Instead of finding their relationship to be some intoxicating gothic romance, it is instead a bizarre, love/hate infatuation that brings misery to everyone around them.The gruesomness of the characters takes away nothing from the value of the work. As a matter of fact, I think it adds a vivid flavor that is hard to get from many novels. Afterall, everyone gringes at movies, but how many people gringe at books?"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"My Review:Emily Bronte's novel Wuthering Heights is a classic that all should read.

It lies desolate from the world upon the moors and wetlands of vast fields. This home is quiet large in size, however it is musty and gray in color and rather lonely in its outward appearance. The master is the father, Mr. Earnshaw, then there is Mrs. Earnshaw and the children, whom are Hindley and Catherine. Further into the novel a child is added into the Earnshaw family, but it is not their own. This child is later known as Heathcliff, an Irish gypsy waif found and pitied by the master during his stay at Liverpool. The master took such pain in seeing the boy on his own that he brought him home to his children to accompany. But Earnshaw's son, Hindley, from the very beginning detested Heathcliff for the reason that the master, much too obviously, favored \\"poor Heathcliff\\" than that of his own son!AS the years past, turmoil, jealousy and overall hatred consumed Hindley, leaving Heathcliff and him to be forever enemies. On the contrary, Catherine and Heathcliff were the best of friends and they grew to love each other dearly. In fact the were inseparable to the point that the greatest punishment that either could have been given was that of being away from each other.The two were quite rambunctious and always up for adventure. One day Catherine and Heathcliff met other children at the residence of Thrushcross Grange ( the Lintons, the rich and spoiled kids!!!). Catherine instantly fell in love with their classy way of life and left Heathcliff to eat her dust!! haha..Catherine still loved Heathcliff but grew to understand that she was just too high class of a women for him , resulting in her decision to love and marry her material possessor Edgar Linton ( one of the rich kids, his sister was Isabella Linton.)Stricken by grief, Heathcliff pursued till his very death his soul and body...his dear Catherine. Without her he was not complete, and each day he yearned her presence.In volume two of this novel the reader comes to know of whom marries who and who are their children. Heathcliff in this volume becomes an aggressive hateful man and his once joyful heart is turned black and cold; full of hate. Cathy, the descendant of Catherine, is portrayed by Bronte as the fulfillment of her mother's dream that was never reached ( marrying her true love). And whom Cathy marries is her cousin ( I know gross right?...well she marries 2 of her cousins!!! nastier!) who is known as Hareton. They, in a way, are the parallel of their elders, but they are more so in the sense that they are the \\"happy ending\\" to the love fest of Catherine and Heathcliff.Overall, I would have to say that this book is not only credited for its educational material, rather to me it is credited by its insightfully constructed plot. Bronte is an amazingly talented author who places her own viewpoints and morals skillfully throughout this classic. This novel is great because of its symmetrical structure of love and hate, nature and culture, and lastly the ongoing fight between Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange. At the story's finale it is truly left up to the reader to decide whom they believe won the battle. At first one believes it is Wuthering Heights due to Catherine giving in to marrying her love, yet it could be the Grange for both Catherine and Hareton beating Heathcliff's evilness in the end. What readers should come to appreciate from this novel is that Bronte really applied her inner emotions to this novel and the whole story is told from her beliefs and her viewpoint on the matter of Catherine and Heathcliff's immortal love which is too sacred to control, therefore Bronte ends this love triangle by their death for the reason that in some cases love cannot be joined for it is so strong that peace could not be kept with its overpowering presence on human kind.--ChiChi----"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"When it was first published under a pseudonym in 1847, Wuthering Heights caused a scandal. The staid and drab era of the 1840's was simply not used to such an intense and disturbing story of such raw passion and cruelty. In this tale of love and tragedy, an orphan named Heathcliff is adopted and comes to live at Wuthering Heights. He falls in love with the man's daughter, Catherine. But his life is hell because of her brother. Catherine's brother hates and humiliates him. Heathcliff can take it no more and eventually he runs away. He's gone a long time and in the meantime, Catherine marries, even though it's Heathcliff she's really in love with. Heathcliff returns dandified and rich... to take his revenge. But I won't give away the climax and ending. Heart-stopping and intense! Not for everyone, certainly not for the light 'n' fluffy inspirational romance reader, but for fans of Charlotte Bronte and Thomas Hardy.David Rehakauthor of &quot;Love and Madness&quot;"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Some readers may be put off by the &quot;classic&quot; genre of this book. The only reason I read it was because I had to for English. Well, I was glad I did. It is extremely difficult to understand at times, especially with the constant switching of narrators. I had previously seen a movie production with Lawrence Olivier, which I loved, and although it was quite different from the novel, it helped me to understand much of what was happening. The romance between Cathy and Heathcliff is absolutely heartrending. To all of those who love passionate romance (though not passionate by today's sense), I recommend this wonderful book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I don't like romance novels, or movies or television shows. Such is the curse of the lion share of my sex, despite our gradual feminization in the modern era.I'm glad I overcame my aversion to read this excellent portrayal of eros defiled. Heathcliff is the focus, fulcrum and prime mover in this story. He is dragged of the streets and taken in by a wealthy gentleman from the provinces. This man showers great affection on the young street urchin and demands equal treatment from his two natural born children.The eldest, a son, resents this upstart, so when the father dies, he relegates poor Heathcliff to the status of neglected servant. Catherine, the younger, has become a close friend of Heathcliff and follows him into the relatively untethered but savage life of the servants' children. Growing up unsupervised they develop the manners of the low born, and but develop a strong bond of love that transcends the facile distinctions of filial versus romantic.Alas, when Catherine comes of age, the duties of her birth beckon and she is taken from Heathcliff and marries someone of higher station.It is this love, never fulfilled, that sours in Heathcliff makes him a despicable tyrant.This is the dark side of romance, and Romance as viewed from the man's vantage point.Worth reading."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"As a great work of literature and a novel of passion, this work is excellent. A dark novel, it is quite intreging, drawing one into the complex and whimsically dark dream world of the characters. The novel is truly able to contrast the wild depths of one's soul with the civilized, although repressed areas through the contrast of the two houses and the people who reside there. Heathcliff, although dispicable, is someone we can sympathize with...savage and unrefined, he extends beyond humanity, becoming a character of pure passion. Cathy also exists as a refined and civilized form of that same passion, which is why she can love both the dainty Edgar and the wild Heathcliff. The children carry on the parents lives, and, eventually setting their mistakes right and bringing order through their marriage. Heathcliff too has a poignant changing scene, in which we realize that he is not evil, but has just succumbed to this because of his pain and sorrow. My favorite scene is the last between Cathy and Hareton, ending with Heathcliff's death....it was simply beautiful and contrasted with the novel's darkness. The style too was mesmerizing....Bronte's poetic language is beautiful and full of meaning...fiting perfectly with the characters. All and all, it is an excellent novel, but complex, and anything but light and simple. Jane Eyre may be better, but if you like it, read this too, it's worth your while."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a very slow book. Not much happens and you shouldn't read it if you want an interesting story. After reading it, I feel that the book could have been shortened greatly. Even though there are some excellent themes in it, I don't see WH as an example of fine literature. Authors such as Hemingway (For Whom the Bell Tolls), Dumas (The Count of Monte Cristo--Unabridged), and Frank (Alas Babylon) spin much better tales with much stronger themes and meaning. My advice: skip this book and read the unabridged version of The Count of Monte Cristo."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Hello,and welcome to my breif reveiw on Wuthering Heights.If you want to read this book you've made the right choice. Wuthering Heights is a beautiful book of passion,pain,tragedy and love. Although I am only a chid I think that this book is the most touching one I have ever read. Wuthering Heights is about the young love of Catherine and Heathcliff and their struggle to be together. I read this book and had this much admiration for it, so why shouldn't you?"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"WUTHERING HEIGHTS has always been portrayed to me as a magnificiently tragic romance between an unconventional pair of lovers. I'm glad I can finally judge it for myself. Heathcliff, rather than coming across as the quintessential brooding (yet sympathetic) hero, is a character of textbook psychopathic tendencies, right down to the needless torturing and killing of animals. Catherine is never described or portrayed sympathetically either; she is ill natured, petulant, conniving and as vengeful as Heathcliff, whom she regards as her soul mate. (But, of course, since they are both physically attractive, people must feel free to ignore these aspects of the text.)So what triggers the tragedy in their romance? Unconventional Catherine decides to take the conventional route of the times and marry for money. Heathcliff, a foundling who has been raised as Catherine's brother, slinks off with his tail between his legs, only to return in three years time with enough money to gamble with,enabling him to win the mortage to Wuthering Heights from Catherine's nasty actual brother. Meanwhile, Catherine and Heathcliff are quite dismayed when Catherine's husband finally puts his foot down and says they cannot continue their relationship. Catherine proceeds to her bedroom where she eventually bites a hole in her feather pillow and (in my favorite scene) amuses herself by naming the bird from which every feather came. Heathcliff elopes out of spite with Catherine's sister-in-law, a conventional sort who still manages to do what the wild and reckless Catherine should have done in the first place, or even later, instead of hiding out in her room for months on end. But no, that would have spoiled the plot, wouldn't it? WUTHERING HEIGHTS is definitely driven by plot, with the characters' personalities shifting to suit Miss Bronte's narrative needs.Am I glad I read this? Yes. Bronte's descriptive strengths made mucking through the characters's histrionics worthwhile. Should I have felt guilty for having put it off for so many years? Certainly not. I think even as a teenager I'd have found the characters absurd and unlikable. Do I have concern for those who think Heathcliff's continued obsession with Catherine after her death, and his compulsion to punish all those who'd thwarted his relationship with her (as well as the offspring of these people, even his own)is a shining example of a true love that transcends death? Most definitely. It saddens me to think that some girls may remain in abusive relationships because their boyfriends are the Heathcliff-type, and therefore, supposedly desirable. Heathcliff is psychopathological. Love for one person, thwarted or not, is not supposed to be used as grounds for destroying the lives of everyone else you come in contact with."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The authors of the afore time---afore the era of simplicity and profanity--- were so epic in there prose. Indeed to be over-the- top in detailing characters and choosing their destiny was par-for-the-course. This is the Harlequin romance novel of them all. For years this has been my favorite movie, and every now and then I whip out the hard copy I've had since High School and enrich myself in the loving passages. If only contemporary authors brought a poetic bent to their prose there would be so much more to read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights tells the immensly passionate tale of betrayal, sorrow and unrequited love. It is an amazing novel, capturing the reader and drawing them into Cathy and Heathcliff's world, devided between the two contrasting houses of Thrushcross Grange and Wuthering Heights. The writing style of Bronte conveys the emotion extremley well throughout the intricate and intertwining storylines. The story is told over the course of two generations, in the moors of England, creating a good backdrop for such a story. It is, in my opinion deserving of its status and leaves the reader with thoughts regarding fate and predestination. A dramatic and sadenning book, Wuthering Heights is a novel which, at the time it was published pushed back the barriers of what was considered &quot;acceptable&quot; in literature."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book is a great mix of passion, love, betrayel, and revenge.i would recommend this book to everybody. But you might want to have a dictionary handy. Be prepared to read things more than once because not all things make sense at first. if you see the movie it might enable you to understand the book better."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I have read quite a big number of classics and this one is certainly one of the best. The tragedy in the book concerning Catherine and Heathcliff is comparable to some plots we come accross in Thomas Hardy's work. Well, there is not exactly the search for perfectness like Hardy in this book but the tragedy of human existence and passion are right there. This is a moving book. I recommend this book without reservation."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I remember reading this novel as a teen and I have treasured it ever since. It is one of the greatest tragic romance in history. Emily Bronte has written a novel of great drama and beauty. I find the romantic tension between Heathcliff and Catherine very intriguing. The characters were very realistic. Even the description of certain scenes were so detailed that I really felt the mood of that period. I just love this book!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I am 15-years old, so Wuthering Heights was difficult to understand at first. The main difficulty was understanding the slang words and some of the phrases that were used in the &quot;English&quot; language. Once I got more into the story, I could understand what was going on. I found myself wanting to read on about the relationships between Heathcliff and Catherine, Catherine and Edgar, and Heathcliff and Edgar. These relationships were exciting to read about to see how everything would turn out in the end. I would put myself in the characters' shoes and think about how I would react to the various situations. For example, if I were Catherine, I would get rid of my need for wealth and marry for love. In Heathcliff's position, I would have accepted the fact that I would never be with Catherine and try to find happiness in my own life. This novel will entice you to keep reading to the end."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This 1847 novel initially shocked many in its Victorian readership, but gradually made its way to solid critical favour. The action of this extraordinarily intense novel was conceived at a very high imaginative level. It centers around the fiercely passionate relationship between Catherine &amp; Heathcliff -- fictional characters of elemental force and towering strength.&lt;&lt;The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English&gt;&gt; notes that &quot;the torturous and violent plot, instead of seeming merely melodramatic, is given solidity by the precisely realized Yorkshire locations and subtlety by the shifting narrative viewpoints.&quot; A perfectly descriptive one-liner of the novel's unbreakable backbone.*Wuthering Heights* is unique: There was nothing like it before, there has been nothing like it since, there will be nothing like it again. Are the waves still pulsing out from this depth-charge of a novel radiating in YOUR imagination? Will you also place your imprimatur of approval on Emily Bronte's undying classic?"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering heights is about the painful love between Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff. This book starts on the day when Mr. Lockwood went to live in Thrushcross Grange. He caught a flu and had to be taken care by Ellen Dean. Mrs. Dean then told the story of Catherine and Heathcliff to him.Overall, I think that this plot is rather twisted. But still, it is a great book. In fact, it is one of my favourite books. WHat a great pity that Emily Bronte hasn't written more novels."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I could actually see myself in both Cathy and Heathcliff, though totally different characters.. or are they?.. It's a good good book!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte has perfectly illustrated a tale of passion, love and despair. One of those couples seen in the same light as Romeo and Juliet, Heathcliff and Catherine portray lovers in another story of love lost. This book is impossible to put down, and it will surely haunt you long after you have finished it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This was a difficult read for me. For several months I would pick up this book become utterly disgusted with the characters and put it back down again. I'm really not sure why I finished it as the more I think about it the more I truly hated it. I wish I had returned it to the library unfinished.This is the story of Heathcliff a gypsy boy taken in by the Earnshaw family and Catherine Earnshaw his only childhood friend. Let's just say that as events unfold and as the characters develop we come to know the evil Heathcliff and selfish Catherine will never be together. Since they truly love each other the only alternative seems to be to make life miserable for themselves and everyone around them. At this point I was really hoping for a rabid pack of wolves to attack everyone and end their misery. Unfortunately this did not happen.On a more positive note this book was very well written and the character development superb."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I don't think there is any other novel out there like this. It's definitely a classic, but it's not pleasant and lovely like Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice or mysterious but positive like Charlotte Bront's Jane Eyre. As other reviers said, it's dark. It's unpleasant. It's full of anger and fighting and cruelty.And yet it is well written. It portrays well what it is meant to portray. I wish I understood it better (reading reviews and plot outlines on this page helped me immensely in this area). I definitely want to read it again sometime. I find it interesting that such a repulsive (but again, fascinating) book is such a well-known classic that almost everyone has at least heard of the title."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"As someone with a B.A. in English Literature, I can appreciate that this book has some fine writing and is a worthy classic. On the other, more personal side, I found it extremely disturbing. It is not a tale of love--in fact, I didn't witness any love between Cathy and Heathcliff. Instead, they engage in a sick, jealous, violent, obsessive relationship which ends in heartbreak and tragedy for all concerned. Heathcliff, though the &quot;hero&quot; of the story, is a dangerous, cruel, selfish, and mentally disturbed man and I was not able to feel anything for him but repulsion. Cathy is a spoiled, selfish brat.Nonetheless, it is interesting and sometimes intriguing to read, so I would recommend it if you like 19th century fiction and don't mind lots of violence and cruelty."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"From what I can gather, it is commonly considered that the primary theme of Wuthering Heights is a type of love that transcends all else. Great passion, transcending mortal life, consuming one's soul. Something noble in and of itself, more powerful than reason. Supposedly, this somehow partially excuses any evil stemming from it. Heathcliff is seen as having a wild, passionate, \\"bad boy\\" attraction.If one reads quickly, without really absorbing it all, some scenes do give Heathcliff this allure. But integrating all that he does, he is too evil. And in the end, nothing but deranged evil. His deranged, so-called love excuses nothing. Nor does the mistreatment he received excuse mistreating innocent bystanders. Though it does show insight that abuse tends to engender hatred of life and abuse of others.In his resentment, Heathcliff destroys all rational values in search of some personal satisfaction which is too mean and limited to ever make him happy. Such a man cannot love himself or anyone else. He may have an obsession for something of his imagination, but not appreciation for real people and the give and take of real relationships. Bad treatment may have led to him becoming a monster, but once a monster, he must be recognized as a monster.At that time Bronte was writing, in the 1840's, mystical notions of other worldly love and passions and existence were fairly common. But they are irrational nonetheless.I reject the popular view of the book's theme, whether Emily Bronte intended that theme or not. I think the story illustrates the theme of people being responsible for their own choices and suffering the unexpected consequences of their actions. In other words, the story does not glorify some superior love, but actually ridicules the delusion of it.The idea that souls of loved ones will be reunited after death is common. However, this is a spiritual thing; so, Heathcliff's desire to have the coffins opened on the side makes no sense in this light. He was simply deranged. How Bronte thought up such a thing is strange. Perhaps the idea is that Heathcliff is not spiritual enough, not properly religious, to imagine the mystic reuniting of souls? So he imagines a more physical reuniting?Bronte, as shown by her poetry, seems enamored with notions of life after death; so, it is difficult to know what she felt about life. There is evidence both that she enjoyed it and that she hated it. I wonder if she didn't simply have different moods? Anyway, she was often intelligent and insightful about the natures of different types of people, and Wuthering Heights is cleverly and inventively presented. The ending, which implies that the new generation will find lasting love and happiness, saves the book. I also liked the way religion was shown to be of no positive use for anything, which I doubt was Bronte's intention, but engenders meaness and abuse."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Yes. I agree. This book is compelling and atmospheric. I love the hints of the supernatural. Heathcliffe's lycanthropic qualities. Almost a werewolf on the moonlit moors. The ghostly hauntings and the attentions to and realisations of character's dreams are all very effective. I also like the dichotomy between the two houses. Wuthering Heights is a veritable Hell and Thrushdown Grange is Heaven. BUT... I have never encountered such an utterly repellant motley crew of characters in my life! Who on Earth could have ANY feelings for these people? Heathcliffe is a mad-dog that needs putting to sleep. Hindley is an abusive, maniacal drunkard. Joseph is an hysterical religious bigot. Catherine is a pain... But, worst of all none of the characters show any inclination to extricate themselves from their mess. Rather, they actively encourage each other's dissolution and disarray. There is no-one in the book strong enough or intelligent enough to check these processes of atrophy and attrition. How pointless, don't you think? And for all the reviewers who defend this book with the charge that real-life is similarly evil... Well, yeah, maybe real life according to Jerry Springer and his idiot dysfunctional redneck guests. I found these characters so repellant and downright sinister I couldn't stop thinking of Myra Hindley and Ian Brady."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Its a well woven story. Shows many attributes of human nature, the characters are as imperfect as humans are. Its not one of those stories with a perfect heroine or a horrible adversary, this story is realistic and shows different sides to people, it details their lives with utmost imperfect sincerity that you feel so deeply for these people, the author did a marvelous job with establishing a empathic relationship between the characters and the reader, and its ending isnt a perfect fairy tale ending, but its very filling and satisfying, it might be a accurate portrayal of what life is really like, and the ways people go to endure it"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I read this many years ago.

The detail of being able to enlarge font is appreciated by those of us Seniors with failing vision."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This novel has an unusual quality you can read it over and over. It has wonderful characters to love and to hate and a story line that will keep you guessing, it really is one of a kind."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Although Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre has been one of my top 5 favorite books all my life, her sister Emily's classic Wuthering Heights has never been a favorite. However, having now read it once in print and listened to it twice in audio, I will admit that it is growing on me. Wuthering Heights will never be a favorite -- its characters are too universally tormented (demented, even), the emotions are too overwrought and the feel of the book is too claustrophobic to ever suit my tastes. However, I am learning to appreciate the wild elegance of Emily Bronte's work.A note on the particular audio version I listened to, which was produced by Recorded Books: it has been my experience that Recorded Books employs the best narrators in the audio book industry. And while Flo Gibson, who narrates this one, is a highly-regarded narrator, nevertheless she is one of my least favorites. I have listened to her narrate two or three books and in each of them my opinion was the same; when she is narrating in her natural voice it is pleasing enough, but when she is doing character voices she manages to make them all sound like 80-year-old women who have been lifelong smokers. Her voice is particularly ill-suited for young female characters."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Its been a long time since I've fully been engrossed in a novel-for some time, I've worked my way through books, flipping a few pages forward so I could see when the chapter would end and I could find something better to entertain myself with. This particular novel, however, woke up something in me. It's a beautifully written piece about a passion that goes unchecked, leading a man to his doom. What's august about this piece is that the reader has a hard time deciding if the man (Heathcliff) did in fact deserve his fate. The novel deals with very difficult psychological subjects-when forgiveness should be blessed on those who have wronged you and what one should value in one's life. It is enraptured by violence, yet there is not mention of any violent scenes. Amorous to its very essence, but sadly disappointing for those expecting erotic moments. It deals with the very basis of man but mixes universal raisons d'etre with individual idiosyncrasies of the characters. It is, in short, an amazing novel and Emily Bronte should be admired for still being able to connect with readers years after her death."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I read Wuthering Heights for first time when i was 12 years old.Now I\`m 18 and I\`m still reading this book.And at everytime i read it, I can\`t hold myself from crying. I think I read it for at least one hundred times.It is the best love story ever written.from the first chapter, it starts to effect you and you cannot give it up till you wil finish it.At each chapter you start to ask yourself &quot;what will happens?, what will he or she do?&quot; or questions like this.I want to say here if you want to read it, don\`t think anything.Buy it and read it.you will see that it will become your bedside book.I can\`t describe it in words because i can\`t find the best words to describe it.It is the best book.I CANNOT FIND WORDS TO DECRIBE IT."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"If anyone doesn't like this book, it is indeed because they are either a high-school student forced to read it, someone who doesn't like 19th Century literature, or someone who expects &quot;nice&quot; characters. The strength of this story is that it is written about very flawed people. It is dark and passionate and very non-PC. It would never be written today. In short, it is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This was really a great book. I started out with a negative attitude about reading it, because many English literature classics turn out being very boring or slow; not so with this one. It was so intense and original that I honestly had to force myself to close the book at night and get some sleep. One should not expect a likeness to Shakespeare's extraordinary skill of language, but it obviously was not written by an idiot. Overall it is easy reading, with a few sophisticated, rarely used words encountered every page or two. The book should be read by anyone who can appreciate true love, and the pain caused through selfishness, cruelty, and all-encompassing sorrow. Just about every feeling of emotion is covered in this great work, actually. Don't put much truth into what some reviews say about the ending. There truly could not have been a better one. Everything comes full-circle, as I see it, and it happens in such a way as to make any sharp reader satisfied. Check this book out from the library; or better yet, buy it so you can read it again, ten years down the line, when you've forgotten what it was even about."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"For the first time I got to read this absolutely astounding masterpiece, I got thrilled and enchanted by the most beautiful language, descriptions that make you see the set and actions before your eyes, and of course this consuming crazy passion which entwines both main characters. Emily Bronte succeed not only in creating a most touching, and yet horrifying love story, which can only be compared to Phantom by Susan Kay,but also managed to make it a Gothic tale with symbolism and double meaning all around. This is a book to be read many times, and understood deeply. I was 16 when I've read it for the first time, and since then I reread it for countless number of times, and each time I discovered something new. It helped me to grow emotionally. In this story, &quot;physical&quot; true love is lifted above our world, ad turned into something more spiritual. The bond between heathcliff and Cathy was so strong that it conquered death. A greatest love story of all time. A must-read for anyone."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The other reviews of the book already summarize the plot and lend a personal response. I only wish to bring to mind, a few points about the book which make it worth reading and worth appreciating .Written in the typical Gothic Novel style, the work is full of horror, violence, love, trauma and death. How many authors can intergrate all that into a single plot and have the novel called a &quot;classic&quot;? The fact that Heathcliff cannot be classified is crucial to the novel, he oscillates between the vicitm of abuse by Hindley, and the villain by Nelly, Cathy and Linton. Throughout the novel, the unreliability of the narrative only adds to the dire and dark tone of the novel - making it even more horrific than it already is. In the time Bronte wrote in, eroticism in literature was absent - the boldness of Bronte in writing about a man walking into a married woman's bedroom inannounced is not only shocking, but also a precursor to the modern, romantic drivel that some read. Its a great book, the theme of nature vs.nurture and of wuthered development have been taken up with severity - and as the story unravels, the plot reveals itself in repetition - highlighting the horror of violence. Read this book, knowing the time it was written in, see the harsh descriptions of the violence committed by a loveless man, whose unknown background makes him a mystery. Tell me, when you've read it, if you think Heathcliff was an illegal child of old Earnshaw...is there another explanation for the way he is brought into the house, and why catherine and him develop the diabolical friendship they have?"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is NOT the study edition referred to in the other review. It is a poorly formatted version of the book which contains nothing but the text. No table of contents or other such fanciness, and certainly no supplemental material. Just the text. Rather than spend even 99 cents on this version, get the Project Gutenberg download of Wuthering Heights for the Kindle. It is better formatted and free."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"What?! Seriously? They had to put a Twilight cover on this book to get people to read it? Wuthering Heights is a million times better and more important than Twilight. Come on!I doubt any of the characters of Twilight had anything anything close to the depth required to even comprehend this novel."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"\\"Wuthering Heights\\" is a cruel,complex, unforgettable look at possessive love. The 1847 novel was the only one witten by Emily Bronte.The story tells of Heathcliff who is an orphan adopted on a Liverpool journey by Mr. Earnshaw. He brings the ragged lad back home to the wild moors of Yorkshire. Heathcliff is mistreated by the oafish Hindley Earnshaw the son of the family. He spends long dreamy hours wandering the moors with Catherine the Earnshaw daughter. After many complications Heathcliff leaves England for mysterious regions. He returns years later to discover Catherine has married the weak milquetoast Edgar Linton who gives Catherine the security and kind love of a well to do landowner.Catherine dies giving birth to daughter Cathy. Heathcliff weds the infatuated sister Isabella sister of Edgar Linton. In the second half of the novel Catherine's daughter will wed the son of Heathcliff and Isabella. Isabella has fled from the cruel Heathcliff dying at an early age.The novel is structured as a flashback to events told by Nelly Dean a nurse to Catherine who relates them to Mr. Lockwood a shallow English dandy who has rented Thrushcross Grange following a failed romantic affair.The novel switches from past to present dealing with many characters with similar names. Heathcliff is often called satanic and is a figure of Dantian and Satanic power. He is very cruel killing small animals; driving Isabella away and insulting everyone. He mistreats his son and his alcoholic nephew. Heathcliff is as rough as a crag of rock on the wild moors. He longs for a complete soul union with Catherine. He even has her dug up from the grave so he can look at her dead face! Necrophilia, sadism, overt cruelty to the weak are everday occurrences at Wuthering Heights which is ruled by the tyrant Heathcliff and his mean toady servant the repulsive Bible thumping Joseph.Catherine is petulant, violent, selfish and cruel. Neither Heathcliff or Catherine are admirable characters. They apparently love and long for one another. At one point Catherine tells Nelly \\"Heathcliff and I are one soul.\\" Following her death she will haunt Heathcliff as she roams the stark moors in neither heaven or hell.Libraries have been built dealing with the complexity of this novel. It demands several rereads. Let it be said that the novel is always fresh, suprising and modern. Wuthering Heights is not your typical love story. It is harsh, stark and cruel. Read it and ponder this tale of ghostly, obsessive, dreamliike love set against the dark brooding moors of Yorkshire. The characters will leave a permanent imprint on your mind and heart."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I'll never forget a one-on-one extended conversation I once had with the celebrated, brilliant albeit tortured poet, John Berryman (and his bottle of Jack). What remains with me from that broadly inclusive and allusive ramble about all things literary (and more) was his singling out Emily Bronte's \\"Wuthering Heights\\" as the one novel capable of exerting a hold on the reader that all but defied his analysis and description. I didn't fully grasp his drift at the time, but after at least two additional readings of this perversely powerful, heaven-denying yet time-defying testimony to indestructible passion that is neither quite \\"of\\" nor \\"out of\\" this world, I now number myself among those who, like Berryman, are in the novel's grip.The uniqueness of the story is not the subject matter (as Charlotte implied in her critical assessment of her sister's novel--though I would grant that scenes of puppy hanging and necrophilia are not common Victorian fare). The novel owes its special place to the discourse--the language as employed by Emily Bronte to express the feelings of Catherine and Heathcliff--that moreover insures familiar emotions strike the reader in unfamiliar ways, altering and destabilizing conventional understandings before taking root in consciousness. Bronte's syntax and diction literally make the reader \\"work,\\" but the difficulty is essential to her dual purpose: 1. to enable us to experience first-hand some of the same reeling and disorientation felt by the characters who ride the whirlwind of their fatal but not deadly passion; 2. to convey the supreme difficulty (impossibility, for most of us) and accomplishment of representing in words a passion that is equal parts natural and unnatural.The key to reading this novel for maximum impact and lasting appreciation is to struggle with, but not give up on, the novel's vital meanings, which are in the passages containing some combination of the following: paradox and irony, sudden reversals, antithesis, oxymoronic juxtaposition, natural images functioning as \\"objective correlatives,\\" mind-blowing similes and metaphors pushed to extravagant literary \\"conceits.\\" Above all, the reader needs to be alert to Bronte's transpositions of references and referents, her displacements of \\"signifiers\\" and the \\"signifieds\\" with which they are normally paired.The foregoing might seem to be insufficient incentive to read this remarkable novel were it not for the surprising degree of \\"precision\\" that characterizes Bronte's eros-fueled discourse about love. Just as the \\"monstrous,\\" elemental, and hate-spewing Heathcliff is at the same time an attentive, responsive observer (catching Hindley and later Catherine in mid-flight, a fractional second before either hits the floor) and a careful, even long-range planner, taking pains to stay within the \\"law,\\" Bronte's language attends to and remains true to its own laws, adhering to a meticulous and consistent logic that rewards the reader who has the patience to stay with its lurching, unpredictable course. Once you've decoded a statement such as Heathcliff's that he can \\"never forgive Catherine's murderer\\"--with Catherine herself being the \\"murderer\\" he has in mind--the logic of Bronte's lexicon along with her unfailing responsibility to the reader become more evident, making possible a relationship between reader and text rivaling that of Cathy and Heathcliff.(Concerning this Penguin edition, I could do without its return to the original published format of two volumes along with two chapter 1's, two chapter 2's, etc. The unified, organic structure of the novel is better served by an edition that avoids such a distracting bifurcation of the narrative. There's only one potential benefit that I can see: if you read the first volume only, the William Wyler-directed Hollywood classic starring Olivier and Oberon works much better.)"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"What a great experience to finally reread this classic as an adult. Emily Bronte depicts a very gothic and depressing story of two star-crossed (but not terribly likeable) lovers, Cathy & Heathcliff, and the love between them that transcended the grave. Added to that a wonderful depiction of the dark English moors and the local characters with their strange dialects. This was also told in a very unusual style, like a tale within a tale within a tale, adding more layers and perspectives to the story.How unfortunate that one's upbringing can so affect a person that their grief and bitterness turn what could have been a fine young man into such a hateful and vengeful person as Heathcliff became. And fortunate that Cathy's daughter and Hareton could overcome their dark upbringing to bring a happier light onto the dark moors of England.I did not read this version of the book, but theSelected Works of the Bronte Sisters (Wordsworth Special Editions) (Wordsworth Special Editions), which did not have all the footnotes. I think I enjoyed that better as I wasn't constantly distracted by looking to the back for the notes and just allowed myself to become engrossed with the story. It's one book you have to read at least twice in your life -- of course in school as required reading and then again as an adult to add that perspective of age and experience in life so that one can more fully appreciate a such a classic tale."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Those who read WUTHERING HEIGHTS only because their 10th grade English teacher mandated it, often return to Emily Bronte's classic years later for a return visit to the howling moor without quite knowing why. There is a sense of place to the novel that resists ready explanation, and it is perhaps that lingering memory of the triangle that connects Heathcliff, Catherine, and the moor that demands a closer examination with a more mature perspective.Heathcliff and Catherine have a stormy love affair, but the book is not simply a reworking of the romantic potboilers so current then. Nor is it just a cataloguing of nature, though nature is present even from the opening pages. What elevates WUTHERING HEIGHTS to a level not reached before and only a very few times since is Bronte's unique ability to take a nature that is merely descriptive in the hands of a lesser and infuse its wildness and unbridled power into a man who is the walking symbol of that power.Bronte divides nature in the macrocosmic sense--birds, trees, wind, rocks--into two distinct elements. There is the low key, quiet, and peaceful image of nature so beloved by Wordsworth and locates it in the peaceful Thrushcross Grange. It is here where the cultured Linton family live. Every image that Bronte uses is pacific in scope. One wonders whether the Lintons even hear the same whoosh of wind that resounds in Heathcliff's ears. Less obvious to the careless reader is the enervating subtext that infuses the Grange. Bronte drops several hints that the Grange, for all its peaceful charm, has a charm that is incapable of propagating itself in the emerging harshness of the deterministic ruthless way of life that just then was gathering steam. Catherine is a woman with one foot in that world of culture, manners, and -lingering slow death. Even after she leaves Heathcliff for Edgar Linton, Catherine tells Nelly that she is quite aware of the differences between the worlds of the Grange and of Wuthering Heights: \\"My love for Linton is like the foliage in the woods. Time will change it...My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath.\\" Here, Bronte takes the homely images of nature and personalizes them as the metaphorical difference between that which Catherine merely finds pleasant (The Grange) and that which she finds necessary (Wuthering Heights). Then there is the twisted, stormy, and unpredictable nature of Wuthering Heights, where Heathcliff grew and it is there that he suffered untold horrors that taught him that for him to survive, he had to be as violent as the winds which surrounded him.It is less certain whether Bronte wishes the reader to excuse Heathcliff's unspeakable cruelty once he reverses economic position with the effete Edgar Linton. But perhaps it is less to the point to seek to place blame for Heathcliff's revenge than to acknowledge that it is definitely useless to blame a bolt of lighting for striking its unwary victim. Heathcliff, as the walking symbol of Wuthering Heights, is that bolt which strikes out in a manner not unlike the way that he himself had been struck many times as a boy. Once Heathcliff has his revenge in the humbling of the Lintons, a revenge which costs him his beloved Catherine, it remains for the next generation--the young Cathy and Hareton--to remind Heathcliff that revenge must not be permitted to outlive its proper time, and for the new residents of both Grange and the Heights, that time has long passed. What emerges, then, from a second reading of WUTHERING HEIGHTS is Bronte's firm commitment to recreate a clash of conflicting and very nearly mutually exclusive emotions--revenge and forgiveness--that cause each new generation to learn to temper the former with the latter and thus retain their basic humanity."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"A classic like this comes with a hell of a lot of baggage. More people know of Wuthering Heights, know the cliche of clambering about desolate moorlands shouting \\"Heathcliff!\\" and rolling about passionately in the heather, than have actually read the book.But those who do read it are often surprised to find a violent, complex tale that tells as much of hate as of love. This is no frilly romance. This is a book peopled by unapologetically nasty, even hateful characters, many of whom are totally irredeemable. This is a book of hardship, of cruel passion, of all-consuming vendettas.It is also a fantastic book that everyone should read at some point in their lives. Emily Bronte tapped into some deep, dark well of the human psyche when she penned this singular collosus of a novel. From its amazingly complex yet deftly accomplished narrative structure (consisting of narratives within narratives within narratives) through to its two-tiered plot concerning the sins and misdeeds of one generation being visited upon the second, Wuthering Heights can take your breath away. It doesn't hurt that the plot itself is of great interest, and that the characters, horrid as some of them are, are so vividly drawn that many (like Heathcliff and Cathy) have transcended the bounds of the book to enter our popular consciousness.Wuthering Heights is not to be missed."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This novel is amazing and among my favorites. From the loyal and selfless Mrs. Dean, to the narcissistic and vain Catherine (and everyone imaginable in between), the characters are portrayed with a very unique talent. They truly are unforgettable, and the story is well-packed. The literal undying love between Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff will clutch the very soul of the reader. The insanity that grips and devastates throughout the novel gives Wuthering Heights an almost sick tone. The more dominate plot of Heathcliff bringing a heavy revenge upon his foes which in turn terrorizes the next generation, is told in a brilliant, intriguing, and clever way. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"There really much to say about this wonderful book that hasn't already been said, but I want to say when I read this book, i was so upset when the book ended. I've read this book about million times and each time it gets better and better. I wish i had written this book, it touches every part of you when you read it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"\\"Wuthering Heights\\" is now a famouse work of literature that once recieved very negative reviews Emily Bronte has this only novel besides her peoms. Taking place in a small town \\"Gimmerton\\" in England, it offers a lot of emotions and thoughts to the reader. This novel begins with a narrator who is mentioned only three to four times. The narrator Mr. Lockwood is lodging in at Thrushcross Grange, and is tolf the story of a very conflicting family, by Ellen Dean. Mr.Lockwood only has the oppertunity to meet fine of the characters. It seems to be that anyone that visits Wuthering Heights is faced with horiffic mightmares and will not stay in for long. Ms. Deans story begins when the main characters were very young.The novel has a lot of twist and turns and it is filled with hatred, love, envy and unhappiness. Emily ends her novel very calmly as everything falls in its place. I believe that even today, we are faced with people or families that dislike one another. Yet it is harder for revenge to be accomplished, since now we have justice from law? Emily's novel takes place before the 1800's and the rich were the ones who rules, especially in a small town . \\"wuthering Heights\\" is a must need book. The detailed events and feelings, makes you know each character deeply. You will feel attached to the characters and feel what they feel. I really enjoyed this novel."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"\\"Wurthering Heights\\" is among the greatest English novels. It is the only novel by Emily Bronte that was published in 1847, one year before the death of the author. It is a tragic romantic story of the tormented love relationship between Heathcliff and Cathy. This is a well written moving story which some readers may find too distressing.Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff were deeply in love but were destined to be apart. Catherine is a strong willed lady who was on her way up the social ladder. Heathcliff was an orphan who was a waif and was brought to the house by Cathy's father. Cathy and Heathcliff have a strong attraction for each other. However, due to Catherine's social status, she decides to marry Edgar Linton. Heathcliff feels betrayed. From then on, Emily Bronte weaves an intricate plot in a captivating story full of suspense. The story of revenge by Heathcliff is deeply disturbing, violent and shocking.Heathcliff comes out as a man with a demonic character, who is not capable of forgiving someone, is absolutely evil and seeks total destruction of the objects of his hatred. It is difficult to understand the depth of his cruelty and the extreme irrationality of his actions.The book teaches a number of lessons, one of which is the damage that resentment and pride can do to a person as it did to Heathcliff. The author also shows the negative impact of class differences as Catherine cannot embrace Heathcliff for who he is, despite their deep mutual love.This is a compelling and powerful book that left a deep impression on me. The intensity of the emotions exhibited by the main characters is captivating. This powerful and unforgettable novel is highly recommended for those studying English Literature and anyone else who wants to read an interesting and fascinating book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"That, along with many other lines, is why so many of us love Wuthering Heights. It is my all-time favorite book. I've loved it since I was about 14 years old (I'm 30 now). I love the atmospheric quality, the isolation, the rawness of human nature that this book portrays. Yes, Heathcliff and Catherine's love now seems a bit crazy, but for people who led such isolated lives, it's not hard to believe. To me, the novel IS Heathcliff. SPOILER ALERT--Once Catherine dies (midway in the novel), you would think the novel would end. But it doesn't, because Heathcliff's story continues. He's still my favorite anti-hero of any novel (sorry but Darcy or Rochester CANNOT compare)."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte, by far the most talented, arcane, imaginative of the Bronte sisters, wrote the most mentally-provocative love story ever told in the English language. Everything about this book is brilliant! Its setting on the \\"wuthering\\" (wind-swept) hilltops of a Yorkshire moor that seems not just ghost-ridden but somehow physically suspended in time is the most perfect marriage of location to tale I know of. The characters here, needless to say most especially the damned, tormented Heathcliff, rise so far above anything else written in the English language for the next hundred years that I only wish there was a higher rating than five stars to heave praise on this deserving masterpiece. I was given stacks of \\"classic\\" novels to read throughout high school and I grew cynical about them all, these boring, dust-choked standing ruins of books, but Wuthering Heights was a rare exception. This story of love, death, obsession and the indescribable energy of human emotion all but rises off the page with its ferocity. It's widely said Victorian women had fainting spells under the power of Bronte's prose, and I don't doubt that. It is not for me to try to detail this novel's plot, but rather to try to convey to you the force with which Bronte's great book struck me. I was shocked by its brilliance and reveled in all its suggested far down below its cacophonous words. Anyone who claims to appreciate literature and does not read Wuthering Heights is dwelling in a self-imposed exile from an experience few books can deliver. The sheltered Miss Bronte, in literature what the later Emily Dickinson was to poetry, was, in her era, without peer."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is one of the most passionate and haunting novels I have ever read. Emily Bronte's incredible understanding of human nature makes this tale of the power of both love and hate more endearing and realistic than the normal Romantic novel. Even after 150 years, it has the ability to shock and horrify a reader, as well as move them to tears of both joy and sorrow. The first half of the novel that illustrates Catherine Earnshaw's and Heathcliff's doomed affair is by far the most popular and famous section of the book. However, our culture has severely watered down their fascinating relationship to an archetypal version of two lovers. Bronte presents us with a much deeper, twisted, and complicated love that destroys their lives as well as the people around them. I personally also loved the second half of the book that deals with the effects of Catherine and Heathcliff on the next generation. It is much less intense than the first half, but is very beautiful and brings the plot to a full circle. I strongly recommend this book, but please do not believe that it will be a simple love story. It is a complex analysis on vindication, jealousy, hatred, and of couse, a love that is even stronger than death."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Rants and raves for Wuthering Heights. A story of the past but applies to today's reality. A story of twisted love, passion, jealousy and loosing a loved one.I truly enjoyed reading this novel. In my eyes it was a master piece written in the past. Unlike today's novels this book holds imagery close. You really feel like you're in the story. Not only are you reading but it's like you become a character, watching from the side lines. Just a master piece written by Emily Bronte, a story that will bring event back into reading a novel.A dark and twisted love story, that isn't what most people want to read, but once you get a few chapters in your stuck; you want to know what's going to happen next. Where this love triangle and twisted story is about to go.I'm afraid to say the some of the chapters didn't make since, the twisted, dark, beginning is alittle hard to follow. But if you get past that and really read what this book is about you will find an adventure you never expected to find.I give 4 out of 5 stars. This book is close to being an all time favorite. Not quiet there yet. But close. I recommend reading this book; it's a book to read on a rainy day. Something i will never forget."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights was perhaps the first book that i read which made me cry, laugh and allowed me to become more attached to characters than any other book i had read. When i read it, i knew it was going to be one of my favourite books for life.Emily Bronte's tale of incest, death, insantiy and fate never seems to grow old whilst leaving a testement to the past at the same time. Without a doubt, Wuthering Heights also contains one of the most powerful and potent settings of any book. The book's narrative is divided into two stories- the first of Cathy and Heathcliff and the second of Catherine and Hareton. Which did i prefer? Heathcliff as the hero, but i couldn't not love him as the villain too.Perhaps the main reason i adore this book so much is the obscure complexity of Heathcliff and Cathy and the undying list of themes that seem to grow in number everytime one picks up the book. Any author who succeeds in forcing the reader to like the bad and hate the good has done an amiable task and Emily Bronte does that to the fullest degree. Let's not forget the brilliant insults either. A fabulous read for anyone old enough to appreciate greatness."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Heathcliff is an orphan, adopted by the Earnshaws, where he falls madly in love with their daughter, Catherine. But Catherine denies her true love for Heathcliff, instead marrying Edgar Linton for his wealth, education and good looks. In denying herself Heathcliff, Catherine falls to madness and death, and Heathcliff's terrible vengeance ruins not only her, but everyone Heathcliff has ever associated with.The truth is this is a really well crafted novel. Many are put off by the dark and brooding themes. Also the word choice and frequent switch of narrators can be confusing. But you have to give the book time. Emily Bronte's word use is masterful, giving the characters great scope and the setting an eerie vividness. The revelations are shocking, but also very gripping. It's a love story that goes tragically wrong for the characters, and it leaves a real imprint on you when you finish it. If your into tragic love stories, it is a classic, so you should consider it. And don't worry, the ending isn't THAT tragic."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is not just about love. It is about hatred, delusion, despair. Most of all, it is about vengeance. A spiteful, remorseless and hopeless vengeance exacted for a lost and mourned love. It is indeed a dark, bitter novel which makes you feel angry and woeful. And yet amongst this blind darkness of feelings there's something more than mere despondency: there's faithfulness to a love that is able to survive beyond any parting, even in death."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This classic by Emily Bronte is a must read. The language is archaic, but the story is so compelling I just rushed through the book with no problems.The story is about the passionate love between mismatched Catherine and Heathcliff. Catherine is beautiful and refined, but underneath the ladylike exterior, she shares the same wild and free spirit as her soulmate. Heathcliff is one of the most complex characters of literature. You either love him or you hate him. Indeed, most of the characters in Wuthering Heights are complex - not all good, not all bad. This complexity in a novel published in 1847 was far ahead of its time.The setting of the lonely moors of England and the fine country mansions make the story easy to visualize. The tale is told from the first person point of view of Nelly, the maid who saw it all, and a young boarder who seeks to live with now-older Heathcliff in Heathcliff's dark and imposing estate called Wuthering Heights.The story is epic because it does not stop with Heathcliff and Catherine. It continues with Heathcliff's son and Catherine's daughter. The consuming yet doomed love of Heathcliff and Catherine has tragic repercussions for their descendants. Wuthering Heights is a study of the haunting, eternal power of love. Emily Bronte's story reminds us that sometimes love is not always beautiful and sweet. It can also be selfish and twisted."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This novel was some what ridiculous. The main characters were childish and I actually ended up liking the neighbors better - which I think was the objective. The ending was the only part that I actually enjoyed - don't worry, I won't give it away. I'll just say that it is a relief from the chaos apparent through out the novel. The mood uf the entire novel is dark and despondent...it was just too gloomy for me. I read it first when I was 17 - after reading so many other well written classics by great authors - I have to say that this one does not compare."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a supremely compelling novel displaying the best and the worst of our own human nature. It most certainly is worthy of all the praise it has received, and I can say it was one of the most enjoyable books I have ever read. After enduring the first one or two chapters- which are incredibly droll- one is immersed into a world of the most elliquent emotions, and the deepest ties between the charecters. Within the first few chapters you begin to spot the eternal, everlasting love between the two main chareters Heathcliff and Catherine. Unfortunatly the family rivalry between Hindley(Catherines brother)and Heathcliff soon make it clear their undying love cannot be fullfilled due to the fact that before Heathcliff was adopted into the family he was a gutter waif,or one may say a vagabond. Then Catherine marries, which forces all the residences of their little world to be flung unto a world of deception, cruelty, spite, and revenge.I would say that after reading this book one really has to view humanity and love in a different light. For me it really exposed the deep emotions that are never in black and white and that one must really be introduced to before they can truly begin to know what feelings are about. Probably the best part of this book, or at least for me, is the way Bronte makes the reader feel what the charecters feel and how gradually she gives one the understanding of the conflicts between the chareters. Bronte also prestents her book in such a way that after a while you really feel you are in the room whatching the events unfold, which gives the reader the oppertunity to care about the novel. Somehow, I cannot beleve I thought I was not going to like this book when I first began reading it, but now I'm sure it will remain a classic for millenia to come."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights was our newest assingest reading in my language arts class. I have to be honest I almost quit the course just looking at how difficult it seemed. I had never read classic literature before and it was something new, that looked way too difficult for me. Now that I have finished reading the book, I completely understand where all the stories I love to read came from. They take the basic story line from classics such as this one, and make it simpler. However, I honestly enjoyed the challenge of coming to understand this book. I have also struck a new passion for classic literature.Emily Bronte had a magnificiant way of finding different twists to be put all over. For instance, the book starts off at the ending and does a flashback of the beginning of the novel. Her ways of connecting things make this book so you can't skip a beat or you'll be forced to go reread it. Each chapter is jam packed with details. Even ones you think insignificant have ways of tieing in later on.The true story begins a love/hate good/evil battle. It's a lesson in life and teaches you about what certain peoples values truly were. For Catherine (a main character in the story) as much as she loved Heathcliff (a servant boy who was found on the streets of London and adopted into the Earnshaw family) her decision to marry was not followed by her heart, but by what her social status would become. She ends up marrying Edgar( a wealthy man who lived down the road from Wuthering Heights in a place called Thrushcross Grange) and not knowingly sparks Heathcliff's revenge which is the story line continued through the very end of the story.To love Heathcliff is to hate Heathcliff and visa versa. He plays almost the biggest role since he is one of the only characters who is known throughout the whole book. You first meet him as a grumpy old man whom Linton( one of the narrators) is leasing Wuhtering Heights from. As the new narrator, Nelly Dean( another servant girl who had a long past with the Earnshaw family) tells of what hardships he really had to go trough. Heathcliff was an adopted orphan and he was brought into a father who loved him, a sister who really showed no care at the time ( but who would fall madly in love with him in the end) and a brother who showed nothing but hatred towards him until his dying day. Mr. Earnshaw was very partial to Heathcliff to I think that struck the hatred from Hindley ( the brother). Throughout the late Catherines life, it was a constant battle between love and money. Although Catherine marries Edgar and Heathcliff does end up with Isabella ( Edgars younger sister), their love only grows stronger. And it continues even after Catherine dies and has her daugheter, young Cathy.Both volumes of this book are so much alike. It is almost the same story just with the heirs of the deceased living it. Cathy ( late Catherine's daughter) also is in love with two men.( Hareton- son of Catherine and Edgar, and Linton- son of Isabella and Heathcliff. Although Cathy's first husband( Linton ) does die shortly after their marriage and she gets to marry Hareton too, the similarities between Cathy and her mother are so significant.As the novel comes to an end Cathy and Hareton move back to Wuthering Heights. It is very debateable on wether or not this is truly a happy ending ( becuase so much has happened before it). I think it is because I think it is finally bringing the two different worlds together as one.I loved this book and enjoyed how well Bronte brought everything together. I have found a new love for classics and am finding myself enjoying more from that time period now more than anything else. All because I didn't give up on this one book...I encourage everyone who reads this to continue reading the book. It gets hard (believe me I know) but if I understood it anyone can!--d*"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is on of the greatest classics in literature and one I had never read until recently. I found this story of obsessive and destructive relationships very compelling and difficult to put down. It's a romance but by no means is it a happy one. Things don't go well for these people.Wuthering Heights is the story of two families the Earnshaws and Lintons, who really should never had gotten together. It's the romance between Heathcliff and Catherine that underlies the whole book. Heathcliff is defiantly the ultimate anti-hero, he's obsessive, abusive and just plain evil, but still you feel yourself drawn into his dark world and hoping that redemption comes to him. He seems beyond it however and his destructive behaviour forms the basis of this gothic tale.Emily Bronte's skills as a writer are amazing, her language is poetic and deep and the story is truly unique. My only criticism is concerning the way she wrote dialogue for the character Joseph, it's often illegible and I found it most difficult understanding what he was saying. That aside I really enjoyed this book and recommend it wholeheartedly as a study of human nature as it is without the influence of a Divine being.Thanks for reading my review and enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"At first, I griped and complained about having to read this book. My aunt practically shoved it into my hands and told me that I was to read this book and like it! Well, I read it, and I don't like it at all...I absolutely LOVE it! I'm really into romance and this one hits home.Emily Bronte died one year before its publication in 1847 and is perhaps one of the most powerfully written books in the English language. I was first 13 when I read this book and it took me three more times for me to understand what the heck Joseph was saying! .... learned in this type of speech, it's really an understanding book.Just the undying love between Heathcliff and Catherine alone is enough to put anyone in tears. And how Heathcliff is so masculine, yet so insecure and rude. How did Emily Bronte come up with this passion and this knowlegde, when she seldom left her house? You can't help but fall into sync with one or more of the characters. Tragically, yet beautifully written.This book is truly a classic, you'll never want to put it down! Get it!!!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I used to love Jane Austen. Pride and Prejudice was my favorite book; I've read it so many times that I can quote Elizabeth Bennet in my sleep. I know every single word of the movie Emma by heart. So, naturally, I felt compelled to read it. I love the flowery language, how Emma and Mr. Knightly converse so eloquently. However, still being a student, I am subjected to the whims of my teachers. When Mr. Sneeringer told us to have Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights read in a week, I groaned. How it pained me to set aside my precious Emma! I was especially greived because I recognized the author's name. About a year and a half ago, another honors English teacher commanded us to read Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre. That book is definetly not reader-friendly. The vernacular of the Victorian era that completes the whole effect of reading a Jane Austen novel worked completely against Charlotte Bronte. It made reading a difficult novel all the more tedious. I feared that I was in for another dose of the awful stuff when I received Wuthering Heights. I want to say that I was pleasantly surprised, but that doesn't even come close to my feelings. The mystery was too much for me; I couldn't put it down. Wherever I went, Wuthering Heights came with me. I took it to class, to my meals and to bed. I literally fell asleep reading the two nights my book lasted. I found it to be extremely powerful and compelling. I aspire to become a great writer someday, so I have studied many things necessary to a great novel, including plot and character development. Emily Bronte is a master at these. Her characters are so complex, and, yet, I can still identify with them. They are so well developed that it makes an intriguing story impossibly compelling. She is truly a master of the Gothic novel. I am still in awe of the graphic description of all the dark forces surrounding the Heights. I became part of the whole story when I read this book. Yes, I still love Jane Austen, but now I readily admit that there is definetly room for Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"And it must be a fine something indeed, for it kept me, a fairly discerning reader, going all the way through despite the dated language, occasional impenetrable dialect, and characters who as grown adults behaved precisely the way I remember behaving when I was about 16.Part of the 'something', I think, is the surprisingly modern psychological insight underlying the book. Today we all know the people who cry 'I'm in love' while inflicting only pain on the loved one, or who destroy children and families because of some perceived wrong. But at the time this book was written, it was not common to focus a novel on a pair of lovers with the understanding that those lovers were, in fact, jerks. The way Bronte alternately panders to 'romance' conventions with craggy Heathcliff and wayward Catherine and then spits in the face of those conventions by showing the effeminate, willowy Edgar to be the closest thing to a decent adult character in the book is refreshing for those of us who are tired of the dominance of the alpha male.In passing, I must also mention that between the stormy moors, the borderline necrophilia, and the grandiose tooth-gnashing spurned-lover angst, this is a very goth book, which never hurts from my point of view.The other part of the equation is that (despite the protestations of certain reviewers) Bronte keeps the suspense high throughout the book. Between worrying about the fate of young Cathy, waiting for the ghost to make another appearance, and eagerly anticipating the moment when Heathcliff gets his, there's hardly a slack moment.I must say that the ending was not, in my opinion, as strong as it could have been, but I'll speak of it no more so as not to spoil it. Hence, only four stars."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Although I read Wuthering Heights years ago, I enjoyed rereading it. When I was younger I thought Heathcliff was just plain mean. Now that I am older, I understand loss, and frustration a little better and the book took on new meaning for me. I think everyone should read this book at least once, and if like me you read it years ago, it is time to reread it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I won't talk about the book because it's a classic and it is wonderful. This edition is so nice. It is cute and small and very pretty. It won't take much space, and it could be joined by several in the Gramercy Classics series for a very nice display. I recommend this book as a gift and I recommend you read it!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The only novel of Emily Bronte, published a year before her tragically early death, was met with considerable critical scorn upon its publication in 1847, but became successful in the following years, and it remains a masterpiece of literature to this day. The novel's central characters, Cathy and Heathcliff, are the ones that stick foremost in readers' minds, but the book spans two generations, opening with an embittered Heathcliff having wrecked havoc on the offspring of himself and his wife,the now deceased Linton, Cathy's daughter, and her brother Hindley's son, Hareton. The first narrator, Lockwood, arrives at the Heights, witnessing the strange, dark dynamics of his master's home. He falls asleep reading the papers of the late Catherine Earnshaw, and then encounters her childlike wraith, frightening him, and he overhears Heathcliff crying out for her. Lockwood makes the aquaintence of Nelly Dean, the Earnshaw's original housekeeper, and implores her to fill in the blanks of the bizarre oasis that he has found himself in. It then flashes back to what set it all in motion. Heathcliff is a gypsy boy found abandoned on the streets of Liverpool and is taken in by the Earnshaw family. The daughter Cathy is immediately taken with the mysterious lad, while her brother Hindley openly resents him. Cathy and Heathcliff are inseparable, roaming the moors, seeking adventure in everyday occurances, living their isolated lives in relative tranquility. Their bond, while not incestuous techincally because they are not blood relations, is disapproved of :\\"She was much too fond of Heathcliff. The greatest punishment we could invent for her was to keep her separate from him, yet, she got chided more than any of us on his account.\\"When the elder Mr. Earnshaw (who favored Heathcliff) dies, Hindley takes full advantage of this and relagates this \\"filthy, swearing boy\\" into a servant and goes out of his way to make Heathcliff's life hell. Cathy meets the weathly Edgar quite by chance after she and Heathcliff stray onto the Linton property: she is attacked by the family dog and they take her in until she heals; she contracts a fever which kills Edgar's parents. When she returns to the Heights, she has been transformed into a lady, upsetting the volatile soulmate that she so dearly loves but does not feel that she can marry. The rejected young man disappears from his beloved's life for some years, returning a very (inexplicabily) wealthy man, returning to wreck havoc on all who have wronged him. Cathy has married Edgar; Hindley has become a gambling drunk. He torments his former love with his courtship and marriage to Edgar's sister Isabella, his dark motives that ultimately drive everyone to misery, Cathy to an obsession that will cost her dearly. Their tender reunion at her deathbed (she is weak, soon to give birth to her namesake daughter), heartbreaklingly expresses their longing for one another and the negative choices they have made. \\"Catherine Earnshaw, may you not rest, as long as I am living! You said I killed you - haunt me then! The murdered do haunt their murderers, I believe - I know that ghosts have wandered on earth. Be with me always - take any form - drive me mad! Only do not leave me in this abyss, where I cannot find you! Oh God! It is unttuerable! I cannot live without my life! I cannot live without my soul!\\" After her death, Heathcliff becomes even more embittered, despising his effeminate son, Linton, nuturing Hindley's son Hareton in hatred with cruelty and abuse - both young men court young Catherine's affections. Despite his efforts, Heathcliff is unable to put a stop to Hareton's obvious love for young Catherine after the death of Linton, and so there is hope for the next generation when Catherine realizes that her heart lies with Hareton. The significance of that is unmistakable, even to Heathcliff, who sees in the budding relationship before him the parallels of what he once had with Cathy. Heathcliff remains obsessed with his lost love, hearing her voice calling to him, seeing her apparition out on the moors - the taboo subject of necrophilia is hinted when he digs her up the day after her funeral, and some years later longs to crawl in the coffin with her. When he finally meets his maker, and his ghost joins Cathy's, he has left a very unpleasant memory in the ones who remain; he endeared no one to him with his selfish, cruel and dissolute ways.Heathcliff is appropriately named; although it is acknowledged in the novel that he is named after an Earnshaw son who died, it serves as both a first and last name - his lack of a personal history, mysterious reserve - he is wild, just like the moors and the heath that grows there; he is unpredictable and volatile, like the wind that rips through the countryside, he drives others often to desperation - both Cathy and Isabella are extreme examples of this - leaving them devastated and inclined to self-destruction, as a cliff overlooking the sea can symbolize. He is almost unknowable in a way, making him almost a blank slate that others can project their own views and desires on. Cathy is self-absorbed in the way of an infant, and her love for him is both mature and childlike - the bond the formed from those early days is in her mind, always:\\"My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath . . . . I am Heathcliff - he's always , always in my mind - not as a pleasure, any more than I am always a pleasure to myself - but as my own being.\\"The shifting of narrators can be mildly confusing at times, but the story is powerful and probes into the depths of human psychology, very daring for a novel of its time. Emily Bronte's poetry is also in a class by itself - some of her poems, which she wrote while composing the stories of her imaginary world of Gondal, seem to foreshadow the theme of Wuthering Heights. I recommend strongly the poems, \\"Remembrance\\" and \\"The Prisoner\\" in particular.A classic on every level, as long as you can handle dark human depths and romantic tragedy."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Every month my teacher makes us write a book report. I had a 300 and something page book that I was going to read but of course I put it off because I HATE READING! I decided to read this book because it was shorter and it had been on my bookshelf collecting dust for years. Once I started reading, I read a quarter of the book and the only reason I put it down was because by the time I looked up it was two in the morning! I think everyone needs to read this book. I was also amazed when I found out that it was written 150 years ago!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I picked up this book with a great background history of the Bronte sisters. Emily was the most sheltered and out of her came Wuthering Heights which is an intense story of love, hate, and passion. The book criticizes society at the time and really holds nothing back. There is no real happy ending here but the book does take you along an interesting path that deals with race, class, and religious issues."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"As you begin to read this novel you will almost certainly feel a sense of confusion. I have heard many people complain that the first four chapters are among the most confusing and boring chapters they have ever read. Do not, I repeat, do not stop reading this book in the first four chapters. Although the story does not make sense at first and especially because the names of the characters sometimes appear more than once, continue to read the book because it is worth it in the end.The story focuses around Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff. The main theme of the story focuses around the mysterious powers of love and hatred and how this played into the lives of two families, the Earnshaws and the Lintons. The reason why this novel has been considered such a masterpiece is that it encompasses every human emotion from love to hate, forgiveness to revenge and everything else in the realm of human understanding. As one reads the novel it becomes apparent that Emily Bronte is very skilled in her ability to weave everything into this tight-knit story with countless parallels and subtle symbolism. There is incredible symbolism within this book that I would encourage readers to try to pick out. On the surface the book is a treasure in itself, containing the most memorable love story in all of literature as well as managing to encompass so many universal themes, but understanding the symbolism gives this novel so much more depth. Understanding the symbols is the only way to truly appreciate the genius of Wuthering Heights and Emily Bronte herself. If you do decide to read this book, it becomes too irresistable not to read again, and absolutely impossible to forget."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a disturbingly dark book about love, obsession and revenge. It is a romantic novel full of twists and turns that nearly requires the reader to keep a running dictionary of characters, especially since names have a tendency to pop up in different places and on different people throughout the novel. I read this novel for a class assignment in Victorian Literature but it is helpful to know that the book employs many themes of the Romantic literary genre as well. Victorian ideas of social class are brought up as well as the fantasies of adolescence. Some of the Romantic ideas found in the novels include the idea of the tragic landscape. The landscape of the novel is foreboding and isolated, borrowed most likely from the gothic novel. The characters are extreme in their varying passions and the concept of the dream is used in a type of ghostly communication. One of the story's narrators has a dream of being visited by the ghost of Catherine, which causes a startling and dramatic reaction in Heathcliff. The belief that the reader cannot fully hate Heathcliff because of how he was mistreated as a child is also a Romantic ideal.The story contains a great deal of darkness and some cruelty, which may turn readers away. Love is often extreme to the point of violence in the novel while the romances themselves are nearly incestuous in tone. Cousins marry and adopted siblings hold lifelong affections and obsessions for each other. The novel also illustrates an element of cruelty that can be slightly disturbing at times. Heathcliff, the novel's antagonist, goes as far as to string up the beloved dog of the young woman he courts after Catherine rejects him.The main focus of the story is the rather twisted love story element that develops between Catherine and Heathcliff. Heathcliff is adopted into Catherine's family at a young age and the pair become close, though Catherine rejects him because he is poor and instead marries a rich neighbor. Though throughout the novel, other romances develop between the two highly inbred families, they are side stories in comparison to the main romance.The love of Catherine and Heathcliff eventually develops into an obsession that lasts, and in fact becomes even stronger with the eventual death of Catherine. Her spirit seems to haunt Heathcliff and further fire his obsession. Even before Catherine's death this obsessive love broadens to include an equally obsessive drive to ruin the lives of all the people who mistreated him and stood between him and Catherine, including her husband and older brother.These obsessions eventually lead to the last of the major themes of the novel, revenge. A good part of the book is spent upon Heathcliff's attempts to destroy the lives of anyone and everyone who mistreated him or got in the way of his relationship with Catherine. His need for revenge does not lessen as the book moves on and Heathcliff continues to take his revenge even upon the next generation, including Catherine's daughter and his own son. Whether or not Heathcliff succeeds in his attempts I leave to the reader.Personally, I enjoyed this book a great deal, if for no other reason than the simple fact that it was quite different from the usual school assigned reading. I was pleasantly surprised by how well woven and engaging the book was. The calculating lengths that Heathcliff goes to in order fulfill his quest for revenge are nearly reason enough to read the book. The old style language of the book, which I expected to be a hindrance, was hardly noticeable. In short, if you can handle (or enjoy) the book's darker aspects, then I highly recommend this classic to you. (And I'm not just saying that because I have to! ;))Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"WARNING: reading this review will spoil some of the plot of WH.I grinned when Sis, back in high school, told me I reminded her of Heathcliff. I remembered from the (old, old) movie that he was some evil fellow. Then I read the book. And stopped grinning. I'm amazed this book would ever be assigned to high school 'kids.' It's humorless and ultra-realistic. Every page reeks of evil and has selfishly evil (meaning normal) characters. Heathcliff was a tortured being but hardly innocent. Cathy was a solipsistic, driven fool. Even the Cliff Notes booklet for WH is surprisingly short (I read The Notes after burning through the book in a week) as if Cliff's was horrified to study this book! Cliff's good observation about Heathcliff is that his sole emotion is actually pity/affection for Hareton and that his 'love' for Cathy is, in fact, an animal possessive jealous rage. I changed after reading this book. For the better, I don't know. There is a point in the book where Heathcliff's every action evokes disgust and hatred, and then...as a man...I began to feel what he felt. For whatver his faults, I began to connect fully with his insane rage, and that his ideal of 'love' for Catherine--however warped--had been stolen from him forever. I understood his ruthlessness and love for no person or thing after Catherine's death. By the way, not to parrot the critics, but it is true that the marriage of Cathy and Hareton is NOT some kind of full circle, happier ending. It's more like holding hands in Hell. I left this book sadder than when I started it. After reading it, I doubt anyone anywhere is getting 'wiser.'"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"the point of view was different and that was one of the main things that i enjoyed about this book. at the beginning i was like what a boring book because it had nothing to do with what it was sopposed to andi was confused. but further on i started to understand and couldn't put the book down. heathcliff and catherines characters were hard to like but had to admire their love. it ws unique, something that only people dream of and even though theirs didnt work because their likves turned out the wasy it did catherine(2)and hareton experience love. it was well written and one of the best books i have ever read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Those who read this book looking for plots that are simple to follow and modern grammar will be sorely disappointed. It is a classic, beautifully written and descriptive. I chose this novel for my senior thesis, and when delved into more deeply, the complex relationships and manipulations between characters is astounding. Emily Bronte is an artist whom I greatly admire and will always look to as an inspiration. I pity those not exposed to this caliber of writing, and even more so those who cannot find any enjoyable portion of it. It is a work of passion, innovative in a time of repression."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The first book I ever read by the Bronte sisters was Jane Eyre, and I loved it, while WH was too gloomy for my 13 years. I still appreciate Jane Eyre a lot, but I think you can compare Emily Bronte only to Dostoyevsky. WH is above all about life, how it crushes a person, how it changes you from a child into an adult, often thereby destroying the best part in you, about making utterly wrong decisions for the society's sake...it is universal and timeless."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I read this book in Bosnia, when I was 8, and in the beginning, I was bored by the insipid narrator...then, as I read further on, I gained a whole new world of insights, and after I put it down, I was not the same. This is-without any doubts-one of the greatest books ever written: about love, probably not the way it really exists, but more about the way it should be-fierce, almost insane, unconditional, holy; about life, the way it often is, merciless, disregarding one's true wishes and needs. But all the words I pile up here fade away in comparison with this book. It is a shame that there are so many worthless &quot;romantic fiction&quot; pulp books being published and read, when there is Wuthering Heights to teach you about love, loss and despair."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book is excellent, but to fully appreciate it, you must be able to understand not only love but passion. Immature readers cannot grasp the depth of the passion between Cathy &amp; Heathcliff. While Jane Eyre is an interesting story, it does not reveal the magnitude of human emotion and angst that Wuthering Heights does."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Reading all the comments made me sick to the stomach. Everyone nowadays is just living too fast to enjoy the world's real treasures: books. So stop thinking about the logics of Wuthering Heights and just enjoy it 'cause it's the BEST!!!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I am one of the only men Ive ever met that really likes this book. Its one of the only two books that I had to read for school that I actually liked (the other being 1984). Its an extremely passionate story of, as the above description says &quot;a love stronger than death&quot;. Also, I feel this is a book that almost anyone can relate to, due to the way it gets down to the essence of what love is. My words cannot do this book justice properly."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book is amazing. It is such a powerful story. everytime I read it I can see, almost feel, it happen. It's such a dark, almost morbid story. there's just so much feeling that went into writing the book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is the GREATEST BOOK EVER WRITTEN and is probably the greatest book that will ever be written. It not only has a great story line but it has a true depth to it that seems to reach beyond physical life and understanding itself. For a women of that time to have such insight into the psychology of her caracters amazes me. I first read it when I was a senior in highschool and it gave me a true love and respect for reading and great writers such as Emily Bronte. I highly recomend reading it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Simply the most incredible book I have ever read. The characters become embedded in your mind, and you live through their body and see through their eyes. It is so heart-wrenchingly passionate that at times you will feel helpless under the book's control. For anyone who enjoys romance and passion, this is the book with your name written on it. Everyone should read this book, for it taps into those rare and everyday human emotions that we can recognize and relate to. Indeed, a great read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This classic has a reputation as being a grand \\"love\\" story. It is more about dark obession than \\"love\\". The characters are all psychologically damaged people (nuts) who seem to thrive on making each other miserable. I cannot figure out what Catherine had that made two men fall madly in love with her--she is spoiled, selfish, and extremely stupid. Edgar is a spineless wimp who certainly knew he had a rival--but refused to deal with it. Heathcliff is a sadist who is obessed with (not in love with) Catherine; he is willing to harm even himself to cause suffering to other people. Who could love a man that nasty? Isabella is another silly woman who could not see what was going on around her and falls in \\"love\\" with her imagined version of Heathcliff. And on and on...Nelly Dean is the only sane person in this novel, and she was crazy to stay around these looney families as long as she did.The atmosphere saves the book from complete ruin--it is as dark ,moody, and brooding as the characters. Even the houses seem to snarl and brood and take on the personalities of characters. One is compelled to continue in the book just to see how much more crazy things will get with every body being so dysfunctional and obssessed with having their way. The writing is poetic, and the final scene between Catherine and Heathcliff could be touching--if you can forget how absurd it is.Maybe I am too much of a realist to get carried away with this type of novel. I would not touch Heathcliff with a ten foot pole and can't imagine what women see in the character, other than dark good looks. I cannot imagine what a man would see in Catherine. Or how any of these crazy characters' actions spell l-o-v-e."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"If I were a contributor to a dictionary and was asked for a definition of the word passion, I would simply write....\\"See Wuthering Heights\\". All the basic human emotions- love, hate, jealously, pride, are on display in this novel but at their penultimate height. Cathy just doesn't love Heathcliff- he is part of her very being. Heathcliff just doesn't hate his son Linton- he must fully destroy him. In real life, no one would want to meet, let alone spend any time with any of these people (except perhaps for Ellen Deane, a housekeeper who recounts the story to her new employer-good eye for detail as she spins her tale). But to live with them through the pages of a novel-pure heaven. No other book I have read from this time period even comes close to the modernity of this novel. Heathcliff and Cathy are not destined to be together, because Cathy is unable to forgo the warm pleasures that money can bring. She marries Edgar Linton, a good man devoted to Cathy and for a time Cathy settles in to this life. But as soon as Heathcliff re-enters her life, she is determined to possess him as she did before and Edgar must just understand. Why should he be jealous? Cathy asks. There is not hint of a sexual relationship between Cathy and Heathcliff but something deeper, deeper than even love. Edgar, like most human beings, feels unable to share his spouse in this kind of relationship and being thwarted in her desires, Cathy pines and eventually dies. But this happens in the first half of the book-what are the remaining 150 pages about? Since Heathcliff can never be happy since Cathy is gone, then he decides that no one will be happy and he takes his revenge. And what revenge! Just from general knowledge, I knew what to expect in the first half of the book but the second half was a revelation. Emily Bronte has created a character in Heathcliff that breaks almost every moral code of the time and yet the reader sympathizes with him, no matter how monstrous his actions. I can't think of another writer alive or dead who could have pulled off this feat so well. The writing is beautiful and the dialogues between Cathy and Heathcliff are richly poetic.If you haven't read Wuthering Heights, do yourself a favor and run to find a copy. Reading experiences such as this are rare- a perfectly written novel with characters you will remember forever. The world lost a great novelist with the death of Emily Bronte after only one novel. It makes the reader wonder what else she could have produced."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This edition is just the last aesthetic overhauling of Oxford World's Classics ones with just the same picture (by the Pre-Raphaelite master John Everett Millais) on the cover (see my reviews on them or the global vision I offer in the Norton Critical Fourth Edition review).The cover has been the main object of redesign and looks good, even showy. The only complaint I have, with this as well as with previous editions, and Penguin and some worse ones (like Wordsworth Classics), is the very bad paper quality and the outrageous mass-market paperback with glue-only binding. The book looks like it were to be destroyed BEFORE reading. This just can't be the only format in which to get this absolute classical masterpiece of world-over novel writing, in one edition in which the best scholarly efforts have been spent to get a pure text with adequate annotation. At the very least it should be offered as a quality paperback, with flaps, acceptable paper and, of course, signature-sewn.As far as the contents and not the vessel is concerned, and summarizing: the best 1847 reliable and authoritative Clarendon critical text (due to Hilda Marsden), even with over-conservative details for a mass-market edition, like a rather heavy and outdated punctuation and the unbelievable two-volume implied structure, with its clumsy independent chapter numbering.Ian Jack's annotation is yet one of the very best, even if its Yorkshire dialect support is scanty and a bit difficult to follow (most good editions offer by now fullfoot-of-page glosses of the dialect tirades -glosses that are sometimes wrong and misleading-). The Bibliography is very good, selected, sorted and annotated (I don't know if updated, suppose not). The long Introduction by Patsy Stoneman (30 pp) is excellent, even if a little scholarly (and, as with most of other Introductions, please don't read it BEFORE the novel but after it, just as the \\"Charlotte's materials\\" of 1850 provided at the end of the volume).This edition is a really good buy, that should be compared to the best text-oriented editions:A) Penguin (Pauline Nestor),B) Routledge (Heather Glen, very hard to come by, try Amazon Canada).You may also consider the good context-oriented editions (that is, \\"study\\" ones, rich in contextual materials and/or critical essays), namely,C) Norton Critical Fourth Edition (Dunn), with rather scanty if good annotation and a bit eclectic and even idiosyncratic text (but with very good punctuation);D) the NEW Broadview Press edition by Beth Newman, with scanty notes (very good as they are) and full dialectal glosses like Norton Fourth (both sets of glosses neither wrong nor misleading). Some textual foibles or little blunders are not worrisome (with the best punctuation in town). The overall selection of contextual materials is, arguably, the BEST EVER, with a very interesting document on \\"brain fever\\". The brief and original Introduction (21 pp) is excellent and thought-provoking.Not to be forgotten in this class isE) Longman Cultural Edition (Alison Booth), featuring good if more conventional Introduction and good annotation that includes a little blunder about Miloin Chapter 9, with the authoritative Clarendon text (I will inform you if there is any hidden foible with this), and a too vast array of almost dis-arrayed contextual pieces (more than forty of them), interesting but too brief to be really meaningful.I stand by what I have written, but don't forget that this is one of the very best editions available!Oneworld Classics is a worse choice, in spite of his good paperback making, with good paper and printing quality and covers with flaps. With its good annotation it would challenge the top positions, were it not by the bad quality of the text itself, that was carefully edited but keeps many blunders and too many of Charlotte's 1850 \\"improvements\\". Wordsworth Classics edition is also a worse choice, with a reliable 1850 text (that of the Haworth Edition of 1900: that is, a reliable edition of the wrong text!), adequate notes (even if brief and not user-friendly) and a fair Introduction by John S. Whitley, in one of the worst material productions ever.If you are looking for a beautiful hardcover volume, your choices are much more limited. You can wait for two or three years to get an used copy of the Clarendon 1976 (or 1995) Edition, or you can get the nice volume in Barnes&Noble; Classics (that has the reliable Haworth Edition 1850 text, which is really a pity), or rush to get one nice copy of the Franklin Mint edition of 1978 (see my review) with the beautiful if not daring double-page lithographs by Alan Reingold and a very good pre-Clarendon 1847 text, but with no modern introduction and no annotation whatever, except for the well-done footnotes glossing correctly and in full the dialect tirades (the first edition ever to do so)."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I loved Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte, and I can say without a doubt that I loved Wuthering Heights just as much. The Bronte sisters are so talented! I hope to read something by Anne Bronte, the less well known sister, too. Wuthering Heights is about a destructive and consuming love between Heathcliff, an orphan who comes to the mansion of Wuthering Heights, and Cathy, the daughter of the wealthy family that takes him in. They are drawn together as soon as they meet. The novel is narrated partly by Mr. Lockwood, a tenant who meets Heathcliff many years later. His housekeeper, Mrs. Dean, tells him about the events that happened years earlier, making for a gripping, suspenseful, and sad story.Wuthering Heights is very complex, especially the character of Heathcliff. He's not \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\"; he's conflicted, a multi-layered character. At times, I sympathized with Heathcliff; at other times, I really hated him. Wuthering Heights is difficult to put into any category. It is realistic, but it also has supernatural beings, with ghosts and graves and a love that transcends time. But it also is a mystery, asking complicated questions. The writing is very old-fashioned, but it's not too overwritten, though I did have a little trouble with some of the Yorkshire dialect. But that occurs very rarely; there's just one minor character who speaks that way.You can read all of my reviews at my blog novareviews.blogspot.com."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I downloaded Emily Bronte's \\"Wuthering Heights\\" to my Kindle and read this gothic novel for the first time since I was a teenager discovering 19th Century novels. I remember liking \\"Wuthering Heights\\" as well as Charlotte Bronte's \\"Jane Eyre.\\" I'm sure as a young girl I enjoyed the lyrical, descriptive writing, the mysterious, dark setting, and the passionate but impossible love. But now, forty years later and perhaps wiser, I saw so much more in the characters and the relationships, that it was almost overwhelming to read. I now definitely prefer Charlotte's Mr. Rochester to Emily's Mr. Heathcliff. Such a conflicted, tragic character, Heathcliff only gives small glimpses of human warmth. Yet those glimpses kept me reading and wanting to hope for him. Every character in the book is tragically flawed. But like water springing in hard, rocky soil, love breaks through in unexpected places (as with Catherine and Hareton at the end)."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I love this book and have read it multiple times. To call it melodramatic is to misunderstand the period in which it was written, is to oversimplify it without critically assessing it, and is to mistakenly compare it to current novels. It's apples vs. oranges! One thing that I've always admired is Bronte's use of the letter-within-a-letter framing device; it helps establish the multiple voices of the novel and must've been quite innovative for its time. Admittedly, my appreciation for this novel has been enriched by the 1939 film starring Merle Oberon and Laurence Olivier, though I don't think any film can really do this book justice.

After trudging along several chapters I found this book to be quite interesting.This book incorporates a lot of gothic elements within the book. Emily Bronte conveys a deep horror and arouses our morbid curiosity with this. One will find many supernatural elements and suspenseful atmosphere within this book, and even a ghost! Because Bronte writes this book through the eyes of several characters, it is hard to judge the objectivity of the story, forcing readers to determine for themselves whether or not certain actions were justified. In the retellings through one character who used to care for Heathcliff's lover, she consistently paints him as the antagonist, emphasizing his faults and his actions against the family. This makes the book that much more interesting to read.The story of Wuthering Heights is a really complicated love story that focuses mainly on Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw. Through Bronte's appeal to pathos, she is able to convey and build up the romance between Heathcliff and Catherine. When she dies, Heathcliff, literally becomes a monster mentally, and Bronte applies this to a figurative level, describing him as a monster too. This also reveals the inner turmoil he experiences upon her death.Emily Bronte definitely writes on par with her sister Charlotte Bronte. Emily's work on Wuthering Heights, with her use of pathos and figurative language definitely makes it a classical gothic romance novel with a novel storyline.It is a beautifully written book that is full of human emotion from the seemingly cold and calculating Heathcliff. After the death of Catherine he burns for revenge. It is a great book, one just needs to get through the first couple of chapter to realize this. The conclusion is also satisfactory and provides for a good release of tension and an epiphany-like ending.I find this book to be a good read, because it has some adult themes, I would not exactly advise little kids to read it, but I am sure that anyone who appreciates literature would be \\"wowed\\" and amazed by this book. Give it a chance, and you will find that this book is worth every single penny!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a love story. But it is not your typical, love conquers all tale. It is a dark, twisted story of obsession, greed and lust that spans beyond the grave. What really strikes me about the story still is how dark it is. And I don't mean 'given the time it was written' because the story is legitimately dark no matter what era it is set in.In the story Bronte perfectly frames two very different kinds of love. There is the healthy love that the tragic heroine of the story has for her husband. There is a fondness in that love that seems destined to grow and flourish. But, there is also an unhealthy, all consuming fiery love between the heroine and the devil of the story, our tragic hero, the scoundrel Heathcliff. So consuming and obsessive is the love between the two that it becomes dark and twisted. Their love is so unhealthy and obsessive that it consumes and devours both of them. It all sounds so amazingly romantic but what it drives the characters to: insanity, murder, captivity, and revenge makes even their proclamations of love to one another macabre.On a side note, Heathcliff, the center of the story for most intents and purposes, is so damned intriguing. I haven't really encountered a character quite like him in literature. You find yourself wanting to know more about him and can't helping thinking that a man who could love so deeply could be so damned evil! But oh, he is...Far and away, Bronte succeeds in the book in creating characters who are both sympathetic and intolerable. None of the characters are entirely loveable, save for the story teller herself. Otherwise there is a pathetic air among everyone save for Heathcliff who seems the only one in the novel who can exploit this weakness. It makes for a lot of moments of cringing as you can almost see the gears of evil genius working in Heathcliff's head.My only complaint with the book is the conveinance of pregnancy. Never is it mentioned until the child is born and never is the mother said to be or appear pregnant. It wasn't enough to entirely take me out of the story but I did roll my eyes on every instance. That is really the only hard argument I can make of Bronte taking an easy way out in her plot but given this is her first and only attempt at a novel, I can let it go as it truly is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This novel has touched me deeply since first reading and I have enjoyed it many times over, again becoming engrossed in the characters with each new read, yet each time finding something new. A true classic. It is a little sad, though, that this great book averages four stars, the same rating as many of the comparatively poorly written, more contemporary but soon-to-be-forgotten fiction reviewed on this site. Not that one should confine oneself to reading classics, but at least recognize them for what they are."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Ever since I read this book, every book is easy to read. Thanks to this book, I have come to understand two things better: a bit more of human nature through Heathcliff's, and both Catherines' characters and English language through Emily Bronte's amazing style. The language changed a lot ever since the beginning of 19th century, I had trouble reading at first, it seemed boring and I couldn't really get into the characters. Then suddenly it became easy and interesting to read. Maybe I should thank my reading abilities for the improvement but I'd rather think it's the well developed characters of Ms Bronte helped me to step over that invisible reading barrier. I highly recommend this book, it is a must-read kind because it is about pure love, not passion."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte wrote Wuthering Heights during a time when the people of England were not ready for such an intense and passionate novel. There-for it was not given the recognition it truely diserved until many years later, long after she died of T.B. Wuthering Heights is truely a work of art. The story envelopes the reader into a mysterious world with very heartful characters. The narration is perfect, in that you are seeing and hearing everything that the narrator says and sees. Emily's writting style is perfect in that she always gives just the right amount of details in her accounts. As a matter of fact, the story is so well written that a reader who really takes the time to understand and enjoy the book will soon find himself/herself attatched to it. It is almost impossible to put down. Over all, Wuthering Heights is a book not to be missed, but reader be warned, it is a book that takes a lot of effort to read. A lot of paragraphs require heavy analyzing to make sure that you catch the hidden meanings and important foreshadowing. In think that there really isnt much of an age restriction, but if your reading this book for pleasure, and your under fourteen, you wasting your time."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Part of the charm of this novel is that it remains very readable 150+ years after its original publication date. The language of the book flows in a wonderful way, carrying the reader fully into another time and place. Emily Bronte was a true artist; telling a story of passion, pride, jealousy and vengeance using ordinary characters we can all relate to. An unforgettable literary masterpiece!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte is clearly the genius of the family. If you liked Jane Eyre, you will love Wuthering Heights. It is *better* than Jane Eyre, it made me like Jane Eyre less in contrast with Wuthering Height's intense passion. This book is extremely unique and insightful. Don't let the first two chapters confuse you, don't put down this novel, you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I really loved this book. It was a wonderful book, definetly worth your time. The feelings, and the characters were amazing. Each time I read it, a new feeling, a new moral, pops out. Every time is better than the last."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I think I know how Emily Bronte developed the character of Heathcliff. I believe that she based it on that of her father. Outrageous? Unfair? After all the Rev. Bronte was a decent sort of chap whereas on one occasion Heathcliff beat a young teenager until he lost consciousness.But consider this. Emily's father, tormented by his intellectual isolation and his lonely widowhood, used to occasionally open the back door of his house and fire a gun several times into the moors for no apparent reason. You can imagine the young Emily tentatively enquiring, &quot;Is everything alright, father?&quot; and her father answering brusquely, &quot;Perfectly satisfactory, thank you, my dear.&quot; and then slamming the door as he disappeared back into his study.On other occasions, he used to stuff furniture or a rug into the living room fire. I forget where I read this. Gaskell's biography of Charlotte Bronte? Daphne du Maurier's excellent book &quot;The Infernal World of Branwell Bronte&quot;?I doubt that Emily forgot the images created by her father's behaviour. It must have seemed to her like a hint of a suppressed rage so huge as to demand the creation of a character like Heathcliff to express it.How strange this book - like a dream journey into the subconscious world! People reflected in other people. Time collapsing onto itself. As Emily herself said in a poem, &quot;Once having drunk of such divinist anguish How can I face the empty world again?&quot;"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Like To Kill A Mockingbird, Wuthering Heigts is a novel on the 'prepare for college' reading list, and is read in many high schools. I found an old copy on my mothers bookshelf, and loved this novel before I knew it was considered a 'classic'. You often hear references made to star-crossed literary couples such as 'Romeo and Juliet' and 'Catherine and Heathcliff'. It is telling that this work is important enough to be referenced alongside ShakespeareThe only novel written by Emily (her sisters Charlotte and Anne were more prolific), the tale takes place on the moors of England. Catherine Earnshaw is surprised when her well-to-do father brings home a mysterious foundling and names him Heathcliff. A dark and brooding child, Heathcliff nonetheless becomes Catherines playmate and confedant.Their relationship changes, however, as Catherine grows into a woman. She begins to think that a lady of her station should not be dallying with a foundling such as Heathcliff, who has no family or wealth. She is wrapped in her own vain self-worth, and beings to spur the bewildered Heathcliff.A moody and potentially violet man, Heathcliff retreats further into himself the worse Catherine treats him. He never stops loving her, his passion endures even her scorn. The end of their love affair is both beautiful and tragic.A great triumph of writing by a woman of her time, Emily died shortly after her novel was published. As a historical note, the three sisters published their work under pen names. This ruse was concocted so publishers wound presume the works were written by men, and would therefore be taken seriously."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I first read Wuthering Heights when I was in high school. To this day it is still my favorite book. The characters of Heathcliff and Catherine come alive. I still feel the heartache experienced by these two characters whenever I read the final confrontation scene between these two soulmates. You are actually swept away by their passion and pain.This is one book I would highly recommend to anyone who has an appreciation for great literature."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Yes. I loved this book. You must read it. I have never read any book like this before. It's both happy and sad....read it yourself and you will see what I meen!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Bronte's Wuthering Heights contains the charms and vices of a soap opera. Due to the complex family structure one almost needs to keep the family tree handy while reading to keep from getting confused. I enjoy watching soap operas I like to know all the complex family history or just basic background that has been happening for years. When you know all of the history, it makes the story make sense. Wuthering Heights has this charm because of its long time span and complicated family tree. Some of the bad points of soap operas are also present in Wuthering Heights. One such disadvantage is, in my opinion, slow moving plots. Since there is such a long time period covered, the stories can often drag out. Overall, I liked Wuthering Heights for its soap opera-like qualties."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Overall the book had alot to do with a mystery of love. This book left you wondering what will happen next. Out of everything I had read in the book. I like Catherine Earnshaw Lintons part the most. She was wild at times then a lady at another time. Catherine had it bad with the confusion she had between the two men. My favorite part is on page (149) when Edgar return home from Gimmerton and catches Heathcliff with his wife cause she didn't want Heathcliff to go. The part that seem to make me think is what was Edgar thinking when Heathcliff Gave Catherine to him. This book was Good and I would recommend this book to any one. But I would make sure I explain each character to him or her first."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is one of the greatest books I ever read.

Very, very good..."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"It is a very powerful book that captures you immediately into its narative. You want to grab these two characters and tell them to STOP hurting each other. My wish for them has always been happiness together but that never happens.

I wish more people would read this classic for this really is one of the best."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is definately one of the top ten best books I have ever read.

Otherwise, it is great."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Upon the understanding of the Earnshaw and Linton family histories, one can begin to enjoy the twisted and beautiful facets of Emily Bronte's plot. The development of the character of Heathcliff is nothing short of genius. He is a true villain that at times can be greatly sympathized with because of his great loss, the love of his life. The gothic elements in this novel greatly heighten the overall effect of Bronte's plot. A beautiful story that is indeed a classic of English literature."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I was very much looking forward to a wonderfully written, romantic classic, but I was disappointed to find that the romance and love is not as moving and touching as I had expected. For one reason, the two main characters who fall in love are dislikable characters. I did not like Catherine or Heathcliff, and this made it very hard for me to enjoy the book. However, despite this, I still enjoyed this book. I do recommend it although I was disappointed."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Despite its outward appearance, Wuthering heights is not a romance story. Bronte's purpose in writing this novel was to find out whether or not her criminally-inclined brother could be forgiven. She represented her brother with Heathcliff, a character whose depth of emotion and spirit-- an almost inhuman depth, far surpassing all except Catherine I-- perhaps made possible the extenuation of the absolute evil of his vengeance. I'll say no more, Bronte's purpose was that every reader judge for himself."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is the story about the obssessive love between Catherine and Heathcliff.An eternal love that destroyed everyone who tried to destroy it, and was stronger than death"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I picked up Wuthering Heights because I was bored, and then I couldn't put it down.

It never failed to convery its primary themes; jealousy, betrayal, and revenge. At the same time, it was missing the hook that captures you and makes you care whether the characters succeed or fail. I waited for it chapter after chapter until finally I couldn't seem to feel anything for Heathcliff or Cathy. I have read other works by the Bronte sisters. And while I won't discourage anyone from reading a book they are interested in, I must warn you, if you have any illusions that this will be in some way similar to that of &quot;Jane Eyre,&quot; do not waste your time."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"...but otherwise, there's a plentiful selection of better books to read before this one. This book contained likable and despisable characters, a rather uncommon trait these days. The plot and character interaction were at times confusing, yet really didn't go anywhere significant. Remember, old and british doesn't necessarily equal good."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"No book has changed me as much as Wuthering Heights has. Its appeal for me is in its sense of otherness, something so completely removed from ordinary life. Wuthering Heights is set in a realm where ordinary morals do not apply, where love is transmitted via pain and suffering, a maelstrom of the extraordinary, which lasts for about 40 years, and then is gone. Heathcliff and Cathy must be two of the most unique figures ever created in English literature. Cathy, the spirited and vengeful heroine, who pays for her one fatal mistake with her life. Heathcliff, whose drive for revenge can only be calmed by his love for Cathy. Wuthering Heights is a microcosmos, another universe, so alien and foreign from ours. Its roughness and brutality may confuse us, but beneath the pain is love and tenderness"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte did an excellent job in writing Wuthering Heights. Each character plays an important part in the novel. The way she describes each setting makes you feel like you are really there. Heathcliff, the main character, begins the novel as a young, nice orphan child brought into a family. People treated Heathcliff like a slave when he was younger,but when he gets older he gets revenge on everyone. Catherine, the other main character, is supposed to love Heathcliff according to her, but then marries another man because of money. I think Heathcliff and Catherine should have gotten married. The setting was described beautifully. Emily described the feilds of land that the kinds would play on and the green grass blowing in the breeze. The way she set the mood and the setting the same was great. She descibe how the flowers in front of Wuthering Heights were dead to let you know how bad of man Heathcliff was. Overall it was a very good book, a little hard follow sometimes, but a good book. I enjoyed reading Wuthering Heights."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I did not find this to be a book that I would recommend to others. It was not really my type of book to read. There were two parts that I found of intrest. In the first part of the book I found it kind of funny. When Lockwood came to live on Heathcliffs' property. Lockwood expressed his wanting to be isolated, but he kept talking to Heathcliff. Then Heathcliff interupted Lockwood and said, &quot;I should not allow any one to inconvenience me, if I could hinder it-walk in!&quot; The other part I found it kind of weird. Cathy clams she does not make fun of Heatcliff,but she keeps making rude comments. Cathy says a one point, &quot;I did not mean to laugh at you.&quot; These were the only parts that I found intresting in the book. I found them intresting because of there ironic effect."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"To make my review concise:This book is about a dysfunctional family and dysfunctional relationships between people - or more accurately, about relationships that revolve around a twisted man. It doesn't do much beyond flesh out those relationships over a span of many years.I suppose this book is interesting. It is well written and definitely has characters (although for the life of me, for some reason, keeping their names and identities straight in my mind was a tiring task that I never really fully accomplished, maybe it's just me). I went into this book hoping for more plot, more story of people's lives, with the dysfunctional family elements pervasive if not along the sidelines. That's just not what it is. It's a potential tenant learning about how twisted a family is from the reminiscent eyes of a previous inhabitant. And that is really all the book is.My review here is obviously not paying attention to the book's classic status. Or the fact that it's free and creative commons, written by a woman during a timeframe where as far as I understand, that wasn't common, lest of all to go on to be considered a classic.

Not only did her writng have the power to transport you to seemingly another world, but the memorable characters and personalities make Wuthering Heights a book to remember. The charming tale takes place in windswept England on a lovely castle. Told through a narrative of an old housekeeper, the story of love and hate take place first hand. While quite unsuspecting, Mr. Lockwood, a guest of Thrushcross Grange, visits, he hears the tale of the Earnshaw family who used to live in Wuthering Heights. In a tale of backstabbing, lying, cheating, love, and hatred, he hears the tale of Hindley and Heathcliff and their sibling rivalry along with their lover Catherine who marries Hindley but is in love with Heathcliff. At the end of the book, all members of the original family are gone, and Mr. Lockwood takes note of how quiet and peaceful the grange has become. The true charm of this book are the characters. The way in which they speak is charming and brings out personality. Emily Bronte had a wit an charm about her style of writing, something that is very apparent in Wuthering Heights. While filled with quite a bit of drama, Wuthering Heights is a book that will transport you to the old English estate country and leave you with a story in which you will find entertaining as well as charmming."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book came in as I had expected it too be as well as on time!

I haven't read the others, but it is definitely my favourite so far.\\"I lingered round them, under that benign sky: watched the moths fluttering among the heath and harebells, listened to the soft wind breathing through the grass, and wondered how any one could ever imagine unquiet slumbers for the sleepers in that quiet earth.\\""},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"It's strange how often I have the experience of reading an \\"old\\" novel like this one, expecting it to be dry and boring, and find that it's anything but. You'd think I'd learn, but no. There's a reason these are called classics: people have been thinking they're really good for a long time, and they're still really good. This is the kind of book I would have gone out of my way to not read in high school, which is probably just as well. I wouldn't have appreciated it then.One thing I noticed right off the bat is that this isn't Jane Austen, which just goes to show that female British novelists of the early 1800s can be very different. Jane Austen is very funny and satirical. Emily Bronte is very serious. There are flashes of humor now and then, but she's mining the human soul, and it's dark work.This book was written in 1845, but describes fictional events that took place from the 1770s until 1801. I don't know why she placed the events in the novel so far in the past. Maybe people of the 1840s would have thought, \\"Oh, the 1770s! Yeah, that's how people behaved then.\\" The same way we would think of the 1940s, I guess. But I don't have that perspective, so I don't know what she was going for.She does some pretty complicated stuff with the narration, too. She doesn't just tell you what happened, starting at the beginning and moving on to the end. She actually starts at the end of the story, with the main narrator meeting the surviving participants in what happened 30 years before. Then she begins introducing various other narrators who describe what happened from their point of view. This really plunges you into the story, because you're not looking at it from the outside, but from the perspective of someone actually involved with the events at the time. You're in the moment and in the place. I was impressed by such sophisticated storytelling in what I think was her first novel, and in 1845.There are only a handful of characters in the story, and each one is sharply delineated. You can just picture these people. Bronte has a knack for apt description. I was glad this wasn't one of those novels that describes every nail in the floor, but what description there is is always telling and to the point. She's not just filling up pages like some authors ::cough:: Dickens ::cough:: sometimes do.The plot is simple enough. Heathcliff is a boy of unknown origins who is brought up in the same family as the girl Catherine. They're inseparable companions. However, when they grow up, Catherine marries someone else. That's it. But the consequences and the complexity of the interactions of these two characters with each other and with everyone around them are amazing. Bronte wrings every drop out of the situation. At some times, you get the feeling, \\"Wait: you mean, if he had heard the rest of what she'd said, none of this would have happened?\\" But that's what life is like sometimes. It depends on a single word or look or gesture.I think that people of the time would have been pretty scandalized by some of the goings-on. People play pretty loose with \\"the sanctity of marriage\\", for instance. And I think it would have absolutely terrified women about getting pregnant. Everybody dies in childbirth in this book.I also think this has to be one of the first novels that has an actual sociopath as a main character. Dropping someone like Heathcliff into ordinary polite English society is like tossing a hand grenade into a cricket match. The effects are devastating, and all the more so because people don't expect it and have no idea how to deal with it.To modern audiences, there are other parts that are at least as disturbing. The idea of first cousins marrying seems to be perfectly fine with these people - in fact, one character does it twice - but probably gives readers today a Ewww feeling. And the casual way that Heathcliff can beat people, or kidnap them, or lock them in their rooms for weeks, all without even the mention of the possibility of some kind of police or legal reckoning is chilling.Bronte shows a perfection of wording that is astonishing. She always selects the right word to describe even the most commonplace of actions, such as walking or talking. It's an unobtrusive thing, but she words scenes with a precision that is admirable.Ultimately, this is a fascinating novel following events from a simple source that eventually engulf and destroy almost everyone connected with them, like a slow and remorseless tidal wave.Highly recommended"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"A must read...not because \\"Bella\\" says you should. But because this story is just so powerful. Aside from that one guy you can't ever understand, it takes you to another time with language that is so much like woven yarn."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"After reading Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte, I thought I should continue in the same vein with Wuthering Heights, written by her sister Emily Bronte. But whereas Jane Eyre is a story of love rewarded and hopes fulfilled, Wuthering Heights so far is an unremittingly grim tale of cruelty and revenge in two related families.Structurally, the book is a frame tale within a frame tale: Mr. Lockwood, the narrator who introduces the story, is soon replaced by the voice of Nelly Dean, the faithful servant who relates to Mr. Lockwood the family history that has led to the current misery. To my view, Nelly is the strongest and most believable character. Most of the rest of the characters in the story seem overdrawn. They are also hard to keep straight, partly because names are shared between generations; sometimes I think a family tree might be helpful.Considering that Wuthering Heights was written about 1845, I was expecting more difficulty with language than I actually encountered. There are few speeches in a heavy Yorkshire dialect which are daunting, and apparently even the author at one point considered revising them to make them intelligible to a broader audience. And there are some isolated words which seem to have changed their meaning over the years; but for the most part the book is quite readable.I have so far read about two-thirds of the text. I am plodding through to the end, hoping that there may be some ray of light shed before the end of the book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"A great classic read.

It's extremely well-written but very depressing."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"When Mr. Earnshaw, a man of means, brings a dark, ill-mannered foundling into his home he has no idea that his one good deed will alter the course of his family forever.Taken into the Earnshaw home only to be cast out abruptly, Heathcliff is intent to avenge himself on those who have done him wrong through any means possible. Even his oldest friend and companion Catherine is not beyond reproach.Lockwood knows nothing of the scandal and unrest that surrounds Wuthering Heights when he leases Thrushcross Grange from Heathcliff for a season. Scandalized by the residents of Wuthering Heights and shocked by the blatant disregard for common courtesy and propriety, he soon endeavors to unearth the whole story from his housekeeper, Nelly Dean.The story Nelly reveals is one of unresolved passion, haunting obsession, and a connection that even death cannot deny in Wuthering Heights (1847) by Emily Bront.Wuthering Heights is Bront's only novel.Groundbreaking for its time, Wuthering Heights is a divisive novel that is more often regarded with love or hate rather than indifference.Some claim Bront's gothic novel is a sweeping romance that spans not just years but death itself. Written in the first person with a framing story around the main drama of Catherine and Heathcliff's doomed relationship, Bront creates an evocative story filled with Yorkshire dialect and harsh lanscapes.At the same time, this book is a study in human cruelty. Catherine and Heathcliff are horrible people and, even while proving their love for one another, they do unspeakable things.If you can get past the basic meanness of almost all of the characters, Wuthering Heights is an atmospheric story filled with chills and menace sure to linger after the last page is finished.Possible Pairings: Frost by Marianna Baer, Plain Kate by Erin Bow, The Wicked and the Just by J.

I love classic historical fiction/historical romance, and I was hoping to find the same thing in this novel that I had found in Pride and Prejudice, and Jane Eyre (written by Emily Bronte's sister, and way better). I really don't get why so many people rate this as one of their favorites. For me, there needs to be at least one character that I care about. These characters are all unlikeable. That's not to say the book isn't worth reading. it was interesting, and well written, but it could have been so much better."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Very good book.

I have not read any studies on the book, so I don't know even if this is meant to be one of the themes, but that was my impression.I would definitely read this book again one day."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I last read this in high school, and I have to say, revisiting the classics has been a great addition to my summer reading list this year!

Although the movie was really good for a classic black and white, I must say that the book (like a lot of other book-based movies) was better than the movie. However, the movie did follow the storyline fairly well, unlike most other books. Furthermore, as somber a setting that this book outlines, it is a classic that I will read again. I loved the story, and definitely would suggest this as an educational literature piece."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I believe Wuthering Heights to be just an average book hardly capable of any noteriety. The book seems to be the same old story of a vengeful man who takes his anger and hate out on other people in a useless effort to please himself. This deep inner hatred results from the untimely death of Heathcliff's lifetime love, Catherine. The reason I gave this book a three was because it was so difficult to follow. Bronte used the same names and the same situations over and over and I could never understand who she was talking about. The theme of Man vs Man was overly developed with the continuing acts of hatred from Heathcliff. I reccomend you read this book if you want to avenge something or you withold a deep hatred for someone. EMILY SMITH"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a strange ,but powerful book. Revenge is most likely the dominent theme in the second half of the book. Even though Heathcliff abandons his plan for vengence. There is no traditional happy ending for the principal characters in the book. It was also brought out that it was a spiritual love rather than a physical one the binds Heathcliff and Cahterine together. There is also a theory of crime and punishment. All the characters sin in some way and are punished, with the exception of cathy and Hareton. Another would be conflict between good and evil. The difference between the feeling that Catherine has for Heathcliff andthe one she has for Edgar is that she responds to Edgar only on the more superficial and shallow level. She seems aware that this love is far more important than the civilized and wordly advantages that Edgar offers. Despite this she goes against her natural instinct and marries him anyways. This action turns the good in Heathcliff to evil, taking revenge on everyone except Cahterine. This tears her up and her only option that she looks for is death. After many years he finds his revenge dying away and prepares himself for death and reuniting with the spirit of Catherine soon after. Love is the only element that remains constant. Everything else withers away. It boils down to nothing on earth matters ,but when we are dead and merge with the Almighty Being then shall we see our greatest satisfaction. The power of good is stronger than the power of evil and will eventually prevail."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I had to read Wuthering Heights in my 8th Grade English Class last year, and I thought that the book was brilliant! It is filled with love, passion, deceit, greed, and everything in between. A word to the wise. Be willing to spend some time with this book. You will thank me. Wuthering Heights isn't something that you just read over the weekend, you really have to put some time into it. This has to be one of the most complex books I've read in a while, and its complexities is what makes it brilliant"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Very often Wuthering Heights is represented as being purely a great love story between Catherine and Heathcliff. This, in my opinion, is far from the truth. It is a classic book and there is certainly a great deal of passion in it, but it is about a great deal more than just the love of these two charachters. It is also about the wild moors and the people they produces, about how evil propagates itself and how ultimately a little bit of compassion can overcome years of hatred and mistrust. Read this book, but not just because you think it's going to be a beautiful love story. Read it because it provides an insigth into love, life and the whole human condition."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is a man's romance novel. Heathcliff gets to carry out the role that almost every guy wants to play when he's really in love but it doesn't work. Katherine can't wait for him even though she loves him so she marries some anemic loser. But, instead of whining about it Heathcliff does something about it, thereby makeing life miserable for everyone (including himself) but by doing so keeps his love alive, instead of just moving on. An excellent example of perseverence no matter what the cost and despite the fact that the outcome cannot be successful"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"There's no redeemable quality in either Heathcliff or Catherine. The more I read the more I despised them, the more I didn't really care what kind of havoc they wrecked on each other or their relationship. Their relationship is the epitome of codependency and somehow this is supposed to be regarded as one of the great love stories of our time. How masochistic are we?"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The achievement of Charlotte, Emily, and Anne is an unprecedented phenomenon in English literature. I've always thought of what lessons could modern parents learn from the raising of the Bronte sisters, in years when education was not a recognized priority in women's life, and yet no girls of the Bronte family was left behind. Amazing, wasn't it?It is unnatural to review this book without comparing it to Jane Eyre, another masterpiece of the Bronte sisters. I tend to put both of the two book in high rank, regardless of critiques from different directions. Jane Eyre is admirable for the ambition that is high but not wild, the emotion that is heated but not burned, the action that is courageous but not aggressive, and the totality of natural elegance and inner nobality. While Wuthering Heights is the opposite to the extreme. In WH, the ambition is wild but not high, the emotion is burned before it get's comfortably heated, and the action is often violently aggressive yet not courageous. The boundaries of humanity is ignored, the nobality is not admired or even hated, and the anger is allowed to vent at any cost.Said that, it is a great worth to read for the craftsman of the storyline and the superior language skills. It depicts deviated, obsessive, violent, and destructive personalities that need psychiatric help in my opinion. If it is just for the sake of reading a good novel, I would give WH and JE the same score. However, due to the fact one can not realistically seperate the entertaining effect from educating effect of any literal work, I would like to save the highest score for the truely and entirely best."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Nowadays, if we want a good edition of this strangest and strongest of British novels, deeply haunting and intensely poetical in its rather dark and eerie otherness, we have a variety of options, both text-oriented editions or context-oriented (\\"study\\") ones.To name them all (see my overall review on the Norton Critical Fourth Edition (Dunn)): Oxford World's Classics (Patsy Stoneman), Penguin Classics (Pauline Nestor), Oneworld Classics, among the text-oriented ones;Longman Cultural (Alison Booth), Broadview Press (Beth Newman), Norton Critical Third or Fourth ((Sale)/Dunn) among the context-oriented ones.But when it comes to choose a good-looking hardcover volume, it turns out to be an impossible task to get the right text with an adequate annotation (it seems as if nobody cared for it!).Oxford's World's Classics Special Centennial pocket hardcover issue, now very hard to come by, is a most lovable volume and features the Clarendon reference text, but we add a rather unperceptive and dull Introduction to an absolute absence of notes to get as a result a perfectly useless edition.Barnes & Noble is a really nice hardcover, together with a good Introduction (Daphne Merkin) and a very good annotation (Tatiana Holway), but theirs, while a reliable and well-known text (Haworth Edition, 1900), is a 1850 second edition text, that is to say, Charlotte's highly tampered-with posthumous edition, further disfigured at the hands of the Publisher. Many people think -as I do- that thistext-form is a no-go.Now we come to the Franklin Mint 1979 edition (and its version for Oxford University). It's a very beautiful hardcover volume, leatherette on boards that really looks at least like bonded leather, with all edges gold-gilt, with an excellent125 gram per square meter almost opaque paper (without mineral loading);an excellent quality two-color printing with 11/14 pt Linotype Garamond type and ornate chapter initials. It features the beautiful if not daring Alan Reingold five double-page lithographs with its photographic-like impact...And then what? The text -forgetting for a moment Clarendon and its derivatives-is a very good 1847 first edition text (in the line of SCHORER's, Moser's and Daiches's editions), and it features -for the first time in the novel history- a full and right footnote glossing of the dialectal tirades.Any misgivings? O...yes! Two little ones:a) the Charlotte prefaces should come at the end of the novel rather than at the beginning, not to condition our reading, andb) there is no modern good introduction to the novel (and there were by then a great deal many very good to excellent ones from where to choose); and a very big one:c) the absence of any note whatsoever other than the dialect glosses.Now, it's up to you to choose (and, should you go for this, do a little looking around to get the best preserved copy within your budget).Within its constraints, it's a very nice book and an interesting buy!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"How odd that Amazon does not consolidate the comments on the various editions of this book from different publishers.I read this book out of a certain sense of obligation -- I'd been reading other 19th century English literature and, with some trepidation, picked up Wuthering Heights to complete the set. The book was wonderful, with fully developed if sometimes quixotic characters, and rapid and often unexpected plot twists. The prose is denser than, say, Jane Austen, but not as bad as the stereotypical gothic novel. The main character, Heathcliff, is famously attractive to women but, as a male reader, I thought he was a thoroughly bad egg. Worthy of discussion, though, especially with women who have read it and are likely to have a different opinion."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Though this story overall had a dark essence to it, I believe that an unrelenting passion was shared between Catherine and Heathcliff. Of course, in my view, both characters are selfish and share a fury in great magnitudes. But then again, these similar characteristics are what make them such a match made in heaven...or more accurately, a match made in hell. Even with the hatred, I still believe this is a great love story. Love can be shrouded in varying shades, from happy gay tones to the more darkening hues.The greatest burst of sunshine in this dreary novel would probably come fron Nelly Dean, who was practically the only character with a head on her shoulders. Just the fact that she was able to serve with such a crazed family for so long and come out sane in the end is and indication of her strong, noble personality.In this story, the line between hatred and love is precariously thin."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"If you ever find yourself trying to read this novel, please do it with an open mind. I started out with some very narrow tunnel vision and gradually, I accepted the fact that this story is about 18th century British Hicks. And when you figure this out, the story unravels into something absolutely amazing. You find yourself drawn to Heathcliff, even if he is troubled and deranged. You find yourself wanting a happy ending and wanting a little more from the characters. AND, Heathcliff does surpass Hamlet or Othello as the most troubled romantic lead character of all time. Long Live Heathcliff!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This story was a bit hard to follow. It skips around a bit and if not followed closely, can become confusing. Wuthering Heights is set in the late 1700's to early 1800's. It is centered around two people madly in love. Catherine puts her love for Heathcliff aside to marry the wealthy Edgar Linton. Heathcliff cannot deal with this rejection and runs away. A few years pass and he returns. Upon his return their lives are turned upside down because of their unyielding love. Heathcliff brings revenge upon anyone that had wronged him prior to his leaving. This story shows the destruction that can come from uncontrollable love. Revenge, jealousy, and death are all results of a love that was never given the chance to fully grow.There are some similarities between the author's life and the story as well. One that is immediately recognizable is that the female characters all die after giving birth, as Bronte's mother did. Another similarity is the drug addictions. Bronte's brother was addicted to opium and had a drinking problem. Hindley, Catherine's brother, takes to drinking after his wife dies."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I thought this book was tragic in that two people who obviously love each other very much and have so much in common that they actually refer to themselves as the other person, end up spending most of their lives in other relationships trying to make the other lover jealous or hating their choices. Ultimately, Heathcliff's desire for revenge was hard for me to understand because I suppose I have never loved anyone enough to go that far. And the end was especially tragic because he actually begged Cathy's ghost to haunt him for the rest of his life: &quot;...drive me mad! Only do not leave me in this dark alone where I cannot find you.&quot;"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights tells the story of the impossible love between Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff, a foundling adopted by Catherine's father. Wuthering Heights is the name of the spacious dwelling of the family, located on the desolate moorlands of England. After the death of Mr. Earnshaw, Heathcliff finds himself constantly humiliated by Catherine's brother Hindley. When Heathcliff assumes wrongfully that his ever growing love for Catherine is unanswered he sees no reason to stay and leaves the moorlands in search of better luck. Returning years later as a wealthy man he sees an opportunity to get revenge on his stepbrother, but neglects the intolerable pain he causes to his one an only love. Caught in a spiral of vengeance Heathcliff ruins everything once dear to him.The sole novel Emily Bront (1818-1848) has written in her short life will undoubtedly continue to stand the test of time. Although I myself am not a big fan of novels that write Romance with a capital, this story has touched me in a way that very few have succeeded in before. The powerful description of the unrecognized energy between the two main characters is simply overwhelming. Although Emily was -in the true spirit of Victorian novelists- clearly not afraid of adding an enormous list of extremities to the character of Heathcliff, this embodiment of boundless revenge and pure fatherly despotism is one of the strongest characters ever created in English literature. The fact that not a lot of people will classify this novel as \\"the greatest love story ever told\\" is most likely due to the never ending grimness of the tale. This darkness is nicely illustrated by the high number of deaths weaved into this family epos. But then again, love is not always as nice as in the movies... or is it?For a real romantic this is truly a book to be treasured forever."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I had avoided Wuthering Heights because I thought it was purely a love story and a corny one at that. Pleasantly surprised is a tremendous understatement. This was fantastic. There is no scene - in the book at least - with Heathcliff and Catherine running into each other's arms across the moors. That must have been from a sappy movie version. In fact, there are no scenes like that - no mindless romantic drivel at all. The preface of my copy actually said that the book was not that successful during Bronte's time because the characters were altogether \\"too odiously and abominably pagan to suit the tastes of even the most shameless class of English readers\\" (as stated by the Quarterly Review).It is certainly dark. Wuthering Heights is the story of Heathcliff who, spurned by Catherine, wreaks havoc on the lives of everyone who has ever had anything to do with him, covering three generations. Is it a love story? Well, yes ... sort of. Catherine did passionately love Heathcliff (as he did her) but nothing ever comes of that, at least in the traditional sense. The extent of Wuthering Heights being a love story to me is the inevitable question of \\"If Catherine had married Heathcliff would things have been different?\\" Given the almost demoniacal personality Heathcliff bears throughout the book, I hardly think so.If you have only ever seen the movie, you have only heard half of the story - literally - and that is extremely \\"brightened\\" from the novel's intrinsic dark and spooky overtones. This is one of those books when finished, I found myself wandering around saying, \\"Wow, that was a good book\\". I even waited a few days before starting another."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte's literary masterpiece proves a Gothic novel of classic proportions, with characters whose twisted passions etch themselves upon the reader's mind over successive readings. Set in the rugged Yorkshire of her childhood, WUTHERING HEIGHTS depicts a literary canvas of desolate landscape, where Nature ranges from fury in winter storms to indifference to human endeavor. Over the course of three decades we gradually learn the strange personal history between the Earnshaws of WH and the Lintons of Thrushcross Grange. This grimly violent tale of human passion and supernatural revenge reveals the devastating effect of a dark-skinned foundling lad who is adopted into the family of a kind country squire. With this charitable act Mr. Earnshaw unwittingly introduces restless energy and unbridled emotions into the placid neighborhood--ultimately destroying the decaying dynamics of relations between neighbors. Genealogies are rewritten as unleashed jealousy threatens the flow of lives yet unborn.Recounted in extensive flashback sequences by a faithful servant, Nelly Dean, to a recuperating new tenant at the Grange, this twisted story is also taken up by subsequent narrators--since no single character witnesses very event at both houses. Two gentlemen chose to reside in a remote region, to escape wordly distractions, but the arrival of a young, gypsy-like orphan, Heathcliff, proves the catalyst to disrupt their comfortable social decadence. His passion for Cathy, the wild daughter in his new family, would rule him for life--ruining himfor Life itself. Neither teen could live without the other, although she defied her heart; in so doing she destroyed the lives and peace of mind of innocent relatives and neighbors.Pursued by his private demons of despair Heathcliff knows no peace or valid existence apart from her, tormenting everyone in his intense, constricted social sphere. From foundling to Master, his morose moods and vindictive nature throw a pall upon both houses, as he conspires to control that which is not rightuflly his. All because he was denied sanctioned union with Cathy, his soul mate. Sowing a legacy of vice and despair, Heathcliff privately strives for reunion--not closure--with the shade of his other half. Chasing shadows he morbidly controls the destiny of those involved at Wuthering Heights, threatening to engulf even the detached outsider. A Gothic Classic for all ages."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Having had this book as an assignment in college.... I must say the years have given me a deeper appreciation of it. I really tripped my way through it as a freshman. But now over ten years later I am liking this one more and more!The story centers around poor Heathcliff and his sister/ loved one, Catherine. Heathcliff has lived a life of struggle and woe. He has been disadvantaged and mistreated. Even when he is saved by Catherine's father and brought to live with them he is still, disadvantaged. He is tortured by Hindley, Catherine's brother and made to live a life of pain and anguish.When Catherine leaves home and marries Edgar Linton. Heathcliff become even more tortured as the person he loves is taken from him.This story is one filled with regret, longing and revenge. We see Emily Bronte's excellent rendering of the corruptness of human nature... and in Heathcliff we can see a human going to the depths of depravity and hatred. The scarey thing is that we can... if we look hard enough see a little of ourselves in him too.The novel is dark and foreboding, just like the windswept moors it takes place on. The mood is expertly rendered by this genius author.When you read it allow yourself to be swept away by it's darkness and get caught up in the atmosphere.That was the draw for me and I'm sure you'll will feel it too.Excellent Book!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is the classical novel dealing with undying love and loss. Set on the moors of mid-nineteenth century England it tells the story of a love between the orphan boy Heathcliffe and Katherine. Katherine and Heathcliffe fall madly in love with each other, but there love is not to be as both end up marrying other people. However, their love for each other continues even after their marriages and after their deaths. This is a love that cannot be stopped by death and endures forever.In Wuthering Heights, Emily Bronte wrote of one the classic novels of the nineteenth century. Her characters are well done and the story moves along at a pace that draws in the reader and won't let go. The story is told through the eyes of Katherine and Heathcliffe's nanny, Mrs. Dean, as she tells the story to man who has rented out part of Heathcliffe's property. Mrs. Dean's perspective is always humorous and one almost wonders how much of it has been changed to cover over her own role in the events. It is a testimony to her characters that by the end of the book you will end up hating some of the characters. I personally could not stand, Isabell's son Linton - he was whiny, selfish, pain in the a*s and I was routing for Hareton to beat up him up.The only slight problem with this book is it was written in the old style popular during the nineteenth century - at times this makes the reading some what ponderous. In particular, Joseph's dialogue is a labor and in order to understand it I had to almost read it out loud.Wuthering Heights is a wonderful story about two people who love each other so much that nothing can stop their passion. It is a story as old as time and that will endure until the end of time."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Not to be hyperbolic, but Wuthering Heights is one of the most well known and critically acclaimed novels in the English language, and there is precious little that I can add to the volumes already written on it. It is the story of two British households inhabiting the wilds of the Yorkshire moors, and illuminates the destructive undercurrents that come to uproot and ultimately destroy both clans. At the center of the tale stand the headstrong Catherine Earnshaw and the brooding Heathcliff, one of the most celebrated romantic pairings in world literature. Treated abominably in his youth at the hands of both households and having lost his love to another man, Heathcliff descends into a horrifying abyss of brutality and revenge still harrowing to encounter nearly two centuries after publication. Although the novel progresses at a leisurely pace compared to modern works, it presents the most complete and thrilling portrait of passion ever set forth in the English language. Passion is not a synonym for love in Wuthering Heights-it is an unbridled conflagration consuming all rationality and rendering its victims ravenous beasts, terrifying and magnificent in their hunger. When Catherine declares that her soul will roam the moors forever after her death, even the most confirmed atheist will find himself believing her- passion is such a billowing force in Wuthering Heights that the human body is convincingly rendered a prison of something altogether greater. At the same time, the primordial forces the book presents never become exhausting, contained as they are within a highly unique narrative framework channeling them through characters secondary to the main line of action. For those patient and courageous enough to immerse themselves in its richly textured reality, Wuthering Heights presents a world boarding on the mythic, and it comes highly recommended to the imaginative reader."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Perhaps it's the winsome imagery, perhaps the profoundly real characters one switches between loving and hating, or maybe even the dry humor that is the style of the British, but Wuthering Heights is my all time favorite book. How can words possibly do it justice...the only way to surely judge it is by reading it. Never before have I been so moved by a story; it might be Heathcliff's overflowing love for Catherine that drives him mad yet, ingenious in his revenge, or Cathy's shallow duty to society that denies her the power to be true to herself (I believe the main point of this novel is to not deny your feelings; go with what you feel rather than what should be), but I always find myself reading it on days I need to be cheered up or am really lusting after a good book. If one's not paying attention, you know, one of those days where you just read to take your mind off of something, it can get rather dull and confusing (the diction isn't as simple as say...Ethan Frome), but if you're concentrating, Bronte's words are so amazingly beautiful, it's hard to put it down. When read aloud it sounds like Shakespeare, and I like Emily's work a lot more than Charlotte's, for some reason. Gothic literature is so peculiar and wonderful: a class of it's own, and she really masters it. At the same time she avoids stereotypes and entertaining happenings (the spectre that appears to the somewhat insecure Lockwood early on foretells the chilling story, while at the same time hinting there is something deeply wrong about Wuthering Heights that needs to be corrected), actually writing the book with a purpose behind it. All the characters have very cool qualities about them; all have the potential to be irritating, but hey, we're all human. By imperfecting her people she has perfected the novel, and I'm so thankful I've had the privilege to read such a piece of art. This book forever remains with me; it's a part of me."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Oh, where to begin? Yes, some people complain about the melodramatic (some even say soap-operatic) quality of this book, but it is simply wonderful. It's hard to find a book about the dark side of love, and this book (which offered, perhaps, the first \\"modern\\" character in Heathcliff) has the dark side of love in spades. The story is centered around the Earnshaw and Linton families, who occupy the Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange estates, respectively. While it would give away many important and poignant moments to go more in-depth, rest assured that there is betrayal, violence, and passion. The character of Heathcliff may very well be the best character in literature (in my opinion, at least). His inner conflict between vengeance and love is tragically human, and the fact that he knows that he is doing the wrong thing but cannot stop his drive for vengeance makes him that much more human. This book is excellent. Maybe the best book I've ever read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"but I did not really enjoy it. I understand why it is a classic: Miss Bronte delves into the depths of the human psyche and recounts the agonies of lost love and the despair and cruelty it drives Heathcliff to. She describes the deep bond of love between Cathy and Heathcliff, a bond which is stronger than death and causes as much pain as it does pleasure, and as much agony as comfort. What I cannot understand is how people actually enjoy reading it. I do not mind a lack of action in a book: Pride and Prejudice is one of my favorites and contains far less action than this book. However, Pride and Prejudice was a pleasant read because it had pleasant overtones and a pleasant ending and pleasant characters. This book, however, has nasty overtones, an ending barely passable as neutral, and nasty characters. Most of the main characters were self-centered fiends: Cathy loved her friend more than her husband and made it known to all, Joesph was a foul hypocrite, Linton was a wretched weakling, Hindley a abusive father, Heathcliff an evil fiend, etc. The story itself was an awful tale of lost love leading to a collapse of characer and it's resulting consequences (all bad) on the people in contact with Heathcliff. Why people celebrate this of all love stories is beyond me. Why on earth would people hold up as an example of true love the story of Cathy and Heathcliff? A story which runs as follows: Cathy and Heathcliff are in love. Cathy marries someone else because Heathcliff has a low rank. Heathcliff causes jealousy for Cathy's husband. Cathy dies, and Heathcliff nearly goes insane and spends the rest of his life mercilessly torturing those around him. Someone explain to me why this is held up as a great example of love? Give me Miss Bronte's sister (Charlotte Bronte)'s Jane Eyre any day over this. Jane Eyre is just such a story as should be held up and shown to the world as an example of true love, not Wuthering Heights. Wuthering Heights is an example of love gone horribly wrong, not perfect love. I do not think that it was the author's intent at all to have this lifted up as an example of what love should be like, as many have mistaken her to have done. She was simply showing the power of love: that it has both the power to do both great good and great evil. That is the strength of this book.Overall grade: A"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"If the craft of writing appeals to you, this is a gem. There is only one word out of place (one pronoun with an ambiguous antecedent). The story is told from multiple points of view and includes a variety of sad and sordid relationships but ends with a vision of love nearly unequaled in literature.One overarching theme is the relationship between love and control. As we know today, control is often manfested in anger but also in eating disorders. Yes, two of the main characters would be called anorexic today. Emily Bronte herself probably died of anorexia--her coffin was less than 20 inches wide.This is romantic in the traditional sense: Wuthering Heights emphasizes emotion. And when emotional people are thwarted, they turn angry. Add love, jealousy, class conflict, sibling rivalry, supernatural dreams, and the wild moors of Yorkshire, you've got a gothic novel that has been often imitated but seldom duplicated.Because of the multiple narrators, there is one warning. Many of the episodes are told more than once from different points of view. In each case, though, the perspectives are so different that you might not even realize at first that you are reading about the same event.If you want to read a fascinating story and want a sense of how a great story should be told, read Wuthering Heights."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"A TRULY EXCELLENT EDITION of this strangest and strongest of English novels,hauntingly beautiful in its impassionate poetry,a novel that reads us instead of the other way round,more about important questions than about too trivial answers.The text is roughly the same than Clarendon's reference one, without correcting the error at the beginning of Chapter 16 (we get \\"inhabitants\\" for \\"inhabitant\\", and the reason for NOT emending both 1847 and 1850 readings, although duly explained in a note, is most incredible). The punctuation is even a bit heavier than Clarendon's(I fear a bit too heavy for American habits) and the implied two-volume division with independent chapter numbering looks as funny and cumbersome as in Oxford's.The Introduction, although shorter than Stoneman's for Oxford, is excellent nonetheless. So are the notes, that more often than not give full quotation of the references involved, while Oxford gives only the references. Material production is as bad as you fear and then some, as regards paper quality and binding: pages will get brown in only five years (and Oxford's don't fare much better). Printing quality, on the other hand, is fair-to-good.Don't miss the very first page (the one about Emily Bront life),then read Lucasta Miller's preface,skip both the excellent Pauline Nestor Introduction and the controversial\\"Charlotte's materials\\" (the Biographical Notice and the Preface to the New),and -giving an attentive glance to the Genealogical Tree- go to the TEXT (perusing the notes).Afterwards you will do well to read the previously skipped material, and, perhaps some months later, to peruse the excellent Bibliography.IN SUMMARY: as far as text, Introduction and notes are concerned, no other edition is better. Material production and durability, on the other side, are even a little worse than Oxford World's Classics.Have a haunting, unforgettable read!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is one book I've read over and over again, to understand how it appears to other people. Whomsoever have I met consider it to be rude and strange at first. What this book means to me is unsurpassed literature. It depicts rough love- a love that is as wild as the moors of England. Wuthering Heights breeds initself a &quot;horror of darkness&quot;, we sometimes breathe in our lives. The love existing between Heathcliff- the most loved villians of all time and Catherine stands strong. This book is about a stranger entering a household where he is rejected, and during this course betrays the one solitary feling in his heart- not being his love for Catherine, but compassion. The other half of the story reaches a point where Heathcliff takes his sweet revenge. There are no answers to questions like: Should a character like Heathcliff exist or not? I do not know. This is a masterpiece in literature depicting love, innocence lost, friendship, forgiveness and above all acceptance. Unfortunately, this was the first and last book of Emily Bronte. Wish there were more novels like this one!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights is a novel that creates a love story between Heathcliff and Catherine. This is not however a regular love story. Bronte's ability to create real emotions puts Wuthering Heights in a category far from a &quot;Cinderella&quot; story. Bronte's remarkable ability to conceive almost twisted stories can be seen not to far into the story. It can be seen once Mr. Earnshaw brings home Heathcliff, basically treats Heathcliff as his son and neglects his birth son, and Catherine begins to love Heathcliff that the story will be far from regular. Bronte uses these unique ironies to create detailed stories.In this book Bronte uses her ability to mimic real human reactions in her characters come about. Such as when Mr. and Mrs. Earnshaw die Hindley, their birth son, forces Heathcliff to leave because of his hatred towards him. Hindley knew his father loved Heathcliff more than him and he couldn't stand it. Heathcliff leaving causes problems between. It's Ironic that when Heathciff comes home after three years because of his love for Catherine, she has already married another, Edgar Linton.Emily Bronte's story obviously wasn't that of a regular love story. Not too long after Heathcliff comes home Catherine dies. Heathcliff becomes filled with anger and seeks revenge. He causes pain to all that have hurt him or are related to those that hurt them. Although Bronte didn't create a storybook love story she does end it, in a way, like a love story should end. The lovers are of course united in death. I liked this story by Emily Bronte because it wasn't just a regular love story with a happy ending. Although it did end with the lovers together, it is hardly a &quot;Cinderella&quot; story and the plat twist and intricacies make it a memorable story."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Reading Wuthering Heights is like a journey into a dream abound with entangled relationships, bitter vengeance, and how the innocent heirs from feuded families struggle to escape the macabre legacy of the past. The person who unraveled the history behind Wuthering Heights was Lockwood, a new tenant of the Thrushcross Grange who was forced to seek shelter one night at Wuthering Heights, the home of his landlord Heathcliff.Heathcliff was kidnapped and shipped to England, grew up under the roof of the Earnshaws. Old Earnshaw took a liking of the young Heathcliff while his son Hindley persistently and insidiously grumbled long string of tales against him and treated him like a house servant after the old Earnshaw passed away. At Wuthering Heights the young Heathcliff cultivated a consummate bonding with Catherine Earnshaw who later on betrayed him and married Edgar Linton.LoveThe novel's pivot tends to focus on the power of the central relationship between Catherine Earnshaw-Linton and Heathcliff. However dark and vindictive the novel might have turned out, the work's attraction, as a love story is not difficult to extract. Catherine loved Heathcliff because he was more herself than she was. Their souls were made of the same materials. Her soul, her heart, and her conscience reproved and convinced her that it was wrong to marry Linton, though Heathcliff might appear to be an unreclaimed, uncultivated creature, which would degrade her. In her final words to Heathcliff, the embittered Catherine Earnshaw writhed in torment. Here the novel has attained to the fullness the celebration of such transcendent love, which has surpassed the bounds of mundanity and death, despite the fact that their reunion was marked by dejection, regret, and bitterness. To Heathcliff the entire world was such a dreadful conviction of memoranda that he had lost his beloved Catherine Earnshaw, even though her daughter Cathy asserted that nobody would love him nor cry for him when he died.VengeanceHeathcliff's eye-for-an-eye vengeance visited upon the next generation. To revenge on Hindley Earnshaw's being acrimonious to him, Heathcliff determined to make Hindley's son Hareton a brute. He never taught him how to read or write, never rebuked him for any bad habit and never led him a single step toward virtue. When Heathcliff later became master of Wuthering Heights, he reduced Hareton to a mere house servant and deprived him of any wages. Edgar's daughter Cathy was forced to marry Heathcliff's sickly son Linton who braced the brawl of the previous generation by reviving how Cathy's mother had betrayed the man she loved for her father Edgar Linton. Through his son Heathcliff meant to usurp Edgar Linton's property at Thrushcross Grange and confiscated Cathy's fortune. The heirs (Cathy Linton, Hareton Earnshaw, and Linton) strived to escape from the bitter rift of the previous generation. The second half of the novel (volume ii) somewhat signifies such restoration of order and balance in this second generation.Dream/Stream-of-ConsciousnessThe appearance of Catherine Earnshaw's ghost in the early part of the novel proves to be such an appropriate notion to set the tone of Wuthering Height. The house servant only proved the house was haunted at the expense of the new tenant Lockhood, the ghost also challenged the limits of life. Wuthering Heights as a whole conveys a sense of vagueness and ambiguous plausibility. The notion of dream proved to be a significant source of understanding as both Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff envisaged their happiness in dreams, and Catherine articulated the dreams' informing power to Ellen Dean, who narrated the story to Lockwood over the span of a night at Heathcliff's abode. The warped sense of time, the geographical remoteness, and social aloofness contribute to a dreamlike, stream-of-conscious setting. Such dreamlike setting offers an uncensored realm, free of logic and boundaries, to the transgression of identity, sexuality, violence, and vengeance.\\"May you not rest, as long as I am living. You said I killed you - haunt me, then.\\" The book obviates a transcendent love that surpasses grief and death. It is meant to be haunting. 4.5 stars.2004 (1)"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Several years ago, tired of reading the latest novels, I decided after a few forays into classic literature that maybe I should devote more time to them. After all, anything hailed as a \\"great literary work\\" by millions of people has to be good, right?I'm glad this wasn't the first classic I picked up, because I never would have continued reading them. The book itself isn't all that thick, which while I prefer thick, I was grateful it wasn't in this case. It is a book about torment. Everyone in it is in a perpetual state of plain, downright torment. And the kicker is they bring it on themselves. Reading it I felt bad for Heathcliff as a child and sympathised with his plight. The fireworks begin after Heathcliff returns from some unnamed place or places with millions in the bank. The apple of his eye is the wishy-washy (I just can't come up with a more fitting term for so wretched a woman) Catherine, who can't make up her mind what to do throughout the book until her dying breath. Thank God that happened.When I read a book I generally try to find a connection with one of the characters, someone who might share the same views as I would or who might take the same action as I would in certain circumstances, but I'm sorry to say I couldn't find a single one. I found myself more or less taking the side of Edgar, although he wasn't very enjoyable either. As for Heathcliff I felt like reaching into the book, smacking him around a few good hours while screaming \\"Get over it!\\" Wuthering Heights is filled to bursting with detestable people doing deplorable things for no other reason than greed, selfishness, and what must be some kind of masochistic desire for misery. And Heathcliff is the King of Pain in this one. I felt actual relief at his passing as I would that of a rabid dog.This would be a one star review, but for the last 40 pages where at least some semblence of hope and happiness comes to this stupid book, something it was completely devoid of throughout the rest of it. It's a wonder half of England didn't commit suicide out of severe depression after reading it when it was first released. Even more troubling is that the up and coming youth who read this tend to really believe it's a classic \\"love story\\". Heaven help us.Want torturous love but with actual hope and happiness sprinkled through it? Try \\"War and Peace\\" by Tolstoy. Leave this one on the shelf, unless you like reasons to take sedatives that is."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I'm in genuine awe. Just like the master painters of old, Emily Bronte is a master of the imagination, putting pen to paper and creating a legend."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is definitely worth a re-read. Tho most of us read it in school itis worth reading again. In my opinion it's one of the best ever written. Read the backgroundof the Brontes and you will appreciate the worth of this novel."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte wrote a novel that is both rough and sweet at the same time. This novel is fantastic in its voice. Mostly it is told through the eyes of Nelly Dean, housekeeper/protector of Catherine/busybody who is bold, blunt and strong. The novel is very much linear making it an easy read. Helpfully, in the front of this edition there is a family tree which will aide the reader immensely, because not only are there a lot of characters, there are many with the same name (though different ages). The novel itself is beautiful in its portrayal of everything; from the moors to even Heathcliff (though spiteful and mean as he is), Bronte created a world that truly exists for the reader. Be warned: this is not a world of balls and romantic marriage proposals as Austen, but rather base life as was most likely lived, isolated on the moors.What really I loved about this book was perhaps what came before and after the actual contents. Bronte and her two sisters originally came out with their books within a year of each other under the guise of being three male brothers Ellis, Acton and Currer Bell. In this particular edition, there is a \\"Biographical Notice of Ellis and Acton Bell\\" written by Charlotte Bronte after her sister's passing and on the commencement of new printings of their novels. This edition also includes and Editor's Preface by Charlotte. Commentary from E.M. Forster, Virginia Woolf and a review by George Henry Lewes printed in 1850 come at the end and are very interesting, just to see how two famous authors and one critic looked at the book. These \\"bonus pages\\" made Emily (Ellis) come to life for me.Read this book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I've been trying to read more classic literature recently. And Wuthering Heights was really worthwhile. Yet I find myself almost at a loss for words in describing this book. This gothic romance was a very intense read...and I felt almost in another world as I read it. It creates a \\"feeling\\" that remains with you long after bedtime!The main characters Heathcliff and Catherine are larger than life somehow. How do you describe their dark and stormy love? It is a deep love that descends into obsession, despair, and revenge. Typical of gothic literature, the brooding and haunting landscape of the moors somehow seeps into the characters. And seeps into you... My words can not do this book justice. My advice? Read it!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte's WUTHERING HEIGHTS is by far the best novel I have ever read. The novel's main characters--Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff--are ingeniously written, and the melodramatic scenes are not too \\"cheezy\\" for the modern audience. Bronte's superb authorship allows readers of all backgrounds and of all generations to feel the characters, experience the novel's moods and tones, and appreciate the art of literature. If you absolutely despise reading, you will learn to love it after reading this novel. The novel's themes of passion, hate, love, loss, revenge, and individuality are something we can all relate to and evoke powerful emotions from within any reader. Every educated person should read this...It truly deserves its place among the world's greatest literature."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Annotation: \\"Wuthering Heights\\" is about Heathcliff, an orphan, who is raised by Mr. Earnshaw as one of his own children. Hindley despises him, but wild Cathy becomes his constant companion, and he falls violently in love with her. When she will not marry him, Heathcliff's terrible vengeance ruins them all - but still his and Cathy's love will not die.Author Bio: Emily Bront was born in Thornton, Yorkshire, in the north of England. Her mother died in 1821. Between the years 1824 and 1825 Emily attended the school at Cowan Bridge with Charlotte, and then was educated at home. Her first novel, Wuthering Heights (1847), a story-within-a-story, did not gain immediate success, but it has acclaimed later fame as one of the most intense novels written in the English language. Emily Bront died of tuberculosis in the late 1848. She had caught cold at her brother Branwell's funeral in September. After the appearance of Wuthering Heights, some skeptics thought that the book was written by Branwell, on the grounds that no woman from such circumscribed life, could have written such passionate story. After her sisters' deaths, Charlotte edited a second edition of their novels, with prefatory commentary aimed at correcting what she saw as the reviewers' misunderstanding of Wuthering Heights. The complex time scheme of the novel had been taken as evidence by the critics, that Emily had not achieved full formal control over her narrative materials.Evaluation: Hate is proven to be weaker than love when it comes to Heathcliff. Heathcliff and Catherine are meant to be together. Since the time when they were children they loved one another. Many people tried to keep them apart and they succeeded at times, but their love for one another always shined through. Heathcliff went through a period where he felt that getting even would mend what everyone put him through, but the last part of his revenge remained undone and there was finally some sort of happiness. Love finally outweighed hate creating the happiness between Cathy and Hareton, and Heathcliff and Catherine. It is truly better to love than it is to hate.Overall, \\"Wuthering Heights\\", is extremely enjoyable. I recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys gothic elements incorporated with romance and drama. There are so many themes explored. One thing happens after another, making you want to keep reading and find out what happens next. I liked the fact that love overpowered hate at the end. Jealousy, love, hatred, and tragedy are all mixed together in \\"Wuthering Heights\\", leaving you with a novel that's hard to put down."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I must admit I did the unthinkable. I watched the epic 1939 version of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; before reading the book. The book portrays Heathcliff as a brash, violent man unlike the movie, where he is brash, but his heart is still carrying a torch for Cathy. I never knew that the two main characters had children, and reading about the deep contempt Heathcliff had for Linton, his son, I was appalled. Nevertheless, I loved reading the book. The tragic love borders many other great novels written for the period, and I would suggest anyone who loves two lovers trying to deny the feelings between one another, read it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights has very real, lively and more animated characters contrary to Austen and the like; and is told in a distinctive narrative form. I think the particular narrative style has been chosen because she wrote the book under a male pen-name.The story is very realistic, perhaps livelier than real life stories, but is very disturbing; mainly because of the seemingly morbid presence of Heathclif. Though his character can be attributed to his disappointing childhood experiences, there is still a hint of that 'savage' instinct (as is often stated) which provokes him to be brutal to the core.Catherine represents a typical girl caught in between 'real love' and 'wealthy love', finally chosing the latter since she fears she'd have to live an extremely poverty-stricken life if she chooses the former.A question that arose in my mind while reading it is the unnatural importance given to a servant like Nelly, who seems to have witnessed each and every scene in the novel.Reading the novel is an experience in its own; and,the novel, I'm sure is one of the best novels of its kind."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I am indeed lost for words...a book of unprecedented power and imaginative scope."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is the story of two families in the Yorkshire Moors and how they are all but destroyed by the evil Heathcliff, who was brought to Wuthering Heights as an orphan by old Mr. Earnshaw.It is in many ways a paradox: It is set in a rustic and tranquil environment and in many parts dwells on a picturesque domestic environment, which I believe, would do the hearts of the best of us good.And yet, that is in itself scarred by a regime of hideous terror and cruelty brought on by Heathcliff.From the beginning of the book, we see in the dream of the city fop, Lockwood, how the latter violently rubs the wrist of the phantom Cathy through a broken windowpane. This sets the mood for deed after deed of cruelty and violence.Hence the key word of the novel is paradox. Between the blissful and violent, the homely and the horrific, between the evil of Heathcliff and the goodness of Nelly Dean who muses of the former: \\"\\"Is he a ghoul or a vampire. I had read of such hideous, incarnate demons'.His cruel treatment of Isabella and the second Catherine, is something that would revolt all descent human beings, and cause us to hate Heathcliff.Even Shakespeare's Macbeth shows some conscience, some guilt about his evil actions, as does Lady Macbeth, but Heathcliff never. No plea, nothing at all, can cause him to show the mildest mercy.If he had, but a shred of decency, he would have at least treated the younger Catherine with compassion as this was the daughter of the great love of his life.Heathcliff is a usurper, who mistreats the rightful heirs to Wuthering heights and Thrushcross Grange, Hareton Earnshaw and Cathy Linton II.The other evil folk in the novel, Heathcliff's son, the degenerate Linton Heathcliff and the spiteful manservant Joseph, are but pale shadows of the demonic Heathcliff.The novel focuses on the intense passionate connection (for one could not call such a thing love) between Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw, and the rage of Heathcliff before and after her death, that he could not be untied with her.Wuthering Heights was written in 1847, at a time when the rustic tranquility and wellbeing of the England where Emily Bronte lived, was being shattered by the twin forces of the Industrial Revolution and mercenary profit, and the radical and amoral revolutionary ideologies which would be chartered in The Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx. Perhaps one can see a parallel between the way in which the peaceful routine was being destroyed by both mercantile capitalism and by violent revolutionary socialism , and the way in which the peaceful and tranquil houses of Thrushcross Grange and Wuthering Heights where marred by the diabolical monstrosity of Heathcliff.A key character in the novel is the nurse Nelly Dean, a wonderful woman who shows strength and goodness, throughout in the face of all the evil and cruelty in the saga.She is not much older than Hindley and the first Catherine and I would imagine she is about 16 years old when old Mr. Earnshaw brings Heathcliff to Wuthering Heights, and about 46 therefore, at the time of Heathcliff's death and the redemption of Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange.The second Cathy, while showing a fierce spirit, is a fundamentally better person than her mother, both beautiful and good.Heathcliff and Catherine I are the anti-heroes of the story and Hareton Earnshaw and Cathy II, the heroes."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book is really fascinating.

It takes you to another world( well, at least for me because I'm living in a dull german village with not even a movie theater)and another time, where life wasn't so simple. I'm 13 years old and I've read this book in my spare time. I've read it in German but I'm going to read it in English too.

Catherine Earnshaw is the wildly passionate offspring of the master of Wuthering Heights and his wife. Her father brings home a gypsy looking boy from a trip to Liverpool and this little \\"silent heathen\\" is integrated into the family. Catherine and Heathcliff, as the gypsy comes to be named, become inseperable and untamable. However there is another family in this picture who lives in the much friendlier and luxurious house of Thrushcross Grange. Catherine is wounded while sneaking about the Grange with Heathcliff and his welcomed into Thrushcross Grange to be cared for until she heals. Edgar Linton who is Catherines age and will inherit the Grange upon his parents death takes to Cathy and she to him. But Edgar does not feed Catherine's wild nature and is for all intensive purposes a milksop. Catherine returns to the Heights far more mannered and tamed than when she left and Heathcliff is furious that she no longer cares to share in his savageness. Some time passes and Edgar asks Cathy to marry him, she cries to the lady keeper of the house that she wants to marry Heathcliff but she will lose all of her status as upper class if she does. Heathcliff overhears and in a rage of pain leaves and we do not see him again for three years. When he returns Catherine is married and living at the Grange. Heathcliff has become wealthy but is still the cruel savage from his youth and is bent on revenging himself upon all those who wronged him when he was the title-less gypsy boy. (I'm leaving out some important bits and pieces but for the most part the storyline is intact) The ending is a secret known only by those who choose to take the journey across the moors to Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange to hear Ellen tell the story. I will tell this: Both Catherine and Heathcliff beget children and death figures big in the plot. This novel contains unbridled passion, heinous revenges, festering anger, unfathomable pain, and the intensity of a storm on the moors. Read the whole book before passing ANY judgement.

I very much enjoyed it once I got going although it took a couple of chapters to do so."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"After a years of putting up with Amazon's breathtaking contempt for books, I have to say something here. The reason there are \\"1,000\\" reviews of the Norton Critical Fourth Edition of Wuthering Heights is that Amazon is dumping all the reviews of any edition of Wuthering Heights into one worthless jumble. Note that the initial description of \\"the book\\" is actually a detailed review of an Audio CD version referred to as an adequate abridgement. If you click on the book image in hopes of at least looking at the table of contents, you are taken to \\"another edition,\\" which turns out to be some high school class knockoff lacking even an introduction. Want to know what's inside the NCE Fourth? Too bad.It is routine at Amazon to not bother with copyright dates, so if you sort an author's work \\"by publication\\" you get the most recent printing, not the order of publication. Try finding a chronologically ordered list of a mystery series here. Would it be hard to create one? Of course not. But who cares? Not Amazon.Where this database slovenliness get criminal is when Amazon piles together British and U.S. editions of an author's work with no indication that a \\"new title\\" is actually the U.K. title of a book already available in the U.S. (Carol O'Connell's Magic Men is Shell Game, Find Me is Shark Music, etc.). The luckless shopper ends up with a duplicate title and shipping charges up the wazoo.

The tone of the romantic movie is nothing like the book, and the series is much closer only if you've read the book and can fill in the blanks in your mind. That said, the book is much more dense and dark than either and would appeal to modern audiences much more than the rather frilly movie and disjointed series. In the book, Catherine Earnshaw is self-centered and could easily be termed as mentally deranged and Heathcliff is a sadist. They mentally torture each other and are cruel and thoughtless of everyone around them. Bronte's book isn't the grand love story it's made out to be in the movie. Catherine and Heathcliff are more obsessed than romantic, and there's really not much of anyone to like. The setting is grimy, not grand. The characters are hardscrabble in a bleak, brutal world.

I'll agree with other readers, it's hard to tell who's leading the narrative. It's also hard to tell the relations of the characters until quite a ways into the book. The story does not end up satisfying the reader. It's not really even much of a love story. It's quite a hate story. I'm glad I read it, but only because it kept me from buying it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Even though Emily and Charlotte are sisters, it obvious who the better writer of the two is, Charlotte. I chose this novel for my 12th grade students to read and I decided that I would never again read it. It takes too long for everyone to realize Heathcliff is a jerk. I think that if anyone is interested in reading the Brontes to read Charlotte. If anyone is interested in reading literature from that era, read Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte, one of the Bronte sisters, (the most famous being Charlotte, who wrote Jane Eyre) wrote a classic Gothic romance, chalk-full of the emotions and pathos that a tragic romance encompasses. As a literary work, it is well written and at paar with Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre. This audio book, narrated finely, with a delightful box cover, makes a striking Valentines day gift for women. The story is set in the lush, dark moors of northern England, and centers around a wealthy family and the doomed romance of Catherine and Heathcliff. Catherine comes from a well-to-do family, set in their ways, and all of her societal expectations are heavy on her shoulders. She falls in love with Heathcliff, a deep, spiritual, soulful love, but unfortunately one that could not be consummated. Heathcliff was taken into Catherine's family as an orphan. Heathcliff and Catherine's love, described in the most romantic of terms, is so strong that there is one scene in which Catherine calls out to him in despair, when she is married to another man for his status and convenient position as a powerful family friend, and Heathcliff is able to hear her from his distant stance.The novel is Gothic, although there is no supernatural going-ons and the usual horror that can be associated with Gothic novels. It is a novel full of the dark despair and tragedy of two lovers who can not be together. The character of Heathcliff, in particular, cannot be considered heroic. He is brooding, he is dark, he vows revenge against those who have taken Catherine from him. Likewise, Catherine cannot fulfill the profile of an innocent, hopelessly romantic girl. She is instead, a vain, egotistical and bourgeois materialist, marrying a man for his money and not for his love. But although the immediate situation that occurs with Heathcliff and Catherine, Heathcliff's subsequent vendetta and extraction of revenge are the darkest aspects, the promising and more idealistic love transpires between their children (eventhough they are children of other parents). With stunning narration and a classic feel to the whole thing, this makes a perfect gift on the day that celebrates romance and true love- Valentine's Day."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Haven't read it yet -- downloaded for future reading. . . . . . . . . . . . ."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Downboaded to read on a trip.

Thank goodness for the Kindle dictionary because we don't use most of those words anymore."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"When it was first published, \\"Wuthering Heights\\" elicited strong criticism. Although Charlotte Bronte's \\"Jane Eyre\\" also received its share of negative criticism, it was not as markedly disliked as her sister's book. As time went by, the pendulum swung in the opposite direction, and it was Emily's book that eventually came to be hailed as superior to Charlotte's, particularly as the 20th century got under way.I have read the book three times. It was part of a high school English Lit assignment. To be quite honest, I could barely stomach the book back then. It was too strange, wild, and terrifying to me. The second time I read it, several years ago, I was much older. Thus, I was able to appreciate its masterful prose style and brilliant characterizations. In fact, it was these two factors that kept me reading until the very end. The same thing happened a few months ago. Once more I was hypnotized by this horrible tale of people whose lives went so very wrong. It was one character in particular who exerted a rather puzzling pull on me - Heathcliff. I read almost against my will, hoping against hope that I would be able to find some good quality in him. Of course, I vaguely remembered the plot from the second reading, so I knew that I would not find any such thing.This book, in its entirety, is about Heathclif. It's about how the abuse he suffered at the hands of his benefactor's son, Hindley Earnshaw, twisted him into a demonic caricature of a human being. As such , it is definitely not a pleasant read. However, it does serve as a testament to Emily Bronte's genius. That such a hideous creature sprang from this young woman's imagination is nearly unbelievable, considering her background. Something dark and cruel stirred in the nether recesses of her mind. M. L. Von Franz, a Jungian analyst writing in \\"Man and His Symbols\\", edited by Carl Jung, mentions Heathcliff, describing him as Emily Bronte's animus, the masculine part of a woman's psyche. The animus can be evil or good. Heathcliff is demonic indeed. Bronte brings him to life with great vividness, and this undeniably displays her great talent for making a character truly live in a reader's mind.Therein lies the rub. Heathcliff is so repulsive, so utterly demonic, and so overpowering, that he makes the book sheer torture to read. His influence is seen on every page. The one redeeming quality he might have possessed, his love for Cathy, turns into a monstrous, sick obsession toward the end of the book.While I can admire the powerful way the author delineates character, as well as her obvious command of writing style, I simply cannot say that this book is one of my favorites. I find it especially strange to see it referred to as a love story, and tagged as \\"romance\\" on Amazon. There is little to none of that in this novel. The supposed love story between Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw is sketchy at best. They are separated for three years, due to her stubbornness, as well as his pride. When he suddenly reappears, determined to see her, she is already married to another man, one whom Heathcliff despises as a weakling, due to his passionless nature. Yet it is that very man who treats Catherine with kindness, catering to her every whim. Had she, instead, chosen Heathcliff, things might have been very different. Such a tumultuous relationship could very well have ended in tragedy. Had Bronte taken the story in this direction, the book could, indeed, be classified as \\"a dark romance\\". As it stands, however, it certainly cannot, nor should it be.Catherine Earnshaw herself is not a wholly pleasant character, either, although she never descends to the depths of depravity Heathcliff does. She is, however, a very self-centered creature; her sole reason for marrying Linton is so that she won't be brought below her station by marrying Heathcliff. She attempts to rationalize her decision by claiming that she can use Linton's money to \\"help\\" Heathcliff, but this is a rather flimsy excuse.Through Heathcliff, this also becomes a tale of family dysfunction, and of how that dysfunction poisons anyone who comes into contact with that family, whose most disturbed representative, Heathcliff, engages in a very elaborate plan of revenge throughout the latter part of the book.Allthough, again, the writing is brilliant, the book does have one major flaw, and that is the plotting. Characters are killed off when they are no longer necessary. Now, I do agree that a writer has to include sad and unhappy events in a novel, even if he or she is writing within the parameters of the modern romance genre. However, having characters die every few pages or so is just too contrived. Even Cathy's death is contrived. It's designed to make Heathcliff even more of a monster than he already is. Besides, there is no clear explanation for her death. True, she had gotten herself into a state of near hysteria due to auto-suggestion, but this is hardly enough to cause anyone's death; at least, not as suddenly as hers comes about. It's just not believable. Furthermore, the reader finds out, after her demise, that she was pregnant! She very conveniently gives birth, too, before she inexplicably departs from this world. This seems to be a rather forced way of increasing the pathos.Other reviewers have objected to the narration-within-a-narration technique Bronte uses. Actually, I found this quite intriguing. This is one of the elements about the book that actually maintained my interest. Nelly Dean turns out to be a very shrewd, highly perceptive observer, with an especially keen eye for nuanced detail.I was glad that poor Hareton got a chance at love with Catherine Linton. That was another element about the book that I liked. Still, their union is also a bit too contrived, since they happen to be cousins.All in all, although I do recognize the greatness of Emily Bronte as a writer, I have to say that I consider her sister's novel, \\"Jane Eyre\\", far superior, with a more polished plot structure"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"If I were to go back and read a Bronte book, I would readJane Eyre.

It has a lovely ending.2.

Heathcliff, is one of the most famous or infamous characters in English Literature, he is truly an enigma. His relationship with Catherine, and its consequences are of course the crux of the novel.

Or perhaps you're in the mood for a quintessentially gothic tale, an epic ghost story spanning generations? Wuthering Heights is all of these things and more.

Emily lived for just 30 years: 1818 to 1848.I bought and read this Penguin Classic version of Wuthering Heights. It has a good preface by Lucasta Miller, author of \\"The Bronte Myth,\\" and it has an introduction by Pauline Nestor, who has written two books on the Bronte sisters including \\"Charlotte Bronte' in 1987, and a related book \\"George Eliot\\" in 2002. I read the analysis after reading the book and I recommend that you not read too much about the details of the story until you have read the book. I read the book after reading \\"Jane Eyre\\" and \\"Shirley.\\" I read the three books one after the other.\\"Jane Eyre\\" by Charlotte Bronte has touches of Dickens and Jane Austen in a fictional biopgraphy of a young English woman. That novel is more conventional in plot and structure and it is a compelling read. It was a big hit in 1847 and was a much bigger and more popular novel than \\"Wuthering Heights\\" - published the same year in 1847. Both sisters used male pseudonyms. The present novel has become more popular and better accepted with the passage of time. Even today, \\"Jane Eyre\\" remains as the more popular novel, but now there is a strong appreciation of what Emily Bronte has created: it is an unusual piece of literature. Some think that it shows much more originality than the popular work of Charlotte.In short, Emily Bronte has created a horror book which is mostly grounded in reality. The characters have the problems within themselves. There is nothing unusual or super-natural in the book. The novel is short and concise. It is a well written and entertaining novel. But unlike most novels, it is hard to have sympathy with any characters. One likes certain people in the book because they are not as bad or as outrageous as some of the others. I guess we could say the protagonists are Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw. The latter is somewhat sympathetic while Heathcliff is a man with serious problems. All in all it is very convincing.Also, Emily Bronte uses the story within a story technique: it is a narrative told by a housekeeper with the beginning and closing chapters used to form the story and bring closure.The novel is slow to start but most who can get through the first 100 pages will be well rewarded.I highly recommend this Penguin Classic."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"There is no need to comment on the contents of this volume, since it coincides page for page with the Penguin Classics current \\"black\\" edition of Wuthering Heighs (Pauline Nestor with Lucasta Miller), a really excellent edition (I omit some little misgivings).What is NEW (and almost unseen on the Anglo-American market) is to have an authoritative and scholarly edition in a really nice hardcover (cloth), WITH ALL ITS INTRODUCTIONS AND NOTES, in good and probably lasting white paper, with even a blue ribbon-marker. A delight to the eyes and hands!Let's face it: Clarendon edition wasn't nice-looking, with a price tag of one third of the US Gross National Product. The Franklin Mint Editions (say the 1979 one) is a very fine item, but it has no introduction and the only notes are the well-done glossings of the dialect tirades. Barnes&Noble; hardcover comes near to parfection at a slightly more popular level, but their text is 1900 Haworth Edition, with its uncredible paragraphing and quaint distorted dialect, with some C.K. Shorter idiosyncracies for good measure.SO, LONG LIVE THE PENGUIN CLASSICS HARDCOVER EDITIONS, AND LET'S SEE IF OXFORD FOLLOWS SUIT (I fear not). By the way, a good signature-sewn paperback with flaps and good, durable paper would do almost as well, but there is almost none in the Anglo-American market."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is truly the definitive \\"epic\\" novel. The animated, wild mental scenery, the perplex love/hate relationships, and the extended tale of two generations. Its story is so dramatic and wrenching it almost borders a soap opera, but luckily Emily Bronte's writing skills and character dynamics protect it from ever being comparable. IThe plot revolves around a possessive, yet unconsummated relationship between the two main characters, a gypsy boy named Heathcliff and the daughter of a respected family, Catherine Earnshaw, and branches off into the consequences of a love too wild and profound to be controlled. A love triangle ensues involving a wealthy neighbor who wishes for Catherine's love and her hand in marriage as opposed to Heathcliff's instability. Her choice influences all the events to come and lives are ruined in the midst of the storm created by a passion too deep to renounce. With its dark themes and violent characters it is considered by many to be the original Gothic Romance novel.Upon its first publishing, the story was considered too harsh and the characters vile, and was rejected by many readers in the early 19th Century. Emily Bronte, having been born and raised amongst the moors and the people bred of it knew no other way of life at the age of seventeen when she wrote this novel.Ultimately, it is the wild and uncontrollable nature that makes the novel so affecting and believable, capturing your heart and your emotions. It drives you into feeling what the characters experience with it's descriptive writing and you then know what is the essence of the story. The book is a work of art made from minimal environmental resources, with the mind and the soul sculpting it into a true representation of love's ability to conquer hate."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is an absolute masterpiece, and I feel confident in saying that it is the best book I have ever read. I'm stunned that the average rateing is not five stars. This book is an amazing work. It was written by a woman who never married and yet her description of the vivid passion that exists between the hero and heroine in this book is so passionate and moving that you almost feel as though you can't understand the raw, almost jealous need they have for one another. It reverts to basic animal instinct. She creates characters that you love one momment and hate the next. These are real humans, not representations. They are flawed in every way that they should be and yet they are the ones you sympathize with. They truly are three dimensional, with all the motivations of love, greed, lust, jealousy, and anger that every human being must deal with. If the characters are not enough to convince you of this novel's superiority, all you have to do is look at the actual construction of it. It's like an onion, starting with Mr. Lockewood as the narrator, then Nellie, and eventually even Heathcliff and Cathy speaking to one another in the white hot core, the climax of the story. The two love triangles, emulating each other through generations, the first a tragedy, and the second resolving the fault of the parents with true love succeeding. It is absolutly fascinating how intricatly and beautifully the story is constructed to tell every aspect of the characters. This novel is so moving. It faces every aspect of ourselves as human beings, at the best and the worst of our capabilitys. It may have been written long ago, but it still holds true to problems we face every day. What emotions do we allow to motivate our deeds? That is the real question that this book asks. The images, and the lasting feelings continue long after you have finished the final haunting paragraph. That is why this is the best book I have ever read. If you think I'm simply babbling, all I have to say is read the book yourself. It will be like nothing you have ever read before."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"There is a thin line between love and hate, and once Heathcliff crosses it, we see a grand, passionate and absorbingly interesting man turn into a fearsome thug. Thwarted in his love for his childhood soulmate, Catherine Earnshaw, Heathcliff turns his devastation outward, becoming a hateful -- and hated -- person all across the bleak moors that surround his Yorkshire village.Heathcliff courts and marries the sister of the man whom Catherine chose over Heathcliff, only to torture her emotionally as a way of getting even with her brother. Meanwhile, Catherine slowly wastes away pining for Heathcliff, for although she once rejected him, she eventually realizes that she has made an irredeemable error and can never be happy. Heathcliff sums up the tragedy of their lives in a single question near the end of the novel when he asks, \\"Why did you betray your heart, Cathy?\\"Sound depressing? It's not. Wuthering Heights is a grand and glorious novel that dramatically illustrates the power of love, for good and ill. But more importantly, it teaches us that the only path to happiness is to be true to one's heart, rather than one's head. Had Catherine honored her bond with Heathcliff and refused to bow to the social mores of her day, not only would the two of them been much happier, but all of the many people whose lives they stumbled into would have been much better off.Another reviewer said that those of us who love this novel probably have a strong identification with one of the characters, and for me that is quite true. That's the reason for reading a classic like Wuthering Heights, because when it speaks to you in the clear and true way that Bronte does, you know that you are not alone, and that some things transcend time and place.Think about it -- a prim, Victorian preacher's daughter living on the moors of England before there was electricity can reach across 150 years of time and speak to the heart of a wired American in the 21st century. Pretty amazing, and highly recommended"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Often held up as the standard of the classic gothic novel, Wuthering Heights is, for the most part, a showcase of emotional savagery and a dismal portrayal of the human heart. Not well received when first published under the pseudonym Ellis Bell, Emily Bronte went to her grave believing that her one and only novel was a complete failure. A subsequent edition, edited by sister Charlotte, was released after Emily's death and became a worldwide success.Everyone has heard the name Heathcliff, and that must be due to his being surely one of the vilest, most hateful literary characters to ever exist on a page. An unidentified foundling who is brought to the Earnshaw home as a young boy, Heathcliff is forever painfully aware of his lack of identity and culture and lashes out at everyone with whom he comes into contact. For awhile, his dearest childhood ally, Catherine, is his one sanctuary, but in time he begins to hate her almost as much as he loves her. From that hatred is born several generations of misery and pain, as Heathcliff devotes his entire existence to ruining Catherine, her family, and everything she ever held dear, and no one is immune from Heathcliff's wrath - not even his own children.Most of the story is told as a look-back by aging housekeeper Nelly Dean as she relates the whole sordid tale to Mr. Lockwood, a tenant who comes to Wuthering Heights to rent for a short time and becomes curious about his angry, tormented landlord. The past soon fuses into the present, as Heathcliff's revenge continues to plague both his and Catherine's hapless descendants.As dark and depressing a story as it appears on the surface, Bronte's unfettered examination of the twin emotions of intense love and equally intense hatred is powerful, and stays with the reader long after the last page has been turned. It's nothing if not a poignant and eerie lesson in the damage one person's tortured soul can wreak on everyone around him. I found myself much more affected by it than I thought I would be. Recommended for any fan of classic literature, particularly the gothic era of the 19th century."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Love sometimes encompasses the dark component of obesession and this obsession is beautifully and hauntingly explored in Wuthering Heights, perhaps the most intensely original novel to emerge from 19th century England. This is the story of the passionate love between the wild Heathcliff and the reckless Catherine Earnshaw, both inhabitants of the Yorkshire moors. So passionate, in fact, are Catherine and Heathcliff that their love is doomed to tragedy rather than to fulfillment. When that does, indeed happen, Heathcliff, one of the most original and fascinating characters I have ever encountered, spirals ever downward into a morass of self-destruction and obsession. The symbolism in this novel is rich and complex and not so easily recognizable as one might first suppose. The presentation of the duality of human and non-human existence are deftly explored. Catherine and Heathcliff are violent figures striving in vain to identify themselves as ordinary human beings while disrupting all around them with the voraciousness of their appetites. Both ultimately disintegrate from within due to the passion out of which they are made. These two wildly intense characters stand out all the more sharply when contrasted with the simple ordinariness of Nelly Dean and Lockwood. The novel's central question, of course, concerns the meaning of Heathhcliff, who is both diabolical and yet, at the same time, irresistible. The power of the novel, does not, however, reside solely in the interpretaion of its theme. The setting, the relentless elements of the fire, wind and water of the moors only serves to deeepen and reinforce the intensity of the story. The language, although archaic, is poetic, reflecting Bronte's brooding personal vision. Extraordinary effects have been achieved with a remarkable power of formal organization and a brilliant handling of the time scheme. While encompassing the most domestic of scenes, this novel still achieves the depth of an ancient tragedy. Unforgettably haunting and beautiful in every way."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Having read a number of books in my life, I must say I was not convinced this was one I could enjoy when it popped up on my mandatory reading list for my first year in university.How wrong one can be.Ever since Catherine visited MR Lockwood on that stormy night at the Heights, I have been completely spellbound by this novel. I have tried to rationalize my affection and utter amazment over this book, but I have so far not succeeded. To give a reweiv with any kind of substance when it comes to the theme of this book would be pointless. After having read the book over and over again,and having watched the movies made about it, I still cannot tell you what this novel is really all about. Don\`t get me wrong, the plot is easy enough to follow, but the underlying drama is something that keeps haunting me. Maybe that was what Emily Bronte wanted. For the reader to put down the book and forever be spellbound by what he or she had read. I know I am.Maybe, in our sedated worlds, we long for this kind of emotion, this kind of passion. Not just in our love lives, but in our lives in general. The story touches timeless subjects, it erases the line between heaven, hell and the world we know. It might even suggest that heaven and hell are right here on earth among us all.It is utterly compelling and I would recomend it to anybody. Give it a couple of chapters before you judge it, and I asure you it will be the reading experince of a lifetime.This publishment is even more rewarding because you can read the different analysis of the book in the Critical Edition part of the book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I read what the self-proclaimed &quot;immature&quot; reader wrote, and I beg to differ. I love this book not because I'm supposed to, but because I just do. The austerity of the language, which you term &quot;dull&quot;, is what sets the whole tone for such a troubling work. I doubt that Bronte set out to write a classic romance; I believe she was denouncing the sins of her characters. This novel is multi-faceted with its never-ending parallels: two houses (Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange), two love stories, two heroes, two heroines, two narrators, etc. The inexplicable love that two heartless people like Heathcliff and Catherine share is fascinating to say the least. When Catherine cries out, &quot;Nelly, I AM Heathcliff,&quot; I'm sure many a girl's heart has thudded in her chest. This book sweeps you away to a place and time far removed from us and gives us a view into a harsh and distant world. You don't have to like the book. But don't be so dumb or immature as to assume that no else does either. The longer you study literature, the more you'll see that some books have passed the test of time, because, well, they're just that damn good."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I picked up a copy of Emily Bront's classic after being very much impressed with her sister Charlotte Bront's novel Jane Eyre. However, while I did find much to be meritted in Wuthering Heights, I also feel that it fell short of my hopes. The story initially focuses on the lives of Catherine and Heathcliff, childhood sweethearts forced apart by their families. Catherine marries another man, vainly thinking she can love and be loved by both Heathcliff and her husband Edgar at the same time. As an act of revenge, Heathcliff married Edgar's sister Isabella. What ensues is a dark and stormy emotional battle between many very troubled people.Catherine dies halfway through the novel, starving herself to insanity and death when she realizes that the two men in her life will not share her and instead demand that she make a choice. She leaves behind her a daughter of the same name, young Catherine. Heathcliff and Isabella in turn produce a son, the weak and sickly Linton. The remainder of the novel concerns the love affair that develops between Linton and young Catherine, and Heathcliff's violent, vengeful manipulation of their lives.I thought the book was very well written (as it ought to be, to have achieved a rank among classic literature), and I was able to read it with no trouble. Some of the words and terms are a bit antiquated, but someone familiar with works of the time should not find these too daunting. Though keeping a dictionary close at hand is a surefire way to avoid trouble. Bront has excellent word choice and creates very vivid imagery. My one criticism of the writing itself regards the manner in which Bront has chosen to express dialects. The Yorkshire accent of Heathcliff's servant Joseph (and later of young Catherine's cousin Hareton) is nearly impossible to read, with phrases like \\"ut's soa up uh going\\" intended to mean \\"who is set on going\\". My copy of the book has an appendix that \\"translates\\" the most incomprehensible of his words, but it is a great irritation to constantly flip to the back (sometimes several times per paragraph) for explanation, and even the notes there do not decipher everything.The found the story itself to be profoundly disturbing. Wuthering Heights undoubtedly contains one of the largest collections of mentally unbalanced characters I've ever come across in any novel. It is choc full of sadists, masochists, and otherwise troubled and violent personalities. The whole book has a very dark, opressive feel about it, and there were times I found it downright unsettling. I must tip my figurative hat to Bront for her skill in creating atmosphere and invoking feeling in her readers.However, the storyline is a bit weak in my estimation, as the characters' feelings about and behavior toward each other is often quite illogical. The different culture of the time can explain some of this, but there remains, I believe, a general unrealistic quality about the plot. Why, for instance, would Catherine and Heathcliff have ever fallen in love in the first place? Their childhood attraction is easy to explain as the passing fancies of the very young, but their relationship as adults is more troubling. Heathcliff is moody, egocentric, obsessive, and extremely violent; Catherine is vain and naive, narcissistic, and given to wild emotional tantrums when she does not get her way. What would posses anyone to fall for either of the two? Even harder to understand is the timid Edgar's proposal to Catherine. She abuses him repeatedly, mentally and physically, and yet he claims to love her. Why?The next generation of characters is equally unbalanced and ill-matched. I think young Catherine is probably the only main character with some claim on a sound mind, though even she is not without issues. Though she is intelligent and generally strong-minded, she is for some reason a complete pushover when it comes to the frail, sniveling Linton's outbursts of self-pity. Even when Catherine herself recognizes Linton's problems and appears to have lost her romantic interest in him, she still obeys his every whining command when there is no incentive whatsoever for her to do so. Heathcliff is even more violent in the second part of the novel than the first. He physically abuses nearly all who cross his path, including his own son, taking his only pleasure from the misery of others. Another relationship that raises questions in my mind is Catherine's attraction to young Hareton following Linton's death. Catherine has been brought up as a proper young lady with manners and education, and Hareton is a slovenly, shadowy figure whose speech is as difficult to comprehend as the servant Joseph's. The two young people seem to have absolutely nothing in common.On the whole, I recognize the literary merits of Wuthering Heights - as I said it is very well written and invokes strong reactions in the reader. The character development is excellent, even if those characters are mentally and emotionally unbalanced in the extreme. The book explores the themes of love, jealousy, and obsession, and provokes thought. However, it is by no means a feel-good book and I can't say I'd recommend it for recreational reading. This one is probably best left in the academic discussion circles and not brought home to read before bedtime."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Of all of the audio books of Wuthering Heights, this is my favorite. Janet McTeer brings the characters of Cathy and Heathcliff to life and fully captures the wild passion and pain of the novel. The Patricia Routledge audio play is quite good, as well, but if you are looking for a reading of the complete text of the novel, this is by far the best."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I confess that most of this book was completely over my head. There is a lot of passion in it, but it was a little to deep for me. I guess I'm more of the Jane Austen type. I'd recommend it to anyone who is intrigued by hate and dark passions."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"My friend lent me this book, and at first I didn't want to read it, but I am SO glad that I did! One of my favorite parts is where Cathy is explaining her love for Heathcliff--&quot;Nelly, I AM Heathcliff!&quot; and the part where Heathcliff and Cathy are reunited. This book is one of the best i've ever read. Sorry I can't quote more extensively, but I don't have a copy handy."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I love this book. I love this book. I love this book. It is a story of human nature. I think we all know people like the characters herein in real life. Wuthering Heights is the apotheosis of the classic. I know two people, very close to home like Catherine and Heathcliff who never reached union in this life. There are so many undercurrents to be picked apart in Wuthering Heights. I chose the relationship between Heathcliff and Catherine for my research paper. But there was the weather, and how it mirrored all the actions of all the characters in the novel. This is one of my favorite books."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I was loathing this book, hating the heroine. Catherine Earnshaw is the most hateful and irritating woman in English Literature. Then, thankfully, around mid-point, Catherine Earnshaw does the reader a favor and dies, leaving the book to Heathcliff. The second half of the book, in which Heathcliff returns to exact his revenge, is one of the most gripping tales I have read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Since the age of 17 I have read this novel 6 times and I must say from the first time I opened its pages I was hooked. It is a story of the true love and true hate that is inherent in all human nature that engages its readers deeper and deeper with every word. Almost every character in the novel is both loved and hated by the reader at different times, and I always find myself longing for the reunion of Catherine and Heathcliff no matter how many times I read the story. Emily Bronte was an author well before her time, and I have read nothing so far that even compares to the beauty of this novel!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book is by far the best book I've ever read. The important thing is that you read it slowly so you don't miss any important information. I cried several times throughout the story. My feelings towards the older Catherine and Heathcliff went back and forth throughout the book, but for the most part I liked Catherine and disliked Heathcliff. I like the way history repeated itself with Catherine's daughter and Hindley's son. It was a good way to conclude the story; it gave a feeling of things coming full circle."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"A delicious book to read. Full of meaning and symbolism, I do wonder why no one else had understood this book at all."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"At times the reader despises a character in this book, the next minute he/she loves him/her (and vice versa)! All characters have flaws: Cathy's haughtiness, Edgar's wimpiness, Linton's peevishness, Heathcliff's evilness, but these flaws only make the characters more interesting.Take Hareton and Heathcliff for instance; both posses a strong and profound character instilled with a certain degree of pride, and both posses the potential for becoming good or evil. Heathcliff becomes revenge-driven because he once had been loved and his love is taken away by Edgar, who is not even, according to Heathcliff, capable of being loved: &quot;I was a fool to fancy for a moment that she valued Edgar Linton's attachment more than mine. If he loved her with all the powers of his puny being, he couldn't love as much in eighty years as I could in a day...It is not in him to be loved like me; how can she love in him what he has not?&quot; Heathcliff is angered because he knows Cathy still loves him but is wasting her love on Edgar, who doesn't even deserve her love and is making her worse by trying to care for her: &quot;He might as well plant an oak in a flowerpot and expect it to thrive as imagine he can restore her to vigour in the soil of his shallow cares.&quot; When Heathcliff was loved by Cathy, he had the potential to become good, but when he is deprived of her love, he becomes evil.Very engrossing book!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book is perfect in every way. The author pulls you into a new world, where love will refuse to die. It well writen, a wonderfull story plot, relistic, and perfect in every way possible. This is a book for anyone!!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I saw the movie of this before I read the book, and after being throughly confused by the movie, decided to read the book. I was amazed by the depth of feeling, and horrorfic passion of the characters. It is now one of my favorites. Some parts horrorify you, and some exist to make you belive in the power of true love. All in all, an incredible experience."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I finally read this classic after many years of intending to. My only exposure to the story was the film starring Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon. About halfway through I'm thinking....was the movie this dark? Why do I not remember Heathcliff being so ruthless? Well, turns out the movie version I saw only covers the first half of the book (as I learned through Wikipedia). I imagine the filmakers found second-half Heathcliff to be so unlikeable that even the dashing Olivier could not redeem him.The book was immensely compelling literature, and frankly I tore through it, but I had a hard time sympathizing with Heathcliff's unsatiable appetite for revenge. The second half of the book is like \\"My Name is Earl\\" in reverse. \\"Hmm, who wronged me and how can I avenge them? Hindley? Check. Edgar? Check.\\" It overshadowed whatever love there was between he and Catherine. Not to mention that Catherine was by all accounts a spoiled, unlikeable brat.So 4 stars because it is a fine piece of literature, but wow....not what I was expecting. Dark, dark, dark. Not that dark is inherently bad (Anna Karenina and House of Mirth end shall we say, darkly, and they are two of the best books on earth), but I think I'll stick with Darcy and Elizabeth for my romantic leads."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"As someone who is long out of high school, I thoroughly enjoyed reading Wuthering Heights (and properly this time!)One literary critic I read somewhere said that the sheer number of characters is deliberately confusing. Certainly, it doesn't make it any easier that there are two Catherines. Nor the frequent use of surnames, rather than first names and vice versa, quite interchangably.Like many reviewers before me I found many of the characters thoroughly odious and of moral outrage. Why Nelly Dean doesn't just leave them all is a mystery to me.One thing I found of great help to my understanding of the book was to paste a clearer copy of the family tree to the inside-front cover of the book. I found this on page 308 of The Scribner Companion to the Bronts by Barbara and Gareth Lloyd Evans. The marriages and births are clearer and far more readable.I also felt the need to take notes from a number of other literary critical works on the book to get my head around the whole plot, the characters, themes, imagery and Haworth landscape.Perhaps for the most serious among us there is a concordance to Wuthering Heights! This is great for those doing a paper on some certain theme found in the book, who want to find all the references to that topic all in one place. If you are wanting to find it: A Concordance to Bront's Wuthering Heights by C. Ruth Sabol and Todd K. Bender, Garland Publishing, Inc. New York/London, 1984, Garland Reference Library of the Humanities Vol. 428.Thoroughly recommended. It only loses a star because I would have enjoyed something slightly less complex, which is really just a reflection on this poor reviewer, rather than Emily Bront."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I had to study this book a few years ago and i think it was the novel that opened my eyes to all classics. The Bronte sisters are among my most well loved authors and Emily's Wuthering Heights top the list. In fact, my book was so often read I had to glue the cover back on when it fell apart.Wuthering Heights is a deep dark novel full of revenge, passion, love and hatred. I have once heard this book called 'dry' by someone who clearly hadn't read it as Wuthering Heights is so far from it. Heathcliff spends his whole life seeking revenge on other characters right from when Mr Earnshaw brings him home from London. However, it cannot be said that he is the only character seeking revenge. In all of the subplots one character is avenging his/herself on another.Lockwood is among the silliest men ever written about, he is right up there with the bumbling Mr Collins of Pride and Prejudice (another favourite). Lockwood is the only character to whom anything of humour happens to, providing the reader with some light comic relief. Having said that, the violence which taints all characters has not passed over Lockwood who tries slitting the wrists of the ghost of Cathy .The numerous allusions to the devil and supernatural were still a controversial subject, especially for a woman, to be writing about at the turn of the century and Emily Bronte was berated by many for writing such a book. However, without the references the book would lose so much of its full force. Heathcliff would not exist except as the evil man he is.Somehow I love the people in this book but I could not tell you why. The only characters who I find myself disliking are Linton and Isabella, however they are the only ones with any sense of goodness surrounding them. I suppose the reason I love the others is for their passion and love for another.This is the greatest of all the great classics and if you find it hard to catch onto do yourself a favour and persevere. I found it difficult the first time I tried to read it and now it's a favourite"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I read this book aloud to my wife 23 years ago. At the time, I was working as an apprentice at a winery on the Rhine River. There was an old medeival castle across the river from our room. It was the perfect setting, as we two were the only English speaking people in the town. I think now is the right time to review the book, because I can only recall the feelings left behind by this powerful work of literature. Most of the plot and many of the characters have been long forgotten, leaving only the residue of strong emotion. I have read many works of powerful fiction by the world's great authors since then. But not one of them affected me emotionally the way this extraordinary tale did. I remember one gray German morning finishing the chapter where Heathcliff digs up the body of his beloved Catherine because he has gone mad in his desire to hold her close once more. And then off to the Altenkirch Schwanenkellerei I went. I spent the rest of the day working quietly in the cellars of the winery, deep inside the mountain with mold hanging all about, and brooding over the maniacal behavior of these highly romantic, insane characters. I've never been able to completely shake the feeling. There is something so entirely timeless about this work, as though it were a piece of ancient literature, old far beyond the 1840s setting, something so utterly classical and piercingly primordial, it's as though you already had the genesis of this material in your DNA and it only required this story to bring it back to life within you. You recognize the spell it weaves because it speaks to the humanity in you so clearly. It is as though you have been secretly drugged. The English language has rarely been utilized as well as it has here, and I dare say you would need to go back to Shakespeare to find its parallel. Romanticism reached its high water mark with this novel. Ms. Bronte has now become immortal because of her creation, and in the Pantheon of world literaure, she stands among the Titans. If you are a native speaker of the English language, you can hardly consider yourself educated if you have not read this astounding novel of romantic love and uncontrollable passion."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I have had Wuthering Heights in my possesion for 2 years and could at first only get past the first few pages.I bought it after reading Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte. As soon as I got into it and got to know the characters of Heathcliff and Catherine I couldnt put it down! I found myself staying up till late at night just to see what would happen next and trying to study for a test but ending up opening it and getting totally absorbed in the plot and characters. I guess it is a curse to love books sometimes, and weird to make bad grades because of them at points. Get the book it is great for men and women! My dad loves it! Heathcliff is a very strong male character that boys will enjoy. And Catherine is a very real woman character and that girls will enjoy because she is far from perfect and has a nasty temper but the men in her life adore her anyway."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a very disturbing \\"what goes around comes around\\" type of story. I personally think that you can have a negative look at the story or a positive look. While reading this book I felt bad for poor Heithcliff, who was treated terribly as a child and fought his whole life to get his revenge. However, at the same time I hated Heithcliff for the pain that he caused everyone while getting his revenge. The setting is a very important part of the story. I think the reader is made aware of the darkness and evil mood of both Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange. As I was reading the story I could easily see what the author intended me to picture in my head. All I could see was darkness simply because everyone is just sad and depressed as though they hated their life and wanted to die, which just laid the way for all the tragedies, heartaches and most importantly, betrayal. They all sat around all day and had nothing to do but engage in silly drama.Even though the plot was clear I would have to say that it was rather hard to keep track of all the characters. If anyone has read this book they know exactly what I am talking about. In physics when they talked about how \\"every action has an equal and opposite reaction\\", they definitely must have had this book on their mind! In the beginning we meet a character named Earnshaw who adopts a child named Heathcliff. Heathcliff unintentionally makes Earnshaw's true son, Hindley, jealous. The trouble starts when Earnshaw seems to have more of a connection with his adopted child than his own. Sadly, after Earnshaw dies Hindley takes his revenge out on Heathcliff. For years Heathcliff has to live under his older brother's thumb, which makes the plot thicken. Heathcliff then devotes his whole life toward seeing that he gets his revenge for the way that he has been treated. Wuthering Heights is indeed a classic. However, this book goes too deep into description about certain things and the wording is a bit hard to understand. After I read the book I needed the cliffs notes so that I could fully understand specific things. This book is full of pure evil, which is why I do not recommend it for any lighthearted reader. It is more for anyone who likes a tale about wicked love and sweet revenge."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"In such situations, it is customary to start out with a &quot;good and the bad&quot; scenario. So here goes.The good: This book has a complex plot that keeps you interested for the most part. The characters are believable (if somewhat twisted), and the setting is appropriate: a creepy old house in the Moors of England. Heathcliff is a maniac with a likeable streak (mostly it's just sympathy). Catherine is unbridled, wild and cruel. But it seems the narrator (Nelly) is a bit too perfect.The bad: The plot can be a little too complex at times, and it's hard to follow. And the first four chapters... don't even get me started.I'm still giving it five stars because, in the end, it was worth the sometimes boring reading and slow pace. This book is definitely a classic that everyone should read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The story is narrated mostly by Nelly Dean who used to be a servant at Wuthering Heights but now has a job at Thrushcross Grange, another estate. The main character of the novel is a boy named Heathcliff who is an orphan brought to Wuthering Heights by its owner, Mr. Earnshaw. He has two children of his own named Catherine and Hindley. Heathcliff is soon favored over Hindley by Mr. Earnshaw. A bitter rivalry develops between the two boys which is only intensified later by the death of Mr. Earnshaw. Meanwhile Catherine and Heathcliff fall in love and it is this relationship which dominates the book.Catherine and Heathcliff meet the Lintons who own Thrushcross Grange. Catherine is welcomed by the Lintons but Heathcliff is excluded. Heathcliff disappears for three years because of a misunderstanding. During his absence Edgar Linton and Catherine marry. After his return Heathcliff's obsessive love for Catherine and his desire for revenge against Edgar provide all the necessary ingredients for a real tragedy.WUTHERING HEIGHTS can be looked at as a story about love and hate or good and evil. The characters are complicated and interesting. The literary quality of the novel is very high and it is easy to see why Emily is considered by many to be the best writer among the Bronte sisters."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a timeless classic, which will be enjoyed by generations to come. The dark Heathcliff and wild Cathy's characters are reflected by the dark and wild moors on which the book is set. An enthralling and passionate love story to be recommended to everyone."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I read this book when i was sick and asked my father to bring me one of his books. He brought me this one, and I could not put it down. I cried and wondered and thought about everything in it for days afterward. I still think about it. It was a whole experience, the reading of it, and taking it all in. i can understand why some high school people wouldn't just love it, but i think that has something to do with being &quot;made&quot; to read it. I read it before anyone made me, so reading it again was easier. I seriously think that it is one of the best books ever written..."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Charlotte, Emily Bront's elder sister, wrote that \\"Wuthering Heights was hewn in a wild workshop, with simple tools, out of homely materials\\". This makes sense when we learn that Emily Bront did not care for social life (perhaps due to her extreme shyness) and seemed to scorn the outer world, living contentedly in the bleak scenario of the Yorkshire moors where her clergyman father's parsonage was located. Thus, it was with these \\"homely materials\\" - the wild Yorkshire landscape and its dour inhabitants - that she fashioned her only novel, which is, however, anything but homely.... The book is at the same time beautifully passionate and completely spare in its imagery and the depiction of its characters. The narrative is multifaceted and skilfully employs the technique of using several narrators: Lockwood, the naive Londoner who rents a Yorkshire farm in his search for picturesque landscapes; the commonplace and down-to-earth witness to the novel's amazing events, Nelly Dean; Isabella, the scorned and unloved wife; and so on. Each of these characters lends his or her particular voice to the story, thus making it a sort of patchwork where there seems to be no \\"official\\" version - but which is at the same time seamlessly cohesive.One reviewer, surprisingly, goes so far as to say that Cathy married Edgar for the money (she belongs to the same social class as he does - it is Heathcliff, the slum waif, who is the outsider) and that Heathcliff takes the kid Hindley and teaches him to hate his father (incidentally, the boy that Heathcliff takes under his \\"care\\" is not Hindley but Hindley's son, Hareton). In order to be qualified for writing a review, readers should make at least a honest effort at reading and understanding the book.I believe that the biggest mistake that readers tend to make on approaching \\"Wuthering Heights\\", a mistake perhaps fueled by Hollywood, is to think of it as a romance or love story - which it only secondarily is. This is, above all, a family saga, spanning some three decades and concerned with one individual's revenge on the families he considers to have wronged him. It is also a portrait of human passions - love, hatred, anguish and grief - in a wild, desolate setting where the forces of nature cannot be kept at bay.All in all, a work of great strength and beauty. It would have done Emily Bront a lot of good to know that her masterpiece has at last received the recognition it deserves."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"this book has haunted me from the day i've read it. however i'd read it again because it is written so well. Heathcliff and cathy show a love so intense and deep that hatred creeps into those very soulls who once loved more. a story which unfolds gradually, emily bronte has shown immense skill and talent and in the end produced a masterpiece which will never be forgotten.be patient though, it gets too dark and slow at times. but do read it ........its definitely worth it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Although Wuthering Heights is written in very old english and is not easy to read, the story itself is very touching, romantic and parts of it is tragic.Heathcliff, an orphan, is raised by Mr Earnshaw as one of his own children. Hindley despises him, but wild Cathy becomes his constant companion, and he falls violently in love with her. When she will not marry him, Heathcliff's terrivle vengeance ruins them all - but still his and Cathy's love will not die.This is a book which gets quite intense and the relationships between the characters get quite complicated but it is a good book to read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This was required reading for my Senior English Literature (I was 17) and it was one of the many books that I enjoyed that year. It probably helped that I had read &lt;i>Jane Eyre&lt;/i> when I was 12 or so and again in the same English Lit class in high school. It helped me get used to the style and time period. However, as much as I enjoyed &lt;i>Jane Eyre&lt;/i>, I liked Emily's writing and story telling much better.It is tragic story about passion, hatred, romance and a love that reaches beyond the grave. If you haven't already, READ IT!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I have read many classics, I am an avid reader of them. I collect them all, and analyze which ones are truly classic. I got this book when I was younger than 10, which is pretty heavy stuff for a child. Yet I focused mainly on the actual misery of Heathcliff and Catherine, I think it is the most engrossing and provocative story ever. I also got nauseous from the constant &quot;happy&quot; storie that other kids were reading. I thought this book suits my deep, &quot;tortured soul&quot; kind of reader. I will always have this book on my top list, it actually is timeless. This book will make you yearn for the open moors and the old manor where Heathcliff falls in love with Catherine. It is the best love story I have ever read. If someone is overwhelmed by it, then I suggest to move to something a little bit more shallow. I know I follow this great example of literature in my own writings, which I hope to have published soon. Not for the impatient reader, that's for sure."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights met my expectations as well as exceeded them. I will admit i was tempted to give the novel four stars because of the difficulty in grasping the intricate intertwining of the characters. BUT I came to realize that the genius in the novel lies within the geniusly thought out symmetrical family plots. Many describe the novel as being very dark, but i , on the other hand, describe Wuthering Heights as being raw and original. Emily Bronte can only be marveled apon. How could someone with a secluded life, much as her characters lived, have such a great insight into these wild, but true characters? Its almost unbelievable, but I now give her respect, just as much as I have for her other remarkable sister Charlotte. Although Jane Eyre is still my favorite novel, Wuthering Heights is not far behind that coveted spot. READ WUTHERING HEIGHTS!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I'm fond of that novel because it tells you something about the dark side of man and besides that it's also a very profound love story. To be sure it is a really unusual love story because the two main characters never have a relationship like normal lovers have, they only become united after death. I very much liked that Catherine is close to us as readers. She is always present even though she is already dead at the beginning of the novel. But Nelly tells the story of her life and so it seems to the most natural thing in the world to talk about supernatural events and experiences. While reading the novel my feelings changed a lot, once I was very angry at Heathcliff, then I only felt contempt for Linton and his weakness. The novel is written in very thrilling way, you never know how Heathcliff will react next, he is so erratic. Even though Catherine is not an innocent person at all, you can feel with her and you can sympathise with her throughout the story. And although the character of Heathcliff is so mysterious and dark he attracts our attention in a special manner: He descends from a gypsy family and thus he represents the hidden and often violently suppressed sides of man."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights tells the tale of the passionate and jealousy ridden love of Cathy and Heathclif. Fate, social class, and family separates them. The tale has amazing descriptions, themes, and characters. Violence, passion, and envy are all themes in the book. It is inspiring and wonderful, truly intriuging."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The novel, Wuthering Heights, by Emily Bronte was a good story about the love two people have for each other, and how that love is never lost. From the time that they were young children, Catherine and Heathcliff always had a certain liking for each other, that turned into a deep love. When Heathcliff found out that Catherine may have changed her mind, he was crushed and he vowed to get her back. He used other characters to avenge his love for Catherine and to make her jealous enough to come back to him, one example of that is Isabella. The character of Heathcliff is a somewhat of a selfish and savage character, because he does anything to get back to Catherine and to avenge the hate that is shown to him by Edgar and Hindley. The character of Catherine seems somewhat of an innocent character, who is caught up in what to do, and whether money and status is more important or true love is more important to her. Heathcliff's return to his true love causes problems with her and shows that love can be painful and cause agony sometimes. The characters in this novel were well developed and characterized, which is important to me when I read a novel. I think that the novel Wuthering Heights shows the ideas and opionins that Emily Bronte had about love and how it can effect the lives of people. I found this to be a pretty good novel, a little confusing at the beginning though. I, however, in comparison liked the novel, Jane Eyre, by her sister Charlotte, better."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This novel has touched me deeply since first reading and I have enjoyed it many times over, again becoming engrossed in the characters with each new read, yet each time finding something new. A true classic. It is a little sad, though, that this great book averages four stars, the same rating as many of the comparatively poorly written, more contemporary but soon-to-be-forgotten fiction reviewed on this site. Not that one should confine oneself to reading classics, but at least recognize them for what they are."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights is an excellent story of love and hate. Both love and hate are powerful forces, but Bronte shows that loves conquers all in her book. I enjoyed this book and gave it a ten because Bronte shows that two people can be brought together in life and death. This book never has a dull moment once you really understand it, and from that point on, you fall in love with all of the outgoing characters. One woman is torn between love of a man and his money and love of a soulmate. Just because the soulmate is not rich, she will not marry him, and then starts the hate and jealousy. Even though the girl could not be with her soulmate in life, they are together after death. Bronte overall shows how revenge can drive a person to their graves, and how love always overcomes hate. -G. Davis"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"My overall veiw of the book is not an exciting one. I feel that it had a good story line, but failed to grab my attention through the whole book. Even though I didn't fall head over heals for the book, there are some aspects of it that I happened to like. As on page 230, where Heathcliif put Liton and Cathy out of the room and Linton feels the full affect of his rage and illness as &quot;his cries were choked by a dreadful fit of coughing; blood gushing from his mouth, and he fell on the ground&quot;. The fact there was blood in the excert didn't make it an eye catcher, but the fact that it was so well described. The way she wrote it made me close my eyes and visualize Liton at a door have an attack. I said the book was interesting as well as dull. The dullness happened to come at the very begining when Mr.Lockwood was the narrarator. The issue I had at the start of the book was the fact that the long and drawn out details of the kitchen. On page three, Emily Bronte took all my energy out of finishing the book. It seems as if she spent years reasearching design, and decided to put it in the book. She describes the floor &quot;of smooth, white stone&quot; the chairs as being &quot;high backed, primitive structures, painted green&quot;. Just to give you a taste, I only chose to write a few descriptions. but the book is filled with what seemed to me endless dribble of description."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Dear Readers, I found Wuthering Heights to be both depressing and uplifting in different ways. This book took very sharp turns in the charactor's lives. I found that this was what made this book so interesting. It is hard to explain my feelings on this book without giving away the ending, but I would recomend this book to every young adult. This book is about personal choices and in a way about moral values. The way that one person can learn from their elders. I feel that every young adult should read this book before going on their own."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Though Wuthering Heights was well-written and captivating, the plot line left a bit to be desired. The love, lust, revenge, and hatred all added up to a story resembling a soap opera. While the novel did present a powerful love story, it was one that fueled manipulative plots of revenge. Even so, the book was enjoyable. But eventually, the positive aspects of the novel were overshadowed and it became difficult to continue reading because of the layered plot. Bronte was a great writer, but her characters were merely two-dimensional entities whose goals in life were the direct result of love or hate. The story seemed somewhat unrealistic, simply because the characters seemed to represent extremes. So, while Wuthering Heights was very well-written, it didn't keep my interest.
