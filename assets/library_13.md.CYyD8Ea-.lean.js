This one is no different. If you're a parent who thinks magic is somehow linked to evil, pass this one up. If you're a parent who's going to be bothered by an anti-hunting message (for real, they exist), go read something else.The nameless narrator of The Magic Finger tells a story about her neighbors, the Greggs, who enjoy hunting for sport - much to her dismay. Having begged them to stop, she reaches the end of her rope and \\"puts the magic finger on them all!\\" in anger. The next morning, the family has begun to turn into ducks, growing wings where their arms had been. At first, the idea of flying makes this change somewhat appealing, but that changes quickly as the Greggs spot four ducks moving into their house - leaving them without food or shelter! They must learn to fend for themselves as ducks until an agreement is reached with the new \\"people\\" living in their house.There's more than one message in this book - first, the repercussions of not controlling your anger, as our narrator discovers when her magic finger is the cause of more than one incident. Second, the anti-hunting theme, which doesn't state that no one should ever hunt. It just says the girl is bothered by the Greggs' hunting for fun. Third, the family reaches an understanding of how the ducks felt, showing that at least trying to see things from someone else's viewpoint is good. There's plenty here, in this tiny book, to talk about with your child! Worth a read for parent and child alike.- AnnaLovesBooks"},{"Title":"The Magic Finger","review":"&quot;The Magic Finger&quot; is about a nameless 8-year-old girl who lives next door to the Greggs and can't stand their thoughtless hunting. So, when the two boys and their father return home with a young deer one day, she puts the Magic Finger on the entire family. The Magic Finger is like the evil eye, except the results from her spell are much more amusing.The curse doesn't occur immediately. The Greggs still have enough time to go out again that day and shoot some ducks. After their hunt, they go home with their twenty birds--sixteen are dead, but four continue to follow them home in the air. Although the Greggs try to shoot these four pests, they can never manage to hit them.When the family is getting ready for bed that night, something outrageous begins to happen--they're turning into birds. Furthermore, the four ducks who had followed them home have grown as large as humans with arms instead of wings. In the sudden turn of events, the Greggs lose their house to the wild ducks and must survive on their own by building a nest for shelter, searching for edible food, and avoiding predators--especially ones with guns.The Magic Finger is a wonderful book for 8 to 12-years-old and is short enough (approximately 64 pages with plenty of illustrations) to keep anyone's attention. I really liked the moral of the story, probably since I am a vegan and against hunting. The book isn't preachy, but there's certainly something to learn when the roles of human and animal are reversed."},{"Title":"The Magic Finger","review":"In this book, a little girl about 8 years old lived on a farm. She was an ordinary little girl with a magic finger that could turn stuff into what she wanted it to be. The Gregg family lived next door and they loved to hunt for geese, squirrels and other wild animals for fun. The little girl loved animals and didn't want to see them hurt. It made the little girl angry every time she would see them leave to go hunting. She tried to talk to the Greggs and convince them to stop killing the wild animals, besides they had a right to live too. They only laughed at her and continued to hunt. This made the little girl even more angry and with a flick of her finger a curse was cast upon the Gregg family. The next morning as the Greggs' woke up they discovered they had wings instead of arms. The hunters had become the hunted. This book was good for learning a lesson on treating others, whether human or animals, as you want to be treated. I love animals so this book had great meaning to me. My favorite character was the little girl because at times I wish I had a magic finger too! An easy, fun book to read for anyone with an imagination."},{"Title":"The Magic Finger","review":"The book is about a little girl who , when she gets angry , and points her finger at someone-powers are unleashed which really teaches the target a lesson.Once the schoolteacher is really nasty to her, and the teacher begins to turn into a cat.

I would highly recommend this book to anyone and the kindle format made it extremely convenient."},{"Title":"The Magic Finger","review":"The Magic Finger is an excellent book because it has some of the Roald Dahl magic. However, it does have a strange structure in that the main character acts as the narrator and isn't actively engaging in events for most of the book. She merely directs her finger at the people who make her angry and then we follow what happens to them after that.It is a little bit anti-hunting, which might not appeal to all parents, although I'm not sure Mr. Dahl intended it that way. I don't think young readers will notice the tongue in cheek edge to the ending though.It has a good lesson in seeing things from other perspectives and, as always, Quentin Blake's illustrations capture the whimsy effortlessly.I would definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"The Magic Finger","review":"I read this book called The Magic Finger.

Read this book!Maya, age 8"},{"Title":"The Magic Finger","review":"Have you ever done something by accident? If you did, you should read The Magic Finger. I found this book very funny. This book is about a girl and she puts her magic finger on the Gregg family. First of all, the magic finger is the girl's index finger. When the girl puts the magic finger on people her face gets bright red. When people see her put the magic finger on someone else, it look like this...(picture of lightning). Doesn't that look like lightning, but yellow? Anyway, the Gregg's names are Phillip, Lillian, and Mr. and Mrs. Gregg. All the boys, Phillip, Lillian and Mr. Gregg, like to hunt for food. They hunt for anything they find, birds, deer and other things. So, they found lots of ducks that day. They found 16 ducks and they killed them. Then four more ducks flew by and they all missed. So then, the ducks turned around and they shot, but they missed again. This book is funny because when they all woke up the next morning all the Greggs had wings and the ducks had arms. Next, all four ducks went into the Gregg's house. Then the ducks shut all the windows of the house. My second reason it is funny is, after Mrs. Gregg flew over to the kitchen window she saw the mother duck and said, \\"How dare she cook on my stove!\\" Also, Mr. Gregg saw the father duck take his gun and he said, \\"And look at the duck holding my gun!\\" William said, \\"One of them is lying on my bed!\\" Phillip said, \\"One of the ducks is playing with my electric train set!\\" Next, they made a nest to sleep in. That night it was rainy and windy. After that night, the Greggs were sitting up and they were staring. So, if you are feeling down, then you are going to want to read this book because you are going to laugh until you can't laugh any more!"},{"Title":"Foreign Body: A Tory Bauer Mystery","review":"An amateur female sleuth first-person-narrated cosy. This is the best of the series and I'd recommend starting with it if you're new to Kathleen Taylor. She fills in the back plot smoothly. I thought the earlier ones suffered from clunky dialog and implausible plots. Her detective, Tory Bauer is an overweight forty-something widowed waitress who has lived and worked all her life in a small town in north-east South Dakota. They go to Aberdeen or Sioux Falls for the excitement of big city lights. There are romantic comedy elements that may put you off if you're allergic to those ingredients. Chapters begin with \\"dear reader\\" type essays that invoke the great ones and ask what Kinsey Milhone or Miss Marples would have done. I thought it was an interesting gimmick myself. It's a few years since the last Tory Bauer book but Kathleen Taylor has a great WEB site still."},{"Title":"Foreign Body: A Tory Bauer Mystery","review":"Normally I truly enjoy the Tory Bauer series, however this book was a disappointment. When the suicide note said the victim was ODing and on what, and the note was read by our protagonist and others, then the note turns up missing and the ambulance driver asks what they thought she'd taken and the author couldn't come up with a better cover than deniability (said info theoretically being able to save a life) this was inplausable. The series frequently harps on how terrible it is to die. This was the first major contradiction. The second deals with the same note and the fact that our protaganists had BROUGHT UP the subject with the chaperone, then when the chaperone &quot;found&quot; it, it was as if the subject had never come up. No wonder I was able to find the book used and cheaply. The rest of the books, while having their own contradictions, were not nearly so glaring and I could more easily suspend disbelief."},{"Title":"Foreign Body: A Tory Bauer Mystery","review":"OK, I admit that I was already a Kathleen Taylor fan. Had I not been, FOREIGN BODY would have made me one.This is a tour de force for Ms. Taylor. Her descriptive skills are at their best as Tory Bauer, her protagonist, doesn't even go outside her own caf&eacute; in Delphi, South Dakota to get involved with another mess. The question is: Is it a suicide or is it murder? Tory and her best friend wannabe-lover, wealthy-librarian Neil Pascoe, try to sort the pieces of a puzzle involving the local Luthern minister, a visiting teen-age choir, and a local scalawag.As Ms. Taylor fits the pieces together, she builds her characters so completely that, when one finishes the book, he feels as though he is actually acquainted with the town and it's cleverly drawn citizenry.The Tory Bauer series was already one of the best in the contemporary mystery genre. FOREIGN BODY only builds Ms. Taylor's reputation as a master storyteller and skilled writer.When is Kathleen Taylor going to get her much-deserved Edgar Allen Poe Award?"},{"Title":"Foreign Body: A Tory Bauer Mystery","review":"Kathleen Taylor has done it again!

A young girl has attempted suicide in the Delphi Caf&eacute; and Tory is off in search of answers. I found a few problems with this, the sixth and most recent of the Tory Bauer Mysteries. I have always enjoyed Tory's introspective breaks in previous novels. They are often humorous and surprisingly insightful. But I think Ms. Taylor went a little overboard with this particular gambit in the first part of the story. It seemed to take too long to get to the meat of the tale. By the time Tory sits down with her friend, Neil Pascoe (they are a perfect match!), to discuss recent events, the story begins to move along at a more satisfying pace. There were several writing errors throughout the book. A few examples: In one sentence, the word make was used in place of the word may. \\"...lost on the our vast grid...\\". \\"...that it would to be up to me...\\". There were so many of these small errors it was a distraction. The print on several pages was faint and washed out looking. For people with normal vision, this probably doesn't pose a problem, but my eyesight is less than good and I had some difficulty with it. The story is a very good one and I enjoyed catching up with the folks in Delphi. It is a Not To Be Missed addition to this excellent series. I'm sorry to be so critical here, but I am hoping that word will get back to the publisher that Taylor's books deserve better editing and more attention paid to the actual printing process."},{"Title":"Foreign Body: A Tory Bauer Mystery","review":"This has not been an uneventful year for Tory Bauer and that is the biggest understatement of the century. In a period of seven months, she has become involved in six homicide investigations, began and ended an affair with a married man, and became the co-owner of the Delphi Caf&eacute; when her mentor and friend passed away. The new co-owner is a former stripper who drives her nuts and she fears to becoming romantically involved with her best friend because if things go wrong, she will lose a relationship she deeply cherishes.Just when it looks like her life might be getting back to normal, a girl dies in the Delphi's caf&eacute;. Leaving a note behind, the girl, in her letter, accuses the Reverend Clay Deibert of molesting her. The Reverend is married to Tory's cousin Junior and she does not believe Clay would do anything so horrendous. She intends to prove this and winds up getting involved in another murder investigation.FOREIGN BODY is a laugh out loud amateur sleuth novel that will appeal to anyone who likes an Agatha Christie like mystery with a twist of humor. The lead and supporting characters have all appeared in previous works in this series so readers will feel as if they are revisiting with old friends. Kathleen Taylor has a dry sense of humor, which comes out at unexpected turns in the voices of the characters and helps make FOREIGN BODY an enjoyable reading experience.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Foreign Body: A Tory Bauer Mystery","review":"How could this be happening again? Another dead, or to be more exact, almost dead body in the Delphi Cafe. This is definitely not good for business and poor Tory Bauer, overweight, over forty waitress and now co-owner of the only eating establishment in town can't believe she's calling 911, yet again. It seems that one young Swedish female member, Annelise, of the European Traveling Lutheran Youth Choir has decided to attempt suicide in the cafe by taking an overdose of aspirin, leaving behind a scandalous note that blames this desperate act on Delphi's own Reverend Clay Diebert, for molesting her. To make matters even worse, though rushed to the hospital in Aberdeen, Annelise dies, Clay's wife, Junior is Tory's first cousin, about ten months pregnant and convinced that he's been having an affair with someone, an old Delphi nemesis, Weasel Cleaver is out of jail and back in town wreaking havoc, the cafe's in real financial trouble and about to go under and if that's not enough, another dead body is found in the Reverend's office closet. Now Tory is on the case, trying to sort this mess out and as usual, when she begins asking questions and peeking into the lives of Delphi's finest citizens, secrets and lies start popping up all over town..... Kathleen Taylor has done it again, written another fast paced, entertaining page turner that begs to be read in one sitting. Her engaging plot and crisp, witty and often irreverent writing are only outdone by her wonderful cast of quirky, wacky characters and you're sure to be laughing out loud at their antics and her vivid side-splitting scenes. This is the sixth installment to a terrific series. If you're new to Tory and company, start at the beginning with Funeral Food and read them all. If you're already a fan, you won't be disappointed this time out. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Foreign Body: A Tory Bauer Mystery","review":"\\"I've always wondered how fictional sleuths manage to view the continual mayhem with equanimity. I mean, you never saw Hercule Poirot or Miss Marple turning primly away from those who unexpectedly ingested cyanide. Kinsey Millhone didn't run for the can with a hand clamped over her mouth every time she came across a gunshot wound. Even Cecil Younger, a sort of ordinary small-town guy, seemed able to view bodily remains with a calm resignation that was more sad than anything else. They were able to see the unspeakable and process the unimaginable and unravel the Gordian Knot every ten months or so (depending on publishing schedules,) and most of them seemed no worse for the wear (well, Cecil got battered about a bit, but he persevered too.)I suppose that the operative word here is FICTIONAL.Writers can make up whatever they want, and their poor creations have no choice but to deal with the overflow. That's how it works in fiction. Characters discover bodies, they investigate deaths, and they solve mysteries and then enjoy a bit of downtime between each installment.In real life, you'd never expect to find an overweight, widowed, caf&eacute; owner in a small plains town, unfortunate to have tripped over (in one way or another) six bodies (several at her place of business) in less than seven months.I doubt you'd expect her to have been able to solve the underlying mystery of each of those deaths in short order while simultaneously trying to sort out her decidedly messy personal life and support herself in the trailer-house manner to which she'd become accustomed.And you'd certainly not expect her to have to face the whole process again barely a month after the last grizzly discovery.If I was reading the story of my life, I'd have a hard time believing it myself.Welcome to my world.\\"That's how Tory Bauer, reluctant and self-effacing heroine of Kathleen Taylor's excellent mystery series, describes herself in the newest visit with her and the folks in Delphi, South Dakota.

I was very upset that Romantic Times Magazine gave this book a 2 rating claiming that there was no mystery until the middle of the book and the antics of the characters were just too much to stand.

The characters are like old beloved friends that even if there wasn't a mystery I would keep coming back just to visit with them and enjoy Kathleen Taylor's writing style.

It tell a true story in about a courageous woman. She was born in 1897 and was raised with 2 sisters in South Philadelphia. Her father passed away and soon after the passing of her daddy she quit school. She did have a very close relationship with her mother. She did love to sing in her church choir. Ms. Anderson grew up to be a very private person that lead a very public life as a helluva singer. This book was mainly written to tell about Marian Anderson and one event that changed history. Ms. Anderson was denied the right to perform at the constitution hall in Washington because it was owned by the DAR Daughters of the American; they did not allow black people to sing in their hall. This after selling out millions of shows all over Europe. Well Ms. Marian did not let that stop her, she did perform. In fact she performed for 75,000 plus people and was syndicated on the radio, performing at the Lincoln memorial. No it was not fair but that did not stop her and she went on to do great things. That is what this book does is gives you hope and drive to do what you want to do regardless of obstacles."},{"Title":"The Voice That Challenged a Nation: Marian Anderson and the Struggle for Equal Rights","review":"Marian Anderson's struggle for civil rights is told in this story about her life. Throughout her life she showed people that anythig is possible if you believe. She has an amazing voice which she uses to capitvate the hearts of many. Russel Freedman uses her life story to inspire and demonstrate that Ms. Anderson's life had truly had a voice. In 1939 she performs in front of 75,000 people in front of the Lincoln Memorial where she changed history for many people.This book is a Sibert Medal Recipient."},{"Title":"The Voice That Challenged a Nation: Marian Anderson and the Struggle for Equal Rights","review":"Freedman, a multiple-Newbery winner, has done it again with this insightful and balanced portrayal of a brave woman with a beautiful contralto voice. Anderson broke several racial barriers, becoming the first black person with a major recording contract and the first black soloist at the New York Metropolitan Opera. But she is most famous for a performance at the Lincoln Memorial on Easter Sunday, 1939. Freedman's most engaging chapter tells the story of this concert, which took place because the original auditorium sought, Constitution Hall, was barred to her.The Hall belonged to the group Daughters of the American Revolution, whose policy was \\"white artists only.\\" Anderson was world-class, having performed just about everywhere but Constitution Hall, but the DAR stuck to the policy despite solicitation by politicians, academics, and musicians from around the world. After Eleanor Roosevelt got involved (she quit the DAR over the issue), Anderson was scheduled to sing a free outdoor concert at the Lincoln Memorial, a few hundred yards from Constitution Hall. 75,000 people present and millions over the radio heard her sing, and the concert changed history. The DAR eventually dropped its policy.Freedman tells Anderson's story with a steady focus on his subject. He does not get lost in moral outrage when describing the cruelty of Jim Crow laws, which mandated separate areas for \\"coloreds\\" in public places such as restaurants and train stations, but uses documented events to point out the injustice. Once, the world-famous diva was forced by an official to exit through the \\"colored\\" section of a train station after she had already been greeted by a cheering crowd which included reporters and photographers. Freedman's quiet appreciation for Anderson's courage and dignity is evident throughout, and the reader closes the book with insight into both the life of an accomplished singer and the peculiar culture she lived through and beyond (Anderson died in 1993, at age 96).The book includes numerous photographs of Anderson and her family, news clippings, and other documents. The pictures of \\"colored only\\" signs speak for themselves, and the family photos, including Anderson's baby portrait, reveal something of African American family life in Philadelphia well before the Civil Rights era. Suitable for middle and secondary school readers, especially those studying Martin Luther King and other black leaders."},{"Title":"The Voice That Challenged a Nation: Marian Anderson and the Struggle for Equal Rights","review":"Writing a biography of a private person who led a public life is, by definition, difficult. So it only stands to reason that writing a children's biography of a private person who led a public life would be ten times as hard. Children's biographies cannot speculate over the sex life of the subject. They can't delve into shoddy rumors or dredge up conspiracy theories related to the person's sordid background. None of this is to say that Marian Anderson had such sketchy rumors floating about her person, of course. By all accounts she led an exciting life, had a fabulous career, and is regarded as a great American hero. But she was also a private person, which places Russell Freedman in a difficult position. As the author of, \\"The Voice That Challenged a Nation\\", Freedman's job is to tell Anderson's story while relying on as many good, strong, clean facts as he can get his hands on. Fortunately, we're talking about the premiere biographical children's author here. Alongside fellow genius James Giblin, Freedman knows exactly how to present a life this interesting and detailed. The book will not charm every child assigned it in school. But if you've a kid who's open-minded and able to get into Marian's struggle, this is an excellent resource. Even if, prior to this book, they couldn't tell Marian Anderson from Ella Fitzgerald.The book opens with what is inarguably Anderson's greatest moment in the public eye. She stands on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial with a crowd of 75,000 people below her, waiting to hear her sing. The date is April 9, 1939, and Anderson has been refused the chance to perform at Constitution Hall. Anderson is black and the DAR (Daughters of the American Revolution) is inherently racist. With this concert, under the shadow of Lincoln himself, Anderson gives a heckuva performance that stands as a dignified response to racism in America. It goes very well and from here we shoot back and see Ms. Anderson's life in full. From her early days as a choir member in Philadelphia to her triumphant European tour in the early 30s. Certain aspects of Marian's life repeat themselves. She was wholly dedicated to her mother and took her everywhere. She was uncertain of her own talents at times but continued to sing and conquer. Freedman expertly weaves fascinating aspects of Marian's life (example: her high school boyfriend waited some twenty years to marry her) with factual information about the times in which she lived. Kids who read this book learn just as much about Jim Crow laws and deeply imbedded segregation as they do about Ms. Anderson's life. By the end of the book you find yourself emerging with a fascinating look at a truly great woman.Freedman follows up this book with an extensive bibliography (which gives props to fellow fabulous child biography, \\"When Marian Sang\\" by Pam Munoz Ryan). There's also a discography, a series of picture credits, and a wonderful index. It seems petty to demand that an author (or publisher) bend even farther backwards after producing such a gorgeous book, but I was a teensy bit sad that \\"The Voice That Challenged a Nation\\" didn't have a small cd accompanying it. When you read a quote, like the one from opera and concert singer Jessye Norman saying that, \\"If the planet Earth could sing, I think it would sound like Marian Anderson\\", you want to hear that voice. Not just read about it. But as I said, them's small potatoes. As it is, this may be one of those few children's books that inspire kids to search for Marian Anderson recordings on itunes (which has a lovely selection, by the way).With some authors, you know to trust them. You pick up their latest work without a smidgen of doubt in your mind that what you're about to peruse is going to impress you. After Freedman won my respect with his glorious, \\"Eleanor Roosevelt: A Life of Discovery\\" (Eleanor shows up quite a lot in this book as well, I'm pleased to report), I expected nothing but the best from his Marian Anderson bio. And the best it is. A fine selection for any library, whether personal or public, anywhere."},{"Title":"The Voice That Challenged a Nation: Marian Anderson and the Struggle for Equal Rights","review":"\\"This will be the day when all of God's children will be able to sing with a new meaning, 'My country, 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing.

That refusal led to Marian performing instead from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial for a crowd of 75,000 people on the Mall and a nationwide radio audience.She stood up tall where Martin would stand a quarter-century later and led off her performance with a rendition of My County 'Tis of Thee.Her performance is seen as a historic event at the dawn of the modern Civil Rights movement.Two years ago, Pam Munoz Ryan and Brian Selznick created the stunningly beautiful 40 page picture book, WHEN MARIAN SANG (Scholastic Press, 2002), which won all sorts of awards including a Sibert Honor.Now Russell Freedman has written a beautiful and more detailed biography of Marian Anderson which will similarly captivate readers with its engaging text and its clear, oversized photographs of the singer herself and of supporting characters in the story of Marian Anderson.The most precious of those supporters were also some of the earliest. Through the chapters focusing on her earliest years, I was moved by Freedman's portrayal of how Marian's childhood community came through time and time again to insure that her dreams would not be in vain:\\"Again there was no money for lessons. Most of Marian's earnings from concert appearances went to her mother, who was still taking in laundry and scrubbing floors, and to her sisters, who were still in school. And again the congregation at Union Baptist Church came to Marian's aid, organizing a benefit concert that raised $566 so that she could study with Boghetti.\\"Equally moving is the subplot of her life that involves Orpheus Fisher:\\"I don't wanna wait in vain for your love\\" --Bob MarleyHaving had to quit school after eighth grade in the wake of her father's death, Marian did not complete high school until she was twenty-four. It was during her delayed high school years--back when America was engaged in the First World War--that Marian met Orpheus Fisher who, \\"like her, was still in high school. He fell for the shy singer with the soft laughter and huge sparkling eyes who was almost as tall as he...\\"Decades later, America was midway through the Second World War when Marian finally relented and married Orpheus, who has tirelessly and faithfully pursued her all those years, while she was single-mindedly focused on her career.And what a career it was:\\"During one ten-month period she gave 123 concerts in fifteen different countries, performing a repertoire that included over two hundred songs and arias in German, Italian, English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Swedish, Finnish, and other languages.\\"It must have been amazingly disheartening for Marian Anderson to return home from entertaining European royalty and once again come face to face with Jim Crow. Like black sports stars of that era, Marian faced dangerous and humiliating conditions when traveling and performing around some regions of our \\"sweet land of liberty.\\" And yet, in photos, she appears both to have left that all behind and to be channeling some kind of higher power as she sings.\\" 'It was music-making that probed too deep for words.' \\"Marian Anderson remains a symbol of the historic fight to let freedom ring for all Americans. In VOICE THAT CHALLENGED A NATION, Russell Freedman goes far beyond the symbolic to provide us a memorable look at the life of a singer whose talents knew no bounds."},{"Title":"The Voice That Challenged a Nation: Marian Anderson and the Struggle for Equal Rights","review":"Award winning author Russell Freedman published this biography of African American vocalist Marian Anderson in 2004. I selected it as background to the novel that I'm working on and was not disappointed.Anderson was born in 1897 and grew up in the ethnic neighborhoods of south Philadelphia. Her mother was widowed when she and her two sisters were young; her father was injured in an accident at the Reading Terminal Market where he worked as a front loader. (On a personal note, my German grandmother would take me and my brother and sister to the market once a year to buy delicacies from home. I can still remember the crammed rows of stands that sold sausages, chocolates, breads, and cheeses.) Her church recognized her talents as a contralto when she was only 8 years old and helped raise the money that she needed for lessons. Her instructors included Guiseppe Boghetti who was moved to tears after hearing her sing, \\"Deep River.\\"In the 1920's Anderson began touring the country singing at black churches and colleges. She received a boost in her career when she beat 300 rivals and won the prestigious the Lewisohn Stadium competition in 1925. But her performances in the United States were mostly to fellow African Americans; and she knew that her career would never advance unless she had a wider audience. She decided to go to Europe to study Italian and German so that she could be better equipped to sing operas. During the 1930's Anderson was enthusiastically received by heads of state and famous composers in Scandinavia, Germany, Austria, and Russia. Arturo Toscanini, a very well-known conductor, heard her sing and said, \\"Yours is a voice such as one hears once in a hundred years.\\"But when Anderson returned home racism and prejudice still haunted her. She frequently received third or fourth class hotel and travel accommodations and even into the mid 1950's was blocked from walking unto a \\"Whites only\\" train platform in the Deep South. The pinnacle of her fight against racism occurred in 1939 when her manager wanted to arrange for a concert at Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C. The hall was operated by the DAR (Daughters of the American Republic) who had initiated a \\"white artists only\\" policy in 1935. First lady Eleanor Roosevelt resigned her DAR membership and public outrage followed this act of outright racism. As a result, Anderson performed for 75,000 people in front of the Lincoln Memorial: establishing the Memorial as the \\"moral high ground\\" for protest rights. You can view a short video of this event at: [...] . From that website you will find links to other historical videos, including her reminiscing about her hero, Roland Hayes .Although Anderson did not begin her singing career in order to combat racial injustice, she tenaciously conquered many racial barriers. In recollecting the 1939 concert she said: \\"I said yes, but the yes did not come easily or quickly. I don't like a lot of show, and one could not tell in advance what direction the affair would take. I studied my conscience. .... As I thought further, I could see that my significance as an individual was small in this affair. I had become, whether I like it or not, a symbol, representing my people.\\"When I listened to this book on CD, I wished an audio clip of her singing had been included. Middle school and high school students will appreciate reading this book and teachers should consider using it as a resource for Black History Month. I.

The smile she has while she's singing, the triumphant look in her eyes as she receives her doctorate at ninety are all elicited from the pictures in this book.

The name sounded vaguely familiar, but I couldn't have told you who she was. When I think of the Civil Rights movement, I think of the main people associated with that- the ones you learn about in school- Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks and the Montgomery, AL bus boycotters, the lunch counter sit in crew and Malcom X. I'd never thought much about performers and the impact they might have.Marian Anderson was a young black woman who loved to sing. She sang in her church choir, and after a series of sacrifices made by both her and the members of her community and congregation, she was able to begin a successful singing career in the time when very few people who weren't ethnically Caucasian had a chance. Her abilities as a vocalist and her wide international fame made it possible for her to take a stance on equal rights and have people listen.As her fame grew, she refused to sing for segregated audiences, and when Constitution Hall, owned by the Daughter's of the American Revolution in Washington D.C. refused her the chance to preform because she was black, she and her good friend, Elanor Roosevelt (the first lady) staged a free concert on the steps of The Lincoln Memorial.She was an incredible woman, who didn't apologize to anyone for who or what she was. She had a firm sense of self, and a strong character. Reading this book, I was amazed at the impact she had on moving the Civil Rights Movement forward.This isn't the first Freedman biography I've read, and I have to say that I like his style. It's easily accessible for younger kids, but contains enough information that they are a great starting place for adults as well. He uses a lot of photos to illustrate his points, and they really help to bring the subject of the biography (or photobiography) alive.I read this book because it won the 2005 Newbery Honor Award, but it's a great book to read if you are interested in her life, classical singers, or the impact of some of the lesser known, but still influential, members of the Civil Rights Movement."},{"Title":"The Voice That Challenged a Nation: Marian Anderson and the Struggle for Equal Rights","review":"This book was written for young adults, but it is an excellent introduction to Marian Anderson, her tremendous five-octave voice, and how her voice and life became part of the civil rights movement.

Check out some of her recordings - though not all her albums are available, some of the ones that are still allow you to experience her impact. I can never hear \\"My country, 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty...\\" without thinking of her, and this book reveals some of the emotions behind her singing this song at the Lincoln Memorial.SpiritualsNegro Spirituals 1924-1949"},{"Title":"Colloquial Russian (Colloquial Series)","review":"As a foreign language teacher, I am always picky when choosing materials to teach myself a new foreign language. I was pleasantly surprised with this book. Many books just spend a lot of time repeating random words or tediously try to explain the very complicated Russian grammar BEFORE you even get to start speaking the language. What I liked about this book is that it teaches you these things but through a realistic, written dialogue. They use many cognants (words that sound the same in both langauges) to start you off and have a handy vocab key next to the dialogue in case you cannot figure something out. The grammar and reading comprehension activities following the dialogue are thorough. I also like how the chapters of the book are divided up by theme or topic rather than grammatical concepts.

It's set in a way where one is not jumping from place to place in the learning of Russian grammar, like textbooks I have used in the past. The book gives a little bit of help in learning Russian, step-by-step, showing grammar, dialogues one may encounter, and exercises that aid in learning.The only (and minor) gripes I have with the book are merely aesthetic. It is written for an English (UK) reader. In other words, the English translations are more British than American. It's not a terrible problem, but translations for an American (like myself) do sometimes sound odd. There are many examples. The other is that it is Moscow-centric. I know many people will probably be going to Moscow or through Moscow on trips, and Moscow is a major tourist destination, but my personal urge is to go to St Petersburg, a place I have learned about immensely. I wish the English-to-Russian dictionary was larger. These are only based on opinion, which doesn't detract from how much Russian I have learned by using it.Get the DVD/Book set, which comes in a plastic case.

The author effectively captures the excitement that the new music generated and the cultural revolution it spawned. The chapters on the early years, 1947 and Jump Blues, the 1950s and Elvis, and so on, were excellent and made me want to go out and buy some of these records. Believe me, no book has ever made me want to buy an Elvis recording, but this one has. Most of the book is taken up with the 1940s-60s, and are the best parts.

People talk about the artists of this era as if they were deities, gods among men whose raw artistic power dwarfs the mere mortals who descended from them. Listening to this sort of rhetoric on oldies stations, or the canned VH1-style clich&eacute;s of deification can make one retch. At the same time though, there's a powerful truth to the notion that Little Richard, Chuck Berry, Elvis, the Beatles, the Grateful Dead, and the Rolling Stones really did participate in something special, something which could only happen once, and had a permanent impact on human culture.\\"Flowers in the Dustbin\\" is historian-journalist James Miller's attempt to provide a level-headed, yet exciting history of Rock n' Roll in the 50s, 60s, and 70s which portrays the musical zeitgeist of this era without buying into its mythology. Although Miller spends plenty of time documenting musical innovations and important Rock personalities, his true objective is to explain where Rock n' Roll came from, why precisely it became such a massive cultural phenomenon, and how it helped spark young peoples' desires for social and political revolution. For Miller, Rock n' Roll occurred at a unique cultural moment which probably will never be repeated again, but, at the same time, he clearly believes that a look at the history of Rock n' Roll is absolutely necessary in order to grasp why our culture evolved along the path that it did. I briefly met Miller while visiting the NSSR, and I was charmed by his wit and energy, which he certainly brought to \\"Flowers in the Dustbin.\\"Miller beginss the book with an examination of various elements within American popular music which prefigured the birth of Rock n' Roll. The birth of Jazz itself already possessed hints of the Rock ethos. The music of Louis Armstrong, during Jazz's popular inception, was considered daringly sensual in a way that was outside of the reigning cultural standards of white America. Perhaps just as importantly, Armstrong himself was a representation of the desire for hedonism and revelry which lived under the surface of American life. However, it wasn't until the post-WW2 1940s when these musical and cultural elements of American music began to converge into a unified style. Jump Swing and Jump Blues were each styles of music which were stripped down and drove harder than their predecessors. Leo Fender's mass-produced electric instruments started to come into prominence with songs such as \\"Tennessee Waltz\\" by Pee Wee King and Redd Stewart, thus bringing an air of futurism to popular music. The concept of \\"rocking out\\" could already be seen in songs such as \\"Good Rockin' Tonight,\\" and the sexual bluntness of stars such as Wynonie Harris. Some music businessmen, most namely Ahmet Ertegun of Atlantic Records fame, became increasingly aware of the appeal \\"blackness\\" had for white audiences. Interestingly, the racial divide in music wasn't just a case of white people appropriating black music. Many black teenagers began to listen to grittier, older blues recordings, and identified with them to a greater degree than they did with their parents' favorite Jazz musicians. However, \\"black\\" stations generally refused to play this sort of music- it was \\"white\\" radio that black teenagers were driven towards, because white DJs, who played Delta Blues as a form of exotica, were the only people playing the music that black teenagers wanted to hear.When Rock n' Roll first came to be, it had the luck of circumstance on its side. New radio formats developed which began to play a short list of songs over and over again each day, in contrast to the older radio philosophy, which attempted to provide listeners with a musical smorgasbord. In what was perhaps the first Rock n' Roll style riot in U.S. history, Alan Freed, a black radio personality in Cleveland, put together a 6,000 ticket concert, mostly attended by black teenagers, and with a lineup full of Jump Blues bands. It was the first time that pop music had lit teenagers up, and also was an early sign of the growing age gap in popular music. Surprisingly, the earliest opposition to rambunctious rhythm and blues music did not come from white America, but rather from the black middle class and music veterans who considered this new crass wave of black performers to be both artless and detrimental to the image of black people. As Miller confesses, it's hard to say that they were wrong.The stories of Chuck Berry, Little Richard, and Elvis are far better known than the proto-rock n' rollers that preceded them, but his retelling of their stories is fascinating, to say the least. Berry and Little Richard are possibly the only two figures in Rock n' Roll history who truly lived up to the authenticity that countless rock stars strove for: They clearly loved the energy of their music, and although they were profoundly influenced by their predecessors, they did not seem to be imitating anyone. The same couldn't be said for Elvis, but he was a fascinating and genuinely energetic performer anyways. As Miller makes clear, there was no time when Rock n' Roll wasn't directed by the music business. Elvis was a shy, sensitive middle class Southerner who was remade into a wild hillbilly bluesman. Countless rockstars were \\"found\\" (created?) by the music business, many of whom were Italian-American, due to the \\"not quite white\\" status of their ethnicity. This is not to say that these weren't great performers and good musicians, but economic craftiness was certainly an integral part Rock n' Roll from day one.The transition to the British invasion occurred because of 50s Rock's inability to match the rebellious appetites of young people. American Rock n' Roll was becoming stale and showboaty, which did not at all match the riotous behavior of many Rock n' Roll fans, as was seen in the widespread rioting which was caused by showings of the movie \\"Blackboard Jungle,\\" a movie which portrayed Rock n' Roll excess (while trying to condemn it, actually!), but only succeeded in inspiring teenagers to go crazy. The British invasion began as a mutation of Rock n' Roll which was harder, faster, and more unabashed in its imitation of black culture than white American Rock music. However, the musical inspiration behind the British invasion had powerful effects on both sides of the Atlantic. In one of the most important yet unsung episodes of Rock history, Alan Lomax released the recordings of the deceased Delta Blues singer Robert Johnson. Johnson's music was more emotionally primal and gothic than any previously discovered Blues singer. Lomax traveled through the Deep South in search of Johnson, only to discover that he had recently died. In what would cement Johnson's legendary status, Lomax also discovered that Johnson had mentored multiple famous Blues singers. In fact, one of his \\"students\\" had been Muddy Waters, who actually sincerely believed that Johnson had received his incredible musical power from the devil- which as Miller suggests, is the possible source within American music which eventually led to the creation of the aesthetics of heavy metal and gothic folk. In the U.S., Marxist activists promoted and distributed Johnson's recordings as the embodiment of the proletarian spirit. These recordings, and the socialist politics associated with them, had a formative impact on both sides of the Atlantic. In the U.S., Johnson's recordings primarily inspired folk revivalism, which was led by Bob Dylan. Meanwhile, groups of British kids were starting to play Rock n' Roll with an unprecedented aggression, also inspired by Robert Johnson. Two of these groups were the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. Contrary to popular myths about their rivalry, both bands had a tremendous amount of respect for one another. The Rolling Stones actually attended an early Beatles concert (when Beatlemania was just beginning) and later claimed that it was one of the wildest shows they had ever seen, and subsequently, George Harrison was actually the person who first directed Decca Records towards singing the Rolling Stones.If anyone has any doubts as to the essential importance that drug usage had for Rock n' Roll, I highly suggest that they read this book. Drug use served both as a muse and as a cultural barrier to be crossed. Once Rock n' Roll became associated with drug use, there was no denying that Rock posed a threat to white bourgeois values, and that Rock symbolized a rejection of the militant social conservatism which ruled over the 50s and most of the 60s. Speed was already commonly used in the 1950s, but in British Rock n' Roll, speed and booze were rockstar muses from the beginning. Actually, it was a shift in drug use which drove the rift between the early performance-oriented Beatles and their more recording-focused mature years. Many know of the famous meeting between Dylan and the Beatles, and it is the one myth which actually holds up to scrutiny. Dylan's pot really did blow their minds, and it was pot which inspired them to move in a more recording-centric direction, before any of the Beatles had even tried LSD. The drug-addled phase of Beatlemania marks the point when Rock n' Roll fully embraced raw Dionysian creativity. More than a few people noticed the drug references in their songs. Needless to say, the Beatles went on to inspire tremendous changes in popular music. Once \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" was released, countless musicians were inspired by it. Bob Dylan himself was influenced by the Beatles' psychedelic work, which inspired him to start playing with an electric band. During the Monterrey Pop Festival, \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\" stylistic mark could be heard in the music of Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix. The Beatles had become a phantom patron saint of the experimental side of the 60s.Meanwhile, the Stones continued to represent fealty to the rough tough guy strain within Rock n' Roll, despite their embarrassing attempts at psychedelia for a brief period. Miller recounts the infamous \\"death of free love,\\" when the Hell's Angels murdered a concertgoer at a Rolling Stones show. However, Miller explains why exactly the entire affair was such a shock to the Rock n' Roll world, even the supposedly hard-living Rolling Stones. In Britain, \\"Hell's Angels\\" was a catch-all term for Bikers, which among whom the Stones had a huge following. What they didn't realize was that in the U.S., Hell's Angels were a violent, racist gang which, to say the least, did not ascribe to the free love ethos. To the shock of the Stones, but not to anyone who knew what the Hell's Angels really were, they murdered a black man for no particular reason, right in front of the stage. The Stones continued performing throughout the entire ordeal, with Jagger clearly disturbed and unsure of how to react.Miller goes into plenty of other acts in just as much detail, such as the Doors, the Grateful Dead, Marvin Gaye, and others. He has a particular disdain for the incorrectness of the mythology surrounding the Doors, and it is hard to blame him (but he does praise them as an important band that made good music). Morrison is retroactively remembered as a troubled introvert, when any serious examination of his violent stage antics and (non-)musical attitude show him to be nothing more than a stupid jackass, at least in this regard. I remember in high school how Doors fans would claim that Morrison had been intellectually influenced by Nietzsche's writings, as a justification for their idolization of him. This isn't exactly true- it was the keyboardist who was the Nietzschean, not Morrison. Andy Worhol and the Velvet Underground were far more successful in their explorations of pop nihilism, and were probably even more influential than the Doors, even though they weren't nearly as popular at the time. Worhols' Factory was a revolving door of vagabond rich man's daughters, failed art students, and total weirdoes. They made strange, off-the-cuff and sometimes nonsensical art, and interacted heavily with the art world. Across the United States, the Grateful Dead were led by a hippie version of Worhol, Ken Kesey, author of \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,\\" who organized an entire social scene around dropping out of society and dropping acid. The funniest thing I find about Miller's profiles is that it makes it easy to correspond different strains of Rock n' Roll with different kinds of drugs. The Beatles, Marvin Gaye, and the Greatful Dead each primarily used pot and psychedelics to varying degrees, which comes out in their more introspective styles. Warhol and the Velvet Underground were practically drowning in heroin. The Stones and the Doors were drunken speed addicts.Through all these groups, a common theme of raw self-expression emerged. Whether they were gritty sound experimentalists, joyful psychedelic hippies, or Rhythm and Blues enthusiasts, each band represented the conviction that society as it stood was cold and boring, and that self-expression must come at any cost. Although this was definitely a major truth of the era, and the ultimate source of its impact on world culture, the music business never entirely lost control of the process. Even at Woodstock and Monterrey, business paid close attention, and figured out how to profitably repackage the chaos.These explosions of creativity, sadly, contained the death of the 60s spirit. It wasn't long until people began to notice that different strains of Rock n' Roll had strikingly different social and musical attitudes, and the music business responded accordingly. \\"Albums\\" bands such as Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin were now marketed as \\"progressive.\\" The behavioral extremist strain of Rock n' Roll continued with the Stooges, and culminated in the Sex Pistols.One of the last hurrahs of Rock n' Roll universalism came to prominence with David Bowie. Bowie presented himself as sexually edgy, but also coated his act in a thick layer of theatrical irony. People went wild for him just as if he was an earlier rockstar, but something profound about Rock n' Roll's changing status was present in his musical philosophy. The second-to-last Rock act Miller describes is Bruce Springsteen. Springsteen had grown up on 50s Rock n' Roll, and was the first artist whose entire career was built upon Rock nostalgia. His working class background allowed him to give off an aura of authenticity, but at the same time, his rise was completely concocted by the music business, despite Springsteen's sincere creativity. Music journalists hailed him as a new Rock God who would usher in a new era of Rock fervor- which they did at the behest of record execs. In retrospect, Springsteen represented the institutionalization of Rock nostalgia. However, who could blame Springsteen? Rock's golden era was over, and was never going to come back. Despite Springsteen's Americanist nostalgia, Miller clearly sees a connection between him and Bowie. Bowie was a futurist, but his music contained a distinct understanding that the golden era of Rock was over, and yet, he held a twin desire to continue the Rock tradition. Perhaps the only essential difference in their social attitude towards Rock was that Bowie understood that the old Rock spirit was dead, and that we need to go forwards and try something new, while Springsteen denied that it ever died at all. It's hard to say who was right.Miller's last profile is of the Sex Pistols, but it doesn't tell the reader anything they don't already know about this band. He ends the book on an analysis with a bittersweet conclusion. Rock n' Roll has advanced to a global status, and in many ways, represents the heralding of a global culture. Each decade produces new, genuinely interesting variations of the genre. Miller reminisces on his time as a journalist for both Rolling Stone and Newsweek, and his often frustrated attempts at bringing original creative artists to the media's attention. However, searching for new and exciting artists isn't a hopeless endeavor by any means- certainly, My Bloody Valentine would have made John Lennon's head explode if he had listened to \\"Loveless\\" back in the 60s. Ultimately though, Miller has many reservations about the legacy of Rock n' Roll. From hardcore, to gangsta rap, and alternative rock, the music business has demonstrated its ability to allow just enough adrenaline and creativity to push things forwards, but never enough to allow for music to have true social meaning. One only has to look at Rage Against the Machine's embarrassing hopes at inciting a revolution to see this. Miller obviously understands that pop music was never going to create a \\"revolution,\\" but it at least used to represent raw, unrestrained objection to the alienation created by late capitalism, which one could hardly say about today's music scenes. I find that many of my peers, when faced with the claim that the 60s was a special time for Rock music, point out that good music has been made in every era (which is true), or they sneer that no one has the right to claim that anyone's music is better than another's (also true, in a certain sense). This, to me, is a heavily consumerist attitude towards music which sees music as a bank of mp3s stored on an iPod. As Miller argues with finesse and without pretentiousness, the end of the 60s spirit was a loss because it represented the end of a musical culture which was unusually vibrant, but also totally universal. It helped inspire sexual freedom, the initiation of the LGBT rights movement, drug culture, combating racism, and global cultural cross-pollination. There hasn't been a single historical moment anywhere which can compare (sorry Punks, but it's true!), and there probably won't ever be one again. This isn't obnoxious rockist romanticism, just the truth.I don't mean to give the impression that I totally agree with Miller. Miller clearly lacks the same intimate knowledge of the late 70s and beyond that he has of the 50s-early 70s. Going by his account, it sounds as if Rock and Pop groups from 1978 onwards aimlessly stumbled through a landscape that was entirely manufactured by the music business. I don't think that this is true, and for that reason I also highly recommend reading \\"Rip it Up\\" by Simon Reynolds, a history of post-punk. The modern shape of popular music was as much forged in this era as it was in the 60s, and active creative self-direction by artists in this time played a major role in shaping the ways bands tour, record, and play. Also, most artistically significant bands in the 1978-84 period were fully aware of the end of Rock's universality, but they also fully and consciously embraced the fractured nature of the post-60s genre landscape. If you read \\"Rip it Up\\" together with Miller's book, you'll gain a better grasp of the history of popular music than most critics possess."},{"Title":"Energy pricing in the Soviet Union (IMF working paper)","review":"Until I read this book, I had a shallow understanding of the rise of rock...blues and folk got together, Elvis put a white man's voice on it, and the rest became history. Well, there's a lot more to it than that, and this book fills in the gaps. It reaches way back to the early part of the 20th century and then moves forward, weaving together the various musical influences, technologies, and marketing schemes that came together to give us rock as we know it. It stops at the arrival of Bruce Springsteen in the late 70s, when The Boss \\"saved\\" rock and roll from the disco and bubblegum stagnancy of the era. My one criticism is the author's over-appreciation for the likes of David Bowie, the Sex Pistols, the Doors, and (in my opinion) other overrated acts."},{"Title":"Energy pricing in the Soviet Union (IMF working paper)","review":"This is an excellent book. Miller takes us to the behind the rock scenes where the real decisionmakers managed and provided our 'authentic' experience. Much of what we want from rock is pretty simple, just rhythm to dance to and some dreams to escape into. But rock's managers hyped it into so much 'more' than that. It's good and refreshing to read something that brings down the overblown edifice that rock is in many minds.A key scene in the book is when a be-feathered 'hippie' Jimi Hendrix runs into a record exec who'd known him a couple years earlier as a 'normal' rhythm-n-blues guy. Jimi sheepishly explains, \\"It's for the show.\\"Miller probably should've given punk some recognition that it was intended as a rejection of the indulgent, decorated, overly pretentious rock of the early 70s and late 60s. Yeah, maybe a short chapter on the Ramones woulda been nice. But I can see the point that they never had a big impact, never had the numbers.And as for criticism of Miller for stopping at the end of the 70s: I think that is perfect, since the rock 'culture' had really ended, split forever into multiple subcultures. In fact, the split had occurred in the early 70s, but Miller rightly marches on for several of the 'great hopes', the next Beatles, who never panned out."},{"Title":"Energy pricing in the Soviet Union (IMF working paper)","review":"Great information on the history of Rock and Roll. The book is well-written and readable. It is filled with lots of details unknown to many."},{"Title":"Energy pricing in the Soviet Union (IMF working paper)","review":"Miller is a great writer, and he conveys an authority about the history of early rock'n'roll that is impressive, but his authority falls off a cliff when he goes past 1975. He has no time for anything recorded after the death of Presley, which means that he essentially snubs everything in the last generation (or more) of popular music.Don't be fooled by the subtitle. Even if the book is supposedly about the &quot;rise&quot; of rock music, it is even more about the author's opinion that the music died off as soon as it &quot;peaked.&quot; While I can understand the point of view, especially as I get on in years and cringe at most of what I hear on the radio, to imply that rock music died in 1977 is the height of absurdity, not to mention a willful ignorance of history."},{"Title":"Energy pricing in the Soviet Union (IMF working paper)","review":"'Flowers In The Dustbin' (published as 'Almost Grown' in the UK) is a significant work. While James Miller seems caught somewhere between the erstwhile rock journalist and the detached academic, it's mostly a very good read.Miller is selective in his subject matter, but provides rich detail in that context, neatly exploring the emergence and evolution of the music and its recurring themes. He gives almost equal weight to the artists and the star makers (managers, promoters, producers and disc jockeys), always with due reference to the wider culture of the times.(Some of the criticisms in the Amazon customer reviews are facile, to say the least. Miller did not set out to author an encyclopaedia, nor a comprehensive history of the music. Thus, no chapter on Brian Wilson or Stevie Wonder or Van Morrison or Joni Mitchell - pick your own personal hero.)Miller makes plausible arguments about rock as a 'finished cultural form' and rightly suggests, to the chagrin of some readers, that the excitement and cultural dominance of rock in the 50s and 60s will not be experienced again. (Part of the excitement, of course, was simply novelty, which - by definition - can't be repeated.)What's missing, sadly, is a sense of continuing affection for the music. Miller is jaded and largely disinterested in the music that once made his living. Nor does he seem to believe that, although musical boundaries have blurred, great 'rock and roll' music is still being made. Rock - in its myriad variations - is in great shape and the standard of musicianship has never been better. Jim should get out more."},{"Title":"Energy pricing in the Soviet Union (IMF working paper)","review":"...This whole book is obviously one man's perspective and I didn't agree with all of it, but I respect Miller's choice of emphases and do understand his feeling that rock \\"died\\" a long time ago. His is a thesis that is at least internally consistent and does seem to hold together, although admittedly he is free to cherry pick the rock \\"historical moments\\" that make it thesis work.Any reader is going to find points of disagreement here. I always heard that \\"Rocket 88\\" was the first real rock song and I had never even heard of Wynonie Harris. I would have thought that the British blues-rock scene would have merited a little more attention. I would have teased the Deadhead readers about the bloated excess of their idols after about 1973.Most of all I would have given a lot more attention to the downtown New York scene of the mid to late 70s that included the New York Dolls, Neon Boys/Television, the Ramones, Blondie, Patti Smith, Talking Heads and so many other bands and personalities. These people invented punk music and also revitalized rock music. There was an enormous underground music scene throughout the late 70s, through the 80s and into the early 90s wherein music was issued by independent labels, played on college radio stations and listened to in small clubs all around the United States. Different college towns successively took centerstage and one or two of their local bands went richocheting onto the national scene, only to be gobbled up by the corporate music industry (R.E.M. is exhibit A) or to implode as their music-first principles collided with corporate unit-moving \\"principles\\" (too many examples to mention).Where Miller sees one long arcing rise and then an inexorable decline, I see shorter-term cycles. The music industry that we live with right now seems very much like the one that existed between Elvis's induction into the Army and the arrival of the Beatles in the US. Record-making companies hold the reins and one-hit wonders of minimal musical talent make insubstantial music that challenges nothing except perhaps good taste. Miller rightly laments the fragmentation of the once-united youth audience, but it possible that the internet may in the near future allow young people to make an end-run around the corporate shibboleth and \\"get together one more time\\"."},{"Title":"Energy pricing in the Soviet Union (IMF working paper)","review":"What an interesting book!

While interesting, this dry relating of information is preferable to the idea that very little music of note was created after the Sex Pistols, an idea that seems to grow as the book progresses. Elvis and The Beatles get their due but others whose impact was limited to style are favored over true originals. While Little Richard and Jim Morrisson definitely made an impact, were they true musical pioneers or was this a case of style over substance? The author is making a case for this concept and the idea of &quot;selling out&quot; is bandied about. Were classical composers selling out when they wrote for a fee or circumstance? I wasn't convinced."},{"Title":"Energy pricing in the Soviet Union (IMF working paper)","review":"Although &quot;Flowers in the Dustbin: the Rise of Rock and Roll 1947-1977&quot; uses a quote from the Sex Pistols for it's title, that seems to be the only credit given to the bands of the 70's. This book is yet another aging-boomer nostalgia trip for &quot;when music really mattered&quot; &amp; seems to think anything released post-Woodstock is worthless.The author, James Miller, was also responsible for the original edition of &quot;The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock and Roll&quot; as well as the recently televised &quot;History of Rock&quot;. His viewpoints haven't noticibly changed or expanded since his previous critical forays.Yes, we know how vital the early rock pioneers like Little Richard were. Yes, I'm sure the 60's seemed very earth-shaking &amp; cosmic in their implications for those who claim to remember them. But for those of us who discovered rock when Ziggy &amp; T.Rex exploded out of the denim-clad, stoned ranks of ...musicians, short shrift is given (as usual) to the cultural significance of glitter &amp; punk.Let's be honest here: in the overall scheme of modern media Iggy, Bowie, the Pistols, even the Monkees have all had a heck of a lot more resonance than any of Miller's psychedelic favorites. Really, how can you take a &quot;cultural history&quot; seriously when it gives many more pages to Elvis' death than it does to Led Zeppelin? It's not even illustrated with photos, which is a great loss considering the visual aspect of rock.If you're not pining with nostalgia for the 60's, skip this book.

Additionally, the novel comments philosophically on the failure of love, the difficulty of obtaining spiritual fulfillment, and the difficulties of attaining identity in Modernist America.There is so much that is interesting about the novel.

It argues however that ideas are indeed important to the party and sets out to provide a coherent outline of the political philosophies which have guided Labour - both in power and opposition - since the post-war period. Whilst aiming to provide analytical clarity on this point, the book does not seek to provide a binding canon of Labour thought; on the contrary, the editors express their desire to \\"provoke some debate\\" (3) and this they achieve through their judicious selection of contributors from academia, politics and journalism.The book's structure is clear, consisting in three parts, the first of which takes a look at Labour's landscape, from Old Left through to New, then to the Centre, then from Old Right through to New Labour, immediately positioning the current government's ideological leanings.In chapter 1, Anthony Arblaster characterises \`The Old Left' as strongly socialist, yet anti-Soviet. In favour of broad state ownership of key industries, Old Leftists such as Crossman and Foot were early proponents of a \`third way' between communism and unbridled capitalism. Arblaster also believes that the Left's over-dependence on the charismatic Nye Bevan did not provide the clear direction needed against the revisionist Right.Chapter 2, \`The New Left' by Mark Whickham-Jones charts the rise of key players such as Benn and Holland in the post-Wilson years. The chapter details how the New Left placed great value on economic efficiency, equality of outcome and sought greater mechanisms for democratic accountability and nuclear disarmament. This programme was not widely endorsed, and general disunity in the Labour party brought about the Bennite Left's decline in the early 1980s.Chapter 3 begins with an exposition of the difficulties of locating the middle ground conceived of as being the party's \`Centre'. At times, Noel Thompson argues, the party has lacked a centrist critical mass of support. Where identifiable, centrist discourse has been based on planning, organisation, and the public good, though recent developments have led to greater emphasis on competitiveness, entrepreneurship and the free market. Thompson refers to many post-war party manifestos to demonstrate his points.Chapter 4, written by Kevin Jefferys discusses \`The Old Right', based on revisionism and social democracy. Two main points permeate Jefferys' discussion: that social democratic ideology accommodated a good deal of fluidity and often disagreement; and that revisionist ideas, though often highly influential, were never fully endorsed.The next chapter by Matt Beech establishes New Labour as the \`new right', essentially a group of powerful modernisers and by no means the majority of the Party. Beech shows how New Labour's political philosophy is firmly sited in the economic and social globalisation thesis it holds to. Its approach to equality is arguably vague, though its communitarian emphasis is unequivocal and its conception of liberty, positive.The second section of the book follows, taking six key themes of Labour thought as they intersect traditional left-right positions.Raymond (Lord) Plant opens this section with his essay on the complex development of social democratic thought on \`Ends and Means'. Beginning with Marx, his discussion in chapter 6 progresses through Keynesian philosophy and culminates with questions surrounding the effect that globalisation is having on the very goals of social democracy.The topic of chapter 7 is \`Equality' and Kevin Hickson examines the differing attitudes towards equality expressed by various strands of Labour party thought. Of particular interest to any reader should be Hickson's challenging questions regarding New Labour's achievements on equality of opportunity and social inclusion as a result of their equality policies .The following two essays deal with Labour's economic policy. In chapter 8, Anthony McGrew shows how New Labour's response to \`Globalisation' represents a serious effort to engage with globalising forces, restructuring social democracy to fit the resultant conditions. The contradictions of globalisation are mirrored in the contradictions of Labour's policy responses.Chapter 9, written by Stuart Holland, further develops this discussion of economy policy in the context of \`Ownership, Planning and Markets'. Different from the other chapters with its \`story-telling' manner, the chapter nevertheless presents insightful first-hand accounts and viewpoints on developments in Labour's approach to public shareholding, Planning agreements and social contracts.Eric Shaw presents his view of \`Labourism' in chapter 10, examining trade union involvement in Labour from the perspectives of Marxism and what he calls \`Proto-New Labour'. Issues of class and the wider labour movement are debated and shown to be the basis of a useful conception of Labourism, as opposed to a stringent catch-all doctrine or ethos. That said, Shaw's conclusion is that the empirical significance of labourism as such is diminishing due to the repositioning of New Labour on the electoral spectrum.The topic of chapter 11 is New Labour's set of constitutional reforms. Dilys Hill takes a wide range of \`modernisation' reforms proposed to institutions such as devolved governments, parliament and the monarch, human rights and Europe. She argues that while the UK now boasts a more open system of government, the overall direction of these and further constitutional reforms is still not entirely clear.The last chapter in this section is Brian Brivati's contribution on the changing approaches of foreign policy in Labour's post-war years. Brivati points out how the positional terms adopted thus far in this book do not accurately reflect divisions in the twentieth century Labour party regarding foreign policy at distinct points. He contends that over the course of recent years, socialist internationalism has given way to patriotism, as well as ethical/Christian morality, and is now at the forefront of Labour's attitudes to organisations such as CND, Europe, NATO and recent armed conflicts.The brief final section gives space to five authors who would broadly adhere to each of the ideological positions identified and discussed in this volume. \`Father of the House' Tam Dalyell muses on how the Old Left might have responded to current domestic and international issues, while Frances Morrell, representing the New Left, seeks to establish the relevance of the struggles faced by Labour in the 1970s to today's party. Journalist Joe Haines suggests that Harold Wilson epitemised the centre of the Labour party while the most passionate centrist leader was Hugh Gaitskell. He concludes that \\"the centre is very British, very unspectacular, but it works. That is its justification.\\" (p.260), while the conclusion of Austin Mitchell MP, in his discussion of the Old Right, is that \\"Blair is the ideology but he hasn't any\\" (p.266) and \\"As the old politics return, the ideology of Labour's Old Right becomes relevant again. Finally Polly Toynbee and David Walker reflect on the recent years of New Labour government, asking pointedly if it has gone further towards the right than it \`needed'.Roy Hattersley's afterword draws this fascinating and significant volume to a close. The well-written and pleasantly readable essays fit together impressively, and successfully map the presence and development of ideology and substance in post-war Labour thought. Students of contemporary British politics, members and supporters (even opponents) of Labour - old or new, left or right - and laymen who wish to be informed will undoubtedly find this volume a vital read and a valuable contribution to future debates on Labour philosophy and policy.Darren J.

I definitely recommend this seller."},{"Title":"Understood Betsy","review":"This delightful tale marks Dorothy Canfield Fisher as one of those rare authors able to hold the sympathy and attention of adults and children alike. (C.S. Lewis was another.) Adults will enjoy the subtle humor and gentle irony, while both young and old will enjoy the deeply satisfying tale of Elizabeth Ann's growing confidence and awakening to the world outside herself. Fisher was a master storyteller, and aspiring writers could do worse than use this book as a model for good writing."},{"Title":"Understood Betsy","review":"I have 7 children and this book is an absolute favorite of all. Printed in 1917 it still adresses the unique child-rearing needs of all children if they are to grow up 'free and independent', a century old New England saying for self-sufficiency.In fact , my 76 year old father came for a visit and saw the book and exclaimed in delight &quot; This was one of my favorite books!&quot; And proceeded to read the whole book again. Actually it is a supreme parenting tool also,in novel form."},{"Title":"Understood Betsy","review":"Betsy, a very scared, overprotected little city child is unexpectedly sent out to her distant relatives, a farm family, in Vermont. Used to being conducted to school, sympathized with for every little disappointment she is sent off to school ALONE, given a kitten for which she is the sole care, and finds that a child is not just a burden on a family but a contributing useful member. All this told with humor and good outlining of character. At very end this shy child earns her own way home on a railroad after being left behind. She (and you) know she's going to make it!"},{"Title":"Understood Betsy","review":"... you will like this story.There were a few very small typos and the illustrations did not show up - which was kind of disappointing.I really, really enjoyed this book! If you like The Secret Garden or The Little Princess you will like Understood Betsy also. It is novella length. A perfect read to pick up in between some heavy books.I giggled. I cried. Sweet, sweet book."},{"Title":"Understood Betsy","review":"Elizabeth has spent the first nine years of her life being coddled by her aunt and grandmother in the name of \\"understanding\\" her. She's heard the horror stories about her cousins in Vermont who make children do dreadful things called \\"chores.\\" Then circumstances require Elizabeth to go live with those cousins, and she is terrified. Gradually, Elizabeth, who comes to be known as Betsy, grows physically, becoming hale and hearty, but also in maturity, largely because of her cousins' \\"common sense\\" approach to child-rearing. The nine-year-old who had never lifted a finger to do anything for herself that anyone else could do for her, much less done anything for someone else, becomes responsible and helpful. The girl who was once afraid of her shadow becomes confident and, when necessary, brave. The girl who mechanically repeated whatever she was taught in school learns to think and make applications on her own.There is a definite moral to this story. There are great lessons about hard work, self sufficiency, kindness to others, respect for elders, etc, but it's also a very enjoyable read. There is a wonderful sense of humor woven throughout the story even in the matter-of-fact tone with which the story is told. I've read this aloud to my older two children, ages 7 and 5, (with some explanations along the way) and they greatly enjoyed it, as did my husband who heard about half of it. I would highly recommend this book to anyone, but especially to those with children."},{"Title":"Understood Betsy","review":"Love the story of a sheltered girl who learns to take care of herself when forced to move to a relative's farm. Five star story.Unfortunately the cover you see displayed here isn't the one you get from Amazon, and the book quality isn't high. Instead this is a cheapo digital publishing volume. Reading the book electronically would, IMO, be better than this.I will be looking for this as a used book, because the story is a winner."},{"Title":"Understood Betsy","review":"I would highly recommend this book for young girls. I just finished pre-reading it for my 7 year old daughter and can't wait for her to read it this year! It has a great message and is a very wholesome book. It is about a young girl who is smothered and taken care of a little too much by the aunt that raises her. She suddenly has to go live in the country with different family members and she is terrified of the unknown because everything has always been made easy for her and she is scared to try new things outside of her comfort zone. She soon discovers that she is capable of so much more and is eager and confident to try new things and to rely on herself and her abilities. It has a great message for young girls, to believe in themselves and build confidence. Definitely a must read for young girls!"},{"Title":"Understood Betsy","review":"I don't feel this book is just for young girls. I read it at 9 yrs. old and now I have reread it at 63 yrs.

I wish it hadn't ended, I would like to know how Betsy's life continued on."},{"Title":"Understood Betsy","review":"This was one of my favorite books when I was a child. It's lost none of its charm in the last 40 years. Elizabeth Ann is the foster daughter of her aunt and her cousin in an unspecified Midwestern city. Aunt and cousin dote on her, and are more than a little overprotective -- the cousin is what we would call nowadays a \\"helicopter mother\\". When the aunt becomes ill and must move to the desert to recuperate, Elizabeth Ann is forced to go to \\"the Putney cousins\\", who live on a farm in Vermont. The taciturn but kindly Putneys gently but firmly force Elizabeth Ann to stand on her own two feet, and become the strong and self-reliant Betsy. As a 21st century urban mom, I am more than a little amused to see that the debate over the best way and place to raise children hasn't really changed in the last century. This is a book I strongly recommend to pre-teen girls. This Kindle version does have a few problems: illustrations are referred to, but aren't present, and there are several mis-spellings. Otherwise, two thumbs, way up."},{"Title":"Understood Betsy","review":"I hadn't heard of this book before. Having the Kindle library at my fingertips has opened the door to reading these sometimes over looked treasures.This book reminded me of Anne of Green Gables because of Betsy's orphan state. The difference is she lacked the independence that Anne had. Because the first set of relatives that Betsy had caring for her did not teach her to be independent but pampered her. While the second set of relatives had no idea that she wasn't taught to even do the simplist thing such as buttoning her coat. It is a remarkable story of Betsy's diligence to solve her own problems. This story also in a way reminds me of 'A Little Princess' by Frances Hodgson Burnett, also a great book."},{"Title":"Understood Betsy","review":"I so liked this book and really didn't want to put it down; it took me back to my childhood, making me understand why I was so afraid of things. People that loved me were afraid of some things and passed them down to me. I liked how it ended, but didn't want it to end as I enjoyed it so much; I hoped that the author would write another book about \\"Understood Betsy\\" and how she grew up and became aware that she could do things and giving her confidence in her life. I was cheering for Betsy towards the end, but sad I wasn't going to see more things she would conquer.Yah!!!! for \\"Understood Betsy\\" !!"},{"Title":"Understood Betsy","review":"This is a very simple, old-fashioned short novel that is very affecting. Fisher's writing flows well, is plainly adorned, and while the plot is a little predictable, it does not suffer from that at all. It's hard to say whether this is a young adult or an adult book, but at 67 years old, and with two degrees in English, I found it thoroughly enjoyable regardless of its intended audience.It has a classic plot line and characters who are simply, but fully drawn. Quite a few modern novelists could learn a lot from this little book.I also highly recommend it as a read-aloud for any children (but especially girls) from about 6-10 years old."},{"Title":"Understood Betsy","review":"i am so impressed with this book. a lovely read. had me tearing up a few times. i would highly recommend it. i love Betsey."},{"Title":"Understood Betsy","review":"I had never heard of this one before.

I think this is a fantastic book and would reccommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Understood Betsy","review":"some books are timeless. while the slang is a little dated,you can explain the meaning while you are reading this, this is as sweet as the boxcar children but written when your grandparents were children when life was slower and simpler. it even reminded me of the importance of giving your children tasks that will help them gain confidence perfect for 8 or 9 year olds to snuggle up with while reading a book that will stay with you a long time...very sweet and coming of age"},{"Title":"Understood Betsy","review":"If you haven't read this book, get it now and read it---you are in for a treat!

This one is a winner."},{"Title":"Understood Betsy","review":"I give this book as gifts to adult friends that I really care about -they might never find it on their own since Understood Betsy is disguised as a children's book. It is really a book to guide us through adulthood and keep us ever mindful of how blindingly clear the right decision is and what we need to truly thrive.Here's a teaser . .

It will take you a travel in the timeline to nearly 100 years ago to a farm in Vermont, and to adorable lives of American farmers, you will definately love this book and finish reading with a smile."},{"Title":"Understood Betsy","review":"I loved this book as a child, and young as I was, I was able to understand the lessons of allowing a child the freedom to explore, to experience, to take responsibility. I even remember noticing the children I knew who were being overwhelmed, like Betsy in the first part of the book, by well-meaning parents/guardians who did everything for them.I do not exaggerate that this book, by the woman who was instremental to bringing the Montessori method to the US, I understand, defined my thinking about how to rear a child."},{"Title":"Understood Betsy","review":"This was the first of these older books that I could stand to read, and I read it until the cover came off.Elizabeth is a supposedly delicate child (both physically and emotionally) whose parents died when she was a baby, and who has been coddled into a state of mild nuttiness by well-meaning, devoted aunts. When she fancies herself ill, a doctor is brought in. He finds nothing in her, but discovers that one of her relatives has tuberculosis.Elizabeth is hurriedly handed away to other relatives, the Putneys, who live simple, gritty, fulfilling lives completely opposite her own. Though she initially is horrified both by their down-to-earth lifestyle and their apparent ignorance of her (they don't see her as delicate), she gradually begins to enjoy it. She gains confidence, courage, and emotional strength, but then her doting aunt arrives to pick her up. Does she choose to go with her?"},{"Title":"Understood Betsy","review":"Dorothy Canfield Fisher is simply one of the smartest psychologists, long before Freud came on the seen. In her book, Understood Betsy, Ms. Fisher not only crafts a wonderful story of how a little sheltered and fearful girl under the care of one aunt, grows into an independent thinker, and joyful person under the care of her other relatives when the former aunt is taken out of the picture.Elizabeth Ann, known as Betsy to her farm relatives, was orphaned as a baby. Her city relatives scoop her up to save her from being reared by the 'Putney Cousins' (our heros in Vermont). But fate sweeps Elizabeth Ann away from the only woman who *understands* her, and takes her to the dreadful farm in Vermont, where children have been known to *do chores*. How does Betsy fare?That's the children's part of the story. For the adult, especially one who is unfamiliar with children, the lesson is given that you *can* love a child into the the fearful person you yourself are. But you *can* also love a child to let that child find things out for herself, and become aware, that she is aloud to find things out for herself. Isn't it amazing that children have brains, and they do not have to be programmed by 'pre-warning' them of every consequence to their behavior?Please read, and see Betsy grow into a useful engine (for those of you who know Thomas the Tank Engine). Please read and learn yourself, how to help your children, by learning to leave them alone to find things out for themselves....."},{"Title":"Understood Betsy","review":"\\"Understood Betsy\\" presents a picture of the wise and gentle relationships within a normal family during the second decade of the 20th century. Other reviewers have compared the management techniques of the Putneys to the teachings of Montessori. This simple farm family exhibited a great deal of sound understanding of how a child's mind really works.Interesting that without offering Betsy a lot of their completely undivided attention (as her anxious, obsessive Aunt Frances had done for the most of the little girl's previous life), her austere New England relatives managed by including her in their ordinary activities to make her feel loved, wanted, and \\"understood\\" in a way that she needed badly. Not only that, but in this new atmosphere her spirit blossomed until she herself was able to extend love, caring, and understanding to others. Being treated as normal, she grew into what her relatives expected her to be all along.And the story is believable. How many other children's books with a lesson to teach can claim that? How many other children's books portray the development of normal problem-solving skills in a largely uneventful life? There are no formulas here. Every chapter is an unexpected gift--unexpected, yet harmonious with the whole. You feel that it could really have happened."},{"Title":"Understood Betsy","review":"I have 7 children and this book is an absolute favorite of all.

Even though it was first published in 1917, it is very contemporary in it's message about the importance of gaining self-esteem through accomplishment. In this day and age when parents tend to hover and worry over every small concern, this book show how Betsy, when sent to a farm to live, became a very confident and happy child due to the adults in her life who let her stretch her wings. Many of the ways in which these adults gave her a new life are very subtle but moving. Highly recommended for mid-elementary girls."},{"Title":"Understood Betsy","review":"I know this book is packed with theory and is intended to give the readers some insight to the Montessori-style Education Theory. Nevertheless, in spite of the aforementioned this is a great read and if some theory is delivered by the way then this is only an extra bonus.Elizabeth Ann, who spends her first years with her ever worried aunt Frances is suddenly forced to move to the Putney family she always feared of living on the farm. This is a story of a personal growth, covering all aspects of a child's life - the growth is both mental and physical and is as enjoyable as the \\"Little House in the Prairie\\" books or other books of the kind (I mention the \\"Little House\\" books as for me that's the ultimate compliment).For me the pleasure and enjoyment have to do with the portrayal of the homey life and surroundings (a good example would be the description of the main room that at first seems ugly to Betsy and then becomes the most wonderful room in the world) and especially the account of food... personally I feel this is the first thing that gives the homey feeling. Which foods are served, the way the butter is churned and how Betsy learns to sweeten the apple sauce... this is what I love. Another major matter of enjoyment is the fast process of change in Betsy's thoughts, abilities and appearance to which the reader is a witness. Similar change happens in \\"The Secret Garden\\" where the fresh air outside coupled with hard work makes wonders.My only problem comes when I did try to return to theory and to try and adopt some of it to my life with my children. Off course anyone I know wants this natural, closer to nature life. How are you going to achieve it in our modern urban life is a different question. I know that the book talks more about the way and the process then about actually churning butter but I would like to churn a little myself...There is no doubt that life in the outdoor with a lot of physical activity does wonders to your body and soul, especially when small children are concerned."},{"Title":"Understood Betsy","review":"Nine-year-old Elizabeth Ann has lead an extremely sheltered life with her fluttery, over-protective aunts in an unnamed city in the midwest. But when one of aunts becomes seriously ill, this smothering influence is suddenly removed, as the girl is sent out into the extended-family pasture. Her fragile world is turned topsy-turvy as her despairing aunts pack her off to those dreadful, Putney cousins in distant Vermont.Astonished at being instantly called Betsy and suddenly expected to Do for herself--not to mention, for others--the girl finds herself helping with household chores for the first time in her young life. Over the months she blooms with health, intelligence, new skills, and compassion for others--this is surely the Vermont Cure! She gradually becomes the pride of the three old folks at the farm, a joy to her teacher and even a temporary big sister. Betsy is amazed to discover herself and her innate talents; she actually enjoys lending a hand and living life to the fullest. Betsy needs to exercise both her smarts, to get out of difficult situations, and her heart, to promote social justice. Settlinginto a simple but comfortable New England routine, she truly matures from a fearful, dependent Elizabeth Ann, into the lively and capable Betsy. But where will she ultimately be happiest? First she just wanted to be \\"understood\\" by her adult relatives, but finally she tries to do some \\"understanding\\" herself. After all, isn't that what people basically want--to be Understood (appreciated as and for ourselves) by those dearest to us? A quaint, gentle childhood classic set in simpler times, of particular interest to girls 9-12."},{"Title":"Understood Betsy","review":"I like to read old stories about young girls and this one was perfect.

Taste the maple syrup and feel the kitten's soft fur along with Betsy. This classic orphan story demonstrates the value of self reliance."},{"Title":"Understood Betsy","review":"Understood Betsy by Dorothy Cranfield Fisher is not only a wonderful story, it is an excellent example of superior fiction writing for adults and children alike. The story of a little orphan girl's experiences when moving from her overprotective aunts in the city to her very practical cousins in the country is not only a feel good tale; it is also very helpful for the beginner in child rearing. Betsy's adventures also introduce the inexperienced to the importance of self reliance and this is important because sometimes in life there is no one there to help you and not enough people ever learn this when they are young and some don't get old because they didn't. The cadence of the writing makes this a wonderful book to read out loud to younger children and its simplicity makes it a great gift for older children who can read it by themselves. It is a great story that adults can enjoy right along with the children. The literary quality of the writing made me realize how much I miss it in most modern literature."},{"Title":"Understood Betsy","review":"I read it over and over.Reading it as an adult I still enjoyed it, but I gained some insight as to why. This novel is about a young girl who feels that the world is a dangerous place and who goes around feeling vulnerable and apprehensive. The relatives who have cared for her have taught her to be frightened. self-doubting, and lacking in self-confidence. Betsy is saved by an illness in one of her aunts that requires her to go live elsewhere. The only option is to live with some other relatives who live in Vermont (in the country), and her aunts think this is not a good place for her to go but there is no choice. The Vermont relatives treat her like a normal and capable young girl who is expected to pull her share of the load.From them, and through her experiences living in the country, Betsy discovers she is competent and that the world is not so dangerous. She experiences love that is not suffocating. She builds self-confidence and self-esteem and becomes a responsible, happy little girl who knows that whatever difficulties present themselves, she will be able to deal with them. I also loved the family she went to live with and wished I could live on a farm in Vermont, too, and make maple sugar in the snow!This is a particularly wonderful book for girls because it is about discovering one's own competence and abilities. I would put it in the same category as &quot;Brave Irene&quot; by Steig, only this book is for the 8-12 year old range, I think."},{"Title":"Understood Betsy","review":"In the beginning, as Peggy Parrish puts it, Elizabeth Ann was a wimp.She was sent to her cousins, the Putneys, in the middle of her story. They began to teach her how to think for herself.By the end of the story she could think about anything she wanted to without explaining it to anyone. This is a very well written story. It's a wonderful book relating to life at the turn of the century. It shows how schools, homes and lifestyles have changed over the years. This is one of the top ten books on my personal list.I received this book as a Christmas present in 1997 when I was eight years old. I thought it was an excellent story because Betsy really improved in her new one-room school. Her teacher is really nice because she let Betsy read with the seventh graders, do second grade math and third grade spelling!This story really makes you feel like you are Betsy's friend Ellen. I also like how she and the other girls in her one-room school joined together to make new clothes for the boy whose stepfather is an alcoholic. All the people are really caring in this book."},{"Title":"Understood Betsy","review":"The last word of _Understood Betsy_ is &quot;Happiness&quot; - and yet here I am, crying. A bit like the _Little House_ books, _Understood Betsy_ gives nitty gritty, realistic details of what daily life was like for a little girl living on a small farm in Vermont in 1906. Betsy herself is just as fascinated to hear about what life was like before she was born, when lead pencils were cast in a groove on a desk in the schoolhouse, as I was to read the descriptions of Betsy learning to manually mold and churn butter. Yet all this history is purely incidental to Betsy's story. One year with her no-nonsense country relatives transform Betsy from a fearful, sheltered nine-year old into a confident and responsible ten-year old. The gentle irony of the narrator's voice allows us to identify with Betsy's insecurity and self-pity, while realizing that her apprehensions are merely silly notions planted in her head by overprotective aunts. Though Betsy may at times feel abandoned and bewildered, she is surrounded by love, and has the common sense to snap out of her brooding whenever something interesting happens. I cried so much that watching me, you would have thought the book to be quite tragic; but the tears were tears of pride and happiness for Betsy. What a great book :-)"},{"Title":"Understood Betsy","review":"Oh how I wanted to be Elizabeth Ann when I was little and first read this book! First of all, I thought that Elizabeth Ann was far and away the most beautiful name I had ever heard in my entire life. And I definately identified with the dull suburban upbringing, though perhaps my parents weren't quite so hypochondriatic. How I wished that some distant relatives with a farm would suddenly appear, and take me away so that I could eat maple sugar candy and learn how to churn butter and rescue kittens and go to a one room school house!Twenty years after I first discovered this book, it is still one of my favorites. Written by a leading advocate for Montessori-style teaching, this book empahises the importantes of self-reliance and self-teaching. Although I recognize the moralizing, now that I'm a grown-up, I never felt it when I was a kid and simply delighted in reading (over and over and over again) about the adventures of Betsy and her eccentric Vermont relatives."},{"Title":"Understood Betsy","review":"I read this book countless times when I was younger, constantly checking it out from the library.

This is the general reaction from those I've met who read it -- they loved it.Many others have already given info about the story, so I'll try not to repeat that. I think my favorite part is the way that the author addresses the reader, managing to communicate her own opinions while not distracting you from the story. This particularly makes it possible not to take Betsy and her neuroses too seriously during the beginning when she's still afraid of her own shadow. I also appreciate the author's sympathetic view of Betsy. She could easily have described her as a difficult, obnoxious brat (which is probably the way many of her aunts' friends in the city thought of her), but instead she shows us Betsy's strength and true character that comes out gradually as she is challenged rather than coddled. It is a definite success of the author that you grow fond of her rather than wanting to throw your arms up in the air in disgust (at the beginning of the story, anyway; by the end Betsy is very strong, capable, and worthy of our respect).The setting is also very well-done. As many others have mentioned, it gives you a strong feel for the time period and for what life was like back then. This book provided me with one of the strongest mental pictures of what life in our country was like a century ago, and this picture was vivid enough to remain with me for years. Well-done plot, likeable and realistic characters, a strong setting, the ability to make its readers remember it for years -- this book has the necessary ingredients for a true classic."},{"Title":"Understood Betsy","review":"I almost wrote \\"My Favorite Children's Book\\", but that would be misleading, because I can still read and enjoy it now. It doesn't condescend to children and appeals mainly to genuine emotions, not sentiment, so it really holds up over time.The plot, briefly, is about a nine-year old orphan, Elizabeth Ann, who lives with her aunt and a cousin. When her aunt falls ill, Elizabeth Ann has to go live with some rural Vermont relatives, whom the rest of her family has never liked. At first Elizabeth Ann is afraid of them, too--they immediately shorten her name to Betsy--but she eventually overcomes her shyness and blossoms in the rural environment. She also learns to be much less nervous and uptight.What really makes this book stand out are its digressions. The author, Dorothy Canfield Fisher, often informally addresses the reader: one chapter is called, \\"If You Don't Like Conversation in a Book, then Skip This Chapter!\\" The most insightful sequences show Betsy discovering that not all learning takes place in school; measuring butter with her aunt, she is astounded to discover that \\"an ounce\\" exists in real life. She thought it was only found in textbooks. But you have to read the book to see how well this is pulled off.When I was a child I owned an edition with an afterward by Peggy Parrish, which pointed out how modern the book was for its time (it was published in 1917.) Indeed, the women and men share all the tasks, and Betsy is forbidden from nothing because of her gender. That makes this book a really excellent and inspiring gift for young girls, although its message of equality is never heavy-handed.Occasionally there are sections that are too sentimental, and not really necessary to the story, but the rest is so good that this is easy to forgive. Conclusion: Buy it for a child, but read it for yourself first!"},{"Title":"Understood Betsy","review":"I first read this book in my elementary school library. I loved the book then, and I love it now. I read the book to my daughter when she was a little girl, and it was she who told me about this new edition! I was also a timid little girl, and after I read Understood Betsy, I would think, &quot;Betsy did things that frightened her...so can I.&quot; My favorite chapter is &quot;Betsy's Birthday,&quot; and Betsy's discovery that &quot;she had made the Putney cousins proud&quot; still makes me teary. I am thrilled to see that a book which meant so much to me is still brightening hearts and souls."},{"Title":"Understood Betsy","review":"I first received &quot;Understood Betsy&quot; when I was 8 years old, over 20 years ago, and I still remember some of the passages and characters as if I had read them yesterday. I read and reread this book countless times throughout my childhood.Written in 1916, &quot;Understood Betsy&quot; immmerses the reader into rural life in the 1800's. Elizabeth goes from the city to live with farmer cousins, who call her Betsy. She then becomes a girl who learns to do things for herself, think for herself, and take care of others.Most interesting, the book shows the older view of treasuring common day moments, such as making the applesauce or playing dolls. If you always enjoyed the &quot;Little House&quot; and &quot;Caddie Woodlawn&quot; books, then you will LOVE &quot;Understood Betsey&quot;, which delves even more into the everyday life of girls in that time."},{"Title":"Understood Betsy","review":"My mother bought this book for me since I was a very shy and reserved child. She is a teacher and wanted to help me overcome the shyness. We read this book together and as Elizabeth Ann became Betsy, I began to open up as well. The growth of this little girl is evident and you really want her to achieve things. She is so likable as well as the other characters in the book. Dorothy Canfield Fisher should be congratulated in this \\"growing up\\" kind of book. This is a must read for any girl, even the not so shy to understand what others go through. I can't wait to read it to my 4 year old and 11 month old girls! A real treasure of literature."},{"Title":"Understood Betsy","review":"I was introduced to this book by a friend while staying at their vacation home on Lake Champlain in Vermont. It had rained most of the stay and I had exhausted my own supply of books and was wandering through their dusty library shelves when the dame of the home entered and knowing that I am an avid reader, recommended this book. She is a woman in her 70's and said that to this day she reads the book about once a year. I was instantly smitten and spent the next day and a half reading constantly, much to the chagrine of my husband who could not believe that I took the book in the tub, on the boat, to bed, and to a hidden spot in the servant's quarters in the attic to finally finish the text.The writing is easy and eloquent. The story is funny and simple. I love how Ms. Fisher gives us the ability to see what's going on in Betsy's mind and the haughty-taughty little gal is a hoot! I found myself wishing I was 12 and had just read the book. I know I would put on the character and emulate the old-fashioned principles idealized in this quaint story!"},{"Title":"The art of the novel: Critical prefaces","review":"Richard Blackmur in his introduction to this volume tells us that most of these prefaces were written for the famed 'New York Edition of his works. According to Lubbock,\\" The labour was atorment, a care, and a delight, as his letters and the Prefaces themselves amply show. The thinking and the writing were hard and full and critical to the point of exasperation; the purpose was high, the reference wide, and the terms of discourse had to be conceived and defined as successive need for them arose. He had to elucidate and appropriate for the critical intellect the substance and principle of his career as an artist, and he had to do this, such was the idiosyncracy of his mind-specifically, example following lucid example with the consistency of mathematicl equation, so that in the Poetics, if his premises were accepted his conclusions must be taken as inevitable.\\" p. viiBlackmur says that criticism has never been more ambitious, or more useful. He cites James' definition of his task in his preface to 'Roderick Hudson'. \\"These notes represent over a considerable course the continuity of an artist's endeavor, the growth of the whole operative consciousness, and best of all, perhaps their own tendency to multiply , with the implication, thereby of a memory enriched'.Among the prefaces included are those to 'Roderick Hudson' ' What Maisie Knew' 'The Princess Cassamissima' 'The Spoils of Poynton' 'The Altar to the Dead' 'The Tragic Muse'' The Lesson of the Master' ' The Aspern Papers' 'The Awkward Age''The Portrait of a Lady' ' The American'James famous advice to the writer about ' trying to be one upon whom nothing is lost' certainly seems to apply to himself in his effort to understand and deepen the meaning of his own work both for himself and for his readers."},{"Title":"Oriental rugs and the stories they tell","review":"When I was growing up, a visit to Arthur T.

I think that reading this book might just help parents and guardians who are frustrated and need a little guidance and encouragement.

As he should! He stresses self-understanding, determining communication goals, building a positive perspective, choosing words carefully and the &quot;art of caring communication.&quot;One truly important thing that he points out is &quot;ambivalence on the part of the parent is likely to be interpreted as license by the teenager.&quot; He suggests that rigidity is definitely not the alternative, but a clear committment to a system of values. Example is far more effective than preaching. &quot;Do what you say. Teens are quick to spot hypocrisy.&quot;This book is a last minute fix for parents who haven't been working on communication with their children and, frankly, I don't know if it would work or not. Crucial to teen trust and communication is consistent interest from early childhood -- parents who not only instruct but LISTEN from the time the child begins to talk. It takes years and it takes effort...lots of effort.If you have a teenager and you don't know how to say &quot;no,&quot; you're in trouble. Swets does, however, describe techniques to establish that authority. He also calls for improving your listening skills and gives feedback techniques to use when you disagree. You'll find graphs and charts for getting to know your teen -- and yourself -- better.There's lots of helpful information here but the time to begin to talk to your teenager is long before adolescence!"},{"Title":"The Art of Talking with Your Teenager","review":"I'm a teenager who, by parental force, has read this book.

She did a simple survey with hundreds of men and shares her discoveries in this book.What I enjoyed was that she gave stories of various women who either excelled in one of the seven qualities or was an example of what not to do. Although she occasionally gave a list of \\"25 ways to show respect\\" for example, I didn't feel overwhelmed by a to do list. I think Jaynes communicates in a manner that stresses the importance of the relationship with your husband.Sharon Jaynes made a simple statement near the end of the book that could save a lot of marriages. She wrote, \\"It all goes back to why we want to become the woman of his dreams. Is it to give or to get?\\" Just keeping or re-gaining the perspective that it is possible for me to be the woman of my husband's dreams and experience the joy of a vibrant relationship with the man I married is liberating.

The study questions in the back do not simply ask you to \\"fill in the blank\\" from what you have already read. The questions suppliment the reading. The author intertwines her writing with scripture and quotes from a poll of husbands. Many contemporary wives will see themselves in this book.

We thought it must have been written in the 1930's, but we were shockingly mistaken. According to this book, women of the new millenium should live in oppression and misery if need be, as long as their husbands are happy. Some suggestions are not wholly bad if used in a mutual fashion, such as listening to your partner and showing them you love and appreciate them, but come on...never voicing your own opinion, never asking the question why, keeping the children quiet and out of his way, never being seen alone with another man...this is all ludicrous! Is this America or rules for the Taliban's women? The author even asserts that a woman should never display any attributes that would challenge the masculitity of her husband for fear that he would \\"take the easy road\\" and become a homosexual. What does this mean? You can't be smarter than him? Don't dare open a jar in front of him? Or hammer a nail in the wall to hang a picture?This book seems like more of a \\"How-To\\" for an aspiring personal servant than for a happy marriage. Of course any man would be happy with his own personal servant who never challenges him and puts his happiness above all else, but women need to be happy too!

The town is Bracebridge, the colonial New England village that is home to Charlotte Willett, her neighbor Richard Longfellow, and a vivid ensemble of farmers, tradesmen, innkeepers, and clergy.When the discovery of a corpse coincides with Signor Lahte's visit, Charlotte and Richard follow a trail of clues that leads from the bedrooms of Bracebridge to a smoke-filled tavern in Boston, where rum and revolution spice the air. Along the way, the reader is treated to plot twists that will snare even the most jaded mystery fan, as well as a host of historical characters both savory and unsavory.The biggest treat of all, though, is the interplay between the widow Willett and squire Longfellow. These two share an intellectual curiosity and love of civilized discourse that makes their dialogue sparkle. The tension between sensible intuition and scientific inquiry--as well as an underlying sexual attraction that never steps beyond the propriety of their times and stations--adds to the pleasure of eavesdropping on their lively conversations.Richard and Charlotte, as well as the fully-realized minor players who inhabit Bracebridge, are fast becoming treasured old friends whose quirks elicit knowing grins or groans. Ms. Miles is a wonderfully inventive writer who makes us care about the people she has created and eager to read the next installment. Long live Bracebridge!"},{"Title":"No Rest for the Dove","review":"In the summer of 1765, the newly enacted Stamp Tax encourages the Sons of Liberty to agitate the citizenry against the crown. Although the townsfolk living just outside of Boston know about the civil disobedience in the big city, they are more occupied with earning a living than politics.In nearby Bracebridge, Richard Longfellow and his independent neighbor Charlotte Willet are preparing to welcome of famous Italian opera singer Gian Carlo Lahte into their community. Though he has rubbed shoulders with Europe's royalty, the Castrotti comes to the New World seeking a place to call home. On the same day that Gian Carlo arrives in town, a farmer finds a corpse on the Boston-Worcester road. He brings the dead body to Richard, the town's nearest selectman. The local doctor looks at the deceased and believes poisoning is the cause o death. Charlotte and Richard make inquiries and learn that the dead person comes from Milan, Italy. As more people from Gino's hometown arrives in Bracebridge, the two amateur sleuths worry that more murders will follow.Those readers who love a cerebral historical mystery starring two fascinating protagonists will eagerly read this entertaining who-done-it. NO REST FOR THE DOVE is filled with Pre-Revolutionary War tidbits that make the era in Massachusetts outside of Boston seem vividly alive. The tantalizing world of the late eighteenth century Castrotti is also realistically depicted. Margaret Miles' wonderful Americana historical mystery series centers on her two lead charcaters who clearly are a product of their times. This talented writer offers readers a tantalizing glimpse into our countries' past.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"No Rest for the Dove","review":"A Correction:The author of the Bracebridge series is not the Margaret Miles referred to by a previous reviewer.

In this outing, the mysterious and elegant Senor Gian Carlo Lahte, an Italian singer, arrives in Bracebridge and immediately the ladies are charmed and the men begin gossiping about him. Shortly after his arrival, a body is found on the road leading to Boston. No one recognizes the dead man, but Lahte is visibly shaken when he views the body. When the boots and buttons are stolen from the dead fellow, Charlotte Willett and Richard Longfellow, her neighbor, are intrigued by the possibilities. As they contemplate each new piece of the puzzle, the reader must speculate along with them. The author is careful to capture the flavor of the language of the times without bogging down the reader's progress. The characters are finely drawn with the author being careful to capture the flavor of the language of the times. Her descriptions are so well written that you can feel the languor and ennui of a late summer afternoon engulf you. This is an excellent historical series. Even if you don't care for historical mysteries, but prefer procedurals, try this one.

I did not find this book as good and I had trouble maintaining my interest throughout. I had figured out the main gist of the plot about halfway through and had determined who the murderer was. The book is set in the summer of 1765 in Bracebridge and in Boston. There is a lot of unrest in the colonies at this time and the people of Boston in particular are chafing under British rule. This book was set before the Boston Tea Party, but Ms. Miles portrays the political machinations and the unrest quite well. The victim, the murderer and the peripheral characters in the book are foreigners (actually from Milan, Italy). The language barrier and the cultural differences make it more difficult for Charlotte Willett to unravel the mystery. But she does in the end, although the perpetrators are actually not apprehended. I think there is only one more book left in this short series, and I will read it because I do normally like Ms. Miles' writing and I enjoy her main characters."},{"Title":"No Rest for the Dove","review":"I love historical mysteries but this one can in no way compete with such authors as P.C.

It felt kind of abrupt.Still though, I really enjoyed this book and would definitely recommend it!!"},{"Title":"The Perfect Manhattan: A Novel","review":"I adore this book...It captures the world of working in the service industry perfectly...This book is addicting..I absolutely could not put it down!"},{"Title":"The Perfect Manhattan: A Novel","review":"I would suggest this to anyone entering the service industry, especially bartending or anyone who has been a bartender / is bartending as the stories bring back memories - a good easy going read, perfect for the beach!"},{"Title":"The Perfect Manhattan: A Novel","review":"Cassie is a nice girl and an aspiring writer. After finishing college she opts for bartender life, lured by an advertisement nearly guaranteeing the big bucks she needs to pay off her college loans and start building her life's nest egg. She is one step behind the big dogs who bartender around her, but she is no quitter. Through contacts, she gets a summer bartender job in the Hamptons, the ultra-rich sun-and-sand summer hangout. There, she meets some of the rich and falls sort-of in love with one. By the end of the summer, caught up in some of the over-drinking that comes with her business and the over-spending that comes with keeping up with the \\"look\\" of the Hamptons, she pulls herself back, returns to a more sedate bartending scene, and confidently resumes her screenwriting.The tale is reasonably paced. It offers vignettes of bartending, bartenders, and customers (sort of rich and stupidly rich). My problem throughout was Cassie. After a while, I understand that she is a beauty, but that doesn't really affect her give-and-take with the customers, right? Uh-huh. Cassie does admit to some heavy drinking and a little bit of drug use, but she's really just a nice girl, maybe in the wrong place. Uh-huh. I suggest you read this for the vignettes, not for Cassie's summer maturation. Cassie transcribes life around her; she doesn't quite live it."},{"Title":"The Perfect Manhattan: A Novel","review":"I feel like I have an idea of what a bartender's life is really like now!Well written and fun!"},{"Title":"The Perfect Manhattan: A Novel","review":"Cassie Ellis is about to graduate from Columbia. A budding writer, Cassie really wants to work on her own screenplay, but she doesn't understand how she will be able to write it and work full-time at a job she knows she will hate. While perusing the newspaper, an opportunity presents itself: Cassie could go to bartending school. It would be perfect! She could write all day and then bartend at night. Her screenplay would be done in a snap!Unfortunately, Cassie fails bartending school. She doesn't let that stop her, though. Cassie lands a bartending gig in a class SoHo pub. She mingles with enough of the \\"right\\" people to find out that if she truly wants to make some quick cash, she should bartend in the Hamptons for the summer weekends. In need of cash and a little excitement, Cassie finds a job at Spark, the trendiest place in the Hamptons, and soon finds herself hob-knobbing with stars and local millionnaires.One of those local millionnaires is the object of Cassie's crush: James Edmonton III. Soon, they're having a whirlwind romance, but Cassie begins to wonder if James is truly interested in her or defying his father by seeing her. Nevermind that her screenplay is totally not being written and that Cassie is completely exhausted. Can Cassie accomplish her goals and get the guy, too?This book was so much fun to read! The authors really captured the bartending environment and bring it to life on the page. Cassie is a great character, if a little hard to get to know. This book is a breath of fresh air to the chick lit genre. Though some of our favorite and familiar elements are there, \\"The Perfect Manhattan\\" takes a walk on the wildside, which is much needed!I would absolutely recommend this book!"},{"Title":"The Perfect Manhattan: A Novel","review":"I found this book to be a really fun read. I've never been to the Hamptons, but after reading The Perfect Manhattan, I have a clear mental image of what it must be like.

Highly reccomended!"},{"Title":"The Perfect Manhattan: A Novel","review":"Great book, I have been in the restuarant/bar business for a couple of years and this book definitely hit all the areas of life in the summer.

I couldn't put this book down! It gives you a unique 360 degree view of being a bartender and the powerful draw of the glitzy and glamorous \\"celebrity\\" life. It will immediately cause an appreciation for the service industry and a desire to taste the New York City and Hampton night life! Shear and Toomey create a brilliant fine line of loving and feeling disappointed in our heroine (and in ourselves) as she gets us to sympathize with her desire to impress, while abandoning (just for a moment) who she really is. This book whisks you away and you find yourself so caught up in the exhilarating plot, that you are knee-deep in the desire to achieve this status and are routing for things that aren't necessarily in the main character's best interest. However, by the end she shows us the power and strength of being true to yourself, and we are a bit ashamed that we get so caught up in the first place! It is a book that you don't want to end, and as the pages dwindle you can't help but get bummed out - that this was that one great summer read! It is truly a MUST READ! Perfect for a BOOK CLUB!"},{"Title":"The Perfect Manhattan: A Novel","review":"I read about this book in a magazine and thought it sounded fun to read, and it was. The book is very descriptive and very well written and I enjoyed it so much and hated to see it end. Ms. Shear is a gifted writer and I'm sure a gifted bartender, too. She sounds like she is living a life full of friendship and fun and I wish her all the best.So if Manhattan is in your blood, like it is in mine then this is a book you just can't miss. It almost makes me want to run out and become a bartender, until I read about the behind the scenes stuff that goes with it. I suppose my normal job, with all it's health benefits and 401k and pension plans will just have to be my future, but it sure is boring. The next time I'm in Manhattan I am going to make sure to stop by O'neils and buy me a drink and maybe, if I'm really lucky, I can do a few shots with the authors. Maybe some of their creative genius will rub off on me, if not, at least I will have a buzz when I leave."},{"Title":"The Perfect Manhattan: A Novel","review":"This book fills that catergory with utmost ease. Telling a story that most of us were well aware prolly exsisted of our wealthy elitist in american society. I believe that we will all find much truth of our own wishes and desires in this book. We all dream for the bigger and better life not realizing all that may come with it. There is happiness but maybe not the kind of happiness that can be enjoyed from every point of view. As Cassie ultimately has to find out to be happy with herself being just as she is, an average working american-she is guided by an eclectic crowd of people.I would overall recommend this book as a great travel companion or beach read. A great first book by the girls...congrats on your future conquests, I hope all goes so well as this."},{"Title":"The Perfect Manhattan: A Novel","review":"Have you ever wondered what it would be like to bartend in New York City or the Hamptons? I know I have! The Perfect Manhattan will take you behind the bartending scenes and show you both the good and bad.Meet Cassie, a fresh graduate from Columbia University who wants to be a writer but knows she needs to support herself in the meantime. No corporate slave-driven job for her! Instead she decides to become a bartender, telling herself it will only be temporary. After long hours of schmoozing customers and her boss, she ends up with a great opportunity to work in a bar in the Hamptons for the summer.So after snagging a decidedly questionable summer share (a house occupied by a bunch of drunken frat-boy types), Cassie and her good friend Annie (a cocktail waitress) begin work at what turns out to be the hottest bar/club in the Hamptons.Too bad Cassie exaggerated her bartending skills in the interview... will she get in over her head? What about the deliciously handsome and famous bachelor James? He really seems to be interested in her, but why does he keep introducing her to his socialite Paris Hilton look-alike crowd as his friend only (and not his girlfriend)?I enjoyed The Perfect Manhattan quite a bit, to the point of not being able to put it down once I started. Told in first-person narrative, this book is packed with delectable details and exciting adventures. From dates with famous bachelors to snobby socialites to the stuck-up social ladder of the Hamptons to the interesting life of a bartender, this book has it all, and then some.I especially enjoyed the theme of the book: a young woman, fresh out of college, decides not to pursue the traditional way of life, and instead goes on to struggle to support herself and follow her dream. Along the way she runs into plenty of bumps but retains her sense of humor. Cassie is a great main character, if a little naive.The only downsides to this novel were that some of the happenings were a bit unrealistic, and there was at least a couple of scenes in the novel that were of the eye-rolling variety. For instance, how does she suddenly get a screenplay written when she is so busy bartending? Other than a couple of small things however, The Perfect Manhattan was a great read.Highly recommended for an awesome summer read - don't miss this one!"},{"Title":"The Perfect Manhattan: A Novel","review":"This book was fabulous.

Working at the exclusive Spark, Cassie meets who seems to be the man of her dreams, sees plenty of snow in the summer, and finds herself completely unprepared for the new, rich world she's just entered, where pedigree trumps education, and even the trust funds come with strings attached.

The Author made me feel as though I was in the bar myself for I could almost almost smell the different cocktails being mixed. I must confess more than once just reading this book made me feel I was in the midst of a terrible hangover.

This candid debut novel by Leanne Shear and Tracey Toomey takes \\"Sex and the City\\" to the Hamptons, where money talks and \\"camera (...)\\" claw for time on the red carpet. The chapters are hot and the summertime exploits of the wealthy are VVIP only, but the cocktails are cool and intoxicating.Dressed in Chanel, Valentino, Gucci, Herm&egrave;s, Dolce & Gabbana, Juicy Couture, Chopard, Manolo Blahnik, Prada, Burberry, Tracey Feith and more, the pedigreed socialites, whose every outfit is described by the color, price tag and designer labels, party with Grey Goose, Ketel One and Stoli Raspberry vodka. Vueve Clicquot champagne, Patr&oacute;n tequila, Bombay Sapphire gin, and, of course, perfect Manhattans are served in abundance to the playboys, moguls and spoiled rich kids who parade behind the velvet ropes nightly at Spark, the hottest restaurant and nightclub in the Hamptons. Every page reads like the Fashion & Style News pages straight from Town and Country magazine.The best way to enjoy THE PERFECT MANHATTAN is to soak up the sun with your very own tanned beach butler delivering cool cocktails. It is the perfect summer tonic for those who have fantasized about the glitz and glamour of the most elite summer destination, \\"The Hamptons --- the exclusive Long Island retreat for every New Yorker who 'was somebody.'\\" Chapter titles named after cocktails like Sloe Comfortable Screw, Sex on the Beach, Bay Breeze, Thug Passion, Salty Dog, and Sicilian Kiss are revealing preludes.Despite being a recent Columbia University graduate, Cassie Ellis flunks out of Martini Mike's Bartending School and lands a bartending job at an upscale Irish pub in Manhattan named Finton's. Cassie becomes best friends with Annie, a sexy blonde Brazilian cocktail waitress and recent Tisch School of the Arts graduate over a tray of Bikini martinis. On her first night as bartender at Finton's Pub, Cassie is introduced to multimillionaire art dealer Martin Pritchard, who just happens to be one of the few members of the exclusive Southampton Country Club in the Hamptons. He invites her to the Hamptons for the weekend and promises to help her get a bartending job for the summer so she can make more money.Cassie's first exposure to the lifestyle in the Hamptons is seeing Martin's valet with five Louis Vuitton suitcases. Feeling like \\"Little Orphan Annie at Daddy Warbucks's mansion,\\" Cassie accompanies Martin and a young woman fifty years his junior in a Bentley to the Hamptons. Martin's first stop is the Barefoot Contessa specialty grocery store in East Hampton, where he buys Beluga caviar and pt&eacute;s shipped daily from France.Sitting at an ocean-side table at the Southampton Country Club, Cassie is introduced to her summer romance, James Edmonton the Third, one of the most eligible bachelors in the Hamptons, \\"graduate of Yale University, vice president at Goldman Sachs, and master boatman and golfer,\\" not to mention he lives on Further Lane, one of the most exclusive streets in East Hampton. The day becomes even more perfect when Cassie is hired as a bartender at Spark, the place for the chichi and celebrities to see and be seen and where Cassie gets her first $1,000 tip. Annie is also hired, and the two girls cater to and then party with the who's who of the Hamptons social register.Cassie writes her firsthand experiences bartending to the rich and famous socialites in the Hamptons on beverage napkins to fuel her budding screenplay career. On one side of the bar Cassie observes opulence, celebrity bling and excess of every kind. On her side of the bar, cocaine snorting, \\"staff shots\\" every thirty minutes, theft, secret trysts in the employee bathroom, and $5,000 bar tabs are nightly events.Cassie's screenwriting dreams are a perfect match for James's film production plans. Behind the velvet ropes and off the red carpet as James's date at many of the exclusive summer parties and the Bridgehampton polo match, Cassie encounters a cool reception from some of James's friends, especially the \\"Pearls Girls.\\" After all, Cassie has not been socializing with them at Gstaad, Aspen or St. Barths.Wrapped in James's arms and Cristal champagne lifestyle, Cassie overlooks the fact that James is oblivious to their slight until she realizes just who she has become in order to inhabit his world of \\"selfish, shallow, boring people spending money trying to impress each other and cover up the fact that their lives are hollow and meaningless.\\" Family skeletons are revealed and declarations of love are tested. The moral here Cassie is this --- if your first summer romance in the Hamptons doesn't work out, there is always next summer.(...)"},{"Title":"The Perfect Manhattan: A Novel","review":"The Perfect Manhattan goes down smoothly on the beach or by the pool, or in my case, on the Long Island Rail Road en route to the Hamptons.

Cassie Ellis, the main character, is loveable and relatable, and the adventures she witnesses throughout the book are interesting and page-turning. However, after reading about a fourth of the book I was already tired of the constant drinking and hangovers, and felt a bit bedraggled myself, but I stuck it out for the rest of novel, constantly shaking my head at the messes Cassie got herself into. The ending was refreshing, and not as predictable as I had thought it would be.While the novel was entertaining and had great character development and setting, the plot lacked a bit. The story seemed to drag, and not have much true direction; other than the first and last 50 pages, the rest of the novel is nothing but late-night partying and the resulting exhaustion. The two real-life bartenders-turned-novelists that wrote this book obviously have talent for writing a good story, plenty of great material from their line of work, and I look forward to any future novels penned by them - but I do hope they will take some classes on plot development and learn the craft a little more.Grade: B"},{"Title":"The Perfect Manhattan: A Novel","review":"It's hard to come across books that are so hard to put down you stay up til 6am to finish it!

She had hoped that she would clear up her day to devote her time on writing a screenplay. However, Cassie was still able to get a job and hence began her bartending career. That proved to be a stepping stone as Cassie was able to get a bartending job for the summer in the exclusive Hamptons. Cassie soon realized that the Hamptons, frequented by multi-millionaires, were way out of her league. However, the job seemed promising enough even though the life of a bartender in one of the hottest clubs in the Hamptons was an incredibly hectic one. Between consuming alcohol as well as working like crazy at the club, Cassie soon realized that she did not have spare time to work on her script writing. Not to mention the sudden appearance of James Edmonton III, the dashing multi-millionaire who seemed to take a liking at Cassie.\\"The Perfect Manhattan\\" provided a lot of insights into the life of the extremely rich at the Hamptons where designers' labels as well as country clubs seemed to consume its residents' time. The book also provided interesting glimpses of the life of bartenders as the authors were former bartenders themselves. I thought this was an okay book but the plot seemed rather thin for me. The entire book seemed focused on the Cassie's bartending job and it gotten dull for me towards the end of the book. There were not a lot development of supporting characters and they seemed to whiz in and out of Cassie's life rather quickly.

The authors do a great job of giving insight into life behind the bar in New York/Hamptons from the point of view of an attractive and aspiring female bartender. Reading the book has given me more appreciation for bartenders and waitresses, particularly ones that are very good at what they do. My tips are getting better! The photo of the authors on the book jacket makes it believable that the story is based on their real life experiences. It is light reading, but is engaging, with a bit of social/moral commentary thrown in. On the down side is the authors' absolutely relentless use of brand, designer, company and product names. This is obviously deliberate, but it is overdone -- it weakens the writing. The authors should take a clue from the writers of HBO's \\"Sex and the City\\", in which the NYC characters' shameless devotion to overpriced and exclusive designer products is also mentioned, but not so frequently as to distract from the story and the writing.

I urge all of you to read this book as it is an entertaining story that all twenty something females should know.Kristin MarquetAuthor of \\"How Can a Woman Survive Dating in a World Full of Players, Losers, Liars, Scumbags, and Mama's Boys?

From the opposite side of the counter, suddenly all of the things Cassie internally dwells on rung true, whether exploring misogyny, sex, or wealth I always found Cassie to be exceptionally insightful - which gave this book the depth it needed in an otherwise frivolous setting!I recognized the trappings of what I've heard from bartending (and waitressing) friends. I found the lifestyles of the main characters in this book so insanely bizarre (getting home at 7 am and being up and at em a few hours later? hungover? ICK!) that it just drew me in regardless of the somewhat 'flat' characters throughout. As I said, the insights of Cassie probably came more from the two girls who wrote this book, former bartenders and likely aspiring writers at the time, and as such I found this a very valuable book in learning to tip and be a bit more polite at bars! A good read for anyone interested in a fun story that more than makes up for its lack of concrete plot in its insider look at the service industry."},{"Title":"Be Glad: An Incredible String Band Compendium","review":"Speaking as a long-time lover of the music of the Incredible String Band, I can highly recommend this compilation, which gathers fact-filled articles from the ISB newsletter, &quot;Be Glad For the Song Has No Endng.&quot; If you aren't familiar with the ISB's music, go buy The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter, Wee Tam, and 5,000 Spirits before buying the book. But them definitely buy the book. Details about the band have always been somewhat elusive and it was a pleasure and a revelation to discover many of the things herein, including interviews with people who lived with the band members and knew them well. The authors also place the band firmly in a historical and cultural contact and present honest looks at the group's artistic highs and lows. Again, recommended reading for anyone interested in a band that offered moments of genius and musical vision (along with some really painful missteps) unsurpassed by anyone in the field of &quot;popular&quot; music. Says me, at least."},{"Title":"La Boheme in Full Score (Dover Vocal Scores)","review":"Puccini's La Boheme is among his most perfored operas and this Dover addition full score is a great supplement to your enjoyment.The print is large and easily readable.

Black Sparrow copy mysteriously vanished over the winter. Although the ECCO editions are nice enough, (hardcovers included), the print seems a little different and the paper feels a bit thinner, but I suppose I might be a little biased as I loved the original printings (plus you'll never see an autograph/drawing on a HarperCollins edition!).Some really good long poems are included which always makes for great re-reading, but works like \\"the condition\\" and \\"suggestion for an arrangment\\" will have you whipping off lines from memory, maybe just like Buk did when he wrote them."},{"Title":"War All the Time: Poems, 1981-1984","review":"Bukowski often wrote that he thought most poetry was dandyfied, prissyfied, pretty, not real, fake, false and worst of all, restrictive to the &quot;masses&quot;. To him there were a few exceptions; John Fante, Hamsun and early Hem. in prose, some of Pound, all of Sarayon, all of Jeffers in poetry. Hank wrote clearly and lucidly about many topics, not just getting drunk and sleeping with women as many of his detractors claim. He also wrote clean crisp poetry about LA and the race track, and traffic, other writers and about cats, and food, and taking baths and, well, about life!!!! Life being lived by a human being. War All the Time was written during the early to mid eighties, a time when Hank had had some success with his writing. His movie was out and enjoying some success. He was 60 years old and he had a newer car and a house in San Pedro he owned and a woman he loved (the second Linda) so his words in this collection are not quite as hard as poems from earlier on, like the poems found in the Burning in Water, Drowning in Flame collection.

He alternates without warning between gruff and heartbreaking and takes the reader for an emotional ride.Holden Caulfield said, \\"What really knocks me out is a book that, when you're all done reading it, you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it.\\" I loved this idea when I first read The Catcher in the Rye. I don't feel like that often, though. And actually, in Bukowski's case, I'm pretty sure I *wouldn't* like him much if I were in the same room as him...but I sure as hell enjoy reading about him and what he's doing, probably because his poems also include his reactions to the world around him.

WAAAYYYY to much description. but the answer is satisfying. the ending totally completely sucked. but like i said the answer was worth the wait....read the book and you will know my meaning."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"I have had this book in my to be read stack for 10 years, but it was only recently that I picked the book up and read it. I am so sorry I did not read it sooner, this was a unique book that I completely enjoyed.This is the story of the Pelham family, starting with Norman, a young Union soldier, and Leah, the escaped slave who finds him and saves him after he is injured in the Civil War. He brings her home to his disapproving family, and they build a life in his hometown. After she goes back to the town she came from, though, the family must deal with the legacy of her slavery past, a legacy that spans several generations. The focus shifts to their son, Jamie, who leaves home and falls in love with the elusive Joey, and his child, Foster, a gentle boy who must, in the end, go back to North Carolina to resolve the issues that haunted his grandmother.I didn't just read this book, I was absorbed by it. It was a fresh approach to the Civil War, and confronted an issue a lot of novels skirt or treat with kid gloves. Lent writes of powerful, difficult events, but his writing is lyrical and gives dignity to the characters and their struggle. I particularly felt for Foster, who is forced to go from a teenage boy invested in training his bird dog puppy, Glow, to the avenger of his grandmother and man of the family in a three-week period. It's a powerful transition and Lent handles it well.I also loved the author's ability to describe the places in which his story takes place. We are transported to the family farm on a winter night when a baby is born, the wildness of the Rhode Island coast, and the sultry late-summer heat of small-town South. They become characters in the story, affecting the reactions of the human characters to events and propelling the action.This is a book that I would unabashedly recommend to anyone who enjoys a good story with well-drawn characters. I am in process of going through my book collection and giving away the books that I don't love, and had thought that, since this was in the pile for 10 years without being read, it was going to go on the donate pile, but it is definitely staying on my shelves. It was a great pleasure to read and I look forward to reading more of the writer's work."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"The storyline, and the characters were good and so was the beginning but it did drag in places. The book would have been better if it wasn't so dragged out otherwise it would have been a decent book."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"In the Fall is one of those rare finds: a perfectly blended collection of talent, history, and an deeply moving engrossing theme. I'm writing this review a week after completing it and there are some parts which still yet I'm pondering. Read the book for pleasure, study example, or to satisfy the insatiable itch for classic prose that completely mesmerizes."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"I first read this book when i was about 16. I remember reading the back jacket and falling in love with it but i had to be secretive about it because kids my age didnt read stuff like this. Well as a 22 year old today, I found myself wanting a good read, and remembered this greatness that i thought the book to be. After re-reading this book with a slightly older set of eyes, I found myself not so in love with the story anymore. I mean for me the best part about this book is the first chapter. After that the story seems to go off onto other ventures. I think that if the author had just told just the story of the first two main characters in the first chapter, than the story really could have taken on a life of its own and kept the reader wanting more, but when it goes off to the story of the other males and their generations, i find that the story gets somewhat boring and doesnt hold my attention as good as the first chapter. But overall the book is ok and well worth a first read."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"This was quite a long family saga. It was interesting in that it was separated into three different sections with three different lead characters. In some ways there was some mystery because what was initially presented was later modified.This book seems to capture the different reactions to slavery and blacks that history books don't really get into very deeply. Being a northern abolitionist doesn't equate with acceptance of blacks in the community. Once again Mr. Lent delivers a remarkable body of work that is unique and engrossing."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"This book is hard to read due to extensive descriptive wording. The story is wonderful but it takes time and perseverance to finish. The story could have been conveyed in many less pages."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"Lent's _In the Fall_ is a powerful story written about a forbidden subject for the late 1800s. The story has depth and is well written, and the story stays with one after finishing the book. Perhaps it is not a fast read, but one does not want to read this fast. The reader should savor the excellent storytelling and consider the shoes the narrators walk in. It was a dark time in American history, and the story has a dark side, but there are some glimmers of hope. It is a well-told story."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"Such an intriguing plot! An interracial marriage and two generations that follow, looping back to find answers about the past. I wanted to read this book for such a long time, so when I finally got the book I dug right in. But, it was slow to get started and I found myself not caring if I read at night or didn't. When I did read, I'd skip words because it's too long in all the wrong places. For example, often there will be a fascinating dialogue and there you sit on the edge of your seat waiting to find out, \\"what will he say????\\" And right in the middle of the dialogue, Lent decides to tell you about the trees on the hillside and the sun going down and the cows and blah blah, I don't know because I skipped it hunting franticly for those quotation marks of the conversation which was just interrupted. It was tedious. And I wasn't 100% happy with the ending, because it felt untrue."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"Perhaps I'm overly critical, but I read a lot and the zest of some books is lost on me, &quot;In the Fall&quot; one of them. Though I found &quot;In the Fall&quot; one of the better &quot;new&quot; reads of this past year, I found it lacking.I'm afraid this lack draws from the familiarity I felt &quot;In the Fall&quot; had with other novels; the comparison with &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; is always made but more I felt it too much like &quot;Song of Solomon&quot;--the northerner going South in search of the past. Though the two novels set up differing quests, the mood, point of view, and the striking similiarity of phrases between Morrison and Lent pervaded my read, especially in Lent's final section where Foster winds up in a similiar North Carolina small town as Morrison's Milkman. So, for Lent the problem of the past that he explores in his novel becomes in a manner his own problem.And lastly, though I enjoyed the lilt of Lent's language, the poetic license he shed on the scenes, I felt this increased distance between reader and character by not allowing the true nature of character to sift out of the language but forcing the language over character. I felt I understood the writer more than the characters. A string of disjointed noun phrases like Joyce and Pynchon are proficient at felt overdone and awkward with Lent.Despite this, &quot;In the Fall&quot; is a book I would recommend. Certainly it doesn't lack for tension and for a unique and soft handed portrayal of race, marriage, and the futures that pasts breed. There are simply and understandably other novels that come before it."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"The story opens in the backwoods of Virginia with the fateful meeting of the young black slave girl Leah escaping from North Carolina and the white soldier boy Norman returning home to Vermont at the end of the civil war.The story continues on of their life together, then branches off abruptly and follows their son Jamie when he leaves home as a young boy, and finally to the life of Jamie's son Foster, as he makes his way searching for answers after the death of his father.Lent is a fabulous writer and story teller. His characters are starkly real, multilayered, earthy, and flawed. I felt as though his plot took me to me places that I never would have imagined, even though they are ordinary, made extraordinary and thrilling by his telling. There is always an undercurrent of the power and importance of family, the ability of that bond to cause either destruction or resurrection or both to the soul, and Lent uses that beautifully in his stories. Time after time the pictures he painted on the page took my breath away with their detail and ability to transport me there. His descriptions of Foster's 2 dogs touched me to my core with his magical rendering. I would be surprised if Lent were not an absolute dog lover.However, the final chapter is long and drawn out, seems contrived and teases the reader, refusing to give up \\"The Secret\\" until forced to plod through page after page of dialogue with an extremely unlikable character. Could have skipped much of it, and enjoyed it much more.I previously read & loved Lost Nation by the author, and doubted this book would be able to entertain me to the same degree, but I gradually became completely and wonderfully hooked in his world."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"I was excited about reading this book, since historical fiction is my very favorite genre. And the Civil War, where the book begins, is a special favorite of mine. I was engrossed for the first 100 or so pages, but then began to tire of the author's overly long descriptions of trivial items. By the time the story reached the second generation (Jamie), the excessive 'wordiness' became almost intolerable, and boredom set in. But I slogged on, determined to finish the book - even though I had no idea where it was headed. When the third generation arrived (Foster), the pace mercifully picked up a bit, though it was determination, not pleasure, that kept me reading.Despite being predisposed to like this book, I did not. I endured it. It tells a great story, with wonderful, moving insights, and the writing is often gorgeous. It could have packed a huge wallop had it not been such a trial to read; I could not sustain any emotional involvement with the characters in the face of such verbosity. It's overwritten, a frustrating and tedious read. And that's a shame, given how great the story line is."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"I just finished reading In The Fall and am really glad I did. I found it difficult to get into at first and difficult to put down later. There were definately descriptive paragraphs that I skimmed. In my opionion there were times when those descriptions went long. That may just be my preference for reading about people though. I read many books about interracial families and biracial children and felt like this subject was handled well. It's a different time period than I'm used to. My only complaint was that the 2 sisters remained &quot;tragic mulattos&quot;. Although they found a comfortable life for themselves they were unable to find love. That was way too cliche for the rest of the book. Definately worth reading."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"If this is the freshman effort, bring on the follow-up! This is one of the most haunting, beautiful novels I've ever read. It has well-written dialogue and astounding descriptive prose. It's an excellent study of both a family and a nation in transition--which is a lot to ask of one novel--but Mr. Lent delivers with room to spare. It's not a &quot;beach book&quot; (it requires a little too much effort for that) but well worth the time. And the super, ambiguous ending sentence? What a great reward!"},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"The first part of the book was interesting and moved along. The second generation section came out of nowhere as far as the character Jaime was concerned. The leap of imagination to make his character believable was too great. The 3rd generation pulled the threads together but rambled along too long.Had hoped for an exploration of the black/white relationship in Vermont post Civil War. Our book group was unanimous in wondering where the editor was in the process."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"I found this book while looking for another. What a great piece of luck. I read about 50 books a year and have done so for several years. I do not rate many books as excellent. However this one won me over. It is one of the five best books I have read.A great story with wonderful characters."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"For me, the character of Leah created the most memorable image and initiated most of my curiosity. A runaway slave who marries a Union soldier from Vermont, Leah puts enough distance between her slave life and her new role as wife and mother to afford her a margin of safety. It is her fate to learn that no matter how far we run, the past follows like a shadow.No matter what events happen in the lives of the Pelhams in the three generations adressed in the novel, Leah is the sole character who permeates the lives of all. Her experiences in Vermont may be mere echoes of her former life, but but the dark shadows of prejudice still lurk everywhere. Mystery surrounds what happened to Leah Pelham when, after 25 years, she returned to North Carolina to confront her past and search for her mother. The answers profoundly affect the rest of her life and her family.Leah and Norman Pelham have two daughters and one son; the girls remain close to home, but the son, Jaimie, leaves without a word to forge his own path, seemingly adrift from the past. In the final chapters, it is Jaimie's son, Foster, 16, who unravels the mystery. He is the vehicle through which we finally learn the entire story as he returns to Vermont and meets his two aging aunts, the family tree as unique and fascinating as he could ever imagine.The details of Foster's grandmother's quest for closure are significant for the remaining cast of characters, but even without this revelation, the damage to generations is clear. The institution of slavery tainted everyone, North and South, and continues to do so today in it's often more subtle forms. The message is clear: evil engenders evil and plunges roots deep into society that eventually choke the soul of a Nation.The author's prose is often long and wordy and perhaps could have benefited from some editorial restraint. But aside from being a novel with a compelling storyline, IN THE FALL is valuable, as well, as an object lesson in the moral devastation that accompanies slavery in any form. If for no other reason, the book is an important testament to the truth of that reality."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"It's as though Bill Faulkner, Cormac McCarthy, and John Updike had entered a dark fusion machine and emerged as Jeffrey Lent. I say this not because Lent is one of those McCarthy clones who are suddenly populating the literary landscape, or that his writing is precisely reminiscent of anyone, but: the narrative materials are lifted straight out of Yoknapatawpha County, the lovely, lapidary prose sometimes recalls Updike, and the incisive, oblique observation and beautifully wrought violence contains whispers of McCarthy.This, however, is clearly Faulkner country, transposed to New England: broad, dynastic, operatic, with tangled, busted lives, &quot;sins of the fathers,&quot; thwarted redemption, miscegenation, deeply hatched plotting, and long stretches of psychological discovery. Lent transforms these raw materials into a work of unique beauty: his characters are vivid and memorable. His plotting and pacing strike me as signs of architectonic genius. And his descriptive powers, directed to familiar objects--dew on a leaf, a sunset, a snowy vista--unscroll utterly unspoiled language in sinuous, carefully wrought sentences, making us &quot;see&quot; with his own keen eye for fresh metaphor, the kind of virtuoso writing that stops us dead--&quot;HOW could he have done that????&quot;--in much the same way as passage after passage of Mozart have overpowered generations of admirers.Stay with this book: The languid beginnings of In the Fall reproduce the numbing routine of Norman Pelham's rural life--not since Cather's My Antonia have I so deeply perceived the sheer, isolated brutality of a 19th century winter--but, in the following section, with the arrival of Norman's son in the dangerous city, the book's pulse picks up, indeed hurtles, forward, and forward, to a harrowing finale.Here is essential American literature, and a name to remember: Jeffrey Lent, Faulkner of the Northlands."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"This book was simply awesome. It took me quite a while to read it because it was so lovingly written and so absolutely moving. I cannot even imagine how Mr. Lent could conjure such a heartfelt and sad story that gave me shivers more than once.I would highly recommend this book. It is absolutely stunning."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"This is a beautiful, lovely book as heartbreakingly sad as anything I've ever read. There's four or five places in Lent's narrative that just cut you off at the knees emotionally. I'd just have to put the book down a while because I was so affected with the beauty and melancholy of his story. Generational sagas tend to spread a lot of characters too thin over a natural episodic repetitiveness. Lent never allows that to happen here. Each character is presented in their own unique way, their stories sometimes dovetailing, but as time passes back and again, their true natures are ever more revealed, often tragically. I thought them all wonderful. I'd intended to take my time reading &quot;Fall&quot; but around page 180-90 the whole thing, perfectly terrific to that point, picked up an undeniable narrative steam, one of those I-cannot-&amp;-will-not put this bloody thing down till I find out what happens kind of things. What a ride. In the end this is one of those books you love to tell friends about, knowing that if they only like it half as much as you do, they'll love it."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"Well before I finished this book, I was thinking about the reviews I had previously written. I tried to recall those that I thought merited 5 stars. By the time I finished, &quot;In The Fall&quot;, I decided a five star rating is something that should be rather scarce.Book Jackets generally suffer from severe cases of superlative laced hyperbole. If all endorsements were accurate you could walk blindfolded into your favorite purveyor of books, lay your hand on the first tome to be touched, and a Pulitzer, Booker, Nobel, or a Whitbread would be in you hand! However, it is far more likely you would dredge up a tell-all book on Harry Potter's Carbohydrate Addiction with a free coupon good toward any exploitive bestseller, think Boulder Colorado, there are two on the bestseller list as I write.But in this scenario the odds are beaten, no 250-page novel/screenplay, rather a 542-page piece of magic that booklovers live for. &quot;In The Fall&quot; is with you whether you are reading, or away from it. Mr. Lent creates characters so vivid, a story that reveals itself without affectation, pretense, or literary sleight of hand, that this book crosses that point in the reader's mind from a book, to an experience that not only immerses you while being read, but crosses from just a piece of fiction you read, to a set of acquaintances that stay with you. The &quot;fictional&quot; conversations and events, the characters so vividly rendered, you know not only would you recognize them on the street, but wouldn't be surprised if you did. This is a story you think about as happening, rather than just a book. The degree to which you enter this world is a rare event, a special experience.The Writer I thought of when enjoying this work was John Steinbeck. The same way &quot;The Grapes Of Wrath&quot; stays with you years after it was read, or &quot;East Of Eden&quot; or &quot;Cannery Row&quot; lingers, this does the same. This is a story you will remember in detail, these are characters names you will always recall, this caliber of book is why I read. &quot;In The Fall&quot; is the first book I have read in years that I believe will be a true classic in time. &quot;Instant Classic&quot; is a moronic contradiction in terms. A classic has to age, to endure, to continue to be relevant, this work has all the necessary credentials, and in abundance.This is Mr. Lent's first book, but it will stand side by side with Writers who have worked their craft for careers. I say this not to denigrate anyone's work, rather to express what an achievement this book is. For those who create the short lists for literary honors this one should be a foregone conclusion. And as for being an award winner, I think that conclusion is as safe a bet as one can make.An incredible book whether the first, tenth, or last. Mr. Lent stay healthy and write!"},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"&quot;In the Fall&quot; is a first novel written by someone who was born to write.

It would seem that Leah has escaped the South and the legacy of slavery in her New England home, but that is far from the truth. The past ricochets through the following generations, leaving a young grandson to look for the truth.The Pelhams, with their strong, unconventional relationships, stubborness, and fits of violence, are an interesting bunch. &quot;In the Fall&quot; is an unusual and compelling debut."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"In the Fall is a remarkable first novel, inahbitated by fully-developed characters living in a complex and evolving world. But it really is a simple book, too. And therein lies its beauty. Jeffrey Lent's ability to create these complex characters -- much like John Irving without the humor -- and move them from just after the Civil War up through the early 20th century exhibits a singular talent. He takes us through the extraoridnary events of their otherwise ordinary lives. And we feel as if we're there in New England, and there in the South with them. The writing is beautiful and lyrical, yet I turned the pages as quickly as if I was reading &quot;The Bourne Identity.&quot; Lent's writing soars in the middle third of the book, and In the Fall has some of a first novelist's ending problems, but the writing is throughoughly enjoyable. I imagine that In the Fall will inevitably be compared with Cold Mountain. Both first novels, both feature the Civil War and its affect on our nation, both wonderful works of literature. Yet In the Fall truly stands on its own as a distinct work of art."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"In the Fall is a tragic story of how society forces its values on us and how we continue to &quot;fall&quot; beneath its weight rather than rise above it. The Pelham family foundation was cracked from the beginning, not because of Norman, who ends up marrying an ex-slave, but because love and intimacy were not openly displayed in the Pelham home although it was experienced in small, everyday ways. Norman finds his own way of expressing his love, not by his words but by his actions. He passes this on to his children, without even realizing that he has left them a legacy to express themselves physically but very seldom, verbally. This thread of expression is woven through all three of the generations represented in this novel. I hope this novel does well; I hope it climbs onto the Best Seller's List because in many ways, this book is about America-its sins, its fears, its history and its family structure. Until we learn to confront and face our past, our future will always be in question and for some, in jeopardy. Jeffrey Lent takes on a subject during a period of time that is still not talked about openly enough among those of us who call ourselves &quot;well educated and well read&quot;. The language is descriptive, vivid and engaging. It sucks the reader in and makes her feel a part of the experience, not as an observer but as a participant. Read this novel and by all means, pass it on."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"Jim Harrison says of IN THE FALL, &quot;I cannot recommend it highly enough.&quot; That caught my attention. I consider DALVA and THE ROAD HOME two of the finest novels of their kind I have ever read. I started IN THE FALL with high expectations. The reviews I read were all glowing in their praise of the book. I was not disappointed. In fact I was pleasantly surprised. In an era when books seem to be written in a hurry to get them to the publisher, this novel takes its time expressing itself. I wasn't surprised to read that Lent writes in his barn. His unhurried pace and meticulous plotting are a joy to read. I found myself fully involved in the reality he created, the highest praise I can offer a writer. I cannot imagine reading another novel this year that moves me the way this one did. In fact I'm having a hard time getting started on other books. Do yourself a favor and buy this novel. Read it slowly, if you can."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"In the Fall is a remarkable novel. It tells a story of a family, through three generations. It is an unwrapping of a family history and the secrets there in. The beginning is during the civil war, when a wounded soldier from New Hampshire is helped by a young girl, an escaped slave from North Carolina. They travel to New Hampshire and on the way fall in love and marry. The people of this novel are so well crafted that you feel you almost know them and yet there always parts that are hidden away. In one scene in the novel, someone says &quot;A man is the sum of his parts.&quot; Foster answers,&quot;Maybe,.. I don't know. Seems to me though, the last one who could do that sum would be the one involved.&quot; He is told,&quot;...everyman is at least two men. One of them known only to himself.&quot; That is how the characters evolve, there seem to be real dimensions that you catch only a glimmer of and other facets that are laid wide open. The story is strong and provocative, and thoroughly captures the reader. The generations are woven gently and not so gently through out each other, creating a wondrous and stunningly intelligent work. The fabulous part is that you really think that you know what is coming next and then it doesn't. A casual yet brilliant conversation in this novel says everything about the author. Someone says,&quot;...You know exactly what [the words] are. You just don't want to say them for fear you'd be wrong.&quot; Foster answers,&quot;I'm not sure it's worry about being wrong so much as wanting to get things right.&quot; Well Mr. Lent, you got it right, very right!!"},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"When I read the dust jacket I was intrigued; it's not often that an inter-racial romance involves a black woman and a white man and I wondered how the author was going to address the complexities of such an relationship which is difficult enough in these times. Then I looked at the author's picture and I thought, &quot;wait a minute.&quot; It's not that I believe white men should not write about people of color. It's not my place to tell an author what they can or cannot write. But too often I have been offended or worse, disappointed with what I read. Too often the author falls into the easy cliches. A black woman is either a brava mamma or a hot mamma. The ugly secret of slavery has always been the sexual exploitation of black women (ask Thomas Jefferson). Because this country is unable or unwilling to come to terms with the terrible history of race, we live with the legacy of that ugly secret every day.The author of this book faced this issue with more courage, sensitivity and humanity than I could ever have believed possible. It will be a long time before I forget the story of Norman and Leah, one of the most beautiful and heart-breaking relationships I have encountered in years.Unlike the majority of people, I was very disappointed with Cold Mountain and my expectations for that book had been high. I didn't expect a lot from In the Fall, but I received so very much."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"Things I love in a work of fiction: Characters, whom I can picture in my mind, and grow to care for. A sense of place--enough description that I know where these characters are living.

As a Bookseller, I have daily opportunities to recommend books. This is No. 1 on my list!"},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"In The Fall is a superbly crafted novel that presents a remarkable portrait of an American family through three generations. Beginnings at the twilight of the Civil War, Norman Pelham is a Union soldier that, wounded and near death, is discovered by Leah, a run-a-way slave. After Leah nurses Norman back to health they return together to Norman's family farm in Vermont as husband and wife, where they begin a family. As their children begin to approach adulthood, Leah finds herself compelled to return to the South to confront the demons she left behind many years before. Leah's journey will change her family's lives forever. Leah's secrets come to life with their grandson Foster is driven to retrace his family history. Dark secrets blister at the core of the Pelham family, transcendent bonds between men and women fuel their lives over the course of three generations and sixty years. The cost of confronting the past is as severe as the cost of fleeing from it. In The Fall is Jeffrey Lant splendid debut as an author of considerable stature, and will leave legions of enthusiastic readers looking eagerly toward his next book!"},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"Although a first novel, which shows promise, Lent is too wordy and self-important which manifests itself in the prose. The book is depressing. The minute you turn to page two, you know that nothing good is going to happen to the characters. Lent copies too much from recent best-sellers, i.e., Cold Mountain, Beloved and Color Purple. If he would choose his own subject, perhaps his prose would flow better."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"I am a member of an online book club and this was a November selection. I kept reading even though I wanted to stop because the book club usually picks such excellent books. I kept waiting to find some redeeming quality with &quot;In the Fall&quot;, it never appeared. I am amazed at all of the good reviews for this book on this site. The writing was so amateuristic and uninteresting. I have no understanding of how this book is getting an average of 4 stars. Everybody's tastes are different. All I can say is if you feel the need to stop reading this do it, because it never gets any better."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"Jeffrey Lent is to be commended for a fine first novel, filled with detailed descriptions of New England in a previous era. He also gives us a poignant portrayal of how slavery overshadowed the lives of both black and white people yet to be born at the time of the War. The inner lives of his characters are poetically revealed to us, with such an impact that we think about them as we go through our own days. However, like so many male writers, he misunderstands the hearts of his female characters. Indeed, the central plot hinge,the suicide of Leah, alienates her from women readers, who will find it hard to understand a mother leaving a five year old son in this fashion, however desperate she feels her circumstances to be. Also, in a plot twist borrowed perhaps from the sci-fi genre, in each generation the central characters meet their mates by being rescued in dire straits, fed, and given carnal comfort. From this springs life-long commitment? A lot of literary license needs to expended to use &quot;love as rescue&quot; not once, but three times."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"I'm wondering if the people and pubs who wrote those rave reviews of Lent's &quot;In the Fall&quot; read the same book I did. I kept reading in the hope that it might get better. It didn't. And the big &quot;secret&quot; that supposedly doomed this family was so lame it was criminal. Don't waste your time."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"Someone PLEASE tell me it's worth my time to continue reading this book. I've only read the first 50 pages and have little interest in continuing. I had great expectations after reading several reviews but cannot get into it at all. I think Mr. Lent's writing is beautiful but awkward and difficult to read. I really want to like it but it feels like a story whose characters and events I've read about quite frequently before. Say it ain't so someone...tell me it's worth finishing."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"maybe because it brought back fond memories of &quot;Cold Mountain&quot;. But I found it flat,boring. I didn't even bother finishing it."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"There were much to many useless paragraphs in the book to keep me interested. While the storyline was good, the story could have been told in half the pages in the book. I even gave it to a friend to read and she quit after 40 pages. Very disappointed!"},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"I found this book terribly tedious to read. Every action and statement of every character is dissected, discussed and analyzed ad nauseam. Sometimes a person wears a plaid shirt because it's the only clean one in the closet. I was looking forward to reading this book because the subject sounded fascinating, but I was very disappointed."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"This is the third big novel to adopt Cormac McCarthy's style. At times, &quot;In The Fall&quot; slips over into parody. I'm only about 100 pages into it, and at times the writing is so good it's almost painful. But now it's like a soap opera and I've lost my ability to care for the characters. It doesn't have the story structure of &quot;Cold Mountain,&quot; which alternated Ada trying to survive on the farm while Inman struggled to get back to her, both powerful narrative hooks. I haven't read &quot;Plainsong&quot; yet, but I hope it will be better. I doubt if any of them are as good as &quot;All the Pretty Horses&quot; or &quot;Blood Meridian,&quot; which is my favorite novel still."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"It's not that the actual story is nonsense but they guy has included so much 'fluff' that you get board waiting on a paragraph with real content. This book was so frustrating, I really wish I had saved myself the bother of reading it."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"In the Fall is a book about a love shared between a white man and a black woman after the Civil War. It tells of some of the horror a black woman was subjected to. It also tells of the great love shared between the main characters. This book will keep you guessing about secrets in the past being dug up and the consequences they have on the family. Some parts of the book will shock you but it adds to the greatness of this book. Jeffrey Lent did an extremely good job writing this book and I highly recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"Suppose Scarlett Ohara was a runaway slave, whose beautiful mother had been raped by the man who owned them, who saved a wounded boy from Vermont and then walked there together as his wife. Almost home a neighbor woman hanging clothes to dry in the sun sees the boy and the Negress and the young man hears &quot;the soft spatter of clothespins falling in the grass behind him.&quot;Leah became kin - not without hurt and always knowing she must set right what she ran from. That takes her life, but troubled, sadly beautiful daughters unknowingly follow the path to - let's call it &quot;redemption&quot; A very twisted path it may seem, but put me in mind of a Moebius strip - gets you on the other side and then back to the beginning. No maps required.A good writer develops a &quot;voice.&quot; This story is in dialect, which evolves imperceptibly from Carolina to the Canadian border, from the era of Lincon to that of Coolidge. A good story should resolve something; all I'll tell you is that meanness and savagery are finally exorcised by a creature that isn't even human. (OK, a puppy dog.) This level of art requires a message, especially because there is trouble about race. And the message is that Americ's race problem is not skin color but slavery.A flaw? Jeffrey Lent admires and honors womenkind - unreservedly. If we have a sex problem in our country it is not about anatomy but respect. I'm with Jeffrey on that!"},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"I really liked this book. It was well written for the time period of the book.

I want to like Norman. Leah, and the children. I just don't. The only character I found that had some semblance of life was Marthe Ballou, and she's dead already. I'm only halfway through the book and I just want to throw it against the wall because I'm so disappointed. After reading all the glowing reviews, I decided to shell out the extra cash and buy the hardcover. I wish I hadn't. Lent wants to be a spectacular writer, and I suspect that he has it in him, but he's trying too hard. This book is in serious need of a good editor. Too much useless verbage and characters with no life. I'm going to plod my way to the end, though, and I hope that I'll change my mind by the last page."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"If you want to enjoy good writing, read it. If you want to enjoy a good story, don't read it. I found the book dark and depressing and the end a let-down.

Mr. Lent's talent is not at question but I found the novel hard to read due to its sentence structure and style.There were parts in the book that truly grabbed me but more often than not, I caught myself skimming and drifting.

But, ahem... hey guys, have you analysed some of this guy's sentences? May I ask where the editors were on this one? Does this guy have delusions of Faulknerian granduer or what? I mean, if someone can straighten me out, &quot;I'm all ears,&quot; in the words of Ross Perot. Can someone explain what is meant by these &quot;run-on&quot; sentences? Or can anyone get published these days? Does that mean there might even be hope for me? There is one particular sentence that is 76 words long. And, I'm sure there are some that are even longer. Have we returned to the era of Dickens where we're paid by the word?"},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"I found this book relentlessly echoing Faulkner's prose -- the broken sentences, omitted subjects, use of participles instead of active verbs -- but without Faulkner's love and deep knowledge of his characters. Also, is all that graphic sex and violence really necessary to the narrative?"},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"First novels just don't get much better than this.

You'll rarely come across a book this good."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"The first 100 pages of IN THE FALL force you to learn a new language as the first few chapters are written using the vernacular of post Civil War Vermont. The effort is well worth it as you are literally pulled into a harsh time and place long gone but vividly portrayed. Once Mr. Lent has you in his grip, he never lets go. The story moves quickly and in beautifully crafted prose. IN THE FALL is a joy to read and to remember. I can always tell the quality of a book by how slowly I read the ending. I had the same feeling when I finished this book that I experienced when I read Light in August many years ago...the feeling that I had just read something very special.Will this become a classic of American Literature? I have no idea, but I do know that it was one of the best books I have ever read and I eagerly await the sequel."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"I, too, was put off initially by Lent's style, but passed through that and was completely absorbed in this wonderful story about characters whom I feel I know. As I approached the end of the book, I could feel myself resisting having to say good-bye to these wonderful people. Even minor characters seemed to inhabit these pages. I thought the author was psychologically astute as he examined the relationships among generations and races, as well as the impact of slavery on all of our lives. I just finished the book and can't quite decide how I feel about the ending, when Foster learns the truth about his grandmother's visit to North Carolina. Although it feels somewhat contrived, it also really does explain its horror and effect on Leah.This was a wonderful book and one I will suggest to many friends."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"This is the most beautifully written book that I have read in years. It took me a while to get into the flow of Jeffrey Lent's writing, especially his style of using minimal punctuation. However, once I got used to it I became fascinated. Of course, this book has a terrific story, and characters. But more importantly, Jeffrey Lent uses images and language that cut to the essence of who we are and the world we live in. On almost every page I found myself smiling as the light bulb in my head lit up and I said to myself &quot;Ah, that's it!.&quot;"},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"This is a great American novel, Faulknerian in scope and language. It follows three generations of an interracial family from the battlegrounds of the Civil War to the pre-Depression South, a family in whose history is embedded a dark and inscrutable secret. Absorbing, compelling and, ultimately, deeply moving, it admonishes us against delving too deeply into our past while recognizing we are impelled to do so. A page-turner as a story, the regional inflections in its language fix it in time and place. The best novel since Cold Mountain. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"There are times when I crave a well written piece of literature I can enjoy for the magic of the language and its ability to transport me to another place and time. Then there are times when I need a juicy page-turner I can't wait to pick up. This book achieves both requirements, which is a gift from the author and a treasure for anyone lucky enough to dive into the Fall."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"This is a book with an interesting premise that makes us look beyond the narrow parameters of our own lives and contemplate the difficulties of a black woman living in a white world in Vermont in an inter-racial marriage. The very act of a former female slave walking from Virginia to Vermont following the Civil War with a Union soldier who would become her husband is the type of prose that makes this book so interesting. The characters are well-defined and the plot flows easily. This was a random selection by me at the library, and I am now a confirmed Lent fan."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"I'm amazed that anyone can rate this novel less than five stars. If you ask me, a couple of more novels like this from Lent, and he'll be up there with likes of Hemingway and Fitzgerald. Seriously, this is one of the best American novelists to debut in the last 70 years!"},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"This book was an amazing read I could not put down. Lent is as poetically discriptive as Pat Conroy, and his insight into human nature was offered in a take-it-or-leave-it fashion I enjoyed. I learned from this book -- my personal test of a good book. It created value in my life."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"Mr. Lent has captured a literary style that surpasses most novelists in his ability to portray emotionality and non-verbal communication with his extraordinary articulation. The first 191 pages of the book were perhaps one of the most emotionally intense texts I have ever read. Through metaphoric language which is not overly stylized, Mr. Lent has conveyed the underlying and heartfelt feelings of his characters in a most illustrative manner.However, after finishing the first 191 pages, I found, what was essentially, 200 pages of &quot;filler.&quot; While the filler was high quality filler, it was filler nonetheless. In fact, the style of the middle 200 pages of the book was so different, that I had the distinct impression, it was written by another author. I then found that the author's style returned at page 395. I believe that the 200 pages in the middle were mostly superfluous, and could have been boiled down to 20 pages. Maybe that is how Lent wrote it to begin with, but his editors decided that a 325 page book was just not long enough, so they added another 200 pages.However, Mr. Lent has tackled the Post-Bellum Civil War era in a Northern setting. While the majority of the Post-Bellum historical novels of the &quot;Reconstruction&quot; period, deal with Southerners re-integrating into a devastated and destroyed homeland, very few authors have written about the Northern soldiers returning home and re-integrating into society, which has been ravaged as well by the war, and by the struggle between ideologies and reality. ...Overall, the book was very good and rated a 4 star rating due to its intensity, subject matter and writing style. However, because of the 200 pages of 'filler', it does not warrant a full 5 star rating. However, the last 140 pages of the book return to the author's previous style and teach us, once again, the lesson we all know, that in one way or another, history is destined to repeat itself."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"The author truly keeps you turning the pages until the last wonderful chapter. The feelings he uncovers about race relations and family ties are so powerful.. then and now. Readers of &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; will love this one."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"I love long, lanquid sentences, even indulgent ones if they describe a world or thoughts that are new to me. However, this is probably one of the most tedious books I have ever read, and I read fiction for a living. I picked up this book after reading interviews with several prominent (male) southern authors who said that Lent should be read by all. However, his prose is so affected that I wanted to scream. Please, God, find a subject and a verb now and again. The CONSTANT fragments ruined the rhythm of the writing and were so jarring that I almost became angrily frustrated as a reader. Lent is no Faulkner, and he would do good to find his own voice."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"Jeffrey Lent is a writer of tremendous talent and In The Fall is awonderful, if flawed novel. It is the story of three men,grandfather, father, son, and it is the story of their family. Wemeet Norman Pelham as a young man, leaving his home in Vermont tofight in the Civil War. He returns to Vermont with a former slave,Leah, whom he marries. They raise a family, but Leah must return hometo North Carolina to face the ghosts that haunt her there. She comesback to Vermont soon after, so torn apart by the evil she has seen (atthis point, we don't know what it is). [I]t is only [her grandson],Foster, who is finally able to face down the demons hauning his familyand to discover what happened to his family.Foster's journey toNorth Carolina to discover the truth, the last 150 or so pages of thenovel are among the most powerful, most thought provoking writing Ihave ever read. I am blown away by Lent's exploration of the evil inhuman nature, the evil embedded in American history and how he makesit personal--intertwining it with the lives of the Pelhams.Thatbeing said ... the novel could have used some editing. Sometimes,Lent's prose is too self-conscious and stiff. Also, as to storyline,the fact that Norman, Jamie and Foster all wind up with essentiallythe first woman they become involved with was a little hokey,especially for a novel of this power. These flaws, though, areoverwhelmed by the strengths of this novel. I look forward to Lent'sfuture work and highly recommend this novel. It will stay with thereader long after it is finished."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"P>You have to give Jeffrey Lent credit for several things here. First, he has the unusual idea of approaching the issue of race in America from the perspective of Northern New England, one of the whitest sections of the country. Second, the book is wildly ambitious. The stories of the three generations of Pelham men summon, in turn, Cold Mountain, The Great Gatsby, and Huckleberry Finn. The miscegenation angle of the book is Faulknerian. The narrative is unwaveringly serious, and the Pelhams and their women are presented as nearly iconic figures. Even the title of the novel is intended to call to mind the Fall of Man. The book's every page cries out to be treated as great literature.On the other hand, the story is so contrived as to strain credulity--although the Norman and Leah section is apparently based on a real Vermont couple. Writers of fiction are to be forgiven the conceit that strangers fall instantly in love. But surely once is enough for this hackneyed device. When it happens to three successive generations of men from one family, we're entitled to object. Moreover, given that the objects of their affection are in turn a slave, a hooker, and a cousin, it 's fair to ask whether this is love at all, or whether these men are not falling in love with types, rather than actual women. These characters just don't seem to behave like normal human beings, and they certainly don't speak like regular people. The whole thing has the stagy, overwrought feel of a Greek or Shakespearean tragedy, in which the reader is constantly aware of the deus ex machina.But perhaps the greatest flaw is Lent's rather fundamental misunderstanding of the story of Man's Fall. The entire point of the Book of Genesis is that God has granted Man free will, despite the troubles it will cause. Certainly it has been a curse at times, but it is also our greatest blessing. It gives us the measure of freedom and control over our own lives and future that may one day enable us too to achieve godliness. But Lent repeatedly suggests that our fates are inevitable and inescapable, that we have no control over our own futures because we are so tightly bound by the past :[He] did not want to be what he was. The same way Mother thought she could leave her old life behind clean he did the same. But it does not work that way.And judging from the events that befall three generations of Pelhams, he also believes that those fates, those futures, are typically unpleasant.In the Fall was released to much hoopla and has won wide critical acclaim, so some folks must be enjoying it, or, at the very least, identifying with Jeffrey Lent's dour pessimism. I just found it depressingly antihuman.GRADE : D"},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"One of the worst things one can say about a book is that &quot;It was too long.&quot; This book could and should have been shorter and what should have been left out was obvious.

Jeffrey's sentences stretch beyond the imagination and take flight beyond themselves. Have you ever read something so meandering and true that you remembered what it felt like to be on the point bank of a long lazy river just whiling away the time? It is beyond dispute that he has captured the South. And, all that there was to tell about us and more.What is most interesting to me is that Jeffrey Lent tells us something we all know. That we are all one race, one people. This is still not an acceptable thing to say.He tells us our history in a way that makes us all understand how this came to be. Now, we need to accept it.Barbara"},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"I enjoyed &#34;In the Fall&#34; as a story and as a historical reminder.

Set during the fall of the world in the apocalyptic Civil War, the novel follows Vermont farmer and Union soldier as he falls in love with an escaped slave and the next two generations of their family. The locations--both deeply familiar to me and also so powerfully described--are so real and so a part of the characters, so full of terrible beauty, that I can smell them as I read. The historical period of the novel is also wonderfully described, reflecting and affecting the tormented characters of the novel. The setting and characters are deeply entwined into this American, family tragedy wrapped in the horrors of slavery and racism, the evils of power over other human beings, and how that can warp and twist a family for generations. The soul of Vermont (particularly in the character of Norman Pelham) is displayed perfectly, standing outside of tragedy, busy with the hard business of living, and nearly powerless to do anything about the horrors he witnesses. The novel drags and meanders very often, is often predictable. But style, setting, theme save the plot. Grade: A-"},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"I am an avid reader and have read thousands of books in the past 60 years. I would rate this book as one of the ten best books I have ever read, including War and Peace and Quiet Flows the Don.In chapter two the first layer of the onion is revealed when a civil war soldier returns to New England with a brown wife from the south. The impact on his family and community is chronicled. Children are born. The second layer is revealed with a crushing impact on one's emotions.The next generation follows. It is as if it is a different book with a different locale and tales of prohibition. . Near the end, when the third generation returns to the farm, more truths are revealed.And finally, the third generation travels south to learn the truth about the former-slave, wife brought home by the soldier.Very well written book by a first-time author. I shall hold my breath waiting for the next work."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"I loved this book! It is the best book I've read all year. The characters are very well-developed and just draw you in. I truly cared about all of the characters. The book tackles a tragic part of American history. The story is very moving and absorbing. Once I began to read, I did not want to stop until I got to the bottom of the mystery. I highly recommend this book. It is long (over 500 pages), but well worth it."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"Yes, this is a book about slavery. But it is so much more. It is a book about the &quot;evil thread&quot; (I've returned the book to the library so I can't quote that passage) that weaves itself through the generations and grows larger in so doing. I especially relished the last third of the book in which Uncle Alex expounds on life -- things he has pondered for years, and things relevant to all of us. By the time I got to this part of the book, the structural elements that had slowed me down earlier vanished, and I was totally immersed. The end is powerful, not just a place to finish as have been so many of my recent reads."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"The characters were full and the rendering of accents exceptioinal. The story line was easier to follow than most audio books, and did not ramble ecessively to loose the listener who may have a need to turn on and off."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"This book tells a familiar story, but the people involved, the settings, the emotional states, are so well drawn. Excellent writing ! The way people love in the story is powerful and heart wrenching. The language is enthralling. Up until the last tenth of this book I thought:&quot;I'm going to buy 10 copies of this book for Christmas presents.&quot; I loved the dogs.The middle &quot;filler &quot; other reviewers have referred to, was my favorite part ! Then I got to the end and became so angry with Jeffrey Lent. Foster was such a wonderful person when visiting his Vermont relatives. When he got to Pelham, I cringed at his immaturity. Mr Lent has him do stupid-but-every-kid-does-it- kind of stuff, but also predictable and unlikely things, like sleep in the cabin behind the house.Drive off into the sunset with HER? HUH? The ending was from who knows where. Otherwise it was an excellent book."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"I found this book to be a really enjoyable read.This is exactly the type of novel that I can barely put down till finished and then cannot stop thinking about,the type of novel I loan to all of my friends and later re-read. Not many novels inspire this kind of fascination. I hope that Mr. Lent continues to write and will not keep me waiting too long for his next creation.."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"I work in a bookstore and got an advance copy of In The Fall that didn't have a plot description which is always interesting. I usually pick up these advance copies almost daring the book to pull me in. With In The Fall, I was hooked almost immediately. It's beautifully written, with profound character insights that are often startling. Occasionally it's a little overwritten, but never fatally. Its lush language is reminiscent of Cormac McCarthy, without being as intense or exhausting. The language never gets in the way of the characters and story which is a little bit East of Eden and a little bit Cold Mountain. I couldn't put it down. I've already bought 2 copies for friends."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"Okay, I read a review of this book and was interested. A friend recommended it, and I was interested. I bought the book, saw the author's photo on the jacket, and I was interested. I started reading, and I was interested. Then I had to take a break. Now, I will admit that I am a lover of story first, and prose second; which might taint this review. I understand and really do appreciate a writer who can craft language in a beautiful way. However, I found that at times Lent's prose was interrupting the telling of the story. Getting used to the cadence of his language took a little bit, but once I did, I was able to read through. I loved his characters, I loved the time he took with them. And thought he really had an interesting story in there; just that at times it got bogged down a bit. I will fully admit that I had these problems with Cold Mountain also, and while these books are not the same at all, I believe if you really liked CM, then you'll really like this one."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"One of the worst imitations of Faulkner that I've ever read."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"I bought this book because the review in Newsweek, called it the next Cold Mountain. I am sorely disappointed in this book. I hate his style of writing. One sentence will be a paragraph long, and the next three are sentence fragments. He didn't make me care about any of the characters. ........................."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"I agree with several other reviewers who found this book much too long and overwritten. Some of the rambling thoughts, often very deep for the types of characters thinking such thoughts, were really overdone. Sometimes the language was hauntingly beautiful and sometimes it was so smothered in wordiness as to not be comprehensible.That said, I think the bones of a good story were there, just too well-padded to always be evident. The author took an interesting approach and the story was somewhat different than other post-Civil War tales. This was the only thing that kept me reading.....but I must admit that I often scanned long passages that seemed to take detours away from the heart of the plot.I look forward to watching this author's progress."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"This is one of those rare novels that absolutely excited me in its restraint of words, of characters' motivations. Jeffrey Lent is able to move into those ambiguous spaces between people and weave his words around the wordlessness of their emotions. I found his stories of the first and third generations most absorbing, whereas the second generation was a reactive story - but what a read. Congratulations from one novelist to another!"},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"One of the worst things one can say about a book is: &quot;It was too long.&quot; This book could and should have been shorter and what should have been left out was obvious. The author interjects deep philosophocal soliloquies into the thoughts of a) an uneducated Vermont farmer folk, b) a freed slave woman, c) a home school dropout bootlegger, etc. It is a shame the author went this route so often, for the story line and theme were excellent. The placement of these philosphical musings just did not fit."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"jeffrey lent is a splendid writer. The book is beautifully composed, exquisite, tender, descriptions so precise you feel and taste them, its three generations of characters carefully drawn, yourself set down into the time and place of the novel. The narrative brings to life a period and locale not too distant from our present but little thought of or written about. The problem if one could call it a problem is that few writers can hope to match the book's elegant touching prose. For anyone who seeks the superior written word, Jeffrey Lent's In the Fall is a book not to be missed."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"Wow, a wonderful but challenging book. Lovely writing - hit in the head, a man's eyes \\"spangled,\\" an angry woman rises from kneading bread in \\"floured fury.\\" And for me, enough of a plot to keep things interesting. But I had to take a break of a few days after the first 2 generations - I was getting drawn in too far and wasn't sure I wanted to find out what happened next. Certainly worth the effort."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"Though solid in concept and pretty in prose, this book could've used a better editor. Much too long and drawn out - I cannot image any reader failing to get impatient with it. 100 fewer pages would've done nicely."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"Lent possesses a beautiful style of writing but there's just plain too much description and internal monologue which prevents the story from moving forward at a reasonable pace. LONG paragraphs could have been shortened to a sentence or two for the same effect. Sometimes he goes over the top in an off-putting way: \\"Like a child sprinting homeward of a hot summer afternoon and sidestepping the basking blacksnake, Leah said...\\" or \\"...she'd have no choice but to follow it back to the source, to let it drain her as a blown beaver dam drains a spreading new-grown marshland and reverts it to meadow.\\" I mean, come on - I like descriptions as much as the next one but this book goes on way too much and still leaves a thin story. Most of the major characters are unappealing [except for Norman who disappears 1/4 through the book, maybe Foster who appears near the end] and the basic ugliness of the way they treat one another is also off-putting. Is there no goodness or decency in human nature? Everyone seems a lost soul and some are downright evil. After the first 100 or so pages, I had to start skimming to try and get at the \\"meat\\" of the story. The biggest moments of the book are treated lightly, however, which is puzzling after all the heavy leading up to. The ending seems forced and inexplicable. I wouldn't recommend this book unless you don't mind spending a LONG time wading through dense prose with very little plot to savor."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"Jeffery Lent is a stroke of genius in his detailed depth of his characters emotions. The story is developed around several autumns (falls) over multiple generations. Issues of love, hate, good and evil are dramatised over the echos of the civil war. Interestingly the unspoken thoughts of the stories average family members - especially when in the parental role is unique and easily identified by parents in today's world.One wonders if the title In the Fall is reference to the time of autumn or the &quot;fall&quot; we experience when we emotionally expect for one thing in life to happen and we &quot;fall&quot; - something else is the outcome? When northern raised Norman returns from the south after the civil war with a young negro &quot;wife&quot;, Leah, in tow- is his abolishonist mother's sudden departure from the homestead a &quot;fall&quot; of her own expectations? Was the telling of a long held fantasy as a personal reality by the &quot;fallen from perfect health&quot;, bitter at the south's falling, Mr Lex 25 years later to Leah a &quot;falling of her own mother&quot; she could not endure, so she also &quot;falls&quot;?This book requires somber reading. The story is beautiful in it's telling of man's relationships - unspoken thoughts that lead us down the road of life from summer into fall. Baby boomers will love this one!"},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"This book is incredibly descriptive and verbose, but I like that style most of the time. I felt deeply compelled to keep reading this interesting family saga but was very disappointed by the last section where Foster goes to learn the truth behind the mystery of his grandmother's life. It falls flat and is just disturbing but not truthful sounding. What I liked best was the story of the love between Leah and Norman and the parts where Foster grows to know his 2 Aunts, who are the best characters inthe book. Much of the praise for this book is about the language and the depth of the story but I have to agree with some who criticize and say it often feels contrived. Still, I feel Mr. Lent did a fine job and has great promise."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"This was a treasure, a surprise, a book that joins the ranks of my top ten favorite books. I didn't want it to end, I was so enamored with the characters and the story. I was not sure in the beginning, as Lent's writing was initially awkward and rambling, but I saw the spark of characters and his painterly descriptions spoke to the artist in me. You will not be disappointed....this will be the gift of choice for my reading friends this Christmas"},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"This simply put, is a great read.I usually don't go for sagas but this one I couldn't put down.I felt like I knew these people.Mr. Lent has hit one out of the park in his first at bat.Like Asher Brauner's 'Love songs of the tone deaf' this is an amazing display of literary talent for a first novel.Definitely read this book, you will abolutely love it"},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"Jeffrey Lent has the outline of a masterpiece, with well thought out characters and a compelling story line that addresses slavery, sex and family conflict. But I found to story to drag in many places with overly long descriptions of seemingly trivial elements. Lent gives little help in seeing what is going on inside the character's heads, but gives endless descriptions of their work and physical surroundings. Although the novel is characterized as a \\"romance\\" by some reviewers, it is certainly not a love story.The story follows three generations of an interracial family, starting at the end if the civil war and continuing through prohibition. The three generations are confronted with issues of race but the first two generations respond with avoidance, by retreating from life and family.I read this book with a book club and most members did not finish reading the book and did not plan to finish reading it, finding that it was not worth the effort. The general consensus was that it was boring and far too long."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"I absolutely judged this book by the cover when I bought it. I had no idea who Jeffery Lent was nor had I ever heard of his book, \\"In the Fall\\". I bought it on impulse almost like I was drawn to the book. The purchase was never regretted and it became one the best books I have ever read. To me, this book is up there with \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\", \\"The Sun Also Rises\\", and \\"The Kite Runner\\" as one of the most well-written novels ever to come across my face. His story telling is immaculate as is his descriptive narrative of the times he is writing about. I won't get into the story line as that is already done in other reviews, but rest assured...this book is definately worth whatever price you will pay."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"I was completely drawn in by the truthful and realistic telling of this family saga. Although we Americans Black and White, know that we are tied together by blood, by history, by love and hate, it is seldom if ever, acknowledged. Jeffrey Lent does make explicit and loving acknowlegement of these ties. His frank and sometimes brutal telling of the facts of human engagement in love and war (on the battlefield, in the house and on the farm) were at times astonishing. His prose and rendering of the successive generations (all destinctive voices and times) made me feel as if I were floating on a sepia toned river of memory and emotion. I was also pleasantly surprised at the sensuality (not to be confused with sexuality) of his writing. Glorious! I particularly enjoyed his descriptions of food and meals shared. In Black American culture meals, particularly Sunday dinner, are seen as a way to express love and caring. Eating together is more than just a way to fill your belly it also fills your soul. I was well fed by this book! I'm looking forward to forgetting it so I can read it again!"},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"After purchasing &quot;In the Fall&quot; a few days ago, I settled down to read it and have found it almost impossible to think of anything else. Mr. Lent provides us with a three-generation epic that truly has only a handful of characters---but what wonderful characters. The plot is powered by a gripping mystery and enfolded by great love stories. Although Norman and Leah, Prudence and Abigail, Jamie and Joey, and Foster are only characters in a novel, they are as real and as believeable as members of my own family. If anyone believes this is only a Northern version of &quot;Cold Mountain,&quot; they are greatly mistaken."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"Don't tell me it's great, tell me WHY it's great. So instructed my English teacher many moons ago, but telling ANYTHING about this story might spoil something for the reader. There are a dozen little surprises in the first 25 pages, and I'd hate for you to lose the impact of any of them. This book is a little &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; as others have noted, but it's also a little Garp and Prince of Tides and any of the other five or six most magical novels of the past three decades. Mostly though it is itself, split infinitives and sentence fragments and all, leaving you with the knowledge that you've been in the presence of one of the greatest storytelllers to ever come along. What a book, and what a story!"},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"My local bookseller suggested this as one of the most impressive new novels of the year. Since her recommendations vary wildly between wonderful woeful and just plain wierd, I took a chance.How right she was. What a great book. My partner and I read it to each other over three long nights, each of us taking turns to chew our way around the dialects. Like a giant river this book is massive and languid and carries enormous power and has undercurrents which pull at your heart and mind. The characters are complex and human, each with their own failings and foibles, and the strongest character (who, without giving too much away, is killed off quite early on) hovers across the remaining story like mist. The author has an incredible feel for how characters are tied to landscape similar to Cormac McCarthy.Some people will say it's slow, but I loved it, and was hugely moved by it, and can't wait to take it to my reading group. If you love Toni Morrison, you'll most likely love this. Like a good glass of cognac, it needs to be savoured in the hand in order to warm the heart."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"I bought IN THE FALL because of the rave review it got in the New York Times, a real rarity for a first novel. I was hooked from the beginning. The fragmented sentences totally fit the country life Norman, Leah and their kids enjoyed. It evoked the constant chores and passing seasons of farm life. I loved Mr. Lent's characters and plots, found them believable and probably pretty accurate for the time and circumstances. But most of all, I'm in love with his use of the language. Soaring, lyrical, an incredible gift with language, he can turn around and sucker punch you when you don't expect it. You know something is coming, but you never have a lot of notice and it's always far worse than you think it's going to be. I loved the Pelham's story and hated it to end. I hope Mr. Lent continues to give us more masterpieces, but if he doesn't, his contribution to American literature is secure."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"I'm generally skeptical of most modern writers -- there's a tendency to project the modern propensity for endless self-examination on a book's characters, a practice that may be believable (but not enjoyable) in a story set in current times, but is less so in historical fiction -- and was skeptical about this one, too, for that reason. I was pleasantly surprised. Jeffrey Lent's writing style is quite elegant and the story he tells most compelling. There's no predicting the turns the story takes, and the progress of life from the late 1860s through to the 1920s is seamlessly depicted, but never laboriously described. It's just lovely the way Mr. Lent carries the reader through these lives as though one is participating in them, and not simply observing them. With one exception, every person in the story abstains entirely from self-psychoanalysis, no one weeps over his or her fates and fortunes and, instead, everyone is swept along in life by the frailties of his or her own character. (Which is, generally speaking, the way life goes.) I enjoyed the characters -- they had complexity and depth -- and liked very much the fact that the story leaves gaps for the reader to fill in with her own imagination. Really quite a wonderful book for any writer; extraordinary for a first effort. I look forward to Mr. Lent's next effort."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"I suppose the comparison with &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; is inevitable, given that book's critical and commercial success -- even Tony Earley made it in the New York Times' Book Review -- but it's also unfortunate. Both books start at the end of the Civil War, but that superficial connection really doesn't tell &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; lovers anything about &quot;In the Fall.&quot; Lent's themes, beside encompassing many decades beyond Appomattox, are far darker and more profound and the writing is compellingly daring as Lent performs a prose high-wire act with his metaphors and narrative surprises. (Nor is he as obsessed with showing off his command of 19th century detail as Professor Frazier) Take &quot;In the Fall&quot; on its own terms and you will be dazzled and moved."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"Jeffrey Lent is truly a fresh voice in American literature. I enjoy his sweeping, descriptive prose and the depth of his characters. Very satisfying. Although they write in different genres, I would compare the poetic nature of Lent's writing to Shade of the Maple by Kirk Martin, whose vivid prose captures the beauty of Robert Frost and Claude Monet."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"I agree in part with most of the other readers' reviews. To the reader from Baltimore, I hope you'll continue to read this one...because Foster's story is by far the most interesting and the best written portion of the book. I found Jamie's story tedious...and in need of more critical editing. Much of the dialoge between Jamie and Joey seemed contrived and not true to the time period. Lent does redeem himself with Foster's portion of the novel and his beautifully descriptive prose is made it difficult to put the book down."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"I have read many books this summer, but this first novel by Jeffrey Lent was the one that will stand out for me. It has everything a reader could possibly want: a bit of American history, incredible use of imagery, poetic prose, love stories throughout the generations, believable characters, and a mystery story to hook you completely until the end of the novel. When I reached near the end of the novel, I didn't want the book to end, but of course it had to. I have a small problem with the ending, which I won't go into in this review. However, this is a must read book for nearly everyone. It's been a long time since I've read a book and wanted to go straight to the end and find out the family secret, butI forced myself to wait. Three generations of living breathing characters await those who choose to read this novel. And while the characters are not typical, they are filled with the human emotions we all carry within us. Enjoy this incredible novel. We will surely hear from and about Jeffrey Lent again."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"Dynamite! Lent's dialogue style and descriptive abilities are reminiscent of Frazier's Cold Mountain, maybe better. I wanted to savor almost every page - I found myself numerous times putting the book down and looking off in to the distance just to keep the taste of the previous passage in my consciousness. I have read historical novels extensively and this is easily one of the best"},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"For me, the character of Leah created the most memorable image and initiated most of my curiosity. A runaway slave who marries a Union soldier from Vermont, Leah puts enough distance between her slave life and her new role as wife and mother to afford her a margin of safety. It is her fate to learn that no matter how far we run, the past follows like a shadow.No matter what events happen in the lives of the Pelhams in the three generations adressed in the novel, Leah is the sole character who permeates the lives of all. Her experiences in Vermont may be mere echoes of her former life, but but the dark shadows of prejudice still lurk everywhere. Mystery surrounds what happened to Leah Pelham when, after 25 years, she returned to North Carolina to confront her past and search for her mother. The answers profoundly affect the rest of her life and her family.Leah and Norman Pelham have two daughters and one son; the girls remain close to home, but the son, Jaimie, leaves without a word to forge his own path, seemingly adrift from the past. In the final chapters, it is Jaimie's son, Foster, 16, who unravels the mystery. He is the vehicle through which we finally learn the entire story as he returns to Vermont and meets his two aging aunts, the family tree as unique and fascinating as he could ever imagine.The details of Foster's grandmother's quest for closure are significant for the remaining cast of characters, but even without this revelation, the damage to generations is clear. The institution of slavery tainted everyone, North and South, and continues to do so today in it's often more subtle forms. The message is clear: evil engenders evil and plunges roots deep into society that eventually choke the soul of a Nation.The author's prose is often long and wordy and perhaps could have benefited from some editorial restraint. But aside from being a novel with a compelling storyline, IN THE FALL is valuable, as well, as an object lesson in the moral devastation that accompanies slavery in any form. If for no other reason, the book is an important testament to the truth of that reality."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"I was assigned this book for an AP Lit class. It was one of the best books we read all year. This book captures the Vermont that can still be found if you travel off the paved roads and into the backwater areas where dirt roads are still more numerous than their black-top cousins - right down to the dialect used: the word &quot;liddle&quot; immediately comes to mind. This book has everything - a plot line that is interesting, with twists and turns, yet is still not confusing; deep characters whose actions work on more than one level; and a good ending.Read it."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"And you thought writing that takes your breath away was a pleasure of the past? Fear not. Jeffrey Lent uses the English language in ways so few people can. I've been a librarian for 20 years and no book has ever hit me like this one. Allow yourself 15 pages a night because you'll be so sorry when you reach the final sentence."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"Really enjoyed this novel. I had seen and heard of it for a while, but was slow to getting around to reading it. Now I'm not sure what kept me away. Lent uses language wonderfully. He has his stylistic idiosyncracies, but isn't that what literature is about - reading unique voices and glimpsing unthought of aspects of the human experience. He approaches the damaging effects of slavery in an interesting way - by tracing the emotional legacy left on a family poised between white and black. Good stuff. Important and thought provoking."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"True this book is a slow read and not an easy one at that but it is worth it! The story slowly unravels leaving the reader deeply involved in the characters. I was so disappointed to read several of your reader's reviews who thought that this story could be told in half the pages! Obviously they should stick to TV."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"Maybe it's because I am unfamiliar with the works it's being compared to, but I thought this was a fine novel. All the criticism about sentence structure is valid, but the mystery surrounding the devastation that followed Leah's return to Sweetboro kept me racing through the book, while concern for the fate of the members of the family swept me up emotionally.The story was powerful and engrossing enough to compensate for any technical flaws."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"This book was absolutely fantastic. I loved how it richly told the story of this troubled family over the generations. It was very difficult to put down once I had started reading it. Kudos to a great first time author!"},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"Mr. Lent's excessive, even self-indulgent, wordiness mars what is otherwise an extraordinary story, well-told. Does every leaf, every rock, every waterfall,every thought require a poetic simile? Some judicious editing would have improved the book. It took an effort to slog through it, but in the end I am glad I did."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"Not unlike Cold Mountain (to which In The Fall has been loosely compared) this novel unfolds at an unhurried pace. Aside from that and the post Civil War setting, I fail to see any real similarities. In fact, I found the overall story of In The Fall to be more interesting in regard to varied characters, settings and actions. If I had to compare to any well known work I would pick Faulkner's Light In August. Those that appreciate literary fiction and aren't in a hurry to get through their &quot;to be read&quot; pile will probably enjoy this novel very much."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"When I started reading this book, I found myself struggling with it. I thought the characters two dimensional, unexamined. On top of that, the story seemed to be going nowhere. Events did not add up, and just when I thought the book was going in one direction, it would turn and go another.Frustrated, wanting to throw the book across the room, I came here to Amazon.com to read reviews of this book. To my suprise, most of them were glowing. A few felt the same as I, and I was shocked more of you did not think like I did. That being, this book is pretentious, and downright boring.The reviews here gave me the courage to go on, and I'm glad I did. Although it takes you almost half way through the novel to get some depth in character, and plot development, it was worth the time invested.I give this book only three stars though for the following reasons. Lent's prose is hard to read at times. Run on sentences, and the occasional deleted word make for some frustrations. Character development was slow in my opinion, which added to my frustrations with his prose. Also, I do think the story was a bit long and could have been a bit shorter. It took me 200+ pages into the book before the plot of the story was starting to take shape.However, Lent does have some very moving sequences in this story, and those make reading this book worthwhile. Take for example the death of Jamie's wife, and the aftermath that follows. So many unanswered questions I had with the book came together for me in that scene and the twenty or so pages that followed. At that point, this book became a labor of love. For what I believed Lent's message to be in this novel became clear to me at that point in the story.As for what that message is, I wont spoil it for you, afterall, that's why you need to read the book."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"I am rounding off my actual 3.5 stars upward to a *4*... in other words, closer to a 4 than a 3! In The Fall was the latest book in the online reading-group that I am a part of, and my overall opinion of the book was the most lenient among us! Most of my negative criticism would be directed at the writing style early on in Part I where my constant thought was &quot;What is with all of this sentence fragmentation?&quot; I've never seen anything like it. Lent's unique sentence and paragraph structure certainly is unnerving at first, and left me wondering if this was intentionally done to exemplify the idiom of late 19th Century America? Or what? I still don't know. I think that readers should be warned that, grammatically speaking, the greater majority of Lent's sentences (in this early section) are actually lacking the &quot;subject&quot; portion... as though the reader is supposed to fill in the blanks. The subject is not plainly given, it is assumed!But I enjoyed the content of Part I which tells the passionate story of how wounded soldier Norman Pelham is rescued by the fugitive slave Leah. They journey to his childhood home in Vermont where together they raise a family. Leah is increasingly haunted by her past however, and events conspire to shatter the general bucolic bliss they, for the most part, enjoyed. Part II is the story of their son Jamie, and Part III deals with Jamie's son, Foster. The inner struggles of three generations are chronicled, and many comments have been made that Part II is almost entirely superfluous, and the story could have been adequately told if this part was omitted altogether. I disagree. I think that &quot;shortening&quot; it would be better than eliminating it. Part II is essential because I think the author wanted to put a sort-of &quot;distance&quot; between the Norman/Leah story and the Foster/Daphne story, to show us that it is possible to &quot;break the mold&quot; (I can't think of a better term) of our generational curses. (Family secrets might be a synonym). But this can only be done by someone who CHOOSES to stand outside of his own anger or resentment, and face the past objectively. To stare at the portrait of the past (as Foster does at the home of Abigail and Prudence) until that portrait speaks to you. The tragic story of Jamie in Part II shows us someone who runs and hides from the past. Foster, in Part II, purposefully runs INTO the past. His end is at least... hopeful.Reading In The Fall felt, at times, like hiking uphill... early on I wished that I was equipped with better boots. But in some way that is as elusive to define as Lent's style, I felt it was worth the climb."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"I picked up this book because of the cover, believing that, after reading the back, it was a Civil War story (my favorite reads) - it is that, but it is so much more. My best friend (also a librarian) saw I was reading it and stated that it was a book she just couldn't get into it, (I can see why it does seem to move a bit slow in the beginning, and the prose boggs it down)I told her what I will tell you - stay with it, as it only gets better as it goes. You are hooked when Leah travels &quot;home&quot;, by the time you get to the story of her son Jaime you are really hooked, by the time his son Foster gets down South, it is an all-night, can't put it down type of story. My advice, stick with it; it is a wonderful story and you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"This is a novel that has it all: well-developed characters that are sympathetic even when their actions are offensive; the moral question of slavery presented in a very thought-provoking and sometime troubling way; human failure; redemption; and finally, a prose that, once you catch its cadence and structure is truly a thing of beauty."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"This is a beautifully wriiten book that delves into the complex issue of race relations in the guise of a family saga. The story was compelling, but the most interesting aspect of the book is that is makes one think about how complicated racial makeup is, and that any concept of race must take into account so much more than the skin-deep view. It is also a look at power, both political and sexual. and the close relationship of power and race. My only disappointment with the book was that there was very little elaboration on the schism between Jamie and his family and very little insight into his own feelings about his racial past and why he kept it hidden from those closest to him. Presumably it was because it was easier for him to &quot;pass&quot;, but he did now seem like the kind of person to chose ease. I enjoyed the relationship of Foster and his dogs, and the positive view of women that pervaded the book."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"Many new novelists seem to think that they need to write in the first person, or spend an inordinate time putting themselves into any story, no matter how unlikely. I thought that In the Fall was one of the best books I have read in a long time.The main characters of the novel are shown in painful, unsparing detail, and the lives lived are often hard to read about. But you will, as the writing just keeps you reeled right in.I'm a dog person, and his descriptions of a young boy taking up dogs and dog training was just wonderful and (always surprising in a novel!) accurate. The descriptions of farm life in the late 19th, early 20th century, shown as grim yet oddly fullfilling, were enthralling. You can really lose yourself in this book, which is always a delightful surprise."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"Jeffrey Lent's book, In the Fall, is a captivating novel with hauntingly indepth characters. You find yourself completely surrounded by the places and drawn into the fears, expectations, loves, losses and sometimes brutal reality of life for three generations of a family as it struggles to fit into the quickly changing world of New England after the Civil War and the legacy of racism that is their history. This novel is powerful and will reach deep into your heart. Lent brings the pain of our country's slave history to characters that are real and powerful in their ability to survive. This is an impressive novel which includes masterful historic details both of time and place flowing through a story that is rich and rewarding."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"I adore this book! I read a lot of novels, and this is one that I enjoyed from start to finish. The characters pull you in, and with each passing generation, you feel a loss. The ending was hard for me to get through, so terribly sad, but the answers to questions are there, and brought the story full circle. It was a remarkable story, I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"As a first-time novelist (&quot;The Legacy&quot;, Savage Press, 2000), I appreciate quality prose written by other first timers. Jeffrey Lent has hit the mark in this epic saga of Americana. Lent's charecters, his use of language and dialogue, all point towards a long and illustrious career as a fiction writer. Having just read &quot;Peace Like a River&quot;, another much celebrated debut novel, I can honestly say that I liked &quot;In the Fall&quot; better. For readers who cherish history, this book seems to be a better fit. Both are expertly written and have memorable charecters but the overall historical context and Lent's positioning of race as a central theme, in a book set in lilly white New England, held my interest and compelled me to read when I wanted to sleep. Bravo!"},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"I seldom read fiction;I always find myself asking, &quot;Who cares about these people. They're not real..&quot; But from the onset I was spellbound by the poetry of characters Mr. Lent has created with &quot;In The Fall&quot;. I don't believe I have ever read anything as courageous as the meeting of Jamie and Pompelli. Jamie was such a combination of his father and mother; that explains him. And Foster-the exposure of Foster lies within the ONE page where he asks the lawyer FIVE times &quot;And I don't owe you anything?&quot; No, Foster, you owe me nothing. And &quot;In The Fall&quot; will owe you nothing. But you will be anxious for the next book from Jeffrey Lent."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"Why so much praise and wonderment for this book? It is abysmal. I can't recall when I have enjoyed a story less. Was there an editor involved anywhere in the process? Incomplete sentences seem to be the only type that Mr. Sears can write. I understand writing within a dialect for effect, but it isn't a successful tactic in this novel. It is a failed conceit. Mr. Sears wastes paragraphs describing scenery, I am supposing as an attempt to bring us into the world of the characters. Then when something truly important happens he provides it with 3 (incomplete) sentences. Example: chapter after chapter about Leah and Norman's struggles to conceive and the eventual birth of a daughter. Then one measly paragraph telling us that a few years later she had another daughter, and years after that a son. It's an absurd way to tell a story and completely unsatisfying. I could get past the misuse of language if the story were worthwhile, or perhaps if it helped transport us to the time and place of the novel, but that just doesn't happen. Lessons go unlearned, sons repeat the mistakes of their fathers, people behave badly and without remorse. I am left feeling a great loss, though, for the time I wasted on this book."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"Slavery, racism, sex, and how they all can effect not only those currently involved, but generations of people is what struck me most about this novel. As we think about our roots and think of where we came from, this book can add a different level of thinking.This book was well written, but seemed long winded in a couple of the areas and details. I didn't like the way the characters story would just stop and skip to the next generation. As others have said as well, I thought the ending was a let down.The thing I liked most about this novel was that it makes a person think about it when they are not reading it. It aslo makes a person think about their own lives and how certain things can pertain to it, such as how our actions today can effect others ofour posterity later on.If you are looking for some modern day literature that goes beyond the average story then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"I was lured by the great cover, &amp; stellar reviews, but this book, as another reviewer said, is so derivative, not only of Faulkner but especially Cormac McCarthy. Anybody who's read McCarthy will, I expect, cringe at the repeated use of verbs like &quot;tamp&quot; &amp; all the working-class language &amp; taciturn (&amp; shallow!) characters. The story's reasonably compelling, &amp; I liked the middle section best, &amp; yes there are some beautiful passages, but the prose is a cheap, clunky (intentionally clunky, it's still clunky--doesn't matter) imitation of true masters. You want a better imitation of Faulker &amp; McCarthy, read Frazier's Cold Mountain. At least he has a grasp on sentence structure. And the ending's not even close to making it worthwhile. Please, literary hierarchy, don't send us any more cheap imitations like this one! Writers, strike out on your own!"},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"I enjoyed the story, but it took too long to get through the book. Too much detail I just didn't care about, and the end of the book when Foster visits the old man is just painfully slow. I couldn't wait to be done with the book!"},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"One of the best books I have read in a long long time. Wow. What a story teller! What a writer. Here'a couple of lines: \\"the sotted sex-wraithed stain of youth.\\" Or \\"His hands worked up and down the ivory and ebony keys like a lover finally at home.\\" Or. \\"workers were imbecilic, misshapen, enormities of oddity...\\""},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"The author is apparently one of those humans who are very aware of emotions and thoughts about them, moment to moment. The good news is that personality - and the ability to get it on paper - allows him to explore characters' thinking in depth. The bad is that it often isn't clear who is thinking, the author or his characters. This is especially a problem during the first half, where thoughts go on so long that they often get separated from accompanying actions in a way that is tedious.Another problem from this perspective is that to the manically aware personality, a lot of what goes on in everyday human affairs is writ so large as to seem cruel. This I suspect lends to the author's recurring theme of the cruelty of humans. That's too bad, because there is a lot of thoughtful insight in this book about life and racism and, much of it comes from of all places, one of the cruelest characters.For a book that spans over 60 years, there is little of the world around these characters. That's how the author can seem very profound isolating on family relationships, yet miss the pull of the world and history (weren't there, e.g., a world war and several economic depressions during this period?). That leaves the story a bit about life in a bubble, a little thin.Finally, however, Lent has met the universal \\"how to end\\" problem and faltered. In the last long section of the book, he gives the reader a rural-raised 16-year old who, even recognizing that kids used to grow up faster, is mature far beyond his years or believability. At the same time, he turns this 16-year old, one who can see through and outwit a wily, cruel old man over the course of a few days, into a naif unable to recognize the transparent desperation of a local girl looking to escape rural Southern life. It makes for a happier ending than a satisfying story."},{"Title":"In the Fall","review":"What I loved about this book was the ending. It actually had one. So many books I read are spetacular until the end, then it feels like the author's editor has said, \\"you better meet your deadline\\", and they finish abrubtly or without meaning or continuity with the story. This book, I feel, did not do this. It is a fabulous story, and you wish for it to go on and on, but it can't (although, with the ending, you know that the story does continue).Ok, so starting with talking about the ending of the book probably doesn't pull you in. Let me tell you why you should read this book. You should read this book if you like stories that are unique. James Patterson, Nicholas Sparks, Danielle Steele, etc. readers need not apply.You should read this book if you can appreciate good writing. Sometimes Lent can get a little wordy, but his descriptions are not pretentious, just too generous, but you forgive him for the story, and it doesn't happen often.You should read this book if you like to be caught up in a book. This one is a page turner.You should read this book if you like American family epics.You should not read this book if you only like to read pleasant stories where nothing goes wrong and there is a happy ending.I don't usually read a book more than once, but I will read this book again."},{"Title":"Plain facts for old and young","review":"here in Brazil,I read online this book, writen in XIX Century.Its author was Dr. John Harvey Kellogg(1852-1943) a then famous american doctor.Among the twenty biggest doctors at that times, this book has some good things that remains correct today;just 20% of this book remains correct.It is against smoking and advices the exercises.All the 80% of this book is just quackery, for today's standards.To example, the author claims that dozens of diseases are produced by masturbation.No disease is produced by masturbation, but only decades after the publishing of this book, this fact was discovered.Kellogg was outspoken on his beliefs on eugenics,race and segregation. In 1906, Kellogg founded--together with his brother and Charles Benedict Davenport, the Race Betterment Foundation, which became another center of then new eugenics movement in America. Kellogg was in favor of racial segregation and believed that immigrants and non-whites would damage the gene pool. Also, Kellogg gave a large portion of the common stock of the Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company to the Race Betterment Foundation.See the book \\"Progressive Era's Health Reform\\" to read about this subject.Please, I read this book online,not this particular(and new) ediction.Even so, the table of contents of this book is:Chapter 1 Sex in Living Forms.Chapter 2 REPRODUCTION.Chapter 3 ANATOMY OF THE REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS.Chapter 4 Sexual Hygiene.Chapter 5 MARRIAGE.Chapter 6 CONTINENCE.Chapter 7 Unchastity.Chapter 8 THE SOCIAL EVIL.Chapter 9 SOLITARY VICE.Chapter 10 RESULTS OF SECRET VICE.Chapter 11 TREATMENT FOR SELF-ABUSE AND ITS EFFECTS.Chapter 12 A Chapter for Boys.Chapter 13 A Chapter for Young Men.Chapter 14 A Short Chapter for Old Men.Chapter 15 A Chapter for Girls.Chapter 16 A FEW WORDS TO BOYS AND GIRLS.Chapter 17 A Chapter for Young Women.Chapter 18 Chapter for Wives and Mothers.Chapter 19 Hygiene for Women in Advanced Life.Chapter 20 A Chapter for Married People.Chapter 21 INFANTICIDE AND ABORTION.Chapter 22 Diseases Peculiar to Women.Chapter 23 Diseases Peculiar to Men.Chapter 24 General Health Hints.Chapter 25 ONE HUNDRED CHOICE HEALTH THOUGHTS.Even ridiculous for today's standards, this book has the value to show how medicine became better today, in one hundred years.Dr. Kellogg was an eugenicist?Yes, but in this time famous persons such as Lenin, Stalin, Trotsky,Dr. Morris Fishbein,the Wright brothers, Charles Lindenberg, Woodrow Wilson, Herbert Hoover, H. G. Wells, among so many others, were eugenicists too.For today's standards the author of this book was a quack, but he was better than the average of doctors, in his times."},{"Title":"Plain facts for old and young","review":"You can preview this text in the \\"Search Inside\\" link at the top, or download a very large PDF at archive.org, but why not support the publisher and buy a hard copy?This was written in 1910 and published before the sexual \\"revolution\\", when social standards were yet unaffected by the propaganda of Kinsey and Skinner, when life was ruled by common sense rather than the constantly changing theories of academics and social activists. In those days, survival was the guiding principle, including survival of the family, along with the search for a righteous way to live. Call it folk wisdom or traditional beliefs if you like, this book has eye-opening material for today's reader. Kellogg discusses celibate/chaste living for singles, especially for young people, with honest advice for married couples. Read his descriptions of what happens when these principles are not followed, and then look around at society today and decide for yourself whether he speaks the truth.No need to get involved in the social wars for purposes of this review, but read this with an open mind in the sense of how to live a safe and sane life, free of obsessive/compulsive pleasure seeking that frequently causes great pain. Consider the possibility that you have spiritual principles to strive for, and the chances for this are aided by having a clear conscience, a clear mind, and a source of energy that can be transmuted into something higher. Try it and see for yourself - it won't hurt you - you might find that you still have a chance for returning to wholeness, and regaining the clearness of mind you once had as a child."},{"Title":"The Color of Horses: The Scientific and Authorative Identification of the Color of the Horse [with 34 full-color paintings by Darol Dickinson]","review":"Color of Horses is a fantastic picture book of various horse colors. It is not a book on color genetics. Instead, Color of Horses is concerned with the physical makeup of each hair, how that reflects light and thus produces color. Another color concern is how the various colors withstand the effects of hard work and sun. A great picture book with a unique slant on horse color."},{"Title":"The Color of Horses: The Scientific and Authorative Identification of the Color of the Horse [with 34 full-color paintings by Darol Dickinson]","review":"I really enjoyed the lovely paintings in the book. They portray the horse colors in an accurate way. I just would not be too quick to believe the author's explanation of these colors. There really is not much valuable information on genetics which other books explain much more thoroughly. But, even so, I would recommend the book to anyone looking for pictures of solid colored horses."},{"Title":"Mary and the Eucharist","review":"We are using this book as a study in our Legion of Mary. We continue to buy a copy for every new member because it contains such good material. The book is deep and takes some thought, so we take a little each week."},{"Title":"Americas Abraham Lincoln","review":"I think May Yonge McNeer's juvenile biography, \\"America's Abraham Lincoln,\\" is clearly influenced by Carl Sandburg's celebrated biography of Lincoln. It is not that McNeer has the poet's touch, but she has the same tone of reverence and provides the same sort of details to fill in the spaces that Sandburg provided in his three volumes. That reverence extends to the illustrations, which were done by Lynd Ward, McNeer's husband (notice that the 1957 copyright of the book is for May McNeer Ward). The result is a well-done intermediate biography of Lincoln for young readers in grade school.McNeer begins the story of Abraham Lincoln when he was seven-years-old, contrasting his life on the frontier with his thirst for learning. The book is not divided into chapters and there is not an index, but the illustrations will help you identify what part of Lincoln's life is being covered at any point. \\"America's Abraham Lincoln\\" covers the key events, stories, and words of Lincoln's life. There are not a lot of historical details, for which young readers will be able to turn to longer biographies, but there is an emphasis on Lincoln's qualities. This is a somewhat idealized portrait of Lincoln, but that is certainly age appropriate for this type of biography. McNeer makes a point of providing the historical context against which Lincoln lived his life, although the details on the Civil War are rather general and there is not a sense of how Lincoln was the consummate politician of his generation. But since this is an intermediate biography that approach is acceptable.A strength of this volume at the illustrations by Lynd Ward, which consist of both full-page, full-color art and smaller black & white half-tone drawings. There is art on every-two page spread and some of the standout pieces are one-page paintings of Lincoln working a flatboat down the Mississippi and leaving on the train from Springfield for Washington, D.C., the two-page red tone painting of the Lincoln-Douglas debate, and the pencil drawing of Lincoln delivering his Second Inaugural Address. These illustrations make clear the artist's admiration for Lincoln. If something about Ward's art rings familiar to you, it is probably because he was the artist for Esther Forbes' \\"Johnny Tremain.\\" Even if this is your first exposure to his artwork, you will be impressed by the over 60 illustrations Ward provides for this volume."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"I bought this edition because I was so horribly disappointed with the free version, which had no poetry. I wanted to be able to read the wonderful poems, like The Walrus and the Carpenter. However, this edition has no table of contents, and no index, which means I am unable to search for and go to the places in the book I am interested in. This makes it useless to me. Once again, I am horribly disappointed. Also, the reviews all praise the illustrations, but unfortunately, there aren't any!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"The book was for my 21 yr. old daughter.

It's funny, ridiculous, weird, confusing, and VERY much on drugs. I'm sorry... Did you just ask me to eat a mushroom? The many drug references, however, are extremely amusing, and add to the story very much.Alice is asleep and dreaming up a crazy world. The characters she meets are all eccentric, strange, and frightfully funny. Whether we're thinking of the Mad Hatter, the rabbit, or the Queen of Hearts herself, this book is truly a child's happy adventures through a completely ridiculous fictional land (unless you are firm in your belief that this book is completely about drugs, but even then it's still funny and ridiculous).Even though this book is known as a children's book, it is hilarious to all who read it. Enjoy! I just hope you remember to breathe while gasping with laughter."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"This book was so enjoyable! I think that anyone, young or older child, teen, or adult would love every page of it. I felt that it went by fast most of the time, but some parts were repeatable. I almost wish it were a little shorter, like each story only 100 pages so it would go by faster, but it was still very enjoyable. I actually have to say I like 'Through the Looking Glass' the best. I had always thought these were just short childrens books, I was surprised when I found out how big they were! I didn't really like the end of 'Through the Looking Glass' since it was about the same as the end of 'Alice's Adventure's In Wonderland'. The end of 'Alice's Adventure's In Wonderland' was better because: 1. I read it first, and 2. It was just better and I was very surprised by it (guess I haven't seen the movie \\"Alice In Wonderland\\" in a while!). However, they are both very good stories that anyone would love and I will recomend it for everybody. PLEASE rate if this review was helpful to you. THANK YOU!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"This is the ultimate children's book. From the beginning when Alice falls down the Rabbit hole and leaves Dinah, it captivates the reader and enchants the reader. Carroll was a master of outlandish and imaginative fiction and this statement is proven when you read this book.Dont listen to any of the 'nonsense' that Alice in Wonderland is based on LSD trips etc. This is nothing but people trying to take away Carroll's genius from him.Great Book."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"'Alice in Wonderland', by Lewis Carroll, is an excellent book for both adults and children. It details a little girl's wild adventure through a make believe world. The writing was clever. And so were the characters and situations created by Carroll. Everyone is familiar with the principal idea of the book, but reading the book forces you to remember all the particulars. It it clear why children love this book, which it's fantastic situations.Being a software developer and a computer science major, it was also interesting to pick up on concepts such as reasoning and logic skattered within the book (Carroll was a mathematician). Of course these concepts are skewed in Wonderland.If you've never read this book before, put it on your \\"must read\\" list. It's a short book and a fast read. If you you're read it already, why not read it again?"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"Nice presentation of the two books with the classic illustrations.

My youngest child says she likes them because they are the only books that really give a feeling of how life is to children. Even though they are 150 years old they still seem relevant. (I think maybe that means that Lewis Carroll did not fancy little girls, instead he IDENTIFIED with them). I could keep reading these books through my childhood and teenage and adult years and always find something new. I learned the poetry off by heart and so did my partner (before we met each other) (Lewis Carroll also wrote many more poems and the funny ones are just as good as the ones in these books) The puzzles and contradictions in Alice are fun. And there is a magical feeling of &quot;anything could happen&quot;. To me that never got scary because Alice always coped fine. I too prefer Through the Looking Glss(like another reviewer did) not just for the poems but the whole idea of everything being back to front. These are tremendous books! If you like formal logic then L. Carroll's &quot;Symbolic Logic&quot; is crazy and amusing but also interesting and so are his Tangled Tales about maths. These are not so well known."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"Its hard to imagine anyone not enjoying this brilliant book. Whether you're a young child or an experienced reader, you can't help but marvel at the charm that Lewis Carrol creates. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (The Alice books as they are often collectively referred to as) are two of the most enduring children's stories of all time. However, at the same time, they both are considered to be literary achievements in the adult crowd, due to the many societal critiques hidden withing the text.Alice's Adventures in Wonderland begins with the classic scene of young Alice falling down the rabbit hole. Soon she finds herself lost in an insane world. Drinking things make her grow into a giant or shrink to the size of a mouse. Best of all, are Alice's conversations with the many eclectic characters that inhabit Wonderland. Unfortunately, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland comes to an end within the one hundred page mark (it is a children's story, after all). Fortunately, this collection holds the book's sequel Alice Through the Looking Glass. In this Alice stumbles through a looking glass and finds herself in Wonderland again. This time around she becomes a pawn in a giant game of chess. The reader follows her adventures as he tries to become a queen by making it to the eighth square. This chessboard element proves a very intersting way of advancing the storyline.What truly gives this book its lasting charm is its characters. Whether its the Mad Hatter telling Alice about his friend Time, or the disappearing Cheshire Cat, every character is impossible to forget. Many such as the White Rabbit, remain popular icons today, well over a century later. Conversations held with these characters often prove laugh out loud funny, as Alice tries to make sense of and explain herself to these characters. From beginning to end, the reader will have a goofy grin plastered across his or her face.Behind all these fun adventures, Carroll manages to slip in a large amount of social commentary. Some characters represent types of people, such as the overzealous monarch, to display in an exaggerated sense the foolishness of such extremes. His many poems throughout the book often have larger meanings as well: The Walrus and the Carpenter are clearly a condemnation of modern religion. Even the wild effects of drinking and eating can be interpreted as a moral on temperence. As the Duchess in the Wonderland said \\"Everything's got a moral, if only you can find it.\\" Likewise, Alice is rife with various morals.So what makes this book a classic? Reading through other people's comments, its hard to find a single person that didn't give it five stars, much less didn't like it. However, it was hard to find a definite consensus on what made it so good. Some stated its entertainment value, other enjoyed the commentary. Perhaps what makes this book so brilliant is that it has whatever you're looking for. If you want escape and adventure, it has it. If you want to laugh, there's humor. If you want intellectual thought and prose thats there too. What will the reader take away from reading is whatever they are looking for. Definitely a book that deserves its recognition as a classic of English literature."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"This book was great for children and adults alike!

I believe I found that the best available editions, if you want both, are:The BLTC at 1.79Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (BLTC Press Edition)- this edition is very well formatted with all the Tenniel illustrations that I recall and is the one I purchased myself.The Bompacrazy at .99Alice in Wonderland (Illustrated)orAlice's Adventures in Wonderland (Illustrated)(these two appear to be exactly the same from the samples as both have the 'blotted out' picture of the Drink Me tag): this is almost as good a choice, though not quite as well formatted. The sample has a Rackham illustration (and there may be more) as well as the many Tenniel, though, which is a plus.The free Gutenberg org versions - lacked the improved linking and formatting, but there are various illustrated editions; may be worth it to you if .99 is too much or you are looking for something other than Tenniel.I did see a kindle version of an 'Original First Edition' Alice which appears to be illustrated by Arthur Rackham - in case you are looking for that one instead of the better known John Tenniel version.Alice In Wonderland - Original First Edition Version Published For Kindle - Lewis CarrollThat edition has no Tenniel illustrations in the sample; also the text seems to be abridged (or just maybe an earlier version?) and the formatting is poor. Note that the picture of Alice looking at the Cheshire Cat in a tree that appears on this linked product page is not the cover that appears on the downloaded sample; the cover that does appear is of Alice walking with the Duchess and looks like this kindle book:Alice's Adventures in Wonderland & Through the Looking Glass- now for more typical Amazon mis-linked craziness, this latter edition has Tenniel illustrations, but beware that they are very small thumbnails and enlarge to very poor quality. I do not recommend either of these editions. The Rackham is available at Gutenberg for free.Today I discovered the Master EditionThe Complete Alice in Wonderland (Kindle Master Editions)which I missed before (likely because I was concentrating on Through the Looking Glass, which has far fewer editions, and then pursuing the 'matching' Alice in Wonderlands). Today the price is .89 and I am going to buy it. It is at least as well formatted as the BLTC (based on the sample) and has even more Alice writings (beyond Wonderland and Looking Glass) as well as essays and historical info and other 'add-ons'. He has all the illustrations from Tenniel and additional ones from Holliday and Carroll (I think he should add Rackham's, too).As many others have said, the basic Kindle edition is a very poor choice, and most others also lack the illustrations. Thank goodness for samples.Re Through the Looking Glass, it was the chess board appearing in the BLTC sample (and not in the BompaCrazy sample) that finalized my choice in their favor (before finding the Master). Here are the BLTC and BompaCrazy links:Through the Looking Glass- BLTCThrough the Looking Glass (Illustrated)- BompaCrazyI hope this review helps you find your best choice far more quickly than I did."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"I love Alice in Wonderland. I've been reading it since I was a small child, hence I can honestly say that whoever retyped this for the Kindle did a shoddy (my peers would say \\"half-assed\\") job. Oh, it's readable, don't get me wrong. But if we'd bought this as a paperback, there would be an outcry, so why not shout out one for the eBook crowd? Shame on you!There are tons of typos. The quotation marks are in that cheap ASCII nearly-sideways type that makes you blink more than once until your eyes adjust. Italicized words jumped between actual italics to underscores before italicized words (e.g., I will prosecute _you_). John Tenniel's illustrations are non-existent (oh, the horror!!). But my biggest complaint, though, is the presentation of the poetry. In fully-justified, unpunctuated paragraphs. Are you serious, Kindle publishers?!?I got my first taste of things to come with \\"The Mouse's Tale\\" (Fury said to a mouse that he met in the house...), usually written in a fun, swirly format with decreasing font size. (You can see the original at [...]). I realize this would have been difficult to redo in the Kindle format, especially when the user is given the option to make the font bigger or smaller at will. But at least put it in stanza format! I tried to reproduce the result of the attempt, but Amazon's comment box reformats everything, so I'll try to demonstrate:Fury (huge gap) said (huge gap) to a mouse That he(huge gap) met (huge gap) in the (huge gap)house Let us bothgo to (huge gap) law, I will (huge gap) prosecute you.It's the worst example of full-justification allowable - the humongous gaps between words, no punctuation, three or four words per line...and so forth. Making the text bigger or smaller made it worse.The rest of the poetry is in plain old paragraph format, with punctuation thrown in haphazardly or missing altogether. In \\"Through the Looking Glass,\\" consider the presentation of \\"The Walrus and The Carpenter.\\"The Walrus and the Carpenter Walked on a mile or so, And then they rested on a rock Conveniently low; And all the little Oysters stood And waited in a row.\\"The time has come,\\" the Walrus said To talk of many things Of shoes--and ships--and sealing-wax--Of cabbages--and kings--And why the sea is boiling hot--And whether pigs have wings.Readers might find this a little thing, but I'm sorry, this just bothered the hell out of me.I guess I should have expected it. I only paid 99 cents for this version, and you get what you pay for. And for God's sake, don't fall for the \\"free full versions\\" out there that were typed by \\"scholars\\" and available on the web for nothing - they're worse yet! So I give this 3 stars - a wonderful story brought low by lazy copy-editing.Honestly, publishers, if you're going to redo a classic for the Kindle: (1) Include the original artwork, (2) format it correctly so it resembles the original hard copy as much as possible, and (3) spell-check it, for crying out loud. Don't make Kindle owners wonder what other crap is in store that will make us sorry we bought the thing and just reach for our old paperbacks instead."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"After more than a century, young Alice's adventures in Wonderland are still fun. True, there are a good many dated notions and difficult puns. But, even so, my six year old and I had good fun with the tale. That said, I think our success with the book depends a good deal on the edition we choose. By luck we stumbled upon Peter Weevers' illustrated version (Alices Adventures In Wonderland). Sadly it's out of print. Such marvelous pictures! Mr. Weevers really brought Wonderland to life for us.By contrast, most editions contain JOHN TENNIEL's classic/original drawings. Frankly, I think they're a bit dated and dreary. Purists will certainly adhere to them, but other illustrators have done far better. My suggestion is that you search for Alice and find one with another illustrator! One option is the unique artwork of Alison Jay (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland). Not to everyone's taste, but more alive and child-friendly than Tenniel. Another option is the Cooper Edens' edition (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland -A Classic Illustrated Edition). A new edition that looks quite promising is illustrated by Helen Oxenbury (Alice Through the Looking-glass: Walker Illustrated Classics.In another episode, my first experience with Alice was a very bad one. I made the mistake of buying an annotated version. I'm not sure which one. Perhaps:The Annotated Alice: The Definitive Edition. I got so completely tripped up, looking up 19th century references to English politics and what not. I'm sure that aficionados can appreciate Carroll's deeper humor, but for most of us this is just a kids' tale. Don't buy an annotated version unless you're already hooked on Alice.All things considered, here is my advice. DO buy the original Lewis Carroll text (unabridged, not rewritten). It's lively and fun. Especially if you are reading to a young one: DO NOT buy a Tenniel illustrated edition. Try to find a used copy of Weevers' version or take a chance on the an Oxenbury edition, such asAlice's Adventures in Wonderland. And lastly DO read Alice. Her travels through Wonderland are still lots of fun."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"My son stayed at home \\"sick\\" and I said he couldn't watch TV or play computer but he could listen to this audio book.

Best formatted version for the kindle!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"I'm referring specifically to the Books of Wonder editions for this review (Alice: ISBN 0-688-11087-8, Looking-Glass: 0-688-12049-0, or together in a box: 0-688-12050-4). The books are elegantly presented: Alice with a gold color cover and gold gilt edges on all three sides, Looking-Glass with a silver cover and silver gilt edges on all three sides, and the box being in gold color and looking almost identical to the Alice volume. The books are printed on fairly thin, very smooth, and somewhat off-white paper -- the color of which I personally find detracts a little from the books. The books are identical in layout, typeface and illustrations to the original 1865 &amp; 1872 Macmillan editions: the type has been reset and is thus perfectly crisp, the typeface (De Vinne) is a perfect match to the original typeface except the quote marks are a bit more spaced out than is usual. The text is otherwise a perfect match, with line breaks in identical places, etc. The speciality of these Books of Wonder editions is that the illustrations have been printed from the original woodblocks which had been sitting forgotten in a bank vault for many years. The books claim that &quot;details never seen before are now visible&quot;, but I haven't been able to see evidence of this myself: the illustrations _are_ considerably cleaner and crisper, but I've not seen any extra details. On the down side, a number of the woodblocks had editing done on them when they were made, and over time these edited portions have clearly shrunk or no longer fit perfectly into the surrounding wood, so that the editing is much more clearly visible than on facsimiles of editions from 100 years ago. A nice pair of books, but I personally find the Macmillan facsimile editions to be much nicer to handle."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"Although the pictures are great I'm sure, I'd like to warn those searching for a copy with pictures not to get a paperback copy. I recently got a paperback copy, extremmlly happy that it would have pictures as well as words, but it contained none. It does however say in the amazon review that the hardcover addition contains pictures, nothing about the paper back edition, so it is my fault. So if you want pictures, get the hardcover copy."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"Wonderful stories and this one has the pictures! I bought this for my son after the electronic version we got skipped all the photo plates. This has them, just as you probably remember them - Humpty Dumpty, the Jabberwoky, the Queens and Kings, and of course Alice herself. The big pictures are big enough for a child to sit poring over for several minutes, and quite a few small pictures sprinkled about to keep interest high. I remember having my own quite similar book as a kid and bought this for my (at the time) five year old son.Contains both 'Alice in Wonderland' and 'Through the Looking Glass' in one volume. A must have for reading aloud to emerging and expert readers alike, and it's a nice important feeling book for them to go over on their own as well."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"This book is almost like a dream.The way Lewis Carol sweeps you out of your world and into Alice's is simply wonderful.Inside this book of dreams are alot of details about how life was back then, they're just not straight forward.I think this book is appropriate for every age."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"This has always been one of my favourite books. All the characters are wonderful, the poems are hilarious and everything that happens is so entirely whimsical. They are so exactly like dreams too. All the events are thoroughly unusaul, but all the same seem perfectly natural to Alice the whole time; and many of the events are scary in the same was as they are in a dream. There is no explanation -- and no ecsape. It is no wonder that generations have followed Alice down the rabbit hole, or through the looking-glass, into this world filled with wonder!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"This book was great!! In the sense that you can see the trasitions inbetween Carroll's life changes around every corner... it is very cool the way hat Carroll will take tweedle dee and tweedle dum and have them doing mathematical wonders without realizing that he was doing that until you really think about it.. also I LOVED the cheshire cat, how he is so intriguing... like when Alice asks what trail to go down, and he says &quot;where do you want to go?&quot; Alice responds &quot;I don't care.&quot; &quot;Well then, it doesn't really matter which way you go then now does it?&quot; It's a lot like life.. ok.. thats my review... PEACE"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"I first read of Alice and her adventures when most of us did -- too long ago to mention. And I have re-read it at least once a year since.I'm not interested in why it was written or what deep, dark psychological quirks of the author underlie its imagery. It's enough that, from the time I fall down that curious rabbit hole, swim through the sea of tears, dance the lobster quadrille (Can you walk a little faster?), I seem to be retracing every step of my life. Every one of Alice's adventures has its echo in the real world, and they aren't hard to match.So, my much-worn copy sits comfortably on the shelf nearest to hand, and my grandchildren-to-be can expect to find a copy of their own in their very first Christmas stockings. And, hopefully, we, too, will one day &quot;talk of many things -- of ships, and shoes, and sealing wax; of cabbages and kings,&quot; just as I did with their parents when I first recited for them the dire warning &quot;Beware the jabberwok, my son!&quot;"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"Don't buy the Kindle edition hoping to see the wonderful illustrations described in the product information.

Well done. Illustrated. I would recommend this product to any fan of Alice in Wonderland!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"This is arguably the greatest of all childrens' books, and one of the classics of world- literature. There is madness here and method in the madness. There is a story, a heroine, and her meeting with zany characters and a zany world whose rules seem to change with each person she meets. There is wordplay, and there is logical laughter and conundrum. There is seemingly something for everyone.It is possible to be frightened to near death by the Queen of Hearts or to become broken and wise like Humpty Dumpty .\\" Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall/ Humpty Dumpty had a great fall/ All the kings' horses/ and all the Kings' men/ could not put Humpty Dumpty / together again.The weird wonderland Alice meets is filled with games and play. It is fantasy and fear, it is fun and fright. There is at one point no way out of it and yet there is miraculous transformation which takes you somewhere else completely.The logic of this world seems at time too sophisticated for children, and yet childlike . Paradox is contradiction with the pain taken out.There are so many memorable lines and situations here, so much to mean in each sentence , that the work is a wholesale factory for epigraphs and epigrams.As one who never followed the story very well I nonetheless could see that in this work poetry and logic meet and mix each other up for the general benefit and pleasure of the reader.This is a book to be read line by favorite line, character by favorite character, incident by favorite incident with amusement and pleasure."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"Do you want to get away from the hassles of reality, the stresses of everyday life? Then Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is the book for you. After reading it, I found that it can be entertaining for a reader of any age. Children can enjoy an outrageous character in the story, such as the Cheshire Cat. Kids like the sly, disappearing cat with the everlasting smile because he's unusual. Adults can also enjoy the story by examining the meaning of the seemingly shallow plot, a girl lost in a dreamworld, a wonderland. I myself enjoyed the book because it gave me a break from reality. It made me feel like all that I needed was to enter into a wonderland of my own. Is this &quot;wonderland&quot; really safe for kids though? Some people question whether this story is appropriate for children because of the unusual characters, but what is the real meaning? Is the Mad Hatter, with his neverending tea party and his bumbling speech, a portrayal of the mentally unstable? Is the Catapillar sitting on top of a magical mushroom, blowing smoke through a hookah, an emblem for drugs? Children would not see these things in the story, or would they? I think children could enjoy the story for its simplicity, not for hidden meanings. How can the story be taken further though? Adults should be asking questions about the book. For example, when first read, the plot seems simple, a young girl falls asleep and in her dream she tumbles down a rabbit hole into a backwards world where she grows to her liking, watches cats disappear into thin air, and gets crazy advice from a catapillar on a magic mushroom. One second Alice is reading with her sister and the next second sne is floating down a rabbit hole. Adults can examine twists like this and wonder what it means for the entire storyline. Does it foreshadow events to come? Older people would be more likely to think about the storyline and can have more fun trying to find hidden meanings. So this story is very appropriate for adults. The reason why I enjoyed the story was the break from reality. Obviously the story of Alice and her adventures is fantasy, but when I read it, it makes me feel like I can take a break from the world. This is because the characters and plot are so unreal, that they make me feel unreal, too. So this story, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, can be simple for children, complex for adults, and is a break from life for me. Overall, it is a very satisfying story. Are you willing to go tumbling down the rabbit hole?"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"Everyone has been rating this book as a children's book... It was written by an astute mathmatics doctorate Oxford professor. It is a fantastic book for adults to understand the mind of a child."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"Alice's adventures in wonderland and through the looking glass is a very good book for everyone of all ages. It was thrilling and adventreous. It felt like I was right there with Alice going through the adventure with her every step of the way. I would recomend this book to people of all ages not only because of it is adventures but because it had a wide varity of caracters that were funny and some that you can relate to. Some of the characters are, the white rabbit the queen of hearts, the white queen, and my favorite Alice. Alice is very curious and likes to explore wonderland. Alice's adventure in wonderland and through the looking glass is a wonderful book and is full of adventure and wondering."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"I feel that this was a really good book. Like most people, I'd seen various versions of the movie Alice in Wonderland and was curious about the books, particularly Through the Looking Glass, which is never mentioned anywhere. The movies are based on a combination of elements from both books, includnig quirky poems with imaginary words.There were a lot of concepts that aren't in any movies I've seen, such as the talking chess pieces. Instead of one queen, there are two queens and two kings, just as in chess. This isn't just a children's book. I feel it's interesting for all ages."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"A prophetic tome which foretold the gathering storm of the 20th century: moral relativism, social disintegration, lethal authoritarianism, the absurd.

Sam Vaknin, author of Malignant Self Love - Narcissism Revisited."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"A traditional child'book but it was a lot of fun and a change of pace to read as a grown-up. I just LOVED the characters that Alice encounters on her adventures and I also loved the story's word-play and witticism.Out of the two stories, Through the Looking Glass, although less famous, is the more linear and I think entertaining but both are amazingly creative and bizarre stories and are both short enough so that they should be read together."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"I really like Alice in Wonderland and its sequel because it is so whimsical. The way Dodgson made fun of Alice so much makes one laugh until tears come pouring down. He based the character Alice, on his friend; a real life Alice. Throughout the book, he constantly makes references to her, or something related to her. For example, when a character asks her the exact day Alice replies May 4th. May 4th is the real life Alice's birthday. Alice walks through Wonderland, and she sees many strange things, but thinks otherwise. If you like poems, you will certainly like Alice in Wonderland and its sequel, for both books contain numerous poems. However, in the book Carroll takes the original poems and creates a parody out of them. Something interesting to know is that all the poems relate to the chapters. These are all minor details, but something to muse over. On the surface, Alice in Wonderland is a book where she meets weird creatures and walks away from them always feeling humiliated, as she thinks she is smarter than she really is. That is most of Alice in Wonderland.Alice through the Looking Glass is similar to the prequel, yet glaringly different. The whole book revolves around a chess game, and so the character's actions correspond to moves on the chessboard. Alice joins in the game, starts out as a white pawn, and proceeds to move until she becomes a queen. At each square, she meets a new character, but in one chapter, characters from the previous book are in this one too. An important thing to know in this famous classic is that everything is backwards. It makes sense since Alice is on the other side of a mirror, yet she encounters difficulty sometimes in understanding this. But in the end, she manages to become a queen and to checkmate the red king. Both books are very enjoyable, and I strongly advocate both children and adults to read it. Enjoy!! Cheers!!!!! : )"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"If you were the kind of child who always asked the &quot;why?&quot; question, and who liked to challenge what everyone else regarded as normal, you'll love this book. In &quot;Wonderland&quot;, Lewis Carroll questions everything about life that is normal, and gives us a picture of a world where everything that we accept as normal is turned upside down. With Alice, you'll fall into a rabbit hole and enter an imaginary and wacky world where nothing is at it seems. Here's a small taste:&quot;By-the-bye, what became of the baby?&quot; said the Cat. &quot;I'd nearly forgotten to ask.&quot; &quot;It turned into a pig,' Alice answered very quietly, just as if the Cat had come back in a natural way. &quot;I thought it would,&quot; said the Cat, and vanished again.&quot;they drew all manner of things - everything that begins with an M - &quot; &quot;Why with an M?&quot; said Alice. &quot;Why not?&quot; said the March Hare.If you find this kind of surreal world even remotely attractive, then you're sure to love Alice's &quot;Wonderland&quot;. You'll be amazed by the cat-less grin of the Cheshire-Cat, amused by the absurd logic of the mad Hatter, and in hysterics over the antics of the murderous Queen of Hearts with her constant refrain of &quot;Off with his head.&quot; &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; is full to the brim with wild humour, farcical fantasy, witty wisecracks, and slapstick comedy. What I especially enjoyed were the abundance of delightful puns, paradoxes, and parodies. Much of the deeper significance will escape young children, but they will enjoy it as a fantastic story, and rediscover it with even greater pleasure as adults. A &quot;classic&quot; is a book that appeals to people of all times and ages, and that's certainly the case with &quot;Alice in Wonderland.&quot;Is &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; all nonsense? I don't think so. Behind the outer layer of nonsense Carroll conveys a great deal of sense. He allows you to return to reality with a renewed appreciation for everything that is normal and accepted. Yet this fantasy world is at the same time so nonsensical and enjoyable, that you'll want to return there many a time. Don't be satisfied with a movie edition or simplified version of Alice - nothing is as enjoyable as the original! Truly a classic for the child in all of us!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"I would argue that this text offers more than WONDERLAND.

To begin with, I hated the illustrations. They were ugly and gave me the creeps. Although my language was English it was very different from the English that Carroll wrote. I didn't understand half the words. I didn't know what a hedgehog or a dormouse was. Nor was I familiar with mock turtle soup. But its major crime was that it was static. Nothing really happened. She just met a lot of unpleasant individuals and finally woke up. Fast forward sixty years and I have just read it for a class and found it quite enjoyable! First of all, I love the Tenniel illustrations. Yes, they are ugly, but that's what makes them unforgettable. Carroll is not Disney. His little animals are not cuddly and don't whistle happy tunes and are rarely, if ever, helpful. Tenniel makes that clear. Second, I had no idea as a child that it was funny. I did not get any of the jokes or understand any of the riddles. This time I laughed out loud several times. The poems that I could not abide as a child I now find fascinating and rather beautiful, especially the White Knight's verse. Alice STILL has no plot, however, which is why it's not very compelling reading. However, both these books are mercifully brief.Whether one actually likes these books or not, they are important to English literature and are referred to and referenced constantly in other works. So ALICE is essential reading if one wants to be considered an educated English speaker. It's open to many interpretations and many people find it a profound work.

Suffice it to say that Alice's journey into Wonderland is still rather wonderful.Alice still comes off as a bratty know-it-all, but I thought that when I was younger, so it did not change my feelings towards the book. The humor is well thought out, reading through it as an adult, I caught many more of the clever puns than I did before, so that made for some refreshing new discoveries.I would reccommend this book to anyone who hasn't read it or at least hasn't read it since their childhood. It is a quick, enjoyable read that takes ones mind into a magical land of wonder.Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found ThereThrough the Looking Glass continues Alice's adventures. This time, as Alice is playing with Dyna's new kittens, she takes to wondering what is beyond the room that she sees on the other side of the looking glass. Before she knows it, Alice has pushed her way through the looking glass and is in the backwards world on the other side!The faniciful creatures that Alice runs into here are as colorful, and in some cases even more so, as the characters from Wonderland. There's the talking flower garden, a run-in with the Tweedles, a host of chess pieces of varying ranks, a unicorn, a lion and many, many more. Along with the Tweedles, my personal favorite is a white knight who can barely stay mounted upon his steed.The magic and wonder from the first of Alice's adventures is still very present and, although the book sometimes gets confusing because things come and go so rapidly, I believe that I actually found it to be more enjoyable than the first. I highly reccommend it to children of ALL ages. If you feel like some simple fun and joy, settle back in a comfy chair with a nice cup of cocoa and let your mind journey Through the Looking Glass with Alice and discover all of the wonders that she finds there."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"Alice in Wonderland is one of those books you can still enjoy as an adult even though it was written for children. The story is completely nonsensical and at times humorous. In fact I think some of the jokes can only be understood as an adult so it is worth reading again.I have a yellowed copy of Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass, which was given to me on my seventh birthday. It has the original artwork on the cover. My grandmother gave me a copy along with a harmonica. The harmonica was lost long ago, the book remains and has always had a place in my heart. I was too young to read the entire book, so my father started reading this book to me. Perhaps still having this book has given me a connection to the past.I laugh when I reminisce about my father singing \\"Beautiful Soup,\\" most beautifully I must add. He also recited \\"Jabberwocky\\" and I can still hear his voice as I read the tale of the Walrus:\\"The time has come,' the Walrus said,\\"To talk of many things:Of shoes - and ships - and sealing wax -of cabbages - and kings -and why the sea is boiling hotand whether pigs have wings.\\"Alice spends a great deal of time either shrinking or growing taller, depending on what she eats in Wonderland. There are talking chess pieces and flowers. Everything in the looking glass world is backwards so it is fun to think about how life would be on the other side of a mirror.The Mad Tea Party is also very memorable. There is all kinds of nonsense conversation children will love to try to figure out, and as adults still might be trying to figure out! They will love the riddles and beautiful illustrations. The mouse, the chess pieces and the Cheshire cat talk most intelligently about various concerns in Wonderland. Just as everything in a child's world is sometimes alive to them, so Alice's world is filled with things that are alive and most interesting to children.Alice never seems to run out of adventures. The Looking Glass House is amusing to me as it has a cute black kitten who is quite mischievous. I quote:\\"Oh, you wicked, wicked little thing!\\" cried Alice catching up the kitten and giving it a little kiss to make it understand that it was in disgrace. \\"Really, Dinah ought to have taught you better manners! ...Kitty sat very demurely on her knee, pretending to watch the progress of the winding, and now and then putting out one paw and gently touching the ball, as if it would be glad to help if it might.John Tenniel's illustrations make the book and together he and Lewis Carroll created a magical world for children to explore.~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"Those who pick up ALICE IN WONDERLAND seeking to read a book mirroring the Disney movie version will be sorely disappointed. Those who wish to read a delightful children's story that will enchant and entertain readers young and old need look no further.ALICE IN WONDERLAND and THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS have very little in the way of plot - little Alice is thrown into a strange world where nothing seems quite right. She changes in size, is confronted by the imperious Queen of Hearts, has tea with a number of quirky characters; each new situation she encounters is \\"curiouser and curiouser\\" than the next. What the stories lack in plot, they make up for twentyfold in character. Carroll created a whimsical world for his young readers, and its charm spills over to entertain even the old.

Recently, I stumbled upon the book and started skimming it and I was completely blown away!!! There are so many brilliant layers of wit and humor between the lines which I never noticed as a kid. There are twists and turns and endless puns and word games with every turn of the page. This is as much a novel for adults as it is for kids, maybe even more so!

When I first read this novel, I wanted to go through the same thing Alice went through in the story. Following a rabbit, going down a rabbit hole, drinking a potion that makes you either larger or smaller, meeting such wonderful and strange creatures just seems as such an amazing and unforgettable experience.This book is a must read novel for everyone, and it shall continue to be a timeless classic."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"My first exposure to this classic children's story was when I watched the 1951 Disney version, \\"Alice in Wonderland.\\" I remember as a kid, loving it, but actually feeling a bit scared by it. As a kid, I was actually pretty terrified of the idea of falling through a rabbit hole, and getting lost all by myself, in a strange land. Add in the scary character of the Queen of Hearts, and I swore to myself, never to wander off around alone, as a strange rabbit might appear and force me to follow him! I had a pretty wild imagination when I was a child. It's bad, because this often is the cause of my nightmares.I decided to lay off the whole \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" scene, and promised never to read the book. I didn't break this promise for years! Until now. In fact, I have only read Lewis Carroll's until just about a month ago. I know, it's a bit disappointing in my part that I have never read this, but what can I say.. a promise is a promise, right?Review: First of all, I have to say, this is still one of those stories that have the most unforgettable characters ever made. Lewis Carroll created such whimsical characters such as the White Rabbit, the Mad Hatter, the Cheshire Cat, the Caterpillar, the Queen of Hearts, the talking flowers, Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum, and so many more. It's kind of amazing to say the least that all these unique characters all come from one story!The best part though, in my opinion, coming from an adult reader, is the symbolism of this story. Almost all the characters play a part of something in real life -- a metaphor, in a way. The wordplay as well, are witty and clever. Both are done in an extremely subtle way, that most would overlook them. That is probably one of the reasons why this is a classic, and has been around for so long. I feel as though children, as this book was intended for, would see this as a fun book with fun characters. Adults, on the other hand, while they will still appreciate it for the same reasons, would also love this as it will challenge them, and teach them subtle messages, while bringing them back to their childhood all at once.I highly recommend this novel to any reader, no matter how old or young they are. Do not miss it, as this is a timeless piece of literature that everyone should definitely read at least once."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"The book I received was in great condition and arrived in a timely fashion.

Lewis Carroll creates a wonderful fantasy world for young children but the appeal was not there for me. The separate worlds of both stories are chaotic but they pave a way of mystery and suspense. The characters Carroll creates are great and each one is different from the next and you are never sure what or whom Alice will meet next. The downfall for me in these two stories was that neither one had a well thought out plot. For I could tell Alice was wondering to two different worlds not knowing where she was going or why she was there. Some people may find this type of writing great but I find it almost pointless. There is a good twist to the ending of Through the Looking Glass that leaves the reader somewhat puzzled. Although this book had little point to me, I could read it without getting bored, for something strange or absurd happened every other page. Overall this book could use a better plot, but it keeps the reader interested with great characters and odd twists."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"i think this book is very good for girls in my age..because sometimes i also would like to flie out of this stressy world and alice is able to.."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"Puchased for my teenage daughter who loves the classics.Book as described - good seller"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"Alice's AdventureMy first impressions of this book were that it was like reading C.S.

Well if you haven't, &quot;Don't&quot;. Overall it wasn't that bad of a book, but it was extremely confusing. In my opinion this book could have been written a lot better. For example, it could have been alot less confusing and more realistic. The main reason I didn't exactly enjoy Alice in Wonderland was because it needed to be more happy,then unhappy. Here are some more reasons why you should not read this boring book. Alice in Wonderland could have been written a lot better. The author's language usage was a bit hard to comprehend,like when the caterpillar was talking to Alice about a crocodile and when the cat was giving Alice directions. Also, the scenes were short and they jumped right into each other too quickly. Most of the animals were rude and mean to Alice. The flowers shooed her away, the queen tried to cut off her head and the cat was always making her angry by lying. Another part that didn't make any sense was the tea party,there's no such thing aa a &quot;Very Merry Unbirthday&quot;. Also the Mad Hatter and the Hare wouldn't listen to Alice when she was trying to tell her story. All the creatures and animals kept Alice from what she was trying to do which was to follow the white rabbit. Alice met many,many creatures such as Tweedle Dee,Tweedle Dum,Do Do,Bill, Rabbit,Cat,Queen of Hearts,Caterpillar,Playing cards,Mad Hatter,Hare,Flowers,Pig and the Door Knob. This book made me just as frustrated and upset as it made Alice.I felt like I was in the book and I could feel all the confusion and nonsense going on. If I had to give my overall opinion of how good the book was I would give it 2 stars.So, in conclusion I would like to let everyone know that Alice in Wonderland was not worth reading, so don't waste your time! Go get yourself an interesting book to read!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was an extremely ridiculous and confusing book. The characters were mis leading and Alice was very annoying (from the little details I read throughout the book). This book would be a good for fantasy lovers, but to me it was unrealistic and childish. Some of the things the characters said and did in the story were confusing and somewhat complicated. I don't know if I would recommend this book to younger children because of its wording, but it was a child-like book and would attract young readers in a way. The writer writes in a unusual, seemingly &quot;old fashioned&quot; way. You could tell the book wasn't written recently by the language usage. Alice is a young girl who is very bright and adventurous. On her way down to Wonderland, she meets alot of new characters. Some are decieving like the treaser cat but all of the very intresting and USUAL, such as the Mad Hater, The Queen of Hearts, etc. The way the author worded things in the book, made me get confused and unintrested. I had no desire in reading it after the first few pages. I thought the book was far fetched, and seriously i wouldn't recommend this book to teens or children."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"The first thing that must be said for anyone who's seen Disney's Alice in Wonderland and wants to read the book because they loved it so much is beware. The book and the movie, while following the same story line, are nothing alike, and if you expect them to be you'll most likely end up as disappointed as I was.Perhaps it's because I grew up with the fluidly poetic Dr Zeus, or perhaps I just expected something that the book simply was not, but I found Carroll's tale bland and void of the essential, natural art to story-telling that all \\"absurd\\" imaginative pieces need to be enjoyable.Though I must give credit to Carroll for what I feel he deserves- in his time, this was a wildly fantastic book with a plethora of crazy characters, riddles, poetry and inspired plot twists that carry the reader around Wonderland with the famous protagonist.The Characters however, were truly brought to life by Disney to a degree unrealizable within the written format. I don't fault Carroll for this, but when you've seen the movie first...I also found the transitions between scenery and scenes to be lacking in impact because there is little distinction made between one place and the next. I realize that Carroll was describing a dream (which is vague by nature), but I feel that his writing could have accentuated the transitions to give the reader more involvement in the fading between one land and the next- what we have instead is something close to \\"Alice was walking in a forest and now she's crossing a river.\\" Call me picky, but such a lackluster transition is bound to bore.Most agitating were Penguin Classic's annotations that literally littered the text with information completely irrelevant to the story. Boasting on the back that my copy is \\"the most comprehensively annotated edition available\\", they weren't lying. To get this title though, they stuck an annotation into every nook and cranny manageable. By the end of the fifth chapter I almost threw the book out of the bus window because I had read more about Lewis Carroll's diary entries and queer habit of wearing gloves everywhere than of Alice herself. At that point I more or less stopped regarding the annotations at all- content instead to deny their existence rather than try my patience at reading them. I was upset at this because there were several places where an explanation, allusion or elaboration was truly helpful, but they were one in stack of fifty and the remaining forty-nine were just too painfully superfluous to sift throughThrough The Looking Glass also failed to leave an impression on me. It was a very simple extension of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, but in the same exact format, with the same trite transitions and utterly lackluster performances.I thought it was a painful struggle to finish Through The Looking Glass, and then found myself face to face with Carroll's original short story Alice's Adventures Underground- the original short story that he had written for the young daughter of a close friend which his friends had urged him to elaborate upon. Following that, I found an essay written by Carroll, Alice On Stage, about his thoughts on the cinematic production of his tale. I'm sorry; I just couldn't bring myself to bother. That was enough of Lewis Carroll for me.As I implied at the start, stick to Disney's movie. I love to read, but Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a story meant to be seen and heard, not read about."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"I truly feel sorry for any child forced to read this book in school. Reading it as an adult was no better. It was possibly the most warped and perverse story I have ever read in my life. Most passages were pure nonsense while others lead the reader to wonder if Lewis Carroll had possibly tasted some of the mushrooms Alice came upon in her adventure. There are many other \\"classics\\" out there more enjoyable and logical than this one."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"This is my fifth tarot deck and I have to say that I just love it. It's quite clever to design a deck based on the classic &quot;Alice in Wonderland.&quot; Would have rated this deck higher except that it does NOT comes with an instruction book, but rather a quick-and-to-the-point pamphlet that truly simplifies the meanings of the cards. If, however, you are versed in the traditional Ryder-Waite deck then you should have no trouble skipping the pamphlet and using your own intuition. The suits have been reconfigured into flamingoes, oysters, hats, and peppermills, which can be quite confusing. Due to the whimsical nature of the card, you might want to use it for more whimsical readings. But, like I said, if you ARE a fan of tarot decks with unusual design you should DEFINITELY get this deck and use it for those &quot;special&quot; occasions."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"Alice in Wonderland is very creative, it has talking rabbits and every animal is talking and talking objects to like flowers and checkerboard pieces. Alice thinks this a dream but it is actually happening. She sees a talking white rabbit and follows it because it looked like it was in a hurry, was wearing clothes and was holding a watch. The white rabbit falls in a whole which takes them into wonderland where everything is alive and talking. Alice is amazed of what she sees and is still following the white rabbit. The white rabbit takes her in an adventure and she meets strange things and at the end realizes she misses her home.What I liked about the book was that I watched the movie and the book and they are very similar to each other. What really interested me the most is that how Lewis Carroll came up with all of this. I liked how everything talks and that wonderland is very colorful and living. I also liked how much detail it gave to really make you imagine how it looked it kind of made me feel like if I was really there. There was really nothing that I did not like about it.Through the looking glass is book two that explains how Alice goes into another universe by walking into a mirror and is her second time in wonderland but she thinks it's all a dream. But in Through the Looking-Glass she fins out that this is real and that she is not dreaming. In this part of the book she is playing a game of chess and is trying to get to the eighth square. Through the Looking-Glass was my favorite part of the book because it has so many details. I also like that they included little children's stories like Humpty Dumpty. What I did not like was that when Alice was talking to the White and Red Queen about adding and subtracting. I really got lost in that chapter."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"All in all the recording was good and entertaining, but, the end of both stories were cut off and this was very disapointing. A great product until the end."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"Alice's adventures in Wonderland, the classic, thrilling fiction book, by Lewis Carroll, is a story that has intrigued and captivated readers for more than a hundred years. In this book, Carroll writes about a seven year old English girl named, Alice, Who has stumbled into this insane and curious world. In her confusion to find reasonable explanations for this precarious adventure, Alice comes across quite a few unusual characters, including a White Rabbit, whom Alive had followed down the rabbit hole in her curiosity and a shy mouse whom she almost drowned with her tears. As Alice struggles with her internal conflicts of who she is and what has become of her, she came across a blue caterpillar sitting atop a mushroom, languidly puffing on a hookah and after an infuriatingly absurd conversation, Alice continued her journey onward. At last, Alice parades strait into the presence of the demanding Red King and Queen, and finds herself in very unique situations.In, Alice's adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass, I occasionally found it hard to follow the sequence of events in which the story is laid out on account of my confusion at weather Alice was speaking dialogue or internal monologue. Although, Lewis Carroll includes in his stories, fictional characters from children books, which gives it a sense of adolescence; he also includes an Extensive, complex and chaotic game of chess, giving the book a more sophisticated feel. In Lewis Carroll's stories, I admire his creativity and originality with using fictional characters, but dislike the stories' structure and format. Considering everything, I would recommend this book to anybody because it meets the expectations of a classic, a fantasy fiction, and a children's novel."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"Charles Dodgson and the British Imperial ImaginationLewis Carroll (real name Charles Dodgson) was a clergyman and mathematician. His delightful Alice In Wonderland is a feat of mythic imagination and fantasy that conjures an absurd vision of an alternate possible world, while also providing a biting satire of British culture, in the tradition of Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift.Alice's tumble down the rabbit hole is the trigger for an imaginative flight of fancy about the structure of the world. Alice fears that she may fall through the middle of the planet to Australia, where people walk on their heads. This spatial referencing for Wonderland is important as a link to the colonial and imperial imagination of Victorian England. The pace of change and development of empire is such that traditional verities are thrown into radical doubt, and the possibility can be entertained of a journey through the looking glass to a land of wonder down under (like the journey from Kansas to Oz).Each of the characters in Alice in Wonderland can be assessed as social satire. Old Father William references the imaginary Australian spatial framework by standing on his head to guarantee his health. The impotent bullying by the Queen, the languid dream of the caterpillar, the madness of the hatter and hare, the card soldiers, and Alice as a quizzical rational person who takes all at face value, each is amusing because it touches a cultural nerve.The British Empire in its age of confidence almost thought that all things might be possible through science and industry and military might. Dodgson takes this cultural pride to an absurd logical conclusion, where chemical potions can rapidly change the size of objects and where the treasures of nature, such as flamingos and hedgehogs, are instruments for pleasure in an absurd game of croquet, like indulgent ancient Romans collecting rarities from the far corners of the earth.Humpty Dumpty is perhaps the most imperial satirical fool of all. His assertion that words mean what he wants them to mean is rather like the colonial settler, seeking to construct a new world in ignorance and defiance of established reality. Dodgson uses this parable as the occasion for wry logical observations about the absurdity of popular psychology.The popularity of Alice in Wonderland reflects the power of the vivid imaginative fantasy world of whimsy that Dodgson created, as an alternate myth to the orthodox imperial pride in British accomplishment. There is a self-deprecation, deflating the imperial orthodoxy with its surface blindness to the stupidity and confusion of Britain's growth. Looking back to Swift, and forward to the Goons and Monty Python, Dodgson voices a British self-doubt which was actually rather prophetic, in that the house of cards of empire eventually proved highly vulnerable."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"This is a fun read you can see where they get the ideas for all the movies from.

The way Lewis Carrol wrote it has to do a lot about politics and the way of reality. Alice always thinks what's the point of a book that shows nothing interesting whatsoever? Well later on she discovers that there are a few reasons why s some things are not nonsense. These are some of the nonesense things; Drinks make you shrink, cakes make you grow, cats can dissapear, and flowers can sing. Some of the things Alice does can be thought as lessons, the sentence \\"Curiosity killed that cat\\" is used in other ways in the story, starting with chasing a rabbit down a tunnle. This is a fascinating story that I would recommend to anyone, even people that don't like to read; I'm one of those people. This is a well written story that anyone can read. 5 STARS!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"Cohen's introduction provided interesting insight into the life of Charles Dodgeson and the history that surrounds the creation of these 2 books. I love that all the original artwork is contained in this affordable little paperback as well. A must-have for every personal library."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"I think this book is very imaginative and fun to read. In the first part where she's in Wonderland she goes through a world of nonsense and is trying to find a way out. In Through the Looking Glass she goes through a mirror into a backwards world. I would encourage anyone to read this book because it encourages people to use their imagination and to learn that stuff happens you just have to find the correct way to deal with it.My favorite character was the Duchess in the first part because she was very annoying and didn't even know it also she has a very comical cook who's obsessed with pepper.

It is not Alice in Wonderland & Through the Looking glass but Alice in Wonderland ONLY. Very irritating.There is really nothing positive to say about this edition, the formatting is about par for a cheap kindle book. It's manageable but disappointing. If I were reviewing \\"Alice in wonderland\\" then I may have given it a 3-star review but as it is was inappropriately titled the entire experience is a disappointment.I wish there was some way to preview Kindle editions (screenshots etc) before purchasing them.

A little girl falls asleep on a hot summer's day and dreams all the rest. I read this when I was a child and still love it. Relating it to drugs, etc., is absolutely absurd! Just goes to show how far our culture has deteriorated (no child likeAlice's Adventures In Wonderland and Through the Looking Glassimagination). The book should be understood \\"as is\\" nothing more, nothing less. It's a wonderfully funny fantasy I love it!! and so does my granddaughter."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"This book is a classic that every person should read. What's interesting about this book is that there are several smaller stories strewn throughout. The Mock Turle's Story and The Walrus and The Carpenter are two examples. But, behind this book, there are also elements from Carroll's personal life. It has recently become known about this man that he did indeed dabble with opium from time to time, and that he did fancy the company of young girls, which all conveniently fit into this masterpiece of his. I'm not attacking Lewis Carroll's credibility as an author, I'm merely pointing out how an author's personal life can have a strong influence on his/her work. These factors have not hindered Carroll's work, but in a striking way have perhaps helped to make his work that much more realistic. He incorporated elements of which he was very familiar, and it made this book all the better. On a different subject, the illustrations by Tenniel are simply astounding! His use of light and shadow seem to make these characters come to life! I strongly recommend getting this version of Carroll's classic story."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass hold a special place in my heart. After my father died almost ten years ago, I purchased a copy for my mother. I suggested she read it and see that Alice, no matter what she went through, how bizarre and disturbing, always found a way to come out on top. She cried then, but for the first time since his death, she cried tears of joy. It was a special moment in my life, and I have Carroll to thank for that.It's a story that should be read to or by everyone at some point. With the film adaptations that are coming out recently, it's sad to think that most people who see them have only seen other film or cartoon adaptations. Always go back to the source. This version is wonderful for the young or the old, as it's LARGE PRINT. I really can't say enough good things about this book. (On an interesting side note, there's a camp of thought about it actually being written by Queen Victoria...)"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"It appears that many of the reviewers of this particular edition of the book are not actually reviewing the product. Being that as it is, I will attempt to do this work justice. Lewis Carroll wrote this book for young adults, though it is familiar to young children because of the Disney movie. In actuality, the book may be too scary or difficult to understand for small children.This particular edition contains Alice's \\"Adventures in Wonderland\\" and its sequel \\"Through the Looking Glass\\". These stranges worlds reveal a somewhat spoiled young girl in her explorations of a strange world. Yet Alice might not appear so strange if the characters of these worlds were not so strange. Wonderland being the better of the two stories shows slightly more direction. But like any dream, the story often digresses into the bizarre. As Alice meets each new character, many having no apparent relation to the previous, readers can be frustrated by the lack of cohesiveness. Nothing really ties either story together aside from the return to reality in both stories.Carroll referred to this as a \\"book of nonsense\\". By his own admission, he seems to imply that there is nothing profound about this book. It is merely the musings of a sleeping child. Taking this perpective, readers will enjoy the book."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"This Book Brings out the best of both words.

Also, because they are junior editions they don't have introductions, give author backgrounds, etc. - although I don't believe any of the IJL editions are abridged except for The Three Musketeers."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"Another favourite book from childhood is Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (or Alice in Wonderland as it's sometimes called) by Lewis Carroll.The novel was written in 1865 and tells the story of Alice, a young girl who falls down a rabbit hole and into a fantasy world called Wonderland. Once there she comes across a myriad of different characters, all of them anthropomorphic creatures.The tale plays with logic and for this reason has been considered an adult book just as much as a child's book. It's considered to be one of the best examples of the literary nonsense genre (literature that uses sensical and nonsensical elements to defy language conventions or logical reasoning). Pink Floyd (one of my favourite bands) also famously uses literary nonsense in their song lyrics. The effect of nonsense is often caused by an excess of meaning, rather than a lack of it. Words are left for interpretation and there are usually little messages and meanings hidden and buried within cryptic sentences and paragraphs.For these reasons, the novel has been enormously influential in the creation of the fantasy genre which is known for its use of literary nonsense in the narrative course and structure of those books.The novel is broken up into 12 chapters and each focuses on a different adventure that Alice stumbles upon. Among them is the actual falling down into the rabbit hole and coming across various objects such as a bottle with the words \`drink me' written on it.Alice goes through many body transformations - she shrinks, she grows tall, and she shrinks again. She meets a white rabbit (the one she was chasing to end up in the hole), a lizard, a caterpillar and a frog (all with reminiscent human traits). She also meets a grinning Cheshire Cat before becoming a guest at a mad tea party where she becomes insulted by the Hatter who keeps throwing rhymes and riddles at her that she can't interpret or understand. This causes her to leave in a huff exclaiming that it's the stupidest tea party she had ever been to.After leaving the tea party she comes across a garden where she finds three living playing cards painting the white roses on a rose tree red because the Queen of Hearts hates white roses. Alice meets the King and Queen (with the Queen screeching \\"Off with your head!\\") to Alice's amusement and is ordered to play a game of croquet with them. The game quickly descends into chaos and Alice meets the Cheshire Cat once again. The Queen wants the cat beheaded but because his whole body basically is his head, this proves impossible.The cat's owner is a duchess and at Alice's request she is brought to the garden party. After this, Alice attends a trial whereby the Knave of Hearts is accused of stealing the Queen's tarts. The jury is composed of various animals and throughout the proceedings Alice starts to grow larger. The Queen orders that she must leave and Alice starts to dispute with her causing a commotion which has all the cards tumbling in and around her face.The novel ends with Alice's sister waking her up on the riverbank for tea and brushing leaves from her face (instead of cards). Alice jumps up and wanders off leaving her sister sitting there to imagine all the things that had happened.The novel is famous for its many character allusions. Alice is based on a real girl called Alice Liddell whom Lewis met during a summer when he was rowing in a boat with his friend and his three young daughters. He told them a story that featured a girl called Alice who goes looking for an adventure. The members of the boating party show up in Chapter 3 where the Dormouse tells a story about three little sisters named Elsie, Lacie and Tillie. These are meant to be the Liddell sisters and it's interesting to note that Lacie is actually an anagram of Alice...The relationship between Alice Liddell and Lewis Carroll has caused much sinister controversy over the years. Many biographers have thought that perhaps Lewis was romantically or sexually attracted to the young girl. There has never been any direct proof though and many have also just put it down to a mere fondness for the child. So fond were Carroll's affections for the girl that he even gave Alice the original handwritten manuscript of the story with the inscription \\"A Christmas gift to a dear child in memory of a summer's day\\".Some say he may have even bordered on obsession with her, particularly with his excessive references to her in his later story Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There where there were several direct links between the two girls. There is also an acrostic poem at the end of the novel which spells out Liddell's full name when reading downwards. Although a little strange, it is hard to judge what Carroll's thinking was at the time and without reading between the lines, it truly is a beautiful poem. I'll record it in a separate post after I complete this one.As well as a paradox take on words, Carroll was also a genius with numbers and many mathematical references and concepts were portrayed within the story. In various chapters Alice uses multiplication and subtraction to try to analyse her situations and make sense of her surroundings. It is suggested that in logic and mathematics there is an inverse relationship, and this is something for which Carroll had an in depth knowledge of.Reading Alice's Adventures in Wonderland for what it is makes for great reading. But it's only when you start delving deeper and recognising the hidden clues and mysteries that the story contains that the meaning of the novel will take on a whole new form and lead you to explore the story's deeper context.Read more of my book reviews at Storybook Love Affair - [...]"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"I am extremely disappointed in online version of this book.

Rereading it made me more aware of the intoxicating dreamlike quality of the story line as well as the incredibly tongue-in-cheek writing style. BUT... I was very disappointed to open it and find it contained NO illustrations whatsoever! Reading A.I.W. without the John Tenniel drawings is like eating plain dry bread.

I'm going to order a different one right now."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"In my english class we had to pick a foreign author and a book to read. I choose this book because I'd never read it before, I've seen the Disney version of this story but never got around to reading the actual book. I've since finished the book and found that I really enjoyed reading it. I find that the book makes way more sense than the movie, considering that alice's adventures and wonderland itself don't walk in a straight line, but that's what imagination is all about, there is no set direction. I believe Carroll described the childs imagination perfectly.Although I will admit I was alittle lost and confused sometimes. I also enjoyed the poems throughout the story and when characters speak in riddles and ryhmes.

I paid full price at a retail store and I felt it was a fair price because it is the whole collection. The book is a great cloth bound hardcover.

Especially if I have only read them once. However, it was a great buy."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"This was an amazing book! The author's colorful ideas and characters give the reader a sense of wonder as he takes the reader through the many wild adventures of Alice. Lewis Carrol writes in great detail as he describes how Alice jumped down the rabbit hole, struggled with her ever changing size, took care of a baby that turned into a pig, had tea with a mad hatter, and played croquet with a queen. It was easy to relate to Alice and her curiosity and imagination. She longed for an adventure, and that longing is inside of all of us somewhere. It's nice to read a story about someone who actually dares to take the steps into potential danger that we all turn away from daily for fear of the unknown. I am a victim of this fear, but this book made me want to take hold of that childish curiosity and jump into some crazy adventure. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"\\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" is one of the most beloved children's classics. It has been adapted into numerous cartoons, films and plays over the years, and it has become an important backdrop of the World culture. It is a brilliant and zany fairy tale that remains fresh and engaging well over a century after it had been written. This is in large part thanks to the unforgettable and unique characters that are as famous (if not more) as Alice herself: the White Rabbit, the Cheshire Cat, the \\"Mad\\" Hatter, the Queen of Hearts and many more. They are among the most idiosyncratic characters in all of literature. However, the aspects of the book that I found the most fascinating were the clever use of language, the numerous puns, and the plays on the difference between the literal and actual meanings of different expressions and saying. It was very amusing to read these, and realize how clever and verbal this book actually is. The book made me reflect again on so many aspects of the world that I take for granted, and it made me feel like a child exploring and learning about various objects, ideas and relations for the first time. This alone makes this book worth reading and rereading, and I expect to come to it many times again."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"Obviously Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass are 2 literary classics, so I'm not reviewing those...But this particular book has put EVERYTHING having to do with Alice and her adventures under 1 cover.

The characters are mostly animals with different personalities and can talk, so the characters were okay, but to me they could have been improved on. By this I mean they could have come to life more. Some animals were the white rabbit and the cat like in the disney movie. The overall theme of the book is for Alice(the main character)to get out of Wonderland. On her way home, she meets very strange characters and gets into trouble. One event I found interesting is when she meets the Mad Hatter and the March Hare. Their first encounter was interesting but it was when they met again that I thought was good. Another event is near the end with the Queen of Hearts. To find out what actually occurred pick up the book and read it. Alice is a young girl who wishes there were more things in life and one day when she was out side with her sister she spots this white rabbit with a coat on and a pocket watch. She starts to follow it. She followed it through a rabbit hole and as she hit a soft spot on the ground Alice falls into a hole.

If it's true that you can't go home again, it's even more true that some books will never let you back in. This is one of them.I'm not sure if the fantastic lives of fantasy and fiction that play out daily as hard news have diluted our ability to plunge unrestrained into a book like Alice in Wonderland, or if the book refuses to give up its virtues a second time for a plainer reason: despite its monolithic stature in the pantheon of classics, it was originally written, and still remains, a children's story. Pick it up and expect something more, and you may be disappointed.The prose still snaps and crackles like a bowl of fresh cereal, and the imaginary images still effortlessly dance across your mind's eye, but something's missing, whether in the book or the reader you'll have to judge for yourself.

Lewis Carroll has an unique writing style; it is unlike anything that I have read before. His use of words give a sharp image in the reader's head, just like as if they were actually there. He uses excellent imagery. His descriptions on every single character were great,and that was one thing that I enjoyed. An example of his descriptions is in the beginning of chapter six, when Alice sees a footman in front of a house. Carroll describes the footman &quot;with a found face, and large eyes like a frog&quot;. He is one of the few authors that take the time to describe the supplementary characters. The main character is , of course, Alice. She is very adventurous, and this is seen throughout the book. Anything that she sees that is new, she will try it. In the very beginning of her adventures, she sees a potion that is laying around, and in hopes of getting into the garden that she saw earlier, she drank some of it, just because it said &quot;drink me&quot;. The potion made her very small, which eventually became an adventure within itself. Another example was when she went to play croquet with the queen. They played croquet with hedgehogs as balls and flamingoes as sticks. Alice didn't care what the adventure was, as long as she was a part of it.She also didn't hesitate to express her opinions. When the queen was executing everyone in her path, Alice spoke up about what she was doing. People who like adventurous characters would like Alice. The theme of this book to me is if you see something new, you should try it just for the fun of doing something new. It is shown by Alice's different adventures, like what I mentioned in the previous paragraphs. I didn't really get the plot of this story. I thought that it was to get to the garden that she saw in the beginning of the book. I think that I didn't get it because Carroll jumped from one adventure without finishing the previous one. That is one of the reasons why I gave this book three stars out of five. I didn't like this story, partially because it was fantasy. I just read it to try something different. I would recommend this book to readers who like reading fantasy and who like to use their imaginations while reading. I don't know why it is a big children's classic, but I didn't like when I was in elementary school and I still don't like it in high school. This book will most likely never become one of my favorite classics.

Yet, in truth, plenty of adults have never plowed through the brilliant but dated prose contained within the pages of Alice In Wonderland. And most of those never will because it is perceived as a children's tale and a book that they needn't bother with since they already know the basic story. This is a mistake.Alice In Wonderland is a unique and clever book. The fact that interest in it has survived so long is testament to its quality. The bizarre characters, which visually and playfully appeal to children, converse in clever riddles and political subtext that go over their heads and talk directly to more intellectual adults. This is a ground-breaking work, so completely off-the-wall that it's hard to imagine it having been published so many decades ago.Through The Looking Glass is Carroll's return to Wonderland, a special treat for readers disappointed by Alice In Wonderland's premature ending. The fun and mystery continue and improve in this second volume with the classic and irony-filled chess game.Chess-playing cards, hookah-smoking mushroom dwellers, shape-changing elixirs, and disappearing cats. This is an adult fable. Carroll invites us into his dream, and we share his fantastic experience through the clarity of a writer's genius. Don't skip these books. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"It was fun to read this book because so much of what is in here is now in our popular culture today. The movie &quot;The Matrix&quot; made a ton of references to Alice in Wonderland. I enjoyed all of Carrol's plays on words and grammatical structure."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"Lewis Carroll managed to get in his own two cents in this book. He wrote this book for his niece (?) but he still weaved in some of his own political beliefs. Carroll was known to do that and did in Alice and Wonderland, yes it's weird, yes it may be called a children's story but I still think it should be read by child and adult alike."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"Wonderland is a truly fascinating place to read about.I love the illustrations in the original versions---and HATE the later illustrations that were done as the book was published over and over. In fact, I once tried to read a copy from the 1980's but I couldn't go on with it because the pictures were bothering me. Luckily, there's really only one freaky illustration in the original version, and that's the picture where Alice's neck is very long. It's a bit disturbing.But the book is well written and a good adventure story, too.I love the characters. They're very interesting.\\"'Well, then,' the Cat went on, 'you see a dog growls when it's angry, and wags its tail when it's pleased. Now I growl when I'm pleased, and wag my tail when I'm angry. Therefore I'm mad.'\\"- \\"The Chesire Cat\\", Alice In Wonderland, by Lewis CarrollCome to think of it, the Chesire cat illustration is actually quite creepy as well. But it's not a big deal or anything.The whole book's just weird fun. Where in the world did Mr. Carroll think of all this? The Mad Hatter? The Queen of Hearts? The Duchess and her pig baby?Alice herself is a considerably strange character.All in all, aside from a couple of creepy illustrations, the book is wonderful. Everyone should read it once in their lifetime---it's worth it."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"The rabbit hole went straight on like a tunnel for some ways, then dipped down so suddenly that Alice had no time to think what's was going on before she had founden herself falling down a very deep hole (Pg 2). Have you ever imagined crawling through a rabbit hole, falling down a well, and ending up in, well... Wonderland. You portably haven't, but now you are. If you now want to know, then you should read Alice in wonderland by Louise Carroll.Alice lets her curiosity get the best of her so she finds herself falling down a long, black hole. She follows the rabbit because she heard it say \\"Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!\\" After she hits the bottom of the well she finds all of these doors that she soon finds out are all locked. After she went around trying all of the doors she found a three-legged table in the middle of the floor with a small gold key on it. The key was to small to fit any of the doors and she starts to wonder how she is going to get out of her. She then finds a curtain, that's where she finds the door that the key fits. Once she opens the door she sees a beautiful garden but she is too large to fit in the door. Alice then finds a bottle marked \\"Drink Me\\" and when she drink it she shrinks. When she shrinks she noticed that she left the key on the table, which now she is too small to get. Then she finds cookies that says, \\"Eat Me\\" so of course Alice being as curiosity that she is she ate it. The cookie made her larger then what she was before. It made her so large that she got stuck. She started to cry, which made her shrink once again. She cried so much that it caused a river of tears. Then she is able to go into the small door, which then starts the whole adventure.Alice meets a lot of wonderful creatures and people during her adventure. She meets a caterpillar that gives her advice. She also meets the Duchess who has the Cheshire cat. The Cheshire cat told Alice to go visit the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, and the Dormouse. Alice also meets the Queen of Hearts.

The experience itself is like a dream, or more probably also like a drug induced high, and the story is infinitely fascinating.

At times, the children requested another chapter because the previous one was a bit of a &quot;cliffhanger.&quot; This book makes for a wonderful read-aloud for the 6-10 year old set, and would be enjoyable for a proficient reader to read alone, as well.

George MacDonald later published some children's books of his own including &quot;The Princess and the Goblin&quot; and many others which are fantastic and every child should read them.

It has adventure, love, fantasy, and a lot of fantastic nonsense. Every page is exciting and mysterious with a bewildering twist. Lewis Carrol exceeds on making a childerns story into a fantastic novel for all ages. He has great imagination that he uses in his puns, riddles, and characters to make nonsense into complete thoughts and morals. Alice is a creative little girl who seems to find adventure around every corner. Everybody in Wonderland is just as creative as Alice; they all seem to be intelligent and fully spirited. This novel is something no one wants to pass by. Personally, I suggest this book becomes a classic everyone should have to read. Many things in this book capture a moment, like this qoute,&quot;The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the Hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice. &quot;Who are you?&quot; said the Caterpillar. This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly, &quot;I-I hardly know, sir, just at present - at least I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times sice then.&quot; Another quote that stood out and will help choose this as your next book to read is from the cat. &quot;In that directoin,&quot; The Cat said, waving its paw around, &quot;lives a Hatter: and THAT direction,&quot; waving the other paw, &quot;lives teh March Hare. Visit either you like: They're both mad.&quot; &quot;But I dont want to go amoung mad people,&quot; Alice replied. &quot;oh, you can't help that,&quot; said the Cat.&quot;we're all mad here.

It also makes you wonder and wish this could happen to you. Take a walk through Alice's imagination and read this book.(I'm so cool.)"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is one of the most clever and entertaining books yet written. The author's use of language is extremely appealing to the younger readers. These young readers are attracted to this book because of the author's use of many songs. For instance the lullaby sung by the duchess to her child. The Mock Turtle also sang to Alice and the Gryphon a song about the Lobster Quadrille. The author also uses poems that are entertaining and fun to listen to. &quot;You are Old Father William&quot; is one of the many poems. Not only does the author use poems but she also uses commonly known poems and changes the words to fit the character saying them. For instance the Mad-Hatter sings Twinkle Twinkle Little Star in different words saying &quot;Up above the world you fly, Like a tea-tray in the sky.&quot; If this isn't a unique way of writing I dont know what is. Another style of her writingthat is appealing is when she creates a picture, using words in a poem, about the poem. Yhis is used on page 37. The words in the book are nbot hard so the book can be enjoyable when it is being read, not stressful. The author brings animals to life which is an interesting style of writing. This is Lewis Carroll's style of writing. The main character in this book is a little girl with blonde hair named Alice. This child is full of fantasies and dreams, which is what the book is about. Alice is very curious and likes to know every little detail. She thinks she is very smart. For example, when Alice is listening to the Dormouse's story she asks questions like &quot;What did they live on,&quot; and makes smart comments such as &quot;They could'nt have done that you know, they'd have been ill.&quot; She is also a little bit bratty, especially to the Dormouse when she says: &quot;Nobody asked your opinion.&quot; These characteristics pull together to make an interesting main character and to create a fabulous story. The theme of the story is sometimes you need to take a break out of every day life and dream of fantasize. This makes your life more interesting even if you dream about things that will never come true. Alice does this when she dreams about changing sizes and listening to talking animals. Dreaming doesn't hurt anyone except the people who don't do it. If nobody ever had dreams life would be extremely stressful and boring. The plot of the story is all about Alice trying to find the white rabbit, which of course is in her dream. Following the white rabbit takes ALice to interesting places, such as the Courtroom filled with animals, and the Duchess' house, along with meeting interestingpeople such as the Cheshire-Cat and the Queen. This amazing cat hes the ability to disappear whenever it wants to and it always smiles. In the end Alice finds the white rabbit and then wakes up from her dream. This is the plot of the story. The story is effective to the reader. This is so because after listening to such acreative dream and fantasy, it inspires people to take a little time out of the day and be creative and dream once in a while. All the parts of this five star story; the writer's style, the main character, the theme, and the plot; come together to create the overall effectiveness of the story. This is why I rated this book five stars."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"If you've ever wondered what this story was like, I encourage you to read it for your self.

The order came in time and was brand new as I expected it to be.If you havent read it, you should do so."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"Lewis Carroll's Alice stories are two of my favorite stories of all time. I love that they are about imagination - it reminds us that everyone should exercise their imagination from time to time, even adults. After all, if no one used their imaginations there would never be any inventions (the White Knight in Through the Looking Glass is a grand inventor) or progress in the world, although you do have to watch out for the people who use their imaginations for evil. These books are also wonderful because in today's non-stop world we all need a break from reality in a place that is ridiculously nonsensical.Alice's Adventures in Wonderland & Through the Looking Glass are stories of a young girl named Alice who, as we find out at the end of each story, has fallen asleep and dreamed up fabulous lands, creatures, and exceptional nonsense. Although often printed together since the main character is the same little girl, they are actually two separate books written several years apart. They are set in two very different, yet equally ridiculous, places - Wonderland and a place simply called \\"Through the Looking Glass.\\" These books are classics because they have not only stood the test of time, but also because they can be enjoyed by people of all ages. Young people can enjoy them because they are so fantastically silly, and adults can appreciate Carroll's mastery of wordplay.I can't remember if I was in junior high or high school when I first read them, but as is the case with most classics that I read back then, I did not fully understand or appreciate them the way I do now. In going back and rereading them, I found them to be much more humorous than I did the first time around. They illustrate beautifully the reason why English is one of the most difficult languages to master. Part of the charm of the Alice stories is that the characters constantly miscommunicate with each other by using different meanings of words (the Cheshire Cat telling Alice about characters who are \\"mad\\" and meaning that they are crazy while she thinks he means that they are angry), different spellings of words (the mouse saying his \\"tale\\" is long and sad and Alice thinking his \\"tail\\" is long, but she can't understand why it is sad), or by the characters taking comments literally instead of figuratively (Alice complains to a frog that no one is answering the door and he wants to know what question the door asked).Unfortunately, like many classics the language that has made the Alice stories so funny is the same language that will keep many modern readers from enjoying them. Most classics were written in different ages and people talked differently back then. Words and phrases have come to mean different things, we use different slang, and our very patterns of using language have changed. There have also been huge changes in society that affect the way we read and understand. In the 19th century when the Alice books were written, people (especially those in the higher classes) were much more \\"proper\\" than we are today. They had strict rules of conduct which we see Alice struggling with throughout the books, especially since the people and animals she encounters in her imaginary worlds don't seem to be playing by the same rules that she is used to. This again is part of what makes the Alice stories so funny, but only if you \\"get\\" the joke.Alice's Adventures in Wonderland & Through the Looking Glass are truly timeless classics that should be read and reread throughout a person's lifetime. Each time I read them, I find something that I overlooked before, keeping them both comfortingly familiar and surprisingly fresh. Alice is definitely a heroine that little girls can love, but boys might be hesitant to read these stories since they are about a little girl. They should, however, find the kings, knights, creatures, and fight scenes (you know, all the \\"boy stuff\\") appealing. Children will need a pared down, edited version that they can understand, and given the differences in language, junior high and high school students may need a \\"translated\\" version as well. At any age, the Alice stories are best enjoyed when read in the spirit that they were written - with the wonder and pleasure of childish imagination. After all, \\"Life, what is it but a dream?\\""},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"From the first to the last page, Lewis Carroll displayed his unique exposition of characters in order to convey his ideas of the world he wished to create for his readers. The main characters of this wonderful tale include: Alice, the White Queen and King, the Red Queen and King, the Gnat, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, Humpty Dumpty, the Lion, the Unicorn, and the White Knight. Alice, the protagonist, displays a sense of determination to be liked by the people in the Looking-Glass throughout the story despite the fact that the people hardly care for her. A character that ultimately disregards Alice's every word is the Red Queen, which is a strong, organized woman that is sure she is correct over everyone else. Quite the opposite, the White Queen is an unkempt, tentative woman, but helps Alice along her journey. Alice meets the Gnat on a train ride while he is whispering ideas of jokes in her ear to say to the other riders, yet his tepid disposition betrayed his sadness. Tweedledum and Tweedledee are just an odd pair of brothers that fight over meaningless things. Humpty Dumpty is an egg- shaped man that is simply rude to Alice and changes that meaning of all the words she asks him to define. A sweet, awkward, uncoordinated man, the White Knight, leads Alice to the end of her journey. A main conflict that Alice is forced to endure is her struggle to be accepted by the other creatures and people in the Looking-Glass. Another conflict is that Alice must travel through the land alone in order to achieve the rank of Queen. One plot action that helped lead up to the climax is when the Red Queen actually describes the path Alice must follow if she wishes to become Queen alongside herself and the White Queen. She told Alice that she was a Pawn on a chess board and she was to travel through eight squares, and also explained to her who or what is in each one; for example, she told her that she will meet Tweedledum and Tweedledee in the Fourth Square and in the Sixth Square she was to meet Humpty Dumpty. Another action that gradually leads to the climax of this tale is when the White Knight rescues Alice from the Red Knight and leads her to the Eight Square. Enthusiastically, the White Knight gibbers on about the new inventions he has created, and Alice is somewhat listening but is subconsciously waiting to arrive at her desired destination to finally experience her future, whatever or wherever it takes her.\\"Through the Looking- Glass\\" has the capacity to push your imagination to the level it was when you were a child, and that's what I loved the most about it. One of my favorite chapters in the book was \\"The Garden of Live Flowers\\", for the distinct personalities Carroll portrays for each flower was quite entertaining to read and it grasped my attention as did many of the other chapters. I also admired the idea of everything being backwards in the Looking-Glass world, and this was finely displayed in this chapter. \\"Humpty Dumpty\\" was another chapter that I enjoyed because I had a slight twist from the regular story I usually heard as a child. I was able to see the alternative view of a classic tale, and that was a pleasant change of perspective. Throughout the entire story, I also appreciated the diversity of the characters because their odd personalities come together to create a pleasurable read. With the Red Queen being rude and strong and the White Queen being benevolent and hesitant, Humpty Dumpty's character is uncaring but the White Knight's character is sweet and awkward , and Alice's determined personality is different from all else, this causes the readers to get hooked and interested in learning more. I would recommend this book to all children, teenagers, adults, and seniors because imagination has no age limit."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was the first book I can remember that truly thrilled me. I was very young when I picked it off a bookshelf at my grandparents' house almost at random. I was immediately drawn in: electrified, enthralled, amazed. I wanted more and more. This most recent trip through Wonderland was perhaps the second re-reading since then, and while I cannot ever again read it with the wonder of a small boy, I can still see why it captivated me. The wordplay; the games with logic; the agreeably disagreeable characters; Alice's mixture of confusion, curiosity, and determination--it was an irresistible combination. Some might think it is silly for a grown man to read a book like this, but it is certainly no sillier than for a grown man (and an Oxford don at that) to write one. And while Carroll's obsession with little girls, including photographing them naked or near-naked, is downright creepy now to an adult (something I didn't know about when I read his stories as a child) from a literary perspective it is easy to see how this fascination was channeled into giving his young friend Alice Liddell (his boss's daughter) a story to captivate her imagination by making her the primary character. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is the more engaging story, but the chess-themed Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There has some of the passages I remember most. There is the Red Queen running so fast with Alice that their running is more like flying, and pointing out to Alice that \\"it takes all the running you can do to keep in the same place.\\" Then there is the White Queen in discussion with Alice about impossible things, informing her that \\"sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.\\" There are the appearances by Humpty Dumpty and by Tweedledum and Tweedledee (characters Carroll did not invent, but who play more than cameo roles in the story and provide occasions for some of the author's trademark logic and word games). And of course, \\"Jabberwocky,\\" a poem I can still recite from heart, comes from the looking-glass world. While they are perhaps not so magical to me as they once were, it was very pleasant to read these two stories again. They are nice for a diversion, a few linguistic gymnastics, and a return visit to a land that has set more than one person on a lifetime course of reading."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"My first exposure to Lewis Carroll's classic children's story was through the 1951 Disney film adaptation \\"Alice in Wonderland,\\" which I watched repeatedly as a child. The creative quality of the story never failed to fascinate me, and I kept going back despite my deep-rooted terror of the frightful Queen of Hearts, who always gave me nightmares! However, it was not until recently, as an adult, that I ever picked up the book/s upon which that film was based. In some ways I wish I had read it when I was younger, as the book certainly makes a great deal more sense than the movie does (as much sense as a story of this sort can, anyhow), but thankfully this book is unique in that it is just as enjoyable for adults as for children.The story is actually spread across two books, here contained in a single volume. \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" was first published in 1865 and relates the events that take place after young Alice falls asleep during her lessons and dreams of following a white rabbit down a rabbit hole. Alice encounters all manner of strange creatures in her dream, and finds herself in all sorts of curious predicaments where common sense fails and the nonsensical comes to be expected. There is no central, concrete storyline, but rather Alice moves rapidly from one bizarre situation to the next before waking once more and relating the whole adventure to her sister.The second of the two books, \\"Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There,\\" appeared in 1871 and is very similar in nature to the first, though having a slightly different plot. Here Alice steps through an ordinary looking-glass one day, only to find herself in a world where, if you wish to get anywhere, you must walk in the opposite direction! Walking toward your desired destination only gets you further and further away. Also, interestingly, the land which Alice has entered is essentially a giant chessboard, and she must move through the different squares to reach the other side if she wishes to become a queen (which she does).The characters Carroll created in these two stories are some of the most strikingly unique and unforgettable in the world of literature. Alice herself, based largely on Alice Liddell, a real-life child of whom Carroll was very fond, is a wonderful heroine that you can't help admiring. Throughout all of her backwards and upside-down adventures, she remains ever sensible and analytical, always trying to reason her way out of the most unreasonable situations. Other characters a reader won't soon forget include the White Rabbit, the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, the Dormouse, the Cheshire Cat, Bill the Lizard, the Caterpillar, the Duchess and her peppery cook, the aforementioned Queen of Hearts, the Mock Turtle, the Gryphon, the Red and White Queens, the talking flowers, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, the Sheep, Humpty Dumpty, and the Red and White Knights. Carroll also created many fascinating new creatures in his stories, including bread-and-butterflies, rocking-horseflies, \\"slithy toves,\\" \\"mome raths\\" and more.What I find most intriguing, as an adult reader of these books, is Carroll's brilliant use of wordplay and symbolism throughout the stories. Nearly everything has some sort of double meaning. There are hidden messags and subtle witticisms on every page. Carroll also includes several parodies of what were well-known songs and rhymes in England at the time. Young children will love the books for their fantastic qualities and imaginative inspiration, but most readers will not pick up on the many puns and jokes until they are a little older, so these stories really do have something to offer to anyone, no matter what age. I'd highly recommend the book to any reader - and be sure to get an edition that includes the original illustrations.This review refers to the 2004 Barnes & Noble Classics printing, with introduction and notes by Tan Lin."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"This is not a review of the book, you can refer to the printed (or many of the Kindle versions) for that. Rather this is a comment on the Kindle file. I was specifically looking for a version that included the illustrations, and as this version listed John Tenniel under author information I hoped these would be included... they aren't. It does look like a well formatted version of the book, with an introduction by the editor, the original poetry from the beginning of the story (which some public domain versions lack), the original italicized text rather than CAPITAL letters as in some public domain versions, and a good approximation of the unique text formatting as seen in the printed book. It does not have a table of contents."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"There is one thing that all potential customers must keep in mind when buying any Alice book: Do not purchase one that does not include the illustrations of John Tenniel! This edition includes all of them and the quality of the reproductions on the pages are excellent. Tenniel's illustrations help add to the childish excitement of Carroll's stories and will be especially invaluable to teenagers and adults, having just by nature of growing up lost some of the imaginative innocence, that ability to stretch reality, that we all possessed as kids.Of course, the illustrations wouldn't mean jack if they didn't have a captivating story to work with. Carroll's amusing tale of nonsense is targeted as a kid's book, and that is always where many of our fondest memories of it will remain, but as a college student reading it I was amazed by its power to suspend reality and return me to a level of imagination that I had simply thought I lost somewhere along the way. The trip down the rabbit hole can be quite a different experience from a different point of view.This particular edition also includes a good introduction and very helpful explanatory notes organized chapter by chapter. The introduction and notes offer insights to Carroll's life and his relations with the real life Alice and her family that, from a student viewpoint, reveal an interesting and more personal side of the Alice tales."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"This threadbare bargain-priced edition may seem like a deal, but consider before purchasing that it has no table of contents, no introduction, no forward, no illustrations, and no bibliography. Adding insult to injury, the layout of this edition is easily one the worst ever for a reprint, with all words that originally appeared in italics for emphasis printed here in big block caps, as if the typesetting was done by an abrasive kid trying to get attention in an on line chat...IF YOU GET WHAT I MEAN.If you really want to explore and experience Lewis Carroll's classic, getThe Annotated Alice: The Definitive Edition-- for the price on Amazon, it's the real bargain. I also highly recommendAlice in Verse: The Lost Rhymes of Wonderland. Both of these books are a must for serious Alice fans as well as those just getting into Carroll's classic."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"I first read this book when I was eleven because I thought that I might be missing out on something if I didn't. I found Alice's Adventures in Wonderland kind of boring but still good. Then I read Through the Looking Glass, and I loved it! I memorized all of the poems (jabberwocky being my favorite poem in the world), read it about a million times, and recomended it to people. Between Tweedledum and Tweedledee and Humpty Dumpty and all the reat of them, I had a lot of pleasant laughs and thoughts and dreams. Unfortunately, I read that Alice is losing popularity because people aren't at the reading level to read it before they outgrow fairy tales. This is a shame. people should preserve their imaginations just to read an excellent book like this and dream about it for a while. Now I am 13, and I stll treaasure this book. The poem at the very end of the book was so sad in way. it really summed up about how I feel about the magic of childhood."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"My first exposure to Lewis Carroll's classic children's story was through the 1951 Disney film adaptation \\"Alice in Wonderland,\\" which I watched repeatedly as a child. The creative quality of the story never failed to fascinate me, and I kept going back despite my deep-rooted terror of the frightful Queen of Hearts, who always gave me nightmares! However, it was not until recently, as an adult, that I ever picked up the book/s upon which that film was based. In some ways I wish I had read it when I was younger, as the book certainly makes a great deal more sense than the movie does (as much sense as a story of this sort can, anyhow), but thankfully this book is unique in that it is just as enjoyable for adults as for children.The story is actually spread across two books, here contained in a single volume. \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" was first published in 1865 and relates the events that take place after young Alice falls asleep during her lessons and dreams of following a white rabbit down a rabbit hole. Alice encounters all manner of strange creatures in her dream, and finds herself in all sorts of curious predicaments where common sense fails and the nonsensical comes to be expected. There is no central, concrete storyline, but rather Alice moves rapidly from one bizarre situation to the next before waking once more and relating the whole adventure to her sister.The second of the two books, \\"Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There,\\" appeared in 1871 and is very similar in nature to the first, though having a slightly different plot. Here Alice steps through an ordinary looking-glass one day, only to find herself in a world where, if you wish to get anywhere, you must walk in the opposite direction! Walking toward your desired destination only gets you further and further away. Also, interestingly, the land which Alice has entered is essentially a giant chessboard, and she must move through the different squares to reach the other side if she wishes to become a queen (which she does).The characters Carroll created in these two stories are some of the most strikingly unique and unforgettable in the world of literature. Alice herself, based largely on Alice Liddell, a real-life child of whom Carroll was very fond, is a wonderful heroine that you can't help admiring. Throughout all of her backwards and upside-down adventures, she remains ever sensible and analytical, always trying to reason her way out of the most unreasonable situations. Other characters a reader won't soon forget include the White Rabbit, the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, the Dormouse, the Cheshire Cat, Bill the Lizard, the Caterpillar, the Duchess and her peppery cook, the aforementioned Queen of Hearts, the Mock Turtle, the Gryphon, the Red and White Queens, the talking flowers, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, the Sheep, Humpty Dumpty, and the Red and White Knights. Carroll also created many fascinating new creatures in his stories, including bread-and-butterflies, rocking-horseflies, \\"slithy toves,\\" \\"mome raths\\" and more.What I find most intriguing, as an adult reader of these books, is Carroll's brilliant use of wordplay and symbolism throughout the stories. Nearly everything has some sort of double meaning. There are hidden messags and subtle witticisms on every page. Carroll also includes several parodies of what were well-known songs and rhymes in England at the time. Young children will love the books for their fantastic qualities and imaginative inspiration, but most readers will not pick up on the many puns and jokes until they are a little older, so these stories really do have something to offer to anyone, no matter what age.This particular edition (2004 Barnes & Noble Classics printing, with introduction and notes by Tan Lin) also contains several extra \\"goodies\\" in addition to the text of the two books. There is a brief biography of Lewis Carroll, a timeline of his life and career, a fascinating and insightful introduction (well worth the read!), information on various film adaptations, a short story by Carroll - \\"What the Tortoise said to Achilles,\\" commentary on the text by various individuals and publications, and a set of questions designed to aid the reader's thought and analysis of the text. The book also contains all of the original illustrations, which are indispenable to a full enjoyment of the story. Highly recommended to any reader."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"When Charles Ludwig Dodgson first began to tell the story of Alice's adventures underground to the three Liddell sisters, he had no idea whatsoever the impact that his work would one day have in the cultural history of humanity. Is there a person alive in Western civilization that *doesn't* know of Alice, the Mad Hatter, the Queen of Hearts, the White Rabbit and the Cheshire Cat? I seriously doubt it. Writing under the pen name of Lewis Carroll, Dodgson's quirky fairytale soon became a publishing sensation in Victorian England, quite an unusual feat for a dour mathematician who had no interest whatsoever in boys, women or most other human beings, and instead lavishing his attention on little girls - particularly one Alice Liddell, to whom he presented the original manuscript to. The story of Lewis Carroll is just as fascinating as his fictional Alice, so I would suggest following up the \\"Alice\\" books with a good Carroll biography.In a story that is so random (basically made up of one little girl wandering about in a dream) there is plenty of room for all sorts of crazy theories as to exactly what everything means. Does \\"Alice\\" have a deep subtext, filled with hidden meaning and messages? Is it Freudian? Elaborate satire? Does it reflect the deep internal frustrations, anxieties and wish-fulfillment of a slightly-disturbed mathematician obsessed with little girls? Or is it simply a series of weird and wonderful events dreamed up for the enjoyment of children? The fact that nobody is really sure *what* to make of this story is probably the reason why it's still published, read and discussed today.The other reason is its historical value. \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" was the first book designed for children that was entirely void of any sort of moral, and instead written solely for pure entertainment purposes. Before \\"Alice\\", children were stuck with stories that preached goodliness and virtue, something that Carroll himself pokes fun at during the course of the story, when he refers to \\"several nice little stories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts, and other unpleasant things, all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had told them.\\" His stories came like an unexpected breath of fresh air amongst Victorian society, and it was little wonder that adults as well as children helped to make \\"Alice\\" a bestseller during its day.Another crucial feature to the tale is Alice herself, often considered the first realistic representation of a child in literature. She's curious, but sometimes a little shy. She's polite, but manners often give way to frustration and temper tantrums. She's intelligent, but not as intelligent as she would like to think she is (relying heavily on an education that often fails her). She often holds her own against the contradictory natures of the people she meets, but more often than not is baffled and belittled by them. She possesses some degree of common sense, but often does some remarkably stupid things. She's likeable, but she's also a bit of a show-off and a snob. In other words, she's the first (and perhaps the best) example of a three-dimensional child character in literature geared toward either children *or* adults.\\"Alice in Wonderland\\" begins with the infamous sight of a white rabbit with a waistcoat and pocket-watch muttering to himself: \\"I'm late! I'm late!\\" Abandoning her sister and the dull book that she's reading, Alice follows the rabbit down a rabbit hole and unexpectedly finds herself drifting deep down underground. What follows is a series of weird and wonderful meetings with the likes of the Queen of Hearts, the Mad Hatter and the March Hare, the Cheshire Cat and the Gryphon and the Mock Turtle, as poor Alice - the only sane person in the madhouse - struggles to make herself heard against this twisted parody of the adult world.Nearly every page contains a clever pun, nonsensical poem or mathematical puzzle, and there's plenty here to keep you fascinated, whether it be Alice's abrupt shrinking and growing (brought on by eating Wonderland food, and perhaps reflecting Carroll's desire to control the growth of his young protagonist), the beautiful garden that Alice cannot seem to reach (and when she does, she finds it not quite to her liking, perhaps suggesting a reverse-Eden, in which children desiring adulthood soon realize that it's not quite what they expected it to be) or Alice's internal crisis in which she debates whether the surreal circumstances she's found herself in have resulted in her loosing her own identity (I won't even try to open the jar on *that* one!) No wonder scholars can go mad trying to untangle this tale! Even the fact that the story succumbs to the ultimate clich&eacute; in fantasy-fiction, the ending that will reward you with an F if you use it in a creative-writing exercise at school (I am of course, referring to the fact that Alice wakes up at the conclusion of the story to find that it was just a dream), doesn't damage the power of Carroll's imaginative force.\\"Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There\\" is a little more structured in terms of its storyline, perhaps because Carroll was not simply making most of it up on the spot, as he had done with its predecessor. This time, when Alice falls asleep, she crawls through the mirror on the top of the mantelpiece and into the room on the other side. There she finds a land organized into the shape of a giant chessboard, in which Alice herself is a little pawn that must journey to the end of the board if she wishes to become a Queen. On the way she meets several chess pieces, including the Red and White Queen, and the White Knight (widely believed to represent Carroll himself), as well as Tweedledum and Tweedledee, Humpty Dumpty, a garden of living flowers, and the Lion and the Unicorn, the latter of whom famously tells Alice: \\"If you'll believe in me, I'll believe in you.\\" My favourite chapter would have to be the one that involves the ludicrously pompous Humpty Dumpty (who is really the one who coined the term \\"un-birthday\\", not the Mad Hatter and the March Hare as the Disney version would have you believe), though equally memorable is the intriguing episode when Alice happens upon the sleeping Red King, and is told that he's dreaming of her. Is Alice in the Red King's dream, or is the Red King in Alice's dream? What should happen if one of them should wake up before the other? It's a disturbing metaphysical conundrum, and hints at the depths with which a scholar (or deep-thinking child) could delve into these stories.Of course, not every child will enjoy the \\"Alice\\" stories. What was once vividly imaginative and innovative for a stifled Victorian audience has long since become commonplace in children's fiction, and the randomness with which the adventures take place can often unsettle young listeners (as they certainly did me, as I always felt that Alice was caught inside a nightmare). However, others will delight in the madness that abounds throughout the story, and others still will learn to appreciate the work as they get older. There are hundreds of editions out there, most probably quite as good as the next, but I would encourage buyers to track down an edition with John Tenniel's famous illustrations - you simply cannot read the \\"Alice\\" books when they are not accompanied by Tenniel's portrayal of his demure little Alice, with her hooded eyes and large forehead. It would be like reading C. S. Lewis without Pauline Baynes, or Roald Dahl without Quentin Blake. Unthinkable!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"I had not read these books since I was probably seven or eight, and I am glad that I finally got around to reading them again. These are some of the most fun childrens books (or any books for that matter) ever written. A previous reviewer gave this book a poor rating because it was only a childrens book. I fail to understand how being a childrens book means that a book is bad. Many childrens book are among the best books that I have ever read. Just because a book is a childrens book does not mean that it is a book just for children. Lewis Carroll wrote this for children, but it is probably even more enjoyable for me to read now than it was when I was a child, for now I understand many of the double meanings and world plays that you would never understand as a child. Carroll is better with word plays than any other author that I can recall reading. He is a master of molding sentences that simply slide right off of your tongue because they flow so smoothly. This is definitely one of the best childrens books ever written.Overall grade: A+"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, better known as Lewis Carroll, was a shy, eccentric bachelor who taught mathematics at Christ Church, Oxford. He had a great fondness of playing with mathematics, logic, words, for writing nonsense, and for the company of little girls, especially a little girl called Alice Liddell (rhymes with fiddle), the daughter of Christ Church's Dean. Dodgson's passions somehow fused into two great masterpieces of English literature, the Alice Books, immortal fantasies whose fame surpassed that of all of Carroll's collegues at Oxford put together. If the Alice books had any &quot;purpoise&quot; other than to entertain little girls, it is to send you, the reader, to the pleasures of logic and philosophy and, as Carroll says in the introduction to Learners (1897) &quot;to give a chance of adding a very large item to your stock of mental delights.&quot; Carroll's special genius lies in his ability to disguise charmingly the seriousness of his concerns and to make the most playful quality of his work at the same time its didactic crux. In the case of Alice, we are dealing with a very curious, complicated kind of nonsense, which explores the possibilities of the use and abuse of language and is actually based on a profound knowledge of the rules of clear thinging and logical thought. In fact, most of Carroll's apercus and all his jokes are inversions of the rules. Reason is here in service to the imagination, not vice versa. And oh my! Those interesting characters! I like to think that most of the characters that Alice meets are Oxford Dons that the real Alice knew. They sound like Dons with their fine mastery of Socratic logic, their crushing repartee, and the disconcerting and totally unself-conscious eccentricity of their conduct. The wealth of material which Carroll presents for the illumination of his subjects is almost without end. The more I read it, the more I think about it, the more I find. In fact, I have reached the conclusion that AAW is in actual fact a story so deep as to yield results in exegesis almost beyond belief. Also consider purchasing The Annotated Alice by Gardiner. It will help increase your reading pleasure."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"People tend to lump \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" and \\"Through the Looking-Glass (and What Alice Found There)\\" into one collection which has taken on the new title of \\"Alice in Wonderland\\". This is probably a product of the movies, which took bits and pieces from each and made a composite adventure. This was possible, because Lewis Carroll (a.k.a. Reverend Charles Lutwidge Dodgson) managed to make the stories so even in quality that they can be put together seamlessly. He also managed to keep the stories enough different, that one can still enjoy reading both of them one after the other, without the feeling that the second is just a retelling of the first.To be sure, there are several ways in which the stories are similar, but not to the point where it detracts from the reader's enjoyment of the story. There are only three characters which appear in both books, one of which is Alice. The other notable characters (the Cheshire Cat, the Queen of Hearts, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, Humpty Dumpty, etc.) are well distributed between the two books. Thus there is a looking-glass between the two, just as the looking-glass plays such a key role in the second book.The Penguin Classics edition of \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass\\" includes both books including the illustrations by John Tenniel. It also includes the original \\"Alice's Adventures under Ground\\" which includes Lewis Carroll's artwork. For additional features, it includes \`\\"Alice\\" on the Stage' an article which Lewis Carroll wrote after seeing a production of the stage version, and it includes preface's to the books which Lewis Carroll wrote in 1896 for the 1897 editions. There are wonderful notes for both books, and a very informative introduction by Hugh Haughton. There is other supporting material as well. To sum up, this edition has pretty much anything one could want, other than a complete collection of Carroll's work.A last comment on the introduction, it covers the biographical information for Reverend Dodgson, and the information on how the stories came about. Some of this information may detract from one's enjoyment of the story, but one can certainly understand the decision to include it for those who are interested in Reverend Dodgson and his life. All in all, this edition is packed with everything and will suit those who just want to read the stories as well as those who want to delve deep into their origins."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"Last week I downloaded the free version of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. All the poetry was missing from it. I didn't realize it right away until I got to the chapter with the Mock Turtle. So, I came across this version and it was very appealing because I thought I was getting both books for just 99 cents. At first I was mostly satisfied since I saw the poetry, but the formatting of the book was weird. There would be a line of text and then the next line would only have a couple words. Also, this download only has Alice in Wonderland.

But the book is 100% better than any movie.As a writer myself, I can only hope to write a book half as imaginative and charming as this one."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"Alice in Wonderland is my favorite book, and it has the sequel Through the Looking glass. This book is fantasy with a lot of humor in it. When I was little someone who came to our house gave the book to me. I never started reading it until I was in the 5th grade. But still I thought the book was too long so I never finished it in 5th grade. But in 6th grade I read the whole book and loved it, and I read it again this year. I think I could read this book 1 million times and still want to read it 1million times again!In the first story, Alice in Wonderland, It is about a girl named Alice. Alice is in this wonderful, magical place where creatures she never thought of come to life. It all starts with a white rabbit holding a pocket watch saying, \\"I'm late, I'm late.\\" Alice is very curious (who wouldn't be!) so she follows him and ends up falling through a hole, and it is a long, long fall. She comes to a room where strange things happen to Alice. She has a tea party with mad, crazy people, she meets the queen and finds out that the queen isn't decent at all!In the second story, Through the Looking glass, Alice meets a bunch of weird creatures. Alice steps into looking glass house where she is in a giant chess game and on her way to becoming queen Alice. And a lot of exciting and weird things happen along the way.I highly recommend this book to anyone in the 6th grade up. It is the kind of book that you can't stop reading. You get attached to the characters, and books that do that to me, I love, because you know you are enjoying the book.

It gets your imagination going. It all starts when Alice is sitting on a bank with her sister and falls asleep. From there it is all imagination and from there your imagination never stops. Alice lets her curiosity get the best of her so she finds herself falling down a long, black, well after following the white rabbit. She follows the rabbit because she heard it say &quot;Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!&quot; Personally, I would have followed a talking rabbit also. After she hits the bottom of the well she finds all of these doors that she soon finds out are all locked. After she went around trying all of the doors she found a three legged table in the middle of the floor with a small gold key on it. The key was to small to fit any of the doors and she starts to wonder how she is going to get out of her. She then finds a curtain and she moves it. That's where she finds the door that the key fits. Once she opens the door she sees a beautiful garden but she is to large to fit in the door. Alice then finds a bottle marked &quot;Drink Me&quot; and when she drink it she shrinks. When she shrinks she noticed that she left the key on the table which now she is to small to get. Then she finds cookies that says &quot;Eat Me&quot; so of course Alice being as curiosity that she is she ate it. The cookie made her larger then what she was before. It made her so large that she got stuck. She started to cry which made her shrink once again. She cried so much that it caused a river of tears. Alice meets a lot of wonderful creatures and people during her adventure. She meets a caterpillar who gives her advice. She also meets the Duchess who has the Cheshire cat. Alice was confused about why the cat was smiling so she asked the Duchess. The Duchess said that he was a Cheshire cat and that it was supposed to smile. The Cheshire cat told Alice to go visit the Hatter, the March Hare, and the Dormouse. The cat told her that she would love them because they were mad. Alice did as the cat told her and visited them where she sit down and had tea with them. Alice also meets the Queen of Hearts won is an evil person. The Queens tarts get stolen and she thinks Alice stole them. Alice has to go to court over this. The Queen loved to scream &quot;Off with her head!&quot; Alice is woke from her wonderful dream by her sister. Alice then starts to think about how her sister will be when she grows older. At the beginning when she first falls asleep it is hard to tell if she is dreaming so that is kind of confusing but otherwise this book is wonderful and very easy to read."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"I was hoping to find a Kindle edition of both Alice books in one file with the original John Tenniel illustrations. This seemed to fit the bill and seemed to be worth the money. Overall, from my initial reading, I am mostly pleased with the formatting. The unorthodox type setups (such as the mouse's tale) are mostly preserved and the illustrations look good. One complaint is that the title very clearly says \\"with active table of contents.\\" There is no table of contents. I was disappointed in this. Also, on my K1 anyway, some of the poetry lines broke in the middle of words. This made the poetry awkward to read at some places. There also are some stray punctuation marks here and there, but this didn't really detract from the reading experience.Edit 3/19/10 - I finished reading the entire two books and found the table of contents at the back of the book.

It is a perfect example of a story written a very popular theme. It explains that in the mind of a child things are not always as they seem. Alice (the main character) is a curious youngster who follows a white rabbit, in a waist-coat, down a rabbit hole. Alice finds herself in a strange new world where nothing is what it seems. Small cakes and unmarked bottles cause her to grow to be three stories tall and pieces of mushrooms make her shrink to the height of a playing card. As the story progresses, Alice encounters many interesting characters including a very demanding queen who sentences everyone to be beheaded before the end of a crazy croquet game. The author, Lewis Carroll, used poetry and rhythm to add to the already whimsical and mysterious atmosphere. He created individuals with exaggerated character traits, so the reader can easily picture them. For example the Cheshire cat with his giant grin and disappearing body. Carroll also included illustrations of the important scenes of the story, so the reader would be able to understand them better.

Just a couple of years ago I re-read all of the Chronicles of Narnia, and enjoyed them just as much as--if not more than--I enjoyed them as a child.All of that said, yes, Carroll did a wonderful job portraying the messiness, strangeness, and scenery switches of a dream. But as a whole...his works barely rate a 3 on a one to five scale. In fact...I'd probably go with a 2.5 at best. Although some of his Victorian satire was certainly amusing, I feel as if these books were mostly nonsense and simply didn't contain the literary merit to render it a classic with the likes of, for example, Hans Christian Anderson, J.M.

Ormondroyd's \\"David & the Phoenix\\" has the spirit I expected to encounter in Caroll's book. Instead - this book starts nowhere and ends nowhere. And perhaps that is the nonsense that some find pleasing. For me it was simply distracting. The whole idea of the world's we create ourselves is a notion I have always been drawn to. Wonderland isn't even a world much less a persuasive daydream. Nothing there matters.

Meh."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking glass are two interesting stories. When I was a child, I watched the Disney version of Alice in Wonderland and enjoyed it. I've watched it again recently and find it very strange. I came across the book, &quot;Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass&quot; in an old library at my Grandparent's house. This was an old English version, which may have made it more difficult to read and comprehend then if it was in common dialect. The first story, Alice in Wonderland, is the better of the two. It tells of a dreamland that a seven-year old Alice is visiting. This book jumps around a lot, and it is difficult to keep track of who's who by the end. The second story, &quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot;, was worse then the first one. It is once again in a dreamland of a world seen backwards from Alice's own world in the reflection of a mirror. When Alice enters this world, there are about two chapters before they enter the difficult analagy of telling the story through a game of chess. This is extremely hard to follow, seeing as you have to visualize the chessboard in your mind. Each seperate story takes place on a different tile while Alice is a pawn waiting to be Queened. In the end of the story, she is Queened and has tea with the other two queens, that is, the white and red queens. The dissapointing conclusion was that Alice was really in her world the whole time and her kittens were the queens in the story.

Both novels were way too wacky and filled with continuous, non-stop bizarre nonsense, that it became to distracting to read at times. There were several times that I had wanted to stop reading each novel, but persevered only because I wanted to see why these two novels are such beloved classics.However, I don't understand why these two novels are so beloved. They are just too bizarre... Was Lewis Carroll on some sort of drugs while writing these novels or what?"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"Ok, so everyone says that Alice in Wonderland was such a wonderful book, yes,yes, I am aware. But, I thought it was very confusing and all the characters were very stupid. I mean, it's not even a book about anything. Sure, it's trying to say that shes is growing up in the process of the dumb dream world but who cares?It was a bad way to write a story, or better yet it was a bad story to write about in the 1st place."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"My daughter borrowed this book from the library.

The author is very creative in this novel; she uses the literary element personifications through out the whole book. She does a very good job with this by how she portrays the character in the book, (ex: the Queen as a snob). Alice (the protagonist) starts off by following a white rabbit to a hole. This late and timid creature leads her into Wonderland. Wonderland is a place of creation and imagination. The dream like setting gives her the adventure, like a labyrinth. The fairytale like mood in the story gives a sense of fantasy, adventure as she meets and encounters many creatures of the dreamland world. She finds herself lost and goes along with what ever she comes across the unknown world. She finds herself with decisions and she has to make to get to one point to the other. I think that this story has really no point, its just nonsense of fairytale she tells to little kids. She even said that she told this during a trip to entertain three little girls. To me the story was a pointless adventure. Yes, she creates a great tone and mood for the setting yet the body of the story was boring to me. The only point I got from it was an internal conflict of whether to take one road or not, like whether to take and drink certain things and what she should do with the moment."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"Alice's AdventureMy first impressions of this book were that it was like reading C.S. Lewis on cheap drugs. The events are complete non sequiturs and the changes in plot are worse.It appears to be a spoiled child wandering in a world she does not understand, nor is willing to learn about - unlike Lucy in The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe who seeks to understand the local customs and circumstances.The book is very easy to read but it leaves distaste in my literary mouth. I know it is considered a classic but I just do not see it, and if I did not have to read it for school I would not have bothered to finish it.(First written as Journal Reading Notes in 1999.)Through the Looking GlassThough this book is not much better than Alice's Adventures, the chess motif and theme does make the book much more interesting. With the bossy, dominant Red Queen and the quiet, kind, messy white queen, the book is a study in contrasts.The interweaving of the Nursery Rhyme Characters and the frequent fish poetry references does provide more continuity and a sense of sequential events than Alice's first adventure. I also appreciated the linking of the cat at the beginning and end of the story.It does still feel like Carroll did way too many opium pipes in his time.(First written as Journal Reading Notes in 1999.)"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"I am sure this book must be beautiful but I never received it from this seller.

One of them was 'Alice'....Even tho I had read it as a child, I had forgotten just how wonderful Carroll's book was......Recently I was in a bookstore and noted that once again summer classics are out and it was in the pile once again. It can be read and enjoyed by all ages, but I think the subtleties can be best enjoyed by those who are a bit older e.g. the Mad Hatter's Tea Party, the croquet game featuring the Queen of Hearts etc. I was reminded of how much the tea party reminded me of a previous job that I had involving a variety of board members.I guess there is only only one word to describe this classic, 'timeless'."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"THIS IS A BOOK WICH ONE SHOULD ANALYSE FOR ONESELF!And NO, one cannot overanalyse this book, the symbols in it are like the branches of a tree. The branches keep expanding until they end in fruits and seeds, the seeds thereoff will fall unto the ground and transform into another tree wich also has seeds and the cycle will continue ad infinitum.One of the most important symbols is the transformation trough eating pastry or drinking liquids, wich will make one bigger or smaller. The pastry or the liquids as clusters of thought wich will transform ones shape in nonphysical reality. Have you ever encountered someone who was very short or small in appearant reality yet he/she displayed a posture of magnificent greatness? Well, it is not a wild argument to state that he/she took a bite of the cookie or a zip of the magick potion....Another thing very important are the playing cards. The metaphor as life as a game, yourself batteling a whole armada of playing cards spades, hearts and diamonds alike!Then there is the eloquent buffoonery one engages upon in the teaparty of life (remember the rabbit and the hatsalesman?). This reminded me very much of the people one encounters in everyday life who seem to not be able to think clearly, to be out of syntax with the axioms of logic. These people will resort to various kinds of practices like palmistry or speaking with angels, they have postulated their delusions into actuallity.But of course, to transcend beyond this and to show you a way out one has to engage upon our magickal cat (but usually one will just bumb into him at the least expected moment).

Truly amazing. It has inspiried so many people, and even those in my acting school who didn't see much more than the Disney movie were moved by it. And to those who say it was confusing and full of nonesense, I have an explanation. The story was made up by Carroll on a boat ride to Alice Liddell and her other two sisters. Alice wanted to hear a story with lots of nonesense, and that's what Carroll did. If you still do not get it, I can't put it any more clearly. If you need help understanding the books, buy volumes such as the Annotated Alice and other books that explain Carroll's work. Hopefully you'll enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"It's difficult to critique a classic, especially one as well-known as this one, so I have decided to take a different path and strongly recommend this work to all aspiring fantasy authors.Rather than becoming absorbed/obsessed with the works of Tolkein or Jordan, take a long and critical look at this masterpiece.A fantasy, first and foremost, must be fantastic, and Lewis Carroll evokes the fantastic and surreal beautifully without sacrificing that centerpiece of drama known as characterization.

It was during the industrial age of the 1800s and the mechanic way of life was in. As such, art and fantasy were seen by a lot of people in England as ridiculous, nonsensical, and tolerable at best. But Lewis Carroll didn't think so. There are always a few people who won't give up common sense for the sake of public opinion. Writing for a little girl named Alice Liddell, Lewis Carroll told of the adventures of another girl named Alice who, after a tumble down a very strange rabbit hole, found herself in a place where fantasy and nonsense reigned supreme. Countering the status quo of the era in England, \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" bursts with eccentric characters and unsuspecting twists and turns. A good read if you're tired of the machinization of any age and need to have some good old fashion unpredicatable fun!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"I must confess I had never read the account of Alice's adventures before. As an adult, though, I found the two books to be quite charming and fun to read. Alice's Adventures In Wonderland is the much more enjoyable tale of the two, perhaps because so much of it was already familiar to me as a part of popular culture. Through the Looking Glass seemed to me to be much more contrived and less magical. I found myself trying to puzzle out hidden messages and motifs in the latter work, while I basically just read the Wonderland story for pure enjoyment. The latter tale also seemed to fall apart at the seams as it began to approach its conclusion. Without rereading the books, I have trouble seeing all of the complex and satirical things mentioned by academic types (such as a critique of Victorian society and contemporary educational methods), nor does the whole chess game motif make complete sense to me, although the workings of the game apparently pleased the mathematician in Carroll's alter-ego enough that he attempts to explain it at the start of Through the Looking Glass.It was a treat to see the original illustrations of John Tenniel interspersed throughout both stories, despite the fact that Alice appears a good bit more sullen than I envision her in my own mind. It was also good to be formally introduced to such well-known entities as the Cheshire Cat, although Humpty Dumpty certainly comes across as a rather taciturn figure. For those of you who love puns, Lewis Carroll offers you a gold mine of them, although I doubt that many children will actually understand very many of them until they reach an age in which they will probably reject a reading of Carroll as \\"baby stuff.\\" I'm no expert on children's literature (or on children, for that matter), but the story of Alice's adventures would seem to offer a free ticket to an enticing fantasy world for youngsters and a delightfully quaint vacation spot for adult readers."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"I purchased this book because I was specifically lo0king for the sequel, Through the Looking-Glass.

I purchased it after reading that review and thinking he must be mistaken, but he is right, it is there."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"I don't think we will ever again see anything quite like the two Alice stories. They are both unalterable masterpieces.As beautiful as the Disney movie is, the two books have so much more. More off-the-wall characters, more extremely witty dialogue, and more imaginative scenarios to ponder, these books go above and beyond any creative work I have ever seen.Carroll's works have changed my life more than any self-help book ever could. Through them I can ponder about so much more than only the things I can see. I am able to look inside of my imagination, and be unafraid to push its limits.I was around 20 years old when I read the Alice books for the first time. They seem a bit complex for children's books. I believe Carroll intended the books to be for an 8 year old child, and to be honest, I'd be impressed if I saw someone that age reading this material. The vocabulary and sentence structure involved looks more suited to someone the age of 12 I believe, but perhaps children know more than I am aware of.Also, Pig and Pepper (one of my favorite chapters), has a scene that's quite disturbing. I don't know if a first time novelist in this day and age could get away with including such content in a children's title. It's nice to take a look at though, since the chapter contains the very first appearance of the Cheshire Cat. I personally like the sheep from the Wool and Water chapter of \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" a little bit better than the Cheshire Cat, so try looking into that chapter also if you can."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"This has to be two of my favorite books of all time. Carroll has managed to create memorable characters, the mad-hatter, Humpty Dumpty and many others. This is not merely a well-written children's story but a piece of biting satire and a violent attack on the norms, morals and ethics that were prevalent at the time. For instance when Humpty Dumpty shakes hands with Alice he only offers one finer. This was an extreme version of the upper class only offering two fingers to shake to anyone below their stature and he takes this nasty habit to its ugly extreme. The pictures are tremendously well done. I can not praise Caroll enough since he is one of the best writers of children's stories ever and the way he paints the landscape and his usage of the words is truly stupendous. Every time I read it there is something new I pick up and that I have not thought about before. This is the sign of marvelous talent and proves that he is one of the best authors and story tellers ever."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"The book ''Alice in Wonderland Through The Looking Glass'' was an interesting book. I liked the book because it had neat words to learn and also the pictures were very well in illustration. My favorite part in the book was when she met the catipillar. That was my favorite part because he was so calm the way that the author wrote, and he also described the catipillar's actions very well. The ending was nice because it was just good to know she got what she wanted. This book is good and confusing but it is worth while."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"I loved Alice in Wonderland growing up.

So much going on its hard to keep up, but it does a great job at keeping one's attention. Both stories were great, but i liked the original one a little better than the sequel."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"I first read theAlice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Signet Classics)books as a child, armed with my own library card. Throughout that experience, I was simply delighted by the wonderfully colorful illustrations and the fanciful tales. There was no issue of digging for deeper implications, puns, or wordplay. I still recall my fascination with the nonsensical creatures, as well as with Alice's adventurous dreamland.As an adult, one can choose to delight in the obvious fantasy adventures or search for hidden meanings. Therefore, for the purpose of this exercise in which I foray into a reading challenge that will encompass these books and others that can be considered \\"retellings and sequels\\" or \\"literature with allusions and influences,\\" I am choosing to simply enjoy revisiting a childhood treasure.In any case, the most important aspects of these books are the creatively developed characters, especially the portrayal of Alice as a curious child who is obviously intelligent with layers of common-sense and creativity. Just following the characters in their upside-down or backwards adventures can be enough to intrigue the reader. All the reader must do is suspend disbelief for the purpose of the reading experience, which is not such a departure from many reading or movie-going encounters.I plan to reserve my searching for hidden meanings for the other books that I will be exploring in the upcoming weeks.This book is obviously a classic that has stood up to the test of time--it should be no surprise that I am giving it five stars."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"This book is very much worth reading for anyone who would like to know the story before some ells changed it around.

My son tells me he listens in to the reading quite often so it is a hit all around."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"Mervyn Peake (1911-1968) was one of the most original and wildly talented English artists of the last century. Known best both in his lifetime and even more afterwards for his three GORMENGHAST novels (TITUS GROAN, GORMENGHAST, and TITUS ALONE), he was equally adept as a poet and as an illustrator and painter. He illustrated many of his own works as well as those of contemporaries such as Quentin Crisp, and on occasion provided new illustrations for classics from the past, such as this wonderful edition of ALICE IN WONDERLAND and THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS, first published in a rare and obscure edition in 1946 but republished many times since and still readily available.My copy is the Shocken (USA) hardcover edition from 1979, and I can recommend it strongly to anyone interested in a decent copy of the work but not necessarily prepared to look for an earlier edition. The binding is nice, the paper acid-free, the illustrations well reproduced. Peake is closer in style at first glance to Tenniel than most other 20th century artists who have interpreted the work; his finely detailed pen-and-ink work and heavy crosshatching bear the hallmarks of the classically trained illustrator in line with the earlier Victorian draughstmen who set the stage for much children's book illustration in England for a century or more. But there is a weirdness and grotesquerie - a creepiness - to this artist's work that is much more unnerving than Tenniel's and that, in my opinion, does a better job of reflecting the genuinely disturbing elements in the text, the madness and terrors that lie on the edges of the story in such violent characters as the Queen of Hearts and Tweedledum and Tweedledee. There are also pictures that edge close to a surrealism that Carroll was approaching, but that Tenniel I think didn't really understand.A magical interpretation then, and one that any collector of either artist or editions of the work (I am both) should make a top priority."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"In my retirement, I've taken up creative writing and enjoy it very much. In the last five years, I've written over 150 short stories. Had a few published and others read on our local PBS station. The teacher suggested we read \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" as a good example of imaginative story writing. I don't remember reading it as a child, and it was fun delving into Lewis Carroll's mind as he dreamt this up for Alice, his young friend. The introduction to the book, about Carroll, did a good job of setting the story up as well as provide biographical information about the author."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"this classic story is totally worth the read. if you love fantasy this is the book to read!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"Is it a children's story or a primer on logic or even a work of wit and wisdom?Maybe it's all three.Alice in Wonderland, and Through the Looking Glass make up the two Alice books by Lewis Carroll. And in these books, Carroll paints a strange world in which logic has a strange way about it, mostly consisting of folk who interpret things quite literally.This, being a classic of children's literature, has been mimicked by many, and by many, unsuccessfully. Though, I will admit that many adaptations of this work have been made satisfactorily.The first book takes Alice down a rabbit hole and into wonderland. There, she meets all sorts of strange characters and discovers the queen of hearts, as well as other card-themed characters. The queen, it seems, is obsessed with displacing people's heads, and Alice must take every precaution to not upset her majesty.The second book takes Alice through a looking glass into a chess-themed world. Here the cruel magnate is the red queen. Alice learns many new poems and logical quirks before returning back through the looking glass.This book is sure to be enjoyed by bright children as well as adults who are kids at heart."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"I have always loved the classic Disney movie of Alice in Wonderland.

Then I realized the movie makers had indeed 'Hollywoodized'-- that enchanting story -- making it violent and very Harry Potterish in its 'dragon chases' Of course the British actors were superb, as well as the American, but what a corruption of its dreamy innocence with such nightmareish malevolence! This book really is a must for anyone's collection of childhood classics read and enjoyed, even if one is older."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"The author wonderfully re-creates the unsettling and illogical happenings of the dream world. I suppose this has stood the test of time because it has no message or moral - unlike other children's books, which can be too precious and preachy.

The book was also in very good condition and I will deffinatly be ordering from here agin."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"Alices' adventures in wonderland and through the looking glass written by Lewis Carroll and is illustrated by John Tenniel is a story that has lived on and is enjoyed by both young and old. The original book was an immediate classic success for people young and old to read.Carroll's sense of absurdity in his humour and his amazing gift for games of logic and language have made this book an enduring dream legacy of what is possible to happen in a persons mind. This is a story about Alice and growing up and what is lost for her in doing so. Alice dreams of a world where she doesn't belong to and where what is true in her real life isn't necessarily true anymore. The story begins when Alice follows the frantically delayed white rabbit down a black hole into the magical world of wonderland, where she meets a variety of some bizarre creatures some mythical creatures and some downright illogically wrong creatures. There is no linear path to life in wonderland where one event will lead seamlessly to another adding meaningful experience upon experience, instead life for her is made up of series of oftentimes unrelated events, by conversations you never fully understand while others you can't reason with at all in a completely upside down unpredictable world,that is always ever changing. Carroll's way with words has stood the test of time. His use of characters such as the mad hatter and the jabberwocky all have added to the simplistic colorful nature of his story in its a true grandeaur of a masterpiece that will live on for generations to come for readers reading it. Characters that keep you wondering for days on what they exactly are ? Do they belong in our world truly or are they a instead a collection of mixed creatures that are taken from mythological creatures of times a gone by who knows? If you haven't read this book yet then pick it up and read it no matter how young or old you are in age."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"The Modern Library edition is a nice choice for the adult reader, featuring all the wonderful original illustrations (by British political cartoonist John Tenniel), a thoughtful forward by A.S. Byatt, and just enough notes and commentary to provide some additional historical and cultural context.Lewis Carroll was an imaginitive genius and has created some of the most unforgettable and timeless characters with this work - the Mad Hatter, Tweedledee & Tweedledum, the hookah-smoking Caterpiller, the perpetually late White Rabbit - and the absurd situations Alice finds herself in are poignant and amusing at the same time.However, one thing I did not realize coming back to these stories for the first time as an adult was just how largely character and situation-driven these stories are. Carroll moves rather disjointedly from one nonsensical scenario to the next, paying very little attention to a cohesive narrative thread. Indeed the world of Alice is best experienced as a whole, when the menagerie of characters can come to life, but these stories could just as easily be read out of order or taken out piece by piece. The creative work doesn't suffer a bit because of this, but readers should not come to these books expecting a novelistic experience.These are creatures to love, lines to savor, and the most curious things to consider."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"I couldn't put it down, man. I checked this book out at the local library and read through the opening 130 pages in one sitting until I was falling asleep at three in the morning. Lewis Carroll's classic tale of adventure and fantasy \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" is one of the best books I've ever read.The story is about a little girl, Alice, who falls into a very deep rabbit hole, seemingly straight to the middle of the earth! Her adventures once she lands are as wonderfully imagined as any in the history of literature. Her encounters with the White Rabbit, the Mad Hatter, the King and Queen of Hearts, the Duchess, The Mock Turtle, The Gryphon, and The Wise Old Caterpillar are as fun and as pure and as well intended as any characters I've ever read a writer write.The story behind how Alice in Wonderland came to be is equally interesting, and one worth reading up on. That Carroll wrote it without any pretension to selling it, or for money, or even to publish it, is truly one of the remarkable stories of world literature. His motives were pure, and (at least to me) this is one of the reasons why this book is so dear and so readable.I highly recommend \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" to readers young and old and can only say that I look forward to reading \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" next! A marvelous, wonderful book, as fun as any book I've ever read.Yours,Stacey"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"My mom first read this book to me when I was seven years old. Because I was only in first or second grade, Alice in Wonderland scared the heck out of me. I remember parts were pretty horrific and confusing. I kind of hated it. It was like Stephen King for a first grader- which, if you ever go to a website on Lewis Carroll, shouldn't surprise anyone because Carroll had loads of problems and was pretty much tripped out while writing this (I think).Now that I'm older, I decided to re-read Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass. While reading it, it's hard to decide whether this is just a load of imaginative creativity, or a metaphor of something deeper that is true in society today, or true in the 1800's. Well, I guess you can read it either way- but there is definitely some deep stuff in here. Many poems will stop and make you think, and as the story progresses you can't help but feel like you are Alice (which is pretty amazing, because this isn't like Lord of the Rings or anything, it's basically a fairy tale on drugs).Definitely, definitely, definitely do not hesitate to pick this book up and read. Another review said it was disturbing- well, in some ways it really is. But the characters and the plot line (or lack of!) keep you interested and keeps you reading. AIW and TTLG are must-haves in anyone interested in fantasy/sci-fi, along with Chronicles of Narnia and other great classics."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"This is a review of the physical book published by Tribeca Books, not the stories about Alice written by Lewis Carroll. The book itself is not worth your money. The text and margins are very small and do not seem well centered on the page. The font is simple and ugly. The spine of the book is completely white and doesn't have the title of the book or author listed. It may be superficial, but how do you recognize this book on a bookshelf? Overall, the book is very cheap and thrown together. Get a nicer version that also has the original illustrations by John Tenniel."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"Unfortunately, this Kindle version is missing almost all of the illustrations, which are an integral part of the book.

My review is about this specific Hallmark Edition book.It's difficult to find a nice hardcover version of both stories complete with the original illustrations. the illustrations are either poor quality, or are reduced in number. This book doesn't use them at all, so if that's important to you, look elsewhere. Instead it includes beautiful photographs of the scenes from the NBC TV movie. In my opinion this is better than the original, but it lacks the historical signifigance.In my opinion, get this book. It has the stories you want and the photos are very pleasing to look at. This book is bound nicely and will make a great addition to any library or collection."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass are probably some of the most famous children's books in the English anguage. There are two ends to the spectrum of interpreting them.On the one end, the books are seen as wonderful and innocent entertainment mainly for kids but also suitable for adults. It is innovative and chaotic and performs puns and wordplay on the English language as well as concepts. They are accompanied by great quality illustrations and have a sense of fun and adventure about them.On the other end, the books are seen as elaborate allegories. Everything is symbolic. The tales are reminiscent of an LSD induced fantasy. Everything is Freudian and academic and open to postmodern interpretation and of course there's the disturbing question of Carrol's supposed obsession with little girls.Having read - and loved - the books, I think the truth lies somewhere in the middle. Yes, they seem to be oriented primarily for children but that doesn't mean adults can't get anything more than nostalgia out of them. Yes they are rich in some symbolism but it is unwise to overanalyse and read too much extraneous ideas into them.Highly recommended to be read as what they are - the product of an amazing mind, which saw the world of children as the ground in which to sow ideas both fun and profound. All the semi-philosophical talks, nonsense poems, fantastical creatures combine to make an unforgettable work."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"I am a teenager, but I live in France and am not completely fluent in English yet. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was one of the first English novels I read, and I loved it. I went on to read Through the Looking Glass and loved it just as much. I think that it is a perfect book to read to children. The language was clear enough for me to understand, and I am not a native English speaker, so it would be easy for a child to understand.

Carroll puts them all to shame. Both books are filled with puns, absurd comedy, and rhymes and riddles. The first book is more constantly interesting than the second, which slows down at parts (such as during Alice's long conversation with the White Knight).In Alice in Wonderland, I loved the exposition of logical relationships during the tea party with the Mad Hatter and the March Hare. Her exchange with the Gryphon and the Mock Turtle is also fun. Although I didn't enjoy Through the Looking Glass quite as much, Alice's interaction with Tweedledum and Tweedledee and then later with Humpty Dumpty are great. (Humpty Dumpty illuminates the poem \\"Jabberwocky\\" by providing his own definitions of all the nonsense words.)I listened to an unabridged audio version performed by Donada Peters (published by Books on Tape, Inc.): Peters was Excellent.

Chalkful of vivid images, philosophy, language, and satire, Carroll makes one want to give up hopes of writing anything that might be labeled &quot;literature.&quot; Highly recommended.

Though it is a shortened phrase from the original, I was intrigued at the message that this book gives to a grownup. There are some books that was clever satires of their times, which has been 'downgraded' to the level of children's books like &quot;Gulliver's Travel' or 'The Little Prince.&quot; Clearly, &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; also has some of it. Although Lewis Carroll may not have thought of it, what he told the three girls on that fateful day is for also all past-children who are now grownups. Actually, it seems that it was an interpretation of the grown-ups world for the children through the eyes of this little girl, Alice, who also happens to be the person who insisted that this Oxford-Mathematician publish the story that he told her. If you sometimes feel that things are not going your way, you might want to pick this book up. It may work, just like for me and that professor."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"I really do love this book with all my heart.

Both novels are contained in this publication; \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" and Alice Through the Looking Glass\\". You will always enjoy these for your family and pass on to future generations."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"Alice in Wonderland begins as a questioning, youthful girl named Alice tumbles down the rabbit hole to follow a white rabbit wearing a vest and watch. Alice finds herself in world of cards, bottles or cakes of magical liquids that changes her size, and a vast array of dizzying characters. Alice plays a croquet game with the Queen of Hearts in her garden, all the while the Queen ordering her guards to chop off peoples heads. She also encounters a Mad Hatter at his teatime, which is all the time because he angered time once, so tea time is always for him! In Through the Looking Glass, Alice travels to a backwards world through her mirror in her living room, playing her way through the world in a chess game, meeting various characters in her quest to become a Queen. Here, is Lewis Carrols famous poem, Jabberwocky: \`Twas brillig, and the slithy toves' did gyre and gimble in the wabe:' All mimsy were the borogoves,' and the mome raths outgrabe.I found this book to be not what I expect. It was entertaining, exciting, but quite a bit confusing. Overall, I believe it would be better suited for free reading than a report for a class. A part I found especially confusing was in Alice in Wonderland when Alice visits the house of the Duchess and the Duchess sing to her baby, \\"Speak roughly to your little boy, And beat him when he sneezes: He only does it to annoy, Because he know it teases.\\" This part I found to be confusing, since beating of a baby is never allowed in any society, past or present.Many of the themes in Alice in Wonderland are told through poems or songs that the characters sing. Sometimes the message is hard to clearly express because of the way words are used and the long list of characters. I would recommend this book to adults more, because of the writing styles Carrol used, more because the book was written in 1872, but also some teenagers for a look at how developed the movie became for children but because some of the confusion is hard to determine, I wouldn't recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"I am fonder of Through the Looking Glass than Alice in Wonderland, perhaps because of less exposure (e.g., Disney and other commercial venues). The drawings by Tenniel are brilliant and add the right flavor to the story. The book is well-written, surreal with bizarre, fascinating characters (whom a little girl has to figure out), unique situations, word play, puzzles and a mocking irreverent tone towards high society. Whenever as an adult I'd hit a snag and couldn't read, I would always pull out this one and it would put me back on track again. Another I will treasure for the memories of sharing it with my kid."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"This book was an interest in my eyes. It took fantasy and brought it to life in my mind. Through my imagination, I was practically in the body of Alice, experiencing everything she did. Lewis Carroll is an excellent author, depicting excellent pictures, thoughts, and questions in the reader's mind. His style and technique of writing put amazing imagery and specific descriptions through my imagination. &quot;A found face, and large eyes like a frog, &quot; was an example of a piece of his work that depicts a good sense of imagery. The main idea of this story is for the main character, Alice, to find her way out of Wonderland. Some examples of some of the characters were: Queen of Hearts, Alice, the Mad Hatter, and the March Hare. Lewis Carroll uses descriptive words and phrases to describe the many different characters in this fiction book. In this book, Alice goes from being in the middle of the woods to a large hallway, into a big pool of water, to a house in which she grows larger, and finally she meets a weird looking caterpillar resting upon a mushroom. She adventured from place to place, seeking help from many different creatures. Lewis Carroll has a very unique way of describing different events and is also very creative while doing so. For example, when Alice was playing a relaxing game with the Queen of Hearts, the author describes the ball as a hedgehog, and the stick as a skinny, pink flamingo, which puts a very creative picture in the reader's mind. In the process of this story, Alice drinks and eats things, even though she doesn't know what she was ingesting, she did it anyway. Every event in which happened, went with the pattern of the events in the story. Every event was important and was needed to make sense out of the wild story. In &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, Lewis Carroll uses his imagination to create a story full of memorable and fantastic events, used to put a smile on the reader's face and a strong grip on the reader's hand. Overall, I would recommend this book to readers 13 and older. This book will put a sparkle in the reader's eye, and a mind full of memories for a lifetime to remember. So if you have a chance, pick up the book and start an adventurous fantasy through Wonderland!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"I just read this book for an Honors English class, and I got exactly what I expected. Lewis Carroll has an unique writing style;it is unlike anything that I have read before. His use of words give a sharp image in the reader's head, just like as if they were actually there. He uses excellent imagery. His descriptions on every single character was great,and that was one thing that I enjoyed. An example of his descriptions is in the beginning of chapter six, when Alice sees a footman in front of a house. Carroll describes the footman &quot;with a found face,and large eyes like a frog&quot;. He is one of the few authors that take the time to describe the supplementary characters. The main character is , of course, Alice. She is very adventurous, and this is seen throughout the book. Anyting that she sees that is new, she will try it. In the very beginning of her adventures, she sees a potion that is laying around, and in hopes of getting into the garden that she saw earlier, she drank some of it, just because it said &quot;drink me&quot;. The potion made her very small, which eventually became an adventure within itself. Another example was when she went to play croquet with the queen. They played croquet with hedgehogs as balls and flamingoes has sticks. Alice didn't care what the adventure was, as long as she was a part of it.She also didn't hesistate to express her opinions. When the queen was executing everyone in her path, Alice spoke up about what she was doing. People who like adventuruous characters would like Alice. The theme of this book to me is if you see something new, you should try it just for the fun of doing something new. It is shown by Alice's different adventures, like what I mentioned in the previous paragraphs. I didn't really get the plot of this story. I thought that it was to get to the garden that she saw in the beginning of the book. I think that I didn't get it because Carroll jumped from one adventure without finishing the previous one. That is one of the reasons why I gave this book three stars out of five. I didn't like this story, partially because it was fantasy. I just read it to try something different.I would recommend this book to readers who like reading fantasy and who like to use their imaginations while reading. I don't know why it is a big children's classic, but I didn't like when I was in elementary school and I still don't like it in high school. This book will most likely never become one of my favorite classics. Overall, &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; wasn't very effective to me."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"I read the book, \\"Alice In Wonderland.\\" This is a very good book to read but it can also get very confusing if you don't read it thoroughly. The author of this book has a very unique way of writing. The author thinks back as a child and put down everything that happened and then exaggerates it so much that it is a totally fiction book. \\"Alice In Wonderland\\" is not the type of book where you could skip over sentences, because you would get completely lost. This book is a magical book. It takes you into a world you never knew was there. The main character in this book is Alice. She takes many trips, not knowing that in her imagination she is making it all up. She goes from the woods, to a big hallway, into water, then into a house in which she grows larger than wanted, and then she meets a caterpillar on a mushroom. There are many other places she went and met other creatures that helped her along the way. There are many things you can learn from this book. For example Alice wanted to change her size (she wanted to be different than she was before) but then things went terribly wrong. She never went to the size she wanted to be... she either went too short or too tall. This teaches you that you should accept the way you are, because you will thank yourself in the end. You are perfect the way you are you never need to change unless you are bad and need to change into good. You could really learn a whole lot from this book but it is going to be hard for younger kids to understand. I personally recommend this book for 12 year olds and up. This book is really good, give it a try it will take you into a magnificent world and you will never want to come back!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"THE ULTIMATE FAIRYTAIL.

When I thought a Transformers movie would be a great idea; when I truly believed that Buffy and Angel could be together someday; when I could rely on \\"Heroes\\" to be, oh, at least kinda interesting. And a big part of my naivet&eacute; had to do with the Disney Studio. See, as a youngster, they taught me that Snow White had an evil sorceress for a step-mother, that Cinderella had a fairy Godmother for a, uh, godmother, and that a young lady called Alice went to Wonderland in her dreams one day, and met there the Mad Hatter and the March Hare, with whom she celebrated her un-birthday.Disney lied! About that last part, at any rate. Gasp!I can't quite understand why I never knew this, or why this never even occurred to me. I mean, I had read the fairy tale behind \\"The Little Mermaid\\", so I knew that the whole Ariel-Prince Eric hook up was something of an artistic liberty. I'd read \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" and \\"Beauty and the Beast\\", and a host of other stories about beauties whose princes someday came. And since they were all old, old tales, ripe for revision and, let's face it, not exactly offering endings to make you go \\"ahhh\\", it didn't occur to me to argue with the happy-ever-afters being assisted by singing mice and the occasional dancing cavalcade of cutlery.But for some reason, despite the voraciousness of my reading habits throughout what I like to pretend is a life, I didn't get around to reading the original, non-Golden Book version of Carroll's \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" till I was well past the age where perhaps I should have. I've now read it several times, and all I can say is... cool.We all know the basic story (if not, as I have recently discovered, the entirety of it). Little blonde girl is dozing in a meadow with her cat Dinah when she sees a waistcoat-clad White Rabbit rush past exclaiming that he is late. She, naturally enough, follows the tardy bunny down a very, very deep whole, at the bottom of which she discovers a little door. Through that door is Wonderland, which she can only reach by shrinking herself with the assistance of convenient shrinking refreshments. And later, she gets larger again. Then there's this whole thing about a mystic caterpillar, a tea party, the Queen of Hearts, a croquet match using flamingos (animal rights activists, unite against Flamingo Croquet!) and a trial... and that's not even mentioning that enigmatic Cheshire Cat, who can materialize anywhere at will. What an elegantly contrived, wondrously chaotic, perfectly lovely story it is, too.The first thing I thought upon concluding it, however, was that I had accidentally bought the abridged version. So much Alice that I remembered seemed to be missing, and I knew my imagination wasn't good enough to have conjured up that stuff. But then I read \\"Through the Looking-Glass\\", Alice's continued adventures, and it was all explained.Through the Looking-Glass finds our Alice being all other-worldly again, but instead of down a hole she goes through a mirror into a slightly askew locale in which the lion and the unicorn fight for the crown, Humpty Dumpty falls from his wall, and we hear of the Jabberwocky and the Walrus, cabbages and kings. There's also a giant, and inexplicable, chess game afoot. It's witty and suspenseful, surreal and yet actual, well-crafted melodrama blended perfectly with satire... so very entertaining.Ah! I exclaimed. I see! Those clever, sneaky fellows at Mouse Central had combined elements from the two books to create their little gem that they, regardless, called \\"Alice in Wonderland\\", even though Alice was clearly *through the looking-glass* when she, as for example, learned of un-birthdays.This got me to thinking. Does this mean that Disney has lied about other things, as well? Is there no Bambi, no Davy Crockett, no kids from Witch Mountain? What about Herbie, did he really go bananas, and did that guy turn into a shaggy dog, or were those shameless untruths as well? Sure, I knew they'd let the fact-checking go a little in their more recent endeavors, what with Pocahontas not having a talking willow in her circle of friends, Hercules not really being all that good of a guy, and there actually being a proper Princess in \\"The Princess and the Frog\\" (who was emphatically not from New Orleans). But those cherished memories of my childhood I had held as sacred, and they are now tarnished forever.But that's okay. More than okay, really. It's a joy to discover that a story I had thought so familiar can be all shiny and new again. It was a revelation to dive into Carroll's simple, yet complex prose... even the academic-y footnotes are interesting here, as so many of Carroll's characters, metaphors and poems are parodies, references and allusions to persons living and dead. (Well, okay, mostly dead.) The in-jokes are more prevalent than in your average Supernatural episode. Dated it may be, but out-dated, never, and the fact that I can continue to discover the pleasures of this ostensibly child's tale at my advanced age actually makes me grateful for a childhood deprived of it.So, I guess, thanks for lying to me, Disney. I appreciate it. Really. Um... so... anything you want to tell me about \\"The Jungle Book\\"?[The review first appeared in Geek Speak Magazine, Issue 2.]"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"I'm going to assume that we've all read and loved Alice's Adventures, and focus instead on reviewing this gorgeous edition. The design of this novel is exquisite. I ordered Alice as a test case - I desperately want to own the entire Coralie Bickford-Smith line for Penguin, but wanted to ensure the books are well made. From the outside, they're stunning. It feels good in my hands, the color is fantastic, and the graphics are so well-selected. My gripe is with the spine of the book, which is almost too tight - these aren't the most comfortable editions to read without cracking the spine. That said, they are too lovely to pass up, and a steal at under $20!

This is an exact reproduction of the original along with Carrol's original artwork plus you get two books in one, with the addition of \\"Through The Looking Glass\\", plus they are the large print editions. The imagination used to create this story is genius, if you are going to see the movie than take the time to find out what made this classic story timeless."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"\\"Alice in Wonderland\\" is a literary classic which has had a vast influence on many writers after Lewis Carroll's time. One can easily see where satiric writers, like Jasper Fforde, get their notion of twisting literary and familiar characters to suit their own purposes. This Wordsworth Classics edition contains \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" and its sequel, \\"Through the Looking Glass\\", which is the lesser of the two stories.Most everyone (including those who have not read the book) are familiar with the plot line. Alice follows the White Rabbit down the rabbit hole and finds herself in the strange and exotic world of Wonderland where nothing seems to make sense. As she continues in her journey, she meets a wide variety of characters - some familiar (like Humpty Dumpty) and some specific to Carroll (the Mad Hatter and the March Hare). Because Alice's adventure is truly a dream, what happens in Wonderland does not need to make sense or follow any logical pattern of time or plot. \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" finds Alice back in Wonderland, this time with the promise of becoming a queen if she can make it across the chess board. The concept of chess ties this story together, but there are few strong elements which make this sequel difficult to stand on its own. It would work better if some of its stories had been incorporated into the original.All in all, \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" and \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" are unique escapes into one writer's dreamy imagination. In a way, the oddities wind up making sense, allowing readers to philosophize with Carroll along the way. And for any lover of the English language, some of Carroll's creations (especially the Jabberwocky) are astounding and wonderful plays on words. Sir John Tenniel's classic illustrations help further the story, truly capturing the weirdness of Wonderland and Alice's adventures there."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"Of course the story is fun but I don't like the way the ebook is formatted and there's no Table of Contents."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"This is a book that seems to stay with what Lewis Carroll wanted these books to be.

There are so many adaptations of this book and so many varied ways to enjoy it, that there is perhaps a danger that it may be overused.

While it is often labeled a children's novel, it takes the understanding of an adult to grasp the richness of symbolism contained in each page. We get a front row seat as Alice journeys through a myriad of characters that range from the bizarre to the down right funny. Alice is the wiser for each encounter, but what makes the book so charming is that she manages to retain her child-like wonder.I must admit that this novel would not be complete without the illustrations from Punch cartoonist John Tenniel. Tenniel gives the characters a richness and exaggerated life that is unmatched. The book is incomplete without those drawings.Lastly, there is little bit of Alice in all of us. Who among us has not wanted to walk in the forest, open a closed door, or peek behind a curtain. The thought of escaping and exploring the unknown without the fear of harm is almost intoxicating.

Its filled with many different perspectives on many different things, some are very insightful while some are just silly. At some points, it will have you thinking while at others you'll find yourself laughing up a storm. This is what makes it great for kids and adults alike.

Sure, her adventures--first in Wonderland, then in the world behind the Looking-Glass--will appeal to all children; the characters are whimsical and delightful, the dangers tantalizing (at least to young minds), and the endings ever-so-happy. Plus, there are kittens, butterflies, and talking goats...what child can resist talking goats, I ask you?But for those of us over the age of 8...we need something else. As for myself, I got lost in the brilliantly clever humor that was strewn throughout the tales; the wit is quick, and Carroll's enjoyment of wordplay is apparent on every page. \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" and \\"Through the Looking-Glass\\" contain some of the most memorable dialogue you will ever encounter. Buy this book for yourself, or for your child, or your friend, or whomever...anyone with a sense of humor and fantasy will delight in these two classic, unforgettable tales."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a very good book in my opinion. I feel that it is just like you are in a dream and the author does a very good job at writing the book so it seems like that. I think it is a good book because it really keeps you focused on what is happening because it is a complicated story. There are a lot of twists and turns in the book, especially in the beginning. I think that it is also a good book because the author, Lewis Carroll, includes things that you would never even think about until you read to book. I also like the book because it is very entertaining to understand how Alice (the main character) tries to deal with and interoperate all of the strange circumstances that happen in wonderland. All of the characters that are in the book are very strange and tell very bizarre stories. The stories have no point what so ever and it gets quite frustrating to Alice because she really wants to know what happens, but they just wont say it and go on and on. All of the events that happen in the book that need trial do not seem very savvy and are unjust and unfair which is quite interesting to read about because Alice gets accused of a lot of things and it is very gallant of her to stand up for herself. With all of the facts that I just stated, my conclusion is that Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a very good book and I would recommend it to any readers that would like to know about a little girl and her bizarre and exciting adventures in wonderland."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"Alice in wonderland is a great story for all ages. it is full of adventure.

This nineteenth century classic has been credited variously with being a complex mathematical puzzle, a dream, a cynical allegory on modern civilization, a drug-induced hallucination, or just a fanciful child's tale. I lean toward the latter. Whatever the truth, the book has stood the test of time, and continues to intrigue children even today. I highly recommend this imagination-stimulating story, but not without the pictures. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of BIG ICE."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"I first read Alice's Adventures when I was about nine or ten years old, and you know what? I didn't really like it. It didn't make any sense, I told my mother. It's not serious enough for me.But years later, at age twenty, I acted on a whim and read it a second time. And I was captivated. No other book matches Alice in humor, oddness, or bizarre characters. All the imitators (and there have been many) have failed because they couldn't manage to hold together their story's oddness with such a strong, flowing narrative or protaganist as lovable as Alice. Lewis Carroll's plot drifts effortlessly from one bizarre situation to another with sublime grace. His genius was that he went into the bizarre without going too far; his creativity never turned cheap.Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is an adult's children book. I doubt that children will, or even can, enjoy it to the extent that adults will. When I read it at age nine I wanted it to have some kind of meaning, some raison d'etre--how ironic that now I'm an adult and its dreamlike feel is just the kind of break from reality I could use. Of course children can love these stories too, and I don't want to give anyone the idea that Alice and Looking Glass are stories only for adults. Your kids probably don't read anything other than the Harry Potter books, over and over, so why not give them something else?Some other things about Alice in Wonderland make it such a classic. It was unique in its time (and still so) for its complete lack of moralizing. It doesn't tell you how good boys and girls should act, or turn into a good-vs-evil tale. Its protaganist, Alice, has to be one of the greatest characters, female or otherwise, in all literature. Her cleverness and logic are Wonderful.So buy the book. The edition to get is one with the original illustrations."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"'The Annotated Alice' with annotations done by Math and Games writer, Martin Gardiner may be the first, and is certainly the best known annotated edition of a popular classic, followed by annotations of other major popular classics such as the complete Sherlock Holmes and 'The Hobbit'.It is especially interesting to compare the Alice stories with Tolkien's novels, as both series of works are enhanced by their authors' love and professional involvement with language studies. The difference is that while Tolkien was a philologist, Lewis Carroll (Charles Dodgson) was a logician, so their slant on words and wordplay are a lot different. Tolkien is the poet of names and Carroll is the weaver of paradoxes and nonsense. Both, however, benefit from exegesis for those of us who are neither philologists nor logicians.Carroll's works also need heavy annotation for his references to people and events of his day as they are masked by metaphorical references in the Alice books.Reading these stories with Gardiner's annotations is virtually the only way to fully appreciate these works.

As Alice travels through Wonderland and meets many unexpected characters your imagination will soar. Run a race with a dodo bird.

The entire gift was precious though and the book really made it special."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"I have grown up watching Disney's Alice in Wonderland, and knowing what liberties Disney is known to take in their movies, I wanted to read the original story for myself.And I'm glad I did. Lewis Carol was such a wonderful storyteller, full of imagination and creative use of the English language.This was two stories in one. The first, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, I thought had more imagination and he action seemed to flow faster with more scenes and challenges for Alice to deal with. The characters are fantastic and highly imaginative.The second story, Through the Looking Glass, also had a lot of imagination, but it didn't seem to have as fast a pace as the first book. Still, I found it fascinating as the story was done as if Alice were a chess piece moving across a chess board to reach the other side as a pawn to become a queen. As she moved up the chess board, she encountered different characters and situations.Highly recommended, even if it was written as a child's book."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"When I was assigned Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass to read for my Victorian Literature class, I was excited. Even though I had heard Alice's Adventures in Wonderland referred to countless times throughout my youth, I had never read the story or seen the movie. I had never heard of Through the Looking Glass, but while reading, I realized that many people who think they are talking about AAIW are actually referring to TTLG. The two texts seem to be conflated in a way that makes them indistinguishable from each other. It is for this reason that I enjoyed reading this edition of the texts. There is only a page separating the two stories, which allows the reader to easily make the transition between them. This small separation also allows the reader to recognize the undeniable connection between the texts and to understand why many people combine them in their minds.AAIW is about a young girl named Alice whose boring day with her sister is interrupted when a white rabbit runs by her saying, \\"Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!\\" Alice's curiosity is aroused, but surprisingly not to a great degree. This is the first hint to the reader that Alice is not an average child, as she seems to believe that a talking rabbit is quite normal. She does become intrigued, though, when the rabbit produces a clock from his pocket, so she follows it down its hole and enters a world of wonder. I loved the story from this point on. It is filled with such unbelievable creatures and situations, but Carroll's writing style made me want to believe in a world that could be filled with so much magic and splendor. There was never a dull moment in the story, and each page was filled with more excitement. I will offer a warning, though. This story is not for those who like a neatly packaged plotline. It is written in a somewhat discontinuous nature and seems to follow some sort of dream logic where there are no rules. However, I enjoyed the nonsensical pattern. Without it, a dimension of the story would be lost. It offers some insight into the mind of a young, adventurous, fearless girl, and Carroll seems to be challenging his readers to be more like Alice.The second text in this book, TTLG, is again a story about Alice. In this adventure, Alice travels through a wondrous world on the other side of her looking glass. As in AAIW, Alice again encounters absurd creatures, such as live chess pieces and talking flowers. The land she travels through is an oversized chessboard, which gives this story a more structured plot than AAIW. The chess theme provides Alice with sense of what she must accomplish in the looking- glass world, and it provides the reader with a sense of direction throughout the story. Alice's goal is to become a chess queen, so the reader knows that when she becomes queen, the story will be over. However, just because the story has some structure does not mean that it is not just as wild and marvelous as its predecessor. I enjoyed all of the characters. They seem to have an endless supply of advice that people in the 21st century can still learn from. My favorite example is when the Red Queen says, \\"Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!\\" Maybe what Carroll is suggesting is that if we read more nonsensical, unbelievable stories like his, we won't be so afraid to be adventurous and fearless like Alice; so that the next time a white rabbit runs by us, we might just see where it leads us."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"Long time ago, I should have read this story as a child, but I don't remember how come I didn't, but I don't remember either how I came to know Alice so intimately, as if this was a legend that had leaked out to me and never to be forgotten. No doubt, this is one hell of a legend.The title itself belies it to be just a fantastical childhood tale but it is actually a book that will get adults curiouser and curiouser until all the puns that are intended to taunt the deluded adult world will boil down to giving you a crazy smile. I swear by a mouse's tail- these two Alice books are charming, and so full of funny, far-out characters. I cant resist being crazy with the mad tea-party, and the wacky game-story of cards and chess, of the chesire cat that is actually more charming than eerie, and of course, Alice who is smart, proud and always snappy. Although my favorite of all is the wise caterpillar who smokes a hookah and sits on a mushroom.And I love the drawing given by John Tenniel, and some text's visual presentation are supercool.Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass&quot; is actually a story of growing up, or more like a child's discovery of wisdom, or maybe an exploration of wisdom in a child's perspective. The setting of cards and chess is an allegory of the world of chance and determinism, and the pervasive foreshadowing of death seems silly but anyway childish. Sometimes I don't understand why the book is one of the most quoted. Perhaps because aside from being popular, I am sure this tale really brings out the child in anyone.Lewis Carroll might have only told this story to put a loquacious girl in silence but fortunately, he has not made a very simple fantasy. He has invented an Alice in a lot of us."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"It's a fantastic book, of course, and it certainly doesn't need me to praise it as millions have done before. It's probably one of the most unique things ever written: the only book that could be considered both completely a children's story and completely a book for adults. The only problem with the Penguin edition is that it's grossly over-annotated. For scholars this may be very helpful, but sadly enough a lot of the notes are either irrelevant to non-professors or provide critical instead of historical or biographical commentary which, in my opinion, ruins the greatest delight of the book: AAIW/TLG are highly interpretable and symbolic stories, but unfortunately the commentator is always interrupting like a nagging pedant before the reader has a chance to reflect. Once again, both stories well deserve their status as true English classics but another edition might be a better choice."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"How is a raven like a writing desk? Because it can produce a few notes, though they are very flat; and it is never put with the wrong end in front. That is an example of the witty offbeat humor in \\"Alice's Adventures In Wonderland\\".Alice is sitting bored when her attention is captured by a talking white rabbit. She follows it down a rabbit hole into a world full of strange creatures, curious happenings, and mysterious pastries. At first she marvels at all the oddities, but soon she wants to get home, only to discover that she doesn't know how.By far my favorite parts of this book are when Alice encounters the Cheshire Cat. He is very witty, and adds something special to the story. Also his grin is phenomonal.I think the theme of this book is really about using your imagination and letting your creative side get the best of you once in a while, not letting other things like television and the media do the imagining for you. That's also why the movie is totally hypocritical.The whole point of the book is using your imagination, and the \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" movie did the opposite of that. Despite it being created by the godfather of the animated film industry (Disney) it really sucked. They took out too much of the story just to squeeze it into 1 and a half hours and a G-rating. \\"Alice's Adventures In Wonderland\\" wasn't made for the big screen, considering its length and semi-annoying characters that if animated and given the life of Disney turn them into monsters that are enough to make even the most devout Catholic contemplate suicide. And the songs! Don't even get me started on those. Disney has to pump every movie it pushes out full of annoying constant 5-minute \\"songs\\" that give you ear worms for a month! They ruin everything they get their greasy little fingers on. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland used to be original and interesting and Disney went ahead, squeezed out all the creativity, shoved some songs into it, stamped their trademark on it, and shipped it out. They are sick, sick little people.Most of this book is quite entertaining, though there are a few parts that just seem stuck in there and were quite dull. \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" is a very original and interesting story, and if you've never read the book, do so. It is entirely worth it. If you haven't seen the movie, stay far, far away. For those of you who have, good luck with the nightmares. And those monstrous ear worms.-carli"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"Find some children anywhere you can and read this book to them! I say this for your pleasure at least as much as theirs. Reading it out loud will be one of the delightful experiences of your life. Did I say \\"reading?\\" I should have said \\"performing,\\" because you will not be able to resist acting it out. Let yourself go--you will be a child again, yet still appreciate the book's adult insights.There is so much to say about this classic. It captures the psychology of a girl on the verge of growing up; it is full of jokes that appear absurd, but are fiendishly clever; it somehow avoids anything old-fashioned or politically incorrect; and absolutely all the characters are loveable, no matter how hard they try not to be.Carroll was an unhappy, aging man, yet he understood children to a spooky degree. While I smiled mildly at some of the humor, my children rolled around on the floor laughing.Here is an interesting phenomenon: When I read it as a child, I didn't particularly warm to it. When my children tried to read it on their own, they gave up. But the group experience of reading it out loud was a joy for all.Do I need to describe the plot? Could I if I tried? Alice may or may not be dreaming when she follows a rabbit down into his hole and enters a world where the simplest actions are strange and complicated. In her effort to explore this world and ultimately return home, nothing fits right, nothing seems to follow through properly, and no one she meets is sane. Alice, though a little girl, is given plenty of opportunities to be the rational, mature, assertive person of action.Everyone I discuss this book with, and I mean everyone, shudders and raises the issue of Carroll's alleged improprieties. They are invisible in the book, but to put your mind at ease, you may want to check out the judicious biography by Morton N. Cohen.The particular edition of Alice in Wonderland that I am reviewing, published by Grosset, is especially pleasant for reading out loud, with comfortable print, and Tenniel's essential illustrations."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"When I was younger, I watched the Disney version of this book and was left absolutely horrified by what I had seen. I was about four years old and the constant visions of strange and horrid looking creatures flashing on the screen made me want to leave the room. Because of this, I was not so sure how much I wanted to read this story. Actually, even now, I'm not all together convinced that I really like this story. I feel that it is somewhat sacrilegious to say so but I just don't enjoy this story all that much. As read through the first few pages I could still see the strange and haunting images from the twisted children's movie. Maybe that's what has ruined this tale for me, but I do sincerely feel that it is more than that. When I am reading, I begin to feel hopeless, lost and somewhat confused. I don't really feel happy about saying this since I'm a high school boy, but I feel that you should know how strange the concepts are in this book. Honestly, I must say that reading this book made me feel as though I were on a drug trip. This book has the strangest and most disturbing elements such as drinks that reduce your size and cakes that re-enlarge you. Not to mention that creepy, talking cat in the tree, the Cheshire Cat.From a thematic point of view, I suppose you could say that one theme from this story is the frustrations that come with the loss of one's childhood. What I mean by this is that when a person gets older, they encounter physical changes that radically change they way that a child views the world and may even frustrate them. Across the entirety of Alice's adventures, she runs into a series of absolutely ridiculous changes. While these changes are much more absurd than real changes we incur growing up, they cause Alice to become traumatized, frustrated, and even change her perspective of the world. Although she is forced to go through these changes, she continues to struggle to maintain a comfortable physical size. In chapter one, she tries to follow a rabbit into a garden and is unable to fit through the entrance because she is too large. She takes a drink that shrinks her to the appropriate size but then realizes that she left the key to the entrance on the above table. She then eats a cake that grows her to the size at which she can retrieve the key but is then once again too large to enter the garden, which is very frustrating to her. Again in chapter five, she looses control over her physical build and gets an irregularly long neck.As for the characters in this book, I find all of them one hundred percent unbelievable and terrifying. The characters are all introduced abruptly and are completely beyond reason. For example, the Mad Hatter and his fellow creatures are constantly making insane remarks about class and the state of things. There is also a strange creature named the Cheshire Cat who is unaffected by all that goes on in Wonderland and merely observes all that goes on, somewhat like a stocker.This story is told through the perspective of a narrative view through Alice's eyes and conclusions of the new world she has entered. This view gives a good perspective of how crazy the world can be. I mean, Wonderland may seem like and absolutely mashed land of turmoil but through the eyes of Wonderland, Alice is absolutely mad. I suppose this could be compared with the difference in views in today's society and other countries.Again, I must say that I don't really like this book personally simply because it disturbs me so much, but I would still recommend it to others as they may not feel the same way. It really is a well written story, even if I don't like the general plot. I give this book a three out of five star rating."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"This is about the font size, NOT the content.

I could read it many more times because the author paints a vivid picture in your mind that places you in Wonderland along with all of the delightful characters including Alice. The description in the book starts out strong and ends up even stronger. The author's ability to describe both the characters and the setting is amazing.I could just imagine being at the tea party with Alice or pondering whether or not i should drink out of the little bottle labeled drink me. The book takes place with Alice being bored out of her mind which most kids can relate to. Then, her curiosity about a little white rabbit with a pocket watch gets her in trouble when she ends up in a whole other world of queens, kings, talking animals and insane people.All of the characters are interesting and humorous, but often make you frustrated along with Alice because of their crazy antics and utter annoyance. This book is a classic that everyone should read at one point in their life whether they are young or old. This is a story that will surely be remembered . It beats the Disney movie by far. (The movie leaves out alot of the best parts.)I suggest you pick up a copy. It is definitely worth it."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"Alice in Wonderland is a classic that all young spirited people should read. It has adventure, love, fantasy, and a lot of fantastic nonsense. Every page is exciting and mysterious with a bewildering twist. Lewis Carrol exceeds on making a childerns story into a fantastic novel for all ages. He has great imagination that he uses in his puns, riddles, and characters to make nonsense into complete thoughts and morals. Alice is a creative little girl who seems to find adventure around every corner. Everybody in Wonderland is just as creative as Alice; they all seem to be intelligent and fully spirited. This novel is something no one wants to pass by. Personally, I suggest this book becomes a classic everyone should have to read. Many things in this book capture a moment, like this qoute,&quot;The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the Hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice. &quot;Who are you?&quot; said the Caterpillar. This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly, &quot;I-I hardly know, sir, just at present - at least I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times sice then.&quot; Another quote that stood out and will help choose this as your next book to read is from the cat. &quot;In that directoin,&quot; The Cat said, waving its paw around, &quot;lives a Hatter: and THAT direction,&quot; waving the other paw, &quot;lives teh March Hare. Visit either you like: They're both mad.&quot; &quot;But I dont want to go amoung mad people,&quot; Alice replied. &quot;oh, you can't help that,&quot; said the Cat.&quot;we're all mad here. I am mad, You are mad.&quot;"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"One gets very bored for something good to read. This book is certainly not just for children and better than the bible."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"The book Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll was a creative trip into the world of dreams. Lewis Carroll is most famous as an author, particularly for writing Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. He was also a mathematician, Angelical deacon, and photographer. Carroll originally created the story for Alice Liddell, a child he befriended while he was a deacon at a local church. She loved the tale and asked him to write the story down on paper. At first he hesitated. Two years later, Carroll agreed, and the classic story was born. Carroll's main goal for writing the book was to get children interested in reading.Lewis Carroll was actually a pen name for Charles Lutwidge Dodgson. His work was mostly considered to be literary nonsense, and Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a classic example. Many people, ranging in all ages, have enjoyed Carroll's fantasy and word play writings. Carroll's way of writing has influenced many authors all over the world.Although Carroll's writings are very creative and imaginative, Carroll wrote a book with too many hidden meanings in it. For instance, the references to drug use are too prevalent. The first run-in Alice has with drugs is with the caterpillar. She stumbles across him sitting on a mushroom. He is smoking hookah and blowing rings of smoke toward Alice. Shortly after Alice leaves the caterpillar, she meets the Mad Hatter. He was a hatter, which means that he would inhale some of the mercury fumes that were used to cure felt in some of his hats. Mercury poisoning results in brain damage and confused speech. The last drug reference occurs when Alice eats and drinks the substances that make her grow or shrink. Alice did not know what she was consuming. She ate and drank it anyway and she ended up growing or shrinking. Carroll intended that children read the book. He might have sent the wrong messages. Children might think that Alice has fun eating and drinking mysterious substances and they would too. Also, Carroll actually wrote a very complicated book that most young children probably could not understand. He used a lot of literary techniques like reversals, puns, and mirror writings. These could easily be overlooked and misunderstood by children.Lewis Carroll tried to write the book from Alice Liddell's point of view to make reading enjoyable for children. He wanted to prove that children could have thoughts that were as complicated as or more complicated than adults. If the reader will not try to dissect the meaning of each word and wants to feel like a child again, then this book would be a good choice."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"My nephew loved this book and had me read it to him. I always saw the movies but this was the first I actually read the book. I thought it quite better than any of the movies.

The characters created be Lewis Carroll are fantastic, you can see people of all shapes and sizes. You can see many people such as the King and Queen of Hearts and the Duchess, but mostly you see many creatures roaming around. There is the white rabbit who wears a waist coat, or the caterpillar who sits on a mushroom, or the beloved Cheshire Cat: a cat who causes mischief wherever he goes, he also has the talent of dissapearing and reapearing.

But that is not the case here. The Disney movie version is based on a combination of both books. I think this is important to mention, as it will hardly be like the movie version we all know.I love the movie (both the 1951 Disney classic and the new Tim Burton version) and figured I would love the book as well, but this book screwed with me. I have always had a vivid imagination, but never non-sensical imagination. That is exactly what Mr. Carroll had when he wrote this book. The book does, however, contain many of the beloved movie characters- the caterpillar, the white rabbit, Queen of Hearts, Mad Hatter, Dormouse, and of course, the Cheshire cat.Overall, the two stories amused me and kept me entertained, but I would not read them again.

Alice was getting tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, when the White rabbit with pink eye's runs by saying \\"Oh Dear! Oh Dear!

I have always heard about all the underlying and hidden things within the story but I guess I am a surface reader. Either that or all of the underlying things were topical and with the book being written in the late 1800's most of those things would have been lost on me.The Good: It was an easy read the characters were quite unusual and Carroll definitely had an imagination.The Bad: besides my thinking it was going to be better than it was not much. It was somewhat confusing at times.Overall it was an Ok read however with all the hype and rumored greatness surrounding the story I was slightly disappointed.Through the looking Glass. The less known second story about Alice is which she enters a looking glass (Mirror) world where you must move in the opposite direction to get where you desire to go. The world is divided into a grid like a checkers or chess board with the ultimate goal is to make it to opposite side of the board and to become a queen.The Good: Same as the first, lots of imagination and unique characters.The Bad: not too much, like the firs it was a little confusing at times.It was Similar to the first with regard of craziness and characters however slightly inferior to the first."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"Alice's AdventureMy first impressions of this book were that it was like reading C.S.

With the bossy, dominant Red Queen and the quiet, kind, messy white queen, the book is a study in contrasts.The interweaving of the Nursery Rhyme Characters and the frequent fish poetry references does provide more continuity and a sense of sequential events than Alice's first adventure.

I realize that may be the author's intention, but it left me searching for meaning where there was none. Everyone is mad in wonderland, or they wouldn't be there. It's hard to call it an adventure, since nothing really happens. The characters are all mean, and at times unlikable. I get the pun, I can see the satire, but I just didn't find it funny. I have two daughter's who are 4 and 5, and I tried reading it to them as well to see if it might be a generational thing, but since most of the book is a play on words, they did not understand it, and they did not like it any better. I'm sorry. I'll admit Carroll has quite an imagination, and created quite a unique world, but he didn't do anything with it. I feel bad for having seen Disney's classic animation adaptation of this story first, and for hoping to gain some added insight by reading the actual book, but there is nothing more here to be gained.

My teacher said it would be a great one to read. If it wasn't so confusing, it would be a great book for younger children. I really didn't enjoy it though, because the lot seemed a little too young for me. Anyone over the age of twelve, might not be interested in it. Don't get me wrong, Because it did have some exciting parts in it though, like when Alice first entered the wonderland. Everything was like a fairy tale with talking rabbits and shrinking/growing juice. Alice would walk into a room, drink the juice, and if she was small, she'd grow into a giant, and if she was a giant, she'd shrink. It gets pretty confusing. On her adventure, she walks through a series of rooms and can't find her way out. Will she ever make it out? Read the boook to find out."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"\\"Alice in Wonderland\\" was required reading for one of my present classes, if this had not been the case, I'm certain I would not have finished it for the sake of enjoyment. I admit this story has good points as well as bad; it would not have survived nearly so long if it did not. In my opinion, however, the good did not outweigh the bad.One of the strong points of this story is familiarity; the vast majority of us have had some experience with this book, usually as a child; we have heard the story, read a condensed version or seen a film or television portrayal. We have seen little girls dress up like Alice on Halloween; and who doesn't personally know The White Rabbit, The Cheshire Cat or the Queen of Hearts? Perhaps there's a degree of nostalgia that comes from revisiting these old childhood friends.In addition to being familiar, this story also has the charming quality of feeling as if it had been pulled directly out of a child's imagination. By that, I mean it doesn't follow the rules that have been set up by adults, either scientific or social. So, if you fall down a well shaft in Wonderland, not only are you likely to live, you may also be able to examine the trinkets placed on the shelves, perhaps even get in a few winks as you fall.In this book, nothing is what it seems (unless you are familiar enough with the story); a baby may mutate into a pig and run off snorting; a couple of card soldiers may spend an afternoon painting white roses red in order to avoid losing their heads, this is all perfectly normal in Wonderland. Perhaps it is even this strange quality that has made this story so popular. It wasn't enough for me however, to make up for what it lacks. This book didn't move along purposefully enough for me to enjoy it or care what happened next. It also had a strange dream-like quality and I don't mean surreal or day-dreamy. It was dream-like because it was a jumble of random scenes that didn't really interrelate. We often fill in the gaps when we retell our dreams so in that they make sense to us and frankly so that they are worth telling to someone else. This is the impression that I had of Alice in Wonderland; unstructured and random. The only real goal of the main character was to follow the white rabbit and even that failed as a motive fifty percent of the time. Alice is simply moved haphazardly through a sequence of strange encounters and then wakes up. Because of this, I didn't feel anticipation, I didn't hope for anything, and I didn't have any sense of closure when the story ended; which are the elements that I feel make a story worth reading."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"The stories in this book are familiar to most, but are incredible to read nonetheless.

It was silly, but for a time, it progressed. Alice was trying to get into the garden and was exploring the nonsense world as she went along.Through the Looking Glass was different. I had a hard time reading it. I didn't find it entertaining. The pieces made no sense together, and the goal of becoming a queen by making it to the eighth square seemed an afterthought.

The book allows the reader to enter into Alice's mind and travel along with her through the worderful and mysterious Wonderland. Alice is a curious and questioning little girl traversing a land where nonsense is the common-sense, where right is wrong and where wrong is not always right (but can be sometimes!). This causes a surprise in every page you turn. The characters Alice meets usually produce the most unexpected replies which always leave Alice and the reader in a troubled state-of-mind. However amazing it can be, we are sometimes a little puzzled by noticing there is some logic in the nonsense world of Wonderland and I personally think this is the true beauty of the book. Moreover, all this is presented by the most unusual characters in a rich text, often mixing prose and verse and sometimes toying with typography in a e. e. cummings-like nature, which makes the book quite unique."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Throught the Looking Glass","review":"The book Alice in wonderland starts when Alice finds a white rabbit.

His descriptions and evaluations were right on the money. As a critical history buff, I was pleasantly surprised to find no faults or criticisms of Mr. Davis' work. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in historical jurisprudence. Things might have changed in \\"crime detection/investigation\\" but in the courtroom? not so much."},{"Title":"A Vast Amount of Trouble: A History of the Spring Creek Raid","review":"Wyoming looms large for me, and I've alluded to a recent film about Wyoming \\"cowboys\\" in other reviews. Attorney John Davis, from somewhere in the Big Horn Basin, discusses events of 2 April 1909 that put the cowboy canard in its place. Those movie cowboys aren't cowboys because they're all hat and no cattle. They're sheepherders. So were Joe Allemand, shot to death on 2 April 1909, and Joe Enge, murdered and burned in his sheep wagon on Spring Creek.Spring Creek was the last big battle of the western sheep wars, writes Mr. Davis, and was the first (only) Wyoming raid in which killers of sheepherders were convicted of murder. The murderers of Allemand, Emge, and another herder, burned to death with Emge in his wagon, were real cowboys acting out a drama that was a tragedy of the commons. Much of Wyoming even in 1909 was unfenced open range to which cattlemen claimed rights of preemption. Sheep and their crazy herders (cowboys debated overwhelming questions: Were men already crazy before they herded sheep, or were they made crazy by the sheep they herded?) were latecomers who competed for grass and water in a dry state. Sheep wrecked the range for cattle, eating grass down to the ground and then eating the ground. Then they'd bleat and excrete, wrecking water holes. In the Big Horn Basin commons, cattlemen and cowboys tolerated sheep and sheepherders as long as they knew their place. Where there were no fences, cattlemen helpfully drew deadlines, invisible lines in the sand beyond which sheep were not allowed to cross. Allemand and Emge crossed the line.Allemand was foreign. Some accounts say he was Baszue; Davis writes that he was French. Allemand was an alien in an occupation dominated by Mexicans and Basques whose lives had been cheap. Mr. Allemand, though, was liked and respected by his neighbors despite being from somewhere else and despite sheep. Nobody wrote that he was crazy. Emge was foreign, but had been respected because he had been a cattleman before going to the dark side, sheep. He did not know his place. He kept his bovine arrogance despite turning to a disreputable occupation, sheep, and he openly disrespected his old cowboy cronies and their deadline. Emge, of course, represented something new under the hot Wyoming sun: old certitudes were dying. Wyoming, as territory and state, had run cattle and had been run by cattle. But Wyoming in the new 20th Century was born again; by 1909 Wyoming sheep were worth more than Wyoming cattle, and even founding fathers like cattle kings F.E. Warren & J.M. Carey were changing with the times. By 1909 cattle kings were running sheep.That's the context of the story Mr. Davis tells. It's the story of an insular area, almost inbred, that was almost ripped apart by the aftermath of an atavistic raid. Davis excerpts Grand Jury transcripts that show communities and neighbors being pushed and pulled by the old and the new. He tells a story far more interesting than the fey fable that was nominated today for eight Academy Awards."},{"Title":"Flash Hacks: 100 Industrial-Strength Tips & Tools","review":"Have you seen the Hacks series from O'Reilly? Great stuff! I've yet to be disappointed with this series. While most of the information does not really qualify as a hack in the traditional sense, meaning you are not mucking with the actual API or backed of the tool, the books are chock-full of little workarounds, fresh attacks on old problems, and some incredible tips that most users won't have found on their own.Sham Bhangal delivers 100 excellent tips on using Flash MX 2004 and Professional. I think my absolute favourite is Hack #61, Amit's Dials. This little gem shows how to create some interactive controls for tweaking visual and dynamic effects during the authoring process. The idea is to build the basic functionality of your effect through scripting, add these controls so you can fine-tune the effect, and copy the settings back into the script for permanent hardwiring. There are tons of uses for this tip alone, and it's not complicated. The beauty of this hack is in the fact that it's something most, if not every, designer and developer should know about, but very few use. The time and frustration savings are immense.But the book is overflowing with things like this. Tips on optimizing and working within performance constraints; deciding when to use math versus traditional animation; caveats and gotchas and hidden bits of wisdom... It's in here! How about adding speech synthesis to your Flash application? Need an autocomplete function for a text field? How about tapping into some undocumented ActionScript? Well, keep reading - you'll find all of that in Sham's book.The greatest value of Flash Hacks is the insight from someone who has been with Flash for a long time. Bhangal identifies both common and unusual circumstances that designers and developers might encounter, and provides not only great solutions, but good explanations on why a problem exists and the logic behind coming up with an answer. After working through a few of the hacks, you begin to see Flash in a new light, and new problems or challenges are not quite so daunting. A little perspective shift, maybe step outside of Flash for a bit, and you have a whole new toolbox at your disposal.Structurally, the Hacks books are similar to the Cookbook series, also by O'Reilly. However, the intent is a bit different in that the information tends to be much more flexible and covers a wider variety of challenges. The hacks are numbered and grouped logically, and the index makes a good attempt at referencing not only the hack titles, but some identifying keywords that are more generic, thus more likely to be looked up. Of course, we'd all like an index that pretty much includes every word in the main text, but I digress... SmileSham's language is easy to follow, though there are some leaps of faith here and there. Some of the descriptions assume a higher level of familiarity with either ActionScript or web architecture in general, but this shouldn't be much of a problem for anyone who is paying attention. The hacks are appreciably short and compact, while still getting the major points across. This is a good book to thumb through from time to time if you need a little inspiration or want something new to work on. Each hack shouldn't take long to build, and most of the code is available in the companion web site. But don't make the mistake of just cutting pasting code in - the point of this book is to get you working better, creating things on your own, and expanding your approach to Flash.That all being said, I can't really identify any deficiencies in this book. I'm not sure this book is for everyone, though. Many people are happy with the skills they already have, and enjoy trying to hammer out solutions on their own. Others may just need some bare essentials in coding and design. This book is really aimed at people who are comfortable with Flash, learn by doing, and are interested in tinkering at the fringes of their own capabilities. While Flash Hacks is not necessarily a cutting edge technique book, it's excellent for intermediate to advanced developers who are looking for new approaches. It encourages deeper exploration on both design and coding fronts.If you are looking to add a few new tricks to your bag, and maybe get a fresh perspective on some old thoughts, grab yourself a copy of Flash Hacks. Most useful for intermediate to advanced Flash users, but not out of the realm for some eager novices."},{"Title":"Flash Hacks: 100 Industrial-Strength Tips & Tools","review":"This is a member of the Hacks series published by O'Reilly, a seriesof books noted for their ability to answer the perennial \\"gee, I wishI could...\\" problem. (though for most people this would be phrased agood deal less politely. At least it was for me when I was learning Flash)This book is no exception. I have beenusing Flash myself since about version 4 and while I don't spend allmy time with it, I have developed a talent for finding hidden featuresand methods in a variety of platforms and programs, and still I wasimpressed by a number of the techniques outlined in this book. Thereare some which I have, as yet, not really found a use for, but thereare a few that have answered some of the lingering questions aboutthings that I have always found very silly about Flash.The book covers Flash MX 2004, though many of the features are notlimited to that version, and where they are the author has made thisvery clear, in fact the author has kindly translated some of the codeexamples to earlier versions of actionscript where necessary and/orpossible, (well, flash 6 anyway.) The organization of the book isalso a point in its favor as a reference work for the \\"alternativelytrained\\" professional. Where many manuals and instruction books arearranged by tool, this book is organized by result. This is a boon tothose of us who, having a problem with (for example,) sound, will gothrough the manual for all the elements to do with sound functions,only to find that the bit that we needed is covered under UI. Thereare also workflow tips, neat tricks, performance enhancers, Flash bugworkarounds, undocumented features, and even tips about how to preventopportunistic theft of your flash content.There is not room to cover all of the 100 hacks available to you, andeven the range of the chapters is quite extensive. Nor does it makemuch sense to cover all of it in a linear way, as this is probably nothow you will read this either. When I first picked up the book, Iwent down the table of contents and spent the next couple of minutesrifling back and forth through the book going \\"Aha!\\" and \\"ohhh...\\"This of course makes covering the book in a general way something of aheadache. For me, some of the most interesting tips were thosedevoted to the animation part of the workflow. Despite being formallytrained as an animator, my introduction to Flash was primarily fromthe coding direction. As a result, Hack #74, External Script Editorswas of only passing interest to me as I stopped using the internalscript editor long ago. Hack #62, Right and Middle Mouse Buttons,well, I use a Macintosh, and tend to regard other mouse buttons withsome suspicion (or at least scorn.)All of Chapter 9, Performance and Optimization, however, should berequired reading for all Flash developers. Most of us will know somefraction of the tips here, but will benefit immeasurably from havingread the other one or two that we did not previously know, or payattention to.Chapter 5 is probably best approached in the spirit of \\"that's prettyneat, but...\\" as there is little reason to include a 3D Engine in aflash movie other than to be able to say that you could do it. Thebasic physics parts, however, can lend a bit of extra 'oomph' to aninterface.Amongst the Hacks in chapter 3, there are several related bits abouthow to make repeating tiles that can be programatically spread (and varied)across a field. Interestingly, Hack 18 contains nothing about Flash at all,and is simply a breakdown of the method of making repeated tileseasily. I don't know why, but I find that kind of digressionrefreshing.Some of the hacks are improvements or refinements of earlier hacks.One of the animation hacks outlines the method of using overlappingloops of sequences that have a prime number of frames to simulate nonrepeating motion, that the author incidentally describes as being one of his firstattempts at this sort of thing. This hack is immediately followed bya method describing how to get the \\"Matrix\\" effect of falling numbersby using single frame movie clips and a script.All in all, this is a very good book to have as a reference. One goodread through and you will say to yourself at least a couple of times,\\"Why have I not been doing it that way all along?\\" Later on you willfind yourself remembering that \\"other\\" trick and go back to the bookand look again. Since first reading it I have convinced my company topurchase it as an office reference, and I would recommend it to anyoneelse, both the beginner, (to save yourself the trouble,) and the pro (ditto)"},{"Title":"Flash Hacks: 100 Industrial-Strength Tips & Tools","review":"Flash is to making web multimedia as Photoshop is to editing static graphics. And like Photoshop, Flash has a devoted coterie who swear by it. But even such fans may find new, nifty things in this book. One might even suggest that such a group is the audience that might benefit the most.So I started thumbing through the book, to see what caught my eye. [Obviously, your needs will differ.] One method was the construction of a speech synthesiser. Bhangel gives a simple, ingenious way to make a poor man's synthesiser. The sound quality does not match that of commercial synthesisers, like IBM's or Dragon's. But there is a homebrew ambience to this hack that some will find attractive.A related hack uses a recent improvement to Flash. Finally, there is a way for the end of the playing of a sound to invoke a callback. In other words, you can now synchronise another operation to start after the sound ends. The lack of this has greatly hampered the interactive use of sound in Flash. The author then gives a hack of a lip synching animation. Cute!"},{"Title":"Flash Hacks: 100 Industrial-Strength Tips & Tools","review":"The art of making a great Flash movie is all about taking a restricted set of graphics tools and using tricks to make it look as if amazing things are happening. And about finding a way to do that in a small movie that loads quickly. This is no easy feat and it boils down to finding innovative solutions. This book comes with one hundred of these innovative solutions. And if you are a Flash developer it's well worth the money to get these unique techniques wrapped up in this tight form.

The \\"get-to-the-point\\" style of the Hacks series is also very useful when you have a deadline fast approaching. There are 100 \\"hacks\\" in this book that, for the most part, are projects that can be used in your everyday Flash development.First the bad news:BWhile this book is full of great project that touch the surface of most problems, I found that the book could have used more in-depth examples. I also wanted a full chapter on Flash Components, which was not really covered at all. Flash is now the goto format for Rich Internet Applications because of the player market penetration, and with the need to regularly utilize components, it would have been nice to seem more information on the subject.Now for the good news:I choose this book mainly for the Sound and Browser Integration chapters, but I was pleasantly suprised to find more than a handful of topics that helped me develop better applications. I especially liked the chapter on Optimization along with the Color Effects chapter. Both of these chapters provided tid-bits of information that were directly related to a few projects I was working on.Conclusion:While there is room for improvement, I would highly recommend this book, or the next version that I assume will be coming out shortly.

It is not just about showing you some interesting hacks, it is about showing you some of the nonobvious techniques and ideas that will make your Flash designs more original and your applications more effective.If you want to get some quick ideas for new directions in your designs, the first four chapters look at the core techniques that affect the look and feel of a site, such as drawing, animation, and effects. Chapter 5, Chapter 6, Chapter 7, and Chapter 8 revolve around media and content, so visit them for inspiration and information pertaining to 3D, text, sound, or UI elements. Chapter 9, Chapter 10, Chapter 11, and Chapter 12 cover specialized topics such as browser integration, optimization, and security plus a healthy dose of ActionScript for good measure. You should peruse them for answers to question like, \\"How do I center the Flash Stage in the browser?\\" or \\"How can I prevent someone from stealing my design?\\"Flash is a versatile authoring tool and consists of a number of separate areas that usually need to be combined to produce the finished effect or piece, so don't take the chapter titles and synopses as anything other than broad headings. For example, many chapters contain some element of animation, and most hacks contain ActionScript because it lets you do some really interesting things. The following is a brief description of the table of contents:Chapter 1, Visual EffectsThis chapter looks at ways you can make your graphic content more interesting by adding various effects and transitions.Chapter 2, Color EffectsThe savvy designer uses color in addition to animation. Color is often overlooked, but this chapter shows how color changes can transform the atmosphere of a piece or add video-like effects, such as fades and wipes.Chapter 3, Drawing and MaskingCombining Flash's graphic animation facilities with ActionScript increases your creative horizons considerably. This chapter shows graphic effects created at both authoring time and runtime. Masking, which underlies many of the graphics tricks and techniques, is also discussed.Chapter 4, AnimationThe hacks in this chapter offer content creation shortcuts for manually drawn animation, plus ways to optimize animation created under ActionScript control.Chapter 5, 3D and PhysicsFlash Player is somewhat underpowered in terms of computational and animation speed. Therefore, processor-intensive applications, such as 3D, are problematic in Flash. Flash doesn't include any native 3D ActionScript commands or 3D hardware support, unlike Macromedia Director which supports the Shockwave 3D format. This chapter provides a number of hacks that bypass Flash's performance limitations to add physics simulations and 3D effects to your repertoire.Chapter 6, TextThis chapter covers ways to store, display, and manipulate text, as well as create animated text effects.Chapter 7, SoundWithout sound, your carefully crafted content will feel flat and uninspired. The main thrust of this chapter is to show hacks that allow you to create sounds for Flash without having to go to a usually very costly off-the-shelf sound source CD-ROM and without having to nurture any music talent. This chapter also looks at a number of issues that can stop Flash sound from working as advertised and which have put off many Flash sound experimenters in the past. A secondary aim is to present a few sound-related hacks that are not normally attempted. These techniques are hacks because they are sound applications that are not mainstream, such as Flash-based spoken word input and output.Chapter 8, User Interface ElementsThis chapter covers hacks related to user interface issues, such as buttons, scrollbars, and mouse input. However, this book is not about interface design but about stretching Flash in ways Macromedia might not have foreseen or intended. Therefore, the hacks in this chapter cover several nonobvious uses of UI elements within Flash. Some of them overcome apparent limitations in the UI facilities provided by Flash. But the first hack shows that UIs are not just for the end user, sometimes they can make development easier, too.Chapter 9, Performance and OptimizationThis chapter includes hacks to keep your filesizes small and your applications speedy. Flash's animation engine isn't the fastest one around because the Flash Player is optimized for a small download size, not for performance. Also, it is designed with web use in mind; therefore, it is optimized for small, low-bandwidth files rather than large, complex animation. In order to maintain its small footprint and ensure maximum compatibility, the Flash Player does not support hardware acceleration. Therefore, performance issues are often paramount for the Flash designer.Chapter 10, ActionScriptAlthough almost every hack in the book includes some ActionScript, this chapter covers ways to get the most out of ActionScript, including undocumented features. ActionScript adds true power to Flash. Without ActionScript, Flash can create only linear animation. With a little ActionScript, you can create basic navigation via clickable buttons and hotspots. Learning more advanced ActionScript techniques gives you access to features such as creating a local shared object also known as a \\"Flash cookie\\". Without ActionScript, you cannot create Flash sites that communicate with the browser, exchange data with server-side applications, or download MP3 files.Chapter 11, Browser IntegrationThis chapter looks at ways of maximizing browser compatibility so you can maximize the audience and enhance their enjoyment of your content. Ironically, part of the world's love-hate relationship with Flash is based on misconceptions. Many web developers and users don't realize the extent to which Flash works with browsers. In this chapter, we'll see how to integrate Flash with standard browser conventions, such as the Back button, which is highlighted in Hack #94, and search engines like Google.Chapter 12, SecurityThis chapter provides a few ways to protect your content and designs, despite the vulnerability of the SWF format.There are 100 total hacks, with an accompanying thermometer. The \\"temperature\\" indicates novice, intermediate, or expert hack."},{"Title":"Flash Hacks: 100 Industrial-Strength Tips & Tools","review":"There are lots of cool effects in this book.

Nothing serious, just messing around, but comfortable with OOP ideas. So, that's where I stand in the learning curve.100 Industrial-Strength Tips does give you a run down of \\"hey, I've seen that\\" effects and interfaces, which is definitely a plus. It gives you a blueprint of all the bits and pieces that you'd want to implement or be able to implement. The problem is many of the tips use code directly in the main timeline (as opposed to classes) which is not very standard for big projects. So, it would make sense to use these tips if you're only going to use 4-5 of them, but probably not if you're going to build a feature rich site that needs lots of functionality.BUT, it's a good place to start.

The story focuses on his experiences and observations of a small group of crack and free-base cocaine users. His prose is devoid of moral undertones and is non-judgemental allowing the reading to form his own opinions and motivations.Crackhouse: Notes from the End of the Line does not sensationalize or exploit the travails of these people in this lifestyle. This book does not shock anywhere near as much as it educates. Mr. Williams does not sugar coat anything, but he refrains from overstating the obvious.Mr. Williams has also included a nice glossary of terms at the end of the book concerning the crackhouse vernacular.I wish the book could have detailed the lives of the inhabitants outside of the actual crackhouse or smoking room with more detail. How were these people contributing to society when they weren't &quot;seeing Scotty&quot; (a phrase that Williams' group would sometimes use when getting high)? Perhaps, this was not the focus that Williams was aiming for.In any case, I strongly recommend this book for anybody with an interest in the ethnology of crack cocaine users. I found the book educational. I look forward to reading more about this subject in the future."},{"Title":"Crackhouse: Notes from the End of the Line","review":"i like this book a lot because it tells you about the \\"crack house\\" which is the title of the book. And it goes into detail with everything and its really sad but it can teach you a lot about it."},{"Title":"Crackhouse: Notes from the End of the Line","review":"This book offers a tremendous behind the scenes look that only a dedicated \\"sociologist\\" would provide. The author took on the audacious project of living intimately with a family of \\"crackheads\\" for a series of months. He takes you through the sex lives, the jargon, and the impulsive behavior of \\"joe user\\" in the Big Apple.If you read Freakonimics, this book will sound very similar to the chapter on the economics of the Crack trade. Here, though, the user is profiled. Williams has chosen a crack-house full of humans whose number one priority in life is to score and get high. For a self-proclaimed glaciologist, Williams is able to remain seemingly non-biased throughout the bulk of the text. Only in the closing chapter do you get a significant amount of opinion and interpretation.However, I do think that Williams is correct in his major interpretive thesis. That is: Many crack users are part of a subversive racially-influenced culture that seeks to avoid the path of the \\"white man\\". Many users share similar upbringings and experiences that lead to an acceptance of a druggie lifestyle. If you are interested in the power of drugs, or just to get a glimpse of alternative American life, I strongly recommend this title."},{"Title":"Crackhouse: Notes from the End of the Line","review":"although is isnt as good as \\"the cocaine kids\\", williams has managed to put a very realistic face on the crack problem killing america. my only real complaint with the book is that it dosent go into the lives of the books subjects enough... it seems more like a short over-view instead of being intensly focused. i did enjoy the read and i will probably re read it again in the future."},{"Title":"Crackhouse: Notes from the End of the Line","review":"This book is pretty much what its title says it is: a book about people in a crackhouse. It's incredibly sad at times, and the characters are depicted in good detail, but the author's dedicated quest to make this book something for everyone and not just for anthropologists sometimes backfires, and the story comes across as oversimplified and dumbed down.I would have liked more about the author's experiences spending time in this crackhouse, and about what sort of moral stance he had to take when he found himself in rooms with young girls trading oral sex for drugs, and that sort of thing. The author's effort to minimize his own presence in the book just makes his character more mysterious, and made me wonder about him: did he try crack? Was he ever tempted by these promiscuous young girls? He raises a lot of questions--and not just about himself--but he gives a lot fewer answers, and doesn't leave the reader with much hope at all for any of the book's human subjects.Maybe that's about right, though."},{"Title":"Crackhouse: Notes from the End of the Line","review":"Since this book was written in 1992 I believe we've discovered more about this drug than he addresses but it still was an interesting look into the lives of crack addicts living in N.Y.C.

Bad memories for me hence the low rating on the book."},{"Title":"The Transformation of European Politics 1763-1848 (Oxford History of Modern Europe)","review":"&quot;The Transformation of European Politics&quot; has become THE standard text on diplomatic affairs of the 1763-1848. Its sweeping theses capture the reader. Where the book runs into trouble is the author's insistence on the culpability of France and Napoleon for the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. According to Schroeder the British and their allies were willing to accept French domination of Western Europe but Napoleon never accepted any limits to his goals and embarked on a campaign of World Conquest. Anything the Brits did to organize coalitions to destroy France was only in response to French aggression, etc. And the Congress of Vienna was the greatest human achievement since man learned to write, despite the fact that it stiffled the development of democracy in Europe. In particular I noticed points where Schroeder selectively uses arguments of older historians, but then fails to use arguments of the same historians which contradict his thesis (Albert Sorel for one). An important work, even if you need to argue against it."},{"Title":"The Transformation of European Politics 1763-1848 (Oxford History of Modern Europe)","review":"This somewhat dense but well written book is the standard work on European international politics in this period. In many ways a fairly traditional diplomatic history, Schroeder provides a detailed and thoughtful narrative of diplomatic manuvering and the political aspects of wars in the period leading up to the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars, the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars themselves, the nature of the post-Napoleonic settlement, and European diplomacy from 1815 to 1848. The Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars are a particular focus; out of 17 chapters, 10 are devoted to the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars.The narrative is detailed and quite readable, though many of the events described are fairly complex. What really distinguishes this book are some of Schroeder's broad interpretations. One important interpretation, which I believe is now accepted generally by historians of this period is that Revolutionary-Napoleonic France would have been accepted by the European state system if not so unremittingly aggressive. Other themes pursued throughout the book are the particular difficulties of the Austrian empire and the emergence of Britain and Russia as geographically peripheral but hegemonic powers. Schroeder's most important interpretation, however, is his argument, reflected in the title, about the metamorphosis of the European state system.Schroeder argues convincingly that the Napoleonic wars produced a decisive and beneficial change in the European state system. The latter is construed quite broadly as it includes the Ottoman empire and there were connections with the USA and even Persia. Schroeder describes the 18th century balance-of-power system as an instrinsically unstable zero-sum that promoted aggression by the major powers and in which smaller states were continual victims. The experience of great conflict, particularly that provoked by Napoleon, produced a distinctly different system in which great powers restrained themselves in potential conflicts that could produce war, territorial borders were generally respected, and the security of weaker states was respected as essential to to providing buffers between larger states. Schroeder makes this argument quite convincingly and points to the relative success of the Congress of Vienna and the relative durability of European peace up to the 1840s as evidence of the strength of the new system. As a corollary, Schroeder argues also that it is incorrect to see the Congress of Vienna settlement as an attempt to turn back the clock and restore the ancien regime.While Schroeder's broad interpretation is convincing, there are some limitations in the nature and presentation of his analysis. Because of the unavoidably complex narrative, there is something of a forest for the trees problem for readers in appreciating the evidence for Schroeder's argument. Perhaps more important, Schroeder's narrative tends to omit what may be some important features that probably contributed to the transformation of the state system. One of the reasons for the change of the state system was that these were different states. Led by the French state, this period sees a considerable increase in state power, including war capacity via conscription. In some states, international politics becomes more entangled in domestic politics, somewhat different from the more dynastic nature of most 18th century states. Readers interested in an interesting overview of the changes in European states resulting from the Napoleonic wars should look up Michael Broers interesting book on this topic."},{"Title":"The Transformation of European Politics 1763-1848 (Oxford History of Modern Europe)","review":"A truly refreshing look into the evolution of European diplomatic history from dynastic politics to cabinet politics to Realpolitik.A refreshing look into Napoleon as a bumbling egomaniac a captain of the art of war in a sea of mediocrity, and an evil empire builder, despotic and neopotic. A pillager, liar, and bungler who was courting disasters in his every endeavours, only to be saved by his more incompetent, moronic adversaries.Schroeder also blasts the system of the balance of power amongst the Great Powers (Britain, Prussia, Russia, Austria, France) as leading to instability, partitions and war, all at the expenses of less powers like Danmark, Poland, Ottoman Empire etc. as each of the Great Powers angled to tilt the balance to its favour."},{"Title":"Negroes in Cities: Residential Segregation and Neighborhood Change","review":"Excerpt from Foreword by Philip M.

The story of George, motorcycle mechanic and grandfather, is told by a number of narrators. The impressions this novel left, are of a time past, looked at through windows covered in sea salt and motorcycle grease. The style of writing is simplistic, quiet; the story, a second hand account of a man's history hidden within secret letters and within the walls of an abandoned shop. Like the facts of George's life, the narrator's identity is also partly buried. Whether or not his name is mentioned, I cannot recall, and this effect of Condon's adds to the mystery: who was the real George and can we really know him when our main narrator carries with him the secret of his own identity?"},{"Title":"Over there;: The story of America's first great overseas crusade,","review":"Over There: The American Experience In World War I by Frank Freidel (Professor of History, Harvard University) presents the sometimes amazing, often horrifying experiences of American soldiers and sailors during World War I, and as told by the servicemen themselves!

Pil Astin's delicate prose pokes and tickles the reader in the intellectually sensitive zones before suggesting a glass of red wine. Afterward, Astin sits the reader down on the fire side sofa and regales the reader with tales of angels, mystical old Russian men in hospitals and beefy Indian chiefs in tight fitting tank tops and leather pants scrubbing hospital floors. Then when the reader is feeling, hot, flustered and ready for anything, Astin's tense, suspenceful plot suddenly jerks the reader off to a whole unexpected conclusion that is both satisfying and unsentimental. The hospital scenes between Giorgi and Chief are some of the most daring and erotic passages in modern literature. On behalf of all angels, Russians, and beefy Native Americans in tight sweat covered tank tops and glossy leather pants, I applaude Pil Astin for his courage and origniality.

I felt that his portrayal of Native American's was as stereotypical and two dimensional as in a John Wayne movie. I drew a small measure of comfort from the fact that no matter how he portrayed my people it was less cliched than his portryal of the Russians in his masterwork. I also couldn't escape the feeling that this author was just another Anglo from the Suburbs who chose us poor &quot;Indians&quot; as his cause of the moment.

At first it appears to be a fairly typical, if better written, fantasy novel, but in it's own way it is original in the ways it subtly challenges the accepted norms of modern fantasy. What most fantasy novels since Tolkien (whose originality I respect) have in common is an idealised perception of feudalism and monarchy (and the pre-industrialised natural world). Baliol goes beyond the good nobles versus bad nobles formula adopted by far too many writer, instead he challenges feudalism itself. His characters are complex, and multi-faceted: from an antagonist who embodies shades of Rasputin, Marx and Marty Feldman, to an idealistic young nobleman who never questions the validity of the political system he enforces...the system that is the basis for his social station. This critique of feudalism is not the core of the book, or at least it will be difficult to determine that until I can locate the sequels. Personally, I find it the most interesting and novel aspect of the book. I have been waiting many years for the sequel but have not seen anything else by this writer. If anyone has any information on the sequel I would be interested in knowing about it."},{"Title":"The Magefire","review":"My favorite novel, ever. I like this book so much, despite its flaws. At first it seems a bit earnest, boy scout-ish. When it first appeared in 1990 it received a bad review in Locus, for, among other things, having characters who were too stupid to be believable. It has about as few female characters as Lord of the Rings. Although it has a central character, he is one of the more shy and retiring members of a group of adventurers dominated by loud, proud types, and he seems almost invisible at times. In fact it is one of the most 'group-minded' books I have come across. (The other central character is a young woman, who grows increasingly important as the book progresses.) The sense of the quest being bigger than any individual, with new members joining as old members died or were forced to drop out, is very inspiring.The landscape and the world depicted is fabulous, feels real. A magic-haunted seacoast, downs modelled on the North Yorkshire Downs, a vast trackless forest like the Siberian taiga, Ice Age-era grasslands, and a swiss-style mountain kingdom. Of the various races, goblins are treating surprisingly sympathetically, whereas the grisly Rievers and Tarintarmen are hated by all life.As the pages turn, the book turns darker, and the scale of the forces stacked against the heroes grows. There is magic, yes; but the evil is primarily a political one, being that the leaders of men are traitorously allying themselves with an ancient and cruel enemy, the prize being greater power and wealth - at the cost of complete mental and moral submission. It seems very unlike most other fantasy (honorable exceptions: the works of Hugh Cook, Ursula Le Guin, Glen Cook, Gene Wolfe, etc etc).The sequel, The Tears of Ginara, was written but never published; Headline cancelled the series. Last I knew the author was living in Scarborough; I haven't been able to contact him in over 10 years. If he reads this - please selfpublish the rest of the series, on Lulu or similar."},{"Title":"Brother to a Dragonfly","review":"If you were raised in the south as I was, have an interest in the civil rights movement, or want to enjoy one of the most irreverent Christian curmudgeons ever to irritate the church, then read Will Campbell (b. 1924). Campbell was born and raised in the rural and very poor deep south of Amite, Mississippi, \\"ordained\\" by family members at a local Baptist church when he was seventeen, and, in a delightfully improbable life, played a central role as an activist and agitator on behalf of African Americans. But to leave it at that would badly misrepresent him.After World War II Campbell studied at Tulane, Wake Forest, and Yale. He served as Director of Religious life at the University of Mississippi (Ole Miss), but left after two years because his controversial views attracted death threats. He then did a stint for the National Council of Churches where he worked with most of the civil rights luminaries. In 1957, Campbell was one of four people who escorted the nine black students who integrated Little Rock's Central High School; and he was the only white person to attend the founding of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference by the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. So, how did he come to sip whiskey with the KKK and get hate mail from the left?Campbell came to distrust all movements and institutions, especially the church (he once referred to television preachers as liars, frauds, and \\"electronic soul molesters\\"). He dismissed all politics as impotent. It was less than Christian, he realized, to agitate for the oppressed but to hate the oppressor. No, one could not preach what Luther called a \\"fictitious grace.\\" God loves the redneck Klansmen as well as the disinherited blacks. For the most part, Brother to a Dragonfly tells the story of Campbell's deep love for his brother Joe, and how the latter's tragic demise to alcohol, drugs, and domestic violence led to his premature death. But it was through Joe and an overtly pagan family friend that Campbell had a conversion later in life. Without realizing it, he recalls, his twenty years of ministry had become one of \\"liberal sophistication. An attempted negation of Jesus, of human engineering, of riding the coattails of Caesar, of playing on his ballpark, by his rules and with his ball, of looking to government to make and verify and authenticate our morality, of worshipping at the shrine of enlightenment and academia, of making an idol of the Supreme Court, a theology of law and order and of not only denying the Faith I professed to hold but my history and my people--the Thomas Colemans [who murdered two civil rights workers]. Loved. And if loved, forgiven. And if forgiven, reconciled.\\" There was all the difference in the world, he realized, between being a \\"doctrinaire social activist,\\" however laudable, and a follower of Jesus. The key? \\"I came to understand the nature of tragedy. And one who understands the nature of tragedy can never take sides.\\"Christian renegade, preacher, author of twenty books and plays, farmer, country musician, friend of Thomas Merton, and agent provocateur, Will Campbell loves a good chew of tobacco and will strike many as enigmatic.

Now that the holidays are approaching, it's still a good give."},{"Title":"Brother to a Dragonfly","review":"I highly admire what I know about Will Campbell, and this book is giving me more incite into the man."},{"Title":"George Hayes of Windsor and his descendants","review":"This is the book for those of you exploring your roots, you may be an off branch of the Hayes Family and if so you will find this book helpful"},{"Title":"A Satchel guide to Europe,","review":"I own the 1924 edition of this guide and have given 3 others as gifts to family members.This guide (I would recommend 1930 editions or earlier) gives an insight into travel in Europe when &quot;Tours&quot; lasted from 3 to several months.

Recommended means of transportation once abroad include walking trails, char-a-banc, trains and the possibility of hiring a motorcar (in certain areas).

The main character in this book is Taran. Its starts out how he lost his pig(white). But that pig started his new, first, scary, dangerous adventure.he meets Eilonwy, Fflam, Gurgi, Gwidon, and his enemy, Achren in the Spiral Castle. I rated this book 5 because, SERIOUSLY, I couldnt stop reading it!I hope my review will be very helpful to you,READ IT!!!"},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"\\"Book of Three\\" kicks off the classic Prydain Chronicles, a six book cycle of stories set in Prydain, \\"where evil is never distant.\\" In the first book, author Lloyd Alexander sprinkles his story with Welsh mythology, then tempers it with humor, action, and a unique coming-of-age story.Taran, the Assistant Pig-Keeper at Caer Dallben, is bored stiff by his duties -- caring for the oracular pig Hen Wen. Though both the crabby enchanter Dallben and the gentle ex-warrior Coll tell Taran that he shouldn't complain, he wants to be a hero. Taran inadvertantly ends up in an adventure when he chases Hen Wen into the woods - only to be chased by a masked, horned man on horseback.Taran is rescued by Gwydion, Prince of Don, who agrees to bring the overeager young man with him to another city to warn them about the Horned King, who is a servant of Arawn Deathlord. But the undead Cauldron-born capture Taran and Gwydion and bring them to Spiral Castle, the home of the enchantress Achren. Achren imprisons Taran; but he is set free by her \\"niece,\\" a flaky-seeming but very sharp girl named Eilonwy. With Gwydion presumed dead, Taran must set out to warn his allies about the growing threat of the Horned King. Going with him is Eilonwy, a pleasant bard-king who frequently stretches the truth, the twiggy and ever-loyal Gurgi, a crabby dwarf, and a very special sword...There are virtually no epic adventures for kids, let alone ones that adults can find absorbing as well. But the Prydain Chronicles definitely fit the category. Even though the action focuses primarily on Taran and his friends, the repercussions and events in them stretch all across Prydain, and Alexander never lets you forget it. And Gwydion's presence gives the feeling that rather than being the pivot of the conflict between good and evil, Taran is one of many cogs in a larger machine.Alexander is at his most versatile in the Prydain Chronicles, varying between a formal \\"ye olde\\" style and then switching to one of the comical arguments between Taran and Eilonwy. Eilonwy and Fflewddur Fflam add humor, with Fflewddur's frequent fibs causing his magical harp strings to break and Eilonwy puncturing Taran's ego when he gets a little too pompous. Yet Alexander includes sinister moments as well as well: The evil Horned King, and the silent, unkillable Cauldron-Born.Taran is an entirely human hero -- he longs for adventure but doesn't know what it's really like, takes himself too seriously, botches things, misjudges others, and has to learn from his mistakes. Eilonwy is a great counterpart, who keeps us from getting bored with Taran and by providing witty commentary on the proceedings. Gurgi initially seems sinister, but shows beginning signs of his steadfast loyalty.Though Lloyd Alexander informs readers that Prydain is NOT Wales, it definitely has the the Horned King, Gwydion, and the sword Dyrnwyn are carefully woven into the plot. But as J.R.R. Tolkien did, Alexander doesn't simply cut-and-paste them from a mythology book. Instead, he makes them essential parts of the story, and thus makes them his own.\\"The Book of Three\\" is not quite the same as its sequels -- it's not quite as grim, and it has a \\"younger\\" feel to the story. But the solid adventure, excellent writing and mythic clash of good and evil make it a good start to a classic series."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"Though J.K. Rowling may be remembered as one of the best fantasy writers to incorporate humor in her stories, she is by no means the first. Nor is Lloyd Alexander, but you will quickly forget this fact when you read his works. Endlessly exciting and amusing, \\"The Book of Three\\" is the first book in the well-known Prydian Chronicles. In it, Taran the Assistant Pig-Keeper yearns for glory and honor as a warrior outside of his tiny province of Caer Dallben. While chasing after his incredible ocular pig, Taran meets with an array of interesting characters and must face the horrible Horned King.People enjoy making lists of \\"What to Read After You've Finished All the Harry Potters\\". This book and its series should top those lists. Alexander (one of the rare all-American fantasy writers) has incorporated Welsh myth with modern storytelling. The result is delightful. I originally read these books when I was ten or so, and though I'd forgotten more than I liked, much of these book stuck with me. Fflewddur Fflam and his breaking harp strings. Gurgi, the creature that is nothing so much as a hungry green Grover Monster from Sesame Street. And the delightful Eilonwy, whose very presence makes Taran even more awkward than usual. Eilonwy is particularly remarkable in that she is more than willing to fight, work hard, and help others without becoming wishy-washy or humorless. It is Eilonwy that clearly points out when Taran has failed to take the feelings of others into account. More interestingly, she is genuinely affectionate towards the awkard hero. As the aforementioned hero, Taran is interesting as well. Unlike some storytime protagonists, this boy is flawed from page one. Hot-headed, impatient, and imperceptive, Taran is only eventually brought to a slow understanding of what it means to be great. I've always enjoyed the fact that while every other character in this book is described from head to toe, Taran is never clearly described. Some have theorized that this is because author Lloyd Alexander wants his hero to be a sort of everyboy that can look like whatsoever the reader wants. Don't let that fool you. Though this series will appeal to boys, girls will adore it as well. While drawing on the same myths and legends of Susan Coopers \\"The Dark Is Rising\\" series and creating magic akin to Ursula Le Guin's \\"Wizard of Earthsea\\", Alexander has created something entirely unique. Appropriate for many many ages. The violence in this series is no worse than anything you'll find on kids t.v. today, and there is no swearing or suggestive behavior (oh la la!). Instead, you've got a pretty darn good piece of work that kids will gravitate towards regardless of gender or age (I can personally vouch for all the 25-year-olds out there)."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"I would just like to start by saying that anyone, no matter what there preferences are, can read Lloyd Alexander. He is brilliant. I first read The Book of Three as a second grader, again as a tenth grader, and it keeps going. The quintilogy (i think I made that up)is universally appealing.The characters are wonderful. They may not have the hidden imagery as some of the Narnia characters, but they do have quite a sense of depth as well. Especially Taran, a truly wonderful hero in his own, pigfarmerish sort of way.Speaking for the rest of the book, it is an intricate fairy tale that will keep the most fickle reader enraptured, and i highly recommend this book to people of all ages."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"This is the 1st of 5 books chronicling the adventures of Taran, Asst Pig Keeper, and his companions. Prydain is very much based on Wales & it's mythology but is not just a rehashing of old stories. There is magic, good-vs-evil, personal growth and all other aspects you might expect but the characters are written with such love and understanding that it's almost impossible not to be drawn into the story.As the first book in the series the focus is on introducing us to the characters and their world. Taran is a young man fretting about his place and longing for glory. His dreams come true more than he might want them to as he becomes entangled in the struggle against a great evil lord who wants to take over Prydain.You will also meet Prince Gwydion, Princess Eilonwy, Gurgi, Coll, Dalben, Archen and many others who you will come to love (or fear). Share in the growth, both physically & emotionally, of Taran as he finds out the hard way that being a hero has more to do with a person's character than in their accomplishments."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"I must say I am another person who sees many simalarities in this book and in Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. I read these books first and then Tolkien's and then I realized how much influence there is in Alexander's books. But then again, what work of fiction these days isn't influenced by Tolkien? This book was really fun and adventurous with great characters. If you liked Tolkien you'll also like these books and notice the fun similarities: the unexperienced yet eager young hero (Frodo/Taran), the mentoring wizard (Gandalf/Dallben), the very heroic and brave prince/king who lives a little on the wild side and always seems to be fighting and getting dirty (Aragorn/Gwydion), the strange half-evil creature that follows everyone around (Gollum/Gurgi), the dark lord who is trying to take over the land with his strange evil servants (Sauron/Arawn), the evil thing created by the dark lord to help him gain power that the hero must get rid of (the ring/the black cauldron), the other not-quite-as-evil-but-still-pretty-bad person that we must take care of in an earlier book so we can focus on the main bad guy later; they live in a tower away from the main bad guy's place (Saruman/Achren), very evil servants of the dark lord that aren't alive anymore but still aren't really dead; they carry out the orders of the dark lord and are hunting the hero (the Nazgul, the cauldron-born), also the plot how the remaining kings of the land must all band together to fight a war against the growing power of the dark lord, and etc. etc. etc. I could carry on for days. In other words, if you liked Tolkien, you'll like Alexander. The only thing Alexander has that Tolkien doesn't have is a feminine hero and also love interest, who is cute and charming no matter how annoying she may get at times. Enjoy! The other books of the Prydain series are just as enchanting."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"The &quot;Book of Three,&quot; and the stories which follow it, are all rightly considered to be classics of their genre. I remember reading them for the first time, I believe it was during my summer vacation between second and third grade, and being totally absorbed. I remember spending hours drawing crayon pictures of all the characters, and hanging them all over the house... Every kid should have that experience.A couple things I just want to point out. If you are a child reading these for the first time, or an adult buying them for a child, please be careful about all the violence in these books. Yes, violence is a part of the world, and it's good to prepare kids to think about it, but... As a parent reading this to your kids, maybe you could offset it a little, with stories about heroic figures who aren't so intent to wield a sword. For example, a good children's version of Plutarch's &quot;Lives&quot; will include a description of Archimedes, the absent-minded professor who was centuries ahead of his time in the physical sciences. Now that's what I call a hero! Or read to them about musicians, maybe. Why not? Fantasy doesn't always have to be about bloody combat.Beyond that, be aware that these stories are based on real legends, and real (or at least POSSIBLY real, at one time) characters (Gwydion, Arawn, etc.) from Celtic-speaking Wales, which today is in the western part of the United Kingdom, AKA Great Britain. In fact, if you whisper the word &quot;Prydain,&quot; and then whisper the word &quot;Britain&quot; you will see that they are the same word. It's true, Prydain was an early way to spell and pronounce what today we call &quot;Britain.&quot; If any kids, or adults are interested, the most important book you should read to follow up on an interest in this body of Celtic mythology is, without question, &quot;The Mabinogion,&quot; which also includes one of the earliest known authentic versions of the King Arthur tales. Or, do a search on Amazon.com for any book called &quot;The Celts.&quot; There are several with that title, and all the ones I've seen are decent introductions to the Celts, including the Celts of Wales (who are called &quot;Welsh,&quot; for any younger fellow Americans who might not know that) and their mythological figures.Anyway, these stories are incredibly cool. Worth owning, without a doubt. Two thumbs up."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"the book was a great book because of the adventure and suspense also liked the book because it never got boring. The book also had a very well drawn out plot. The other reason that i liked this book was because of the extremly good characters and the rolls that they played i also liked the books ocasinial action parts because they were all good and none of them were boring."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"I thought that Lloyd Alexander's book The Book of Three was very good because there were a lot of great battle scenes and duels to the death. Besides the realism and great detail this book has a great cast of characters, including dwarfs, living dead, a hairy creature, and good and evil sorcerers. What really helps to bring this book to life is the great imaginable scenes of castles and wizards on cliffs edge and warm summer meadows with dead bodies and other things spread about them. Besides battle and death though this book includes happy times with great banquets and hard life on a farm. This book is very good although its plot takes a while to develop. I recommend it to those who like books of adventure, battle, betrayal, and good and evil magic. One thing that also makes this such a great book is the evil sorcerers and warlords that use all of their power to overcome the smaller and weaker armies that inhabit the magical land where it all takes place known as Prydain. Although the group, Taran, Flleuder, Gurgey, Ellonwy, Gallyn, and Dolli, is small they seem to have great strength against all of the evil that they may dare go against them or their homes. Teaming together and stop harm from coming to their small home town, Caer Dallben."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"I appreciate the fact that most of the helpful positive reviews reference how much the reviewers loved these books as children. That's great. But, I don't know if those old attachments will help you make a decision now, especially given how many good new fantasy series are available.This volume, (the first of five), is the best of the set. Each succeeding volume becomes less interesting, less inspired, and more routine. They sort of thin out and become much more sketchy. Random and coincidental things just happen, magic weapons just appear, implausible rescues just happen, and so on. Even in fantasy there has to be some internal logic to the action. It seems that the less that is so, the younger the audience for that book. That's why this series really does seem to be at an introductory level.If you are looking for books for an older or more demanding reader, Susan Cooper's \\"Dark is Rising\\" sequence is a more advanced treatment of many of the same Welsh tales, and is written in a much richer and more satisfying manner. Jenny Nimmo's Magician (Emlyn) trilogy does an even better job of reflecting the true Welshness of many of these old tales.Perhaps it is fair to leave it at this: this is a very good and worthy series for introducing a young reader to arthurian/welsh/quest fantasy, but I would move an avid reader on to deeper and more satisfying works as soon as he/she seemed ready and interested."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"I love the entire Prydain Chronicles as I child and look forward to sharing them with my own children.

The characters are simple enough for children to relate to without being overly simplistic (my favorite was the pseudo-bard Flewddur Flam).

I can't really see why there are so many positive reviews. And yes, I've read a great deal of fantasy literature.It moved along nicely for quite some time, and then in the end, bam, deus ex machina, (spoiler alert!) the bad guy explodes and peace is restored. That's about it. And if it had ended on a cliffhanger, leading me into the next book, that would've been just fine. I was expecting that. But it didn't. I can't see taking the trouble to get the next book. Fflam was a good character, and really I don't care much about anyone else in the saga. The main character sort of \\"grows\\" by default, by virtue of wandering through the woods and running away a lot, but I don't really see it. Whatever love story is supposed to be happening, I just don't believe, and there's not much else to keep my interest. Maybe I'll go re-read The Belgariad, or LotR."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"The Book of Three is the first book of the classic children's adventure fantasy The Chronicles of Prydain written by Lloyd Alexander. He drew inspiration from the myths and legends of Wales but he states quite clearly that they are an inspiration for only some parts of the story. The world and its geography are unique as is most of the story and plot elements.The story starts with the boy Taran who is stuck on a farm where he tends the prize pig (who is an oracular pig, meaning she can foresee the future and has special hidden knowledge) and is learning smithy work. We meet him learning to make horseshoes, while yearning to make swords. Like many youths in fantasy, he longs for adventure and excitement. When the pig escapes and he chases after it, he begins the adventure of his dreams, meeting a prince, a bard, a plucky princess and a grumpy dwarf along the way.Readers of The Lord of the Rings will associate some of the characters from The Book of Three with Tolkien's characters (the prince is gruffly attired as Aragorn is when first met and another character is quite similar superficially to Gollum). It was only a minor distraction for me. The characters are well drawn with interesting quirks that are played out throughout the story.Taran grows throughout the story by making many mistakes and seeming mistakes. He is impulsive, not seeing the big picture. The trait is endearing because of his good-heartedness. Even as he thinks he's failed, the goodness in his acts comes back to reward him and other characters in the story.This novel is a great read by itself and seems to be the start of a fine epic. I'm looking forward to the next book, The Black Cauldron.Also, I can't pass up the chance to mention zombies. The bad guy in the story, King Arawn, uses a cauldron to create his army, known as the \\"Cauldron-Born.\\" Check out this description and tell me they aren't zombies!\\"Are they not men?\\" Taran asked.\\"They were, once,\\" replied Gwydion. \\"They are the dead whose bodies Arawn steals from their resting places in the long barrows. It is said he steeps them in a cauldron to give them life again--if it can be called life. Like death, they are forever silent; and their only thought is to bring others to the same bondage.\\"Arawn keeps them as his guards in Annuvin, for their power wanes the longer and farther they be from their master. Yet from time to time Arawn sends certain of them outside Annuvin to perform his most ruthless tasks.\\"These Cauldron-Born are utterly without mercy or pity,\\" Gwydion continued, \\"for Arawn has worked still greater evil upon them. He has destroyed their remembrance of themselves as living men. They have no memory of tears or laughter, of sorrow or loving kindness. Among all Arawn's deeds, this is one of the cruelest.\\" [pp. 34-35]"},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"I recently re-read the book via listening to the audio book and it is just as engaging as the first time. Alexander does a good job of weaving moral and ethical values into a fun action back book. If you haven't read it, give the entire Chronicles of Prydain a try, I'm sure you will enjoy it. :)"},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"The Chronicles of Prydain is a splendid series of five books. The scene is set in the imaginary land of Prydain. The protagonist of this series is Taran. His lifelong goal is to become a hero. Taran has some companions such as Eilonwy, a princess of the Castle of Llyr; Fflewder Fflam a unregistered bard; Gurgi, a kindhearted monster that looks like a pile of twigs, and Lord Gwydion, the son of a Prince of Prydain and warlord. Together, they try to defend Prydain from the forces of evil.My favourite character is Gurgi for he is a very weird monster and speaks in a strange and hilarious language. I wish I could be a friend of Gurgi's. Gurgi usually speaks in rhymes as in \\"crunchings and munchings\\". \\"Crunchings and munchings\\" means that he desperately wants something to eat. I do not only like him because he speaks a strange language but because he is a loving, caring and kind hearted creature.I felt excitement build up in me as I flipped through the pages in the first book. I have never ever felt like that before!! I was inspired by Lloyd Alexander's writing skills. I wish I could be like him. This is the best fantasy series I have ever read in my childhood. In my opinion, the Chronicles of Prydain is a classic and can be enjoyed by both young and old.Rachel-Gayle, 8 years"},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"This book is about Taran, an Assisstant Pig-Keeper who loses a mystical pig who has the answers to everything.

I have to say that this book has brought me back into the fantasy genre, which, I hadn't read in a long time. The sophisticated writing and description of the characters of the magical land of Pryland puts you right in the character's shoes. The Book of Three has a great plot, which mixed with a touch of humor, makes you want to lock yourself up in your room and keep reading until you finish the book. The Book of Three sometimes is a little hard to follow because of the many strange names of the characters. However, the map illustrated in the first page makes everything easier.

I don't want to give to much away, but the whole way through is great. I liked the Black Cauldron alot but it took a little while before the action started. Though Eilonwy ( a princes Taran finds bothers me) all of the other characters were great. I will say that if you are a fiction fan , and really you don't have to be this is a great book to read if you like action read this. To give you a start of how exciting this book is here is just a part of what happens on one the early chapters. Everything seems normal (besides there being a rumor of an evil warrior known as the Great Horned King roaming somewhere in the land of Prydain) then all of a sudden on a town (actually a type of farm) known as Caer Dallben chickens start to fly and all of the animals start getting really nervous over something. Just when all of this is happening Taran, a younger person around the age of seventeen I'd say has to guard an orracular pig named Hen Wen. Well Hen Wen gets nervous and runs into the woods so Taran chases her and gets lost in the woods which he was forbidden to go to, and gets lost, and can't find Hen Wen. Just then he looks up and standing over him is The Great Horned King. The rest you will have to read and don't just read one read book of the series read all of them.

The tale of Taran, the pig keeper, who keeps a magic pig -- Henny? Is and always will be fascinating to me. It has spirit, and it's really funny. The characters are very three dimensional, and since then, I have read everything that Lloys Alexander has written, and none of it has been any less than The Book of Three. P.S. I tell you, when I was five and read that book teh first time, I was scared of the Horned King. I'd say, read this book and you will also become an avid fan of Lloyd Alexander's."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"This book is cool. its got really exciting wars, magic, and lessons to learn. its a great book, and those who like harry potter, and those who wish that magic really did exist and dream of becoming a hero themselves should read this."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"It's the truth. My sister read these books when her English teacher let her borrow them ,and she promptly decided that all people should look them over. For my seventh Christmas, she bought me The Book of Three. I just let it sit on my desk for about a month, but I finaly picked it up and read it. It was above my reading level, but I made it through and needed to have more. The adventures of Taran, Elionwy, Fflewder, Gurgi, Doli, Gwydion and all the others are irresistable to all who read them. Every person I've ever made read these books got hooked and went into considerable depression when they came to an end. I hated reading before this, but every since I finished these marvelous books, I haven't been able to read enough. It teaches that there is glory and joy to be had for all people if they'll just look around. As the books progress, one finds that the reading level increases (much like Harry Potter) and the subjects more mature. It begins woth a simple longing for adventure and adulthood. It then gets into what it truly means to be a hero. It teaches how to let go of someone close to your heart and about what love is. You learn that glory and honor aren't always gained on the battlefield. An old woman weaving cloaks or a farmer caring for his family are as heroic as any soldier. Taran, the protaganist, learnes what it is to be a man and a leader. Elionwy, the young, beautiful enchantress, learns that she has as much courage, strenghth, and intelligence as any man and learns how to be happy. Fflewder, the king who just wants to be a bard, shows us that joy can be found in the simple things, but that one must work to acheive what they wish. He also learns the value of honesty in any situation. Gurgi, the kind-hearted hairy creature, teaches of loyalty, love, and the power of a good deed done. Gwydion serves as an example of what a man should be. The many other characters all have something to teach the reader about life. Everyone should read these books. They are, in my opinion, simply the greatest books a young person can read. I've read them dozens of times (A quick reader can read the whole series in a day) and every time found something magical about them. While Harry Potter, Narnia, The Lord of the Rings, and other great works are all wonderfull reads, all pale in comparison to the place these books hold in readers' hearts. Parents and teachers, have your children read these books, but read them yourselves as well. If you don't like fantasy, I still urge you to take a shot at these. You'll likely change your mind after this. They are timeless classics for all ages and I hope you all come to love these books as I have."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"A friend of my father's brought me a box full of used books when I was 9 or 10. Tucked away in the bottome was The High King, the last in the Prydain Chronicles....it sat for quite awhile in my bookcase before I picked it up and began reading. What an experience it turned out to be! The adventures of Taran (Assistant Pig- Keeper), Eilonwy, Gurgi, Prince Llyr, and all the other charming charaters in their quest to beat the bad Horned King opened my eyes to the wonderful world of fantasy in children's literature. Indeed, after reading the High King I ran out and spent all my allowance (preciously saved) on the rest of the 5-book series.Lloyd Alexander writes with a refreshing and unpretentious stye, neither speaking down to kids nor falling into any of the cliched storylines or dialogue of many writers of fantasy literature. Indeed, I believe many authors of modern adult fantasy would greatly benefit from studying Mr. Alexanders writing style.I credit this series for the beginning of my 25+ years of affection for Celtic, Gaelic, and Welsh mythology and would strongly recommend this series for any lover, young and old, of fantasy and mythology."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"The Book of Three is the wonderful beginning to my favorite fantasy series. There absolutely isn't a flaw in the entire Prydain series, and there is nothing more entertaining than reading them.The Book of Three is the beginning of the story of Taran and his wonderful companions. Here, Taran is a very naive and young Assistant Pig Keeper. He is in charge of keeping Hen Wen, the oracular pig, but Hen Wen sences the danger of the Horned King near and breaks away from Taran. Taran, wanting to ammend his error, begins his quest after her, and that quest leads him to his group of life-long friends and companions (Eilonwy, Fflewdur, Doli, Gurgi, and others). The quest also puts him in great danger from the Horned King, and Taran learns a lot about life and particularly, heroism along the way.Really, I can't say enough about the brilliance of this book and this series. Alexander does what any great writer should; he entertains with an outstanding story, he creates interesting, three-dimensional characters, and the relationships and events these characters experience bring the characters and the reader to a much greater understanding about life. These are wonderful books which anyone can enjoy and learn from."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"Lloyd Alexander's Chronicles of Prydain was my introduction to fantasy books, and it not only broadened my imagination and appreciation for mythology, but it also helped me through the awkward adolescent years as I watched Taran the Assistant Pig-Keeper find his place in the world.I enjoyed Narnia and Middle-Earth, and while Prydain does not compare to the richly developed worlds of Lewis and Tolkien, Lloyd Alexander holds his own by giving the readers memorable characters. In the Book of Three, we not only meet clumsy yet stout-hearted Taran, but also his band of friends -- talkative Princess Eilonwy, devoted Gurgi, and imaginative Fflewdur, to name a few. What I like most about Alexander's characters is that they have their own faults and weaknesses, making them more real and more credible than other figures of fantasy. I think children will be able to relate to Taran, who in this book, is unknowingly thrust into heroism (yes, another archetypal hero). As eager as he is to rise to glory and be a man, he soon realizes that the way is not as easy as it seems.Taran makes mistakes. Okay, he makes A LOT of mistakes. But knowing that he was able to triumph despite of it can become a big inspiration to kids. And just when you think that you know what's going to happen, Alexander slightly veers away from the expected, leaving the reader with a strong dose of reality after the book is over.As the start of a highly-recommended series, The Book of Three is a delight to read -- you'll want to take this little Assistant Pig-Keeper all the way home."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"I read this book about 25 years ago, way back when I was in grade school, but I still remember it.

Taran longs to find the oracular pig, Hen Wen, to kill the legendary Horned King, to get to Caer Dathyl to warn the Sons of Don of the approaching Horned King, and go back to his chamber at Caer Dallben, all in a day's actions. Along with Eilonwy, a bright and talkative young lady, Fflewddur Fflam, a pinnochio-like bard, who has a magic harp instead of nose, and Gurgi, a half-monkey half-human creature who has a big imagination, Taran, Assistant Pig Keeper, fights his way to learn true heroism, and friendship.

For a young reader, it doesn't get any better. I can remember being snuggled up in bed, reading these books until my eyes wouldn't take any more. Every time I read them, I just can't put them down.The Book of Three is only the beginning of the fabulous quest taken by Taran and his Psychic pig, Henwyn.

It is the first of a beautiful series of books which stretch the imagination and take the young reader on a journey where he or she will meet unforgettable characters and have phenomenal adventures.

It was the first fantasy book I've ever read, and I've been hooked ever since. It is a bold, clear writing style that is very accessible to a young reader.I recently re-read the series, and I was hooked as much today as I was 20 years ago. I would liken these to the new Harry Potter series, which hopefully will help hook a new generation of fantasy readers."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"This is one of the gretest books I have read. I don't want to give to much away, but the whole way through is great. I liked the Black Cauldron alot but it took a little while before the action started. Though Eilonwy ( a princes Taran finds bothers me) all of the other characters were great. I will say that if you are a fiction fan , and really you don't have to be this is a great book to read if you like action read this. To give you a start of how exciting this book is here is just a part of what happens on one the early chapters. Everything seems normal (besides there being a rumor of an evil warrior known as the Great Horned King roaming somewhere in the land of Prydain) then all of a sudden on a town (actually a type of farm) known as Caer Dallben chickens start to fly and all of the animals start getting really nervous over something. Just when all of this is happening Taran, a younger person around the age of seventeen I'd say has to guard an orracular pig named Hen Wen. Well Hen Wen gets nervous and runs into the woods so Taran chases her and gets lost in the woods which he was forbidden to go to, and gets lost, and can't find Hen Wen. Just then he looks up and standing over him is The Great Horned King. The rest you will have to read and don't just read one read book of the series read all of them.

Really!

Somehow I managed to avoid reading them, despite being in elementary school in the seventies, and I decided that it's high time I rectified that error. The series begins with The Book of Three, and while it's a little slow to get going, once it gets underway it's quite the ripsnorter.The Book of Three is the story of Taran, assistant pig-keeper of Caer Dallben. Which doesn't sound like all that much, but then Hen Wen, the pig in question, is in fact Prydain's only oracular pig. So when, in the course of a raid, Hen Wen escapes, Taran goes after her, not realizing that what he thinks is going to be a quick trip into the bush to rescue a wayward piece of pork is going to end up being just the beginning of a life-changing journey, complete with battles, princes, demons, witches, dwarves, and many other trappings of fantasy literature.While it's tempting to see all this as derivative these days, remember the state of fantasy literature in the sixties; there was Lord of the Rings, and, well, that was basically it. (High fantasy of this sort had its big renaissance the next decade, and has been going strong ever since.) This isn't derivative, this is what everything else is derivative of, at least those books that aren't slavish in their devotion to Tolkien or actually attempting to blaze their own paths. Still, because it's been done so many times since, it does feel a bit dated these days, but there haven't been that many authors who've done it better; it's still well worth reading all these years later. ***"},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"Very few novels, particularly fantasy novels, succeed in having a truly universal appeal. Most are written specifically for children or teenagers, or they have a wordiness and content level that can only be appreciated by adults. The Book of Three, the first Chronicle of Prydain, is an exception to this rule. Borrowing from Welsh mythology and introducing incredibly interesting characters, Lloyd Alexander crafts a masterwork of fantasy that can appeal to everyone.The Book of Three follows the story of Taran, an assistant pig-keeper who dreams of heroism. As in many fantasy stories, you can expect this lowly farmboy to have a great destiny. The twist here is that Taran quickly discovers that the fairy tale life he seeks is not necessarily all it's cracked up to be. In Taran's journey he meets a babbling princess, a strange furry creature known only as Gurgi, a compulsive lying bard with a hard that forces him to tell the truth, and much more. The characters ar memorable and the setting is well-described without forcing you to learn more history than is needed to tell a good story. While The Book of Three does have the familiar plot of a peasant becoming a hero, Alexander plays with that classic story, changing things up just enough to keep your expectations off balance.One of the best parts about The Book of Three is that it has a defined ending. The Chronicles of Prydain is a five book series. For most fantasy series, that means an ending that is basically just an advertisement for the next book. In this case, you can read the story and get a feeling of satisfaction about the conclusion. However, once you reach the last page you won't want the story to end. Fortunately, The Book of Three is just the gateway into one of the best fantasy series ever written."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"A fantastic introduction to the fantasy genre, especially to children too young for Piers Anthony's Xanth novels, R.A.

After seeing and loving the cartoon, I read the books and loved them even more. It didn't occur to me until I was much older how far the movie really does stray from the books, but I hold both versions near and dear to my heart. I just finished rereading The Book of Three for at least the fourth time, and it's just as marvelous as it was when I was a kid."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"The first book in the \\"Prydain Chronicles\\" is a fun, fast read. Written as an adventure for younger readers, it still has lots of excitement for adults.This series is based upon Welsh mythology, and it weaves an epic tale of heroes, dark lords, evil sorceresses and death hearlds with horns that can sap all the joy out of the world.Tying all this together is an assistant pig-keeper named Taran, who sets out to find his future-telling pig in the woods and ends up in a battle against the champion of the dark lord.This book is a lot like the Narnia books might have been if Lewis had dispensed with all the allegorical material and written a straight up fantasy adventure. That said, it is not without its own power, and there is a real sense of character growth and pathos in the book."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"I read this series when I was little, and I still LOVE it! Well written and a good book all around.. especially if you're trying to get your kids into reading."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"The Chronicles of Prydain were my favorite books when I was a child and it's a joy to reread them with my own children.

The books are not long but they are beautifully written, layered, suspenseful and also humorous. Truly magical. My middle school student read them avidly, and my second grader makes me start reading as soon as he's up for breakfast."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"The first book in the Prydain Chronicles, The Book of Three is a wonderful tale for people of all ages.

It is full of action, adventure and a bit of romance. I would recomend it to anyone who likes to read fantasy."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"I really don't know that I can say anything about these books that hasn't already been said. They are so widely and wildly loved, and that's as it should be. I first read them at twelve, becoming completely enthralled from the moment Taran wants to make a sword and is instead set to work on horseshoes.This is symbolic of a series that, while embracing and, to a degree, exemplifying the traditional fantasy world of quests, princesses, cloaks, swords, and magic, simultaneously rejects it in favour of plain humanity and the simple day-to-day grind of living. And as Taran's boyish dreams of undying glory give way to the very real and thankless task of true heroism, we get something rare and precious in literature: unique, quality children's fantasy.However, I don't believe for a minute that Prydain is only for children. C.S. Lewis spoke of his imagination being baptized by a book. This has happened to me many times throughout my reading life, and it happened with this series. When you love books, you tend to drift through a great many of them which are pleasant, acceptable, nice, or at best enjoyable reads. But every now and then, a book slices through you like lightning, and you see the world differently. Without the Chronicles of Prydain, I would be a very different person today.Please give these books a chance... after all, books that are only fit for children aren't fit for anyone. I love this series even more as a college student than I did as a child. A series that grows with you is something you don't find every day."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"Book of Three - excellent book for all ages. The story has many good twists and turns. Excellent life lessons for all."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"\\"Hen Wen, Come back!\\" Taran cried dashing into the woods to retrieve the oracular pig. The Book of Three by Lloyd Alexander is a magical, fictional tale about a boy named Taran's quest. Taran is an Assistant Pig Keeper, so when his pig Hen Wen runs away, he goes after her. Throughout his journey Taran's mission changes from finding Hen Wen to saving Prydain from the evil King Arawn and the vicious Horned King. Taran has many helpful companions including a poetic and faithful creature named Gurgi. Gurgi is funny and gives the story life. I loved reading this book and I know you will too. Buy a copy and embark on the journey."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"The Book of Three is the first in a series of children's fantasy novels that I find highly entertaining. The Book of Three (like the others in the series) is set up like a fairy tale: there are definable good and bad characters marked by their morality and purposes. It involves heroic battles, adventure, magic, and an array of brilliant characters whose growth underlines the epic portion of the tale.The main characters in this series are extraordinarily original. They play on archetypes of fantasy setting (a princess, a bard, etc.), but, though made to have some of these qualities, are definitely unique and can also be very funny. Like with real people, you sometimes admire them and are sometimes annoyed by them, they make choices that absolutely you want to scream at, and you always root for them. You always want to see good happen to them, and I think that's what makes them most realistic-their quirks are a bit purposefully overdone, but they are realistic solely by the depth of their dreams, strengths, and weaknesses.The storyline is as solid and dependable as the tale's morality; like a fairy tale, the storyline is an adventure story with an underlying lesson to be learned by the main hero.Also, it's interesting to see bits and pieces of mythology woven into the history of Prydain; and even seeing some Biblical refrences makes the world more connected to our own.I am always amazed by Mr. Alexander's writing style, as well. When you read it, it flows marvelously (it is easy for a child to read, and yet entertaining to older audiences, as well) and the literary devices are original. He thinks of ways to describe things that make each landmark and each character trait stick out and stick with you for a long time. He is definitely a remarkable story-teller.This is a wonderful start to what is ultimately a wonderful series. The Book of Three is probably not my favorite in the series, but I enjoy it very much each time I read it."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"The antlered man came charging at me his sword out ready to impale me. I tugged the mysterious sword Dyrnwyn on the hilt and it loosened a small amount. FLASH!! A young kid named Taran was charged with the duty of taking care of the mystical pig Hen Wen. She escapes when the Horned King and his band attacks the small village. Taran runs into the woods after her, but is cut with the blade of one of the warriors and is slowed down. He awakens to see a person next to him who he learns is the King Gwydion. They set off together to find the pig. They fight many people including the Cauldron Born by which they are captured and sent to Achren. She puts them into cells that Taran escapes from with the help of a young girl Eilonwy. The whole castle collapses with Gwydion inside. Taran finds the pig and he along with Fflewddur Fflam and Eilonwy continue on to reach the city of Caer Dathyl. They are caught by a war band from the Horned King. Eilonwy and Taran ride Gwydion's old horse to the sity to warn them but are stopped by the Horned King. They are pitched off the horse and the King approaches them Taran pulls the Dyrnwyn sword and kills the Horned King. This is a good book because it is very suspenseful.At different points in this book Taran gets captured which makes a very suspenseful chapter. At the beginning of the book when all of the animals are frightened and run away, there is a rising sense of suspense because it makes it seem as if the danger is steadily approaching. When Taran, Eilonwy, and Fflam were being chased by the Cauldron Born, they were so close that they could see them. Then the Cauldron Born had to suddenly turn away to return to the Annuvin. They were so close to dieing or even worse punishment, death was less than fifty yards away. The whole story keeps you on your toes because you have no sense of what is going to happen next.The characters in this story are very different than most others. It is not far from the opposite of the Hero scenario. Taran is a little boy who is very immature and has no sense of what is happening. The Hero Gwydion is not there to help him for the last three quarters of the book. The people around him have more of an idea of what is going on than he does. He grew up in an isolated community so he did not know of what had been going on with the war. It makes you want to know what it would feel like to be in his position of no knowledge.This book ends in a very unexpected manner. It is very lucky that Taran did not die when he drew the sword. He was not even supposed to be able to draw the sword even a miniscule amount. It doesn't explain how it's power killed the Horned King. It leaves a mysterious twist on the end that no one would be able to explain.This is a very good book that includes good characters and a very mysterious ending that you would have to read several times to figure out. Christopher Paolini is a author who wrote a very good book that you should definitely read.J Eld"},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"The Book of ThreeBy Lloyd AlexanderThe only thing Taran of Caer Dallben has ever dreamed of is to become a hero. Alas, it is not easy to call an Assistant Pig-Keeper a hero. It is unknown if the gods of the magical land of Prydain answered his prayers, but one day Hen Wen, the oracular pig, flees the small village and Taran sets out to find her. Along the way he meets a princess from a far-off land, a ragged bard-king, a dwarf of the Fair Folk, and many other, warped, evil monstrosities and valorous heroes. This is a book filled with magic, monsters, and great deeds.This story has a very magical and nonstop type style, showing the heroes and heroines in constant trouble of Arawn's armies. Also, it follows an unpredictable path, making the reader believe one thing is going to happen, and then does something else. A very common way of the story is to make the reader believe someone is dead.If you are a believer in myths, like adventures and stories where the main character is put up against something far more deadly than them, then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"The Book of Three is first in a series of five books by Lloyd Alexander that explain the adventures of Taran, a young boy.

If you like that kind of book then you will like The Book of Three. The other four books are as good as the first.The story begins with Taran, the main character, wanting to do something more than making horse-shoes.

There are a lot of mysterious twists and turns to the book.

Although the series is partly inspired by the Welsh mythology of the Mabigonian (for example, the god of the underworld, Arawn of Annuvin, finds his way into the Chronicles of Prydain as the villian), it is much more than just a re-telling of these ancient legends. The hero of the saga is introduced to us in \\"The Book of Three\\" as Taran, an orphan boy raised on a farm by an ancient wizard and a retired warrior, who dreams of adventure beyond his life as \\"Assistant Pig Keeper\\". He finds that adventure, when his pig runs away, and he must team up with the heroic Gwydion, Prince of Don, the talkative Princess Eilonwy, the colorful would-be-bard Fflewddur Fflam, the hungry, hairy Gurgi, and the gruff dwarf Doli, in order to get her back, and rescue her from Arawn's champion the Horned King."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"Lloyd Alexander, as a writer of fantasy, is second only to J.R.R. Tolkien, and his \\"Chronicles of Prydain\\" series is likewise second only to Tolkien's \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" If you haven't yet discovered the magic of Prydain, then maybe you've heard that this is a children's book. Indeed, the brevity of the story and its whimsical nature may support this claim, but I first discovered Prydain at age 21, and was no less enchanted by it than a child might be. Like the other books in the series, \\"The Book of Three\\" contains deep moral messages that resonate powerfully in the world of today. Though one can draw comparisons to Tolkien (that may or may not be entirely coincidental), Alexander's work stands on its own as a triumph of imagiation and heart. It upholds the traditions of the genre, but remains unpredictable. Alexander doesn't pull any punches. Bottom line: if you haven't been to Prydain, it's time for you to pack."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"I was given this book by a friend when I was ten years old. At that time I wasn't a big reader, but I kept the book around. I recently was going through some old boxes and found this book along with the rest of the Prydain Chronicles. I started reading the book thinking it would bore me, being a book for middle readers. But I loved it, and couldnt put it down. I ended up reading the whole series and loved them all. This just shows that you are never to old for a good fairytale. Read this book, its great."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"I have read the Prydain series of books by Lloyd Alexander a number of times. Although the books are targeted to a younger reader, I still enjoy reading them. Reading these books led me to research the Mabinogian stories. I enjoy seeing how the same stories get told and re-told over time to different ages. A good indication of an abiding value to the stories.I've had to reduce the number of books I own due to downsizing and so was delighted to find a Kindle version. Would love to see the price reduced a bit though. I was not able to pick all 5 books as the price is too steep to purchase them all."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"My friend told me about this book and I immediately got my hands on a copy and began reading, and seriously, in less than a few hours, I was checking out the second, third and fourth all at the same time! These books had very great characters, a good storyline, and totally reminded me of some short parts of the Lord of the Rings. I totally recommend this book to any fantasy fan that loves any book, and if you are those type of people who only read short books, that's OK, this book is very small and won't last you a few hours depending on how fast you read. The only downfall I would have to say is, WHY DIDN'T THEY MAKE THESE LONGER?!?!"},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"Meet Taran. Like most of us, he dreams of a more adventurous life. He doesn't want to tend vegetables or make horseshoes but instead dreams of galloping about on horses, flashing swords, and being a hero. Coll, charged with Taran's education, tries to appease him by helping him become something practical: an Assistant Pig-Keeper. This title bestows upon Taran the responsibility of caring for their prophetic pig, Hen-Wen--which, incidentally, has been his responsibility long before he was given the title. At the moment he is arguing that point, Taran notices that the bees are fleeing. Next, the rooster and hens follow the bees. And before he can stop her, Hen Wen has burrowed under the fence of her pen and escaped. In plunging after Hen Wen, Taran is thrust into a battle of good against evil with such abundance of adventure his heart ought to feel content, but instead he is left yearning for the peace of his home Caer Dalben.On his perilous journey, Taran meets Gwydion who saves him from the Horned King. Although Gwydion and a few other adults (including the aforementioned Coll) often seem like one-sided characters, being faithfully good and honorable and wise, they possess enough personality to feel like dear friends by the end of the series. One thing that astounds me about The Prydain Chronicles is how large of an ensemble Alexander not only introduces but makes memorable. While trying to keep up with Gwydion, Taran is assaulted by a wolfhound named Gurgi. The latter's favorite phrases are \\"poor, tender head\\" and \\"crunchings and munchings\\". Although initially Gurgi seems only out to gain food, he proves a faithful companion. As the companions proceed, they're captured by the wicked queen Achren. Taran is rescued again, this time by a girl. Although Eilonwy resemble the liveliest of chatterboxes, she also proves herself a feisty companion. When Achren catches Eilonwy talking to Taran and tries to whip her, she escapes by biting Achren. Although his release wasn't intentional, Fflewddur proves another valiant companion, despite his penchant to embellish the truth. At the moment he stretches the truth, one or more of his harp strings break, adding unforced comical relief to a tale fraught with danger and grief. Much later in their adventures, as troops are being rallied for battle, Taran also meets Doli. He's a dwarf who keeps trying to turn invisible by holding his breath. Everyone in his family has the power but him, which makes him feel like an outcast. Alexander's characters are all ones with whom you'd likely identify and enjoy getting to meet."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"I have only the vaguest memories of reading The Book of Three as a young boy. I remember thinking the names were strange but the adventure was fun. I also remember intending to read the entire The Chronicles of Prydain but getting distracted with something else and never continuing on. So, with both a sense of nostalgia and a desire to discover this classic series, I picked up and jumped into the series.The edition I read included an introduction which very interestingly informed me that a lot of this story is based on Welsh mythology...which peaked my interest and made me read it in a new light.One thing that became quickly apparent as I read was that this book is certainly written to be accessible to a younger audience. The language and interactions are simple and easy to follow as opposed to some of the intensely detailed and convoluted plots and threads often found in weightier fantasy novels.Taran is a fun, headstrong young character who somehow makes it through this adventure seemingly due more to his good luck than due to any overarching skill. The other characters he meets along the way are creative and a lot of fun to get to know. I really loved the distinctive and quirky nature of each of the characters that joins Taran on his quest.Generally speaking, I felt like the simple language and plot helped to strengthen the story by distancing itself from the heavy baggage that is frequently found in the fantasy genre. However, there were a number of elements that I wanted to see developed a little more fully.Most notably in my mind is the titular \\"Book of Three.\\" As I finished reading the book, my son asked me \\"What is the Book of Three.\\" As I explained it's relevance in the story, he asked my why it was the title of the book if it had as little to do with the plot as it does. I wondered that myself as I read and kept expecting the book to make a reappearance further into the story. The title of the novel made me expect the Book of Three to have pivotal impact. Instead, it sat on the periphery more as an educational opportunity for Taran. Other elements also felt a little weakly formed and left me wanting more. I hope and suspect that some of these smaller threads may make larger appearances later in the series.After reading this novel, I feel bad that I gave up on it as a young child. It is a lot of fun and is full of nice adventure with a relatable central character (especially relatable to kids who \\"know everything\\" but feel like they never have a chance to prove it *grin*). If you've never ventured into Prydain, I'd say it's a worthwhile trip. Come into it acknowledging that it's a children's series (and thus not as heavy as Tolkien or other fantasy staples) and you'll find a lighthearted adventure with more depth than you might expect.4 out of 5 stars"},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"{contains spoilers]Book of Three is a wonderful book. It talks about Taran and his journey to find his lost pig Hen Wen. He meets the prince Gwydion and sets off with him to find out what a villain, the Horned King, is up to, and defeat him.Gwydion has a friend named Gurgi and he tells Taran where he saw Hen Wen. Taran loses Gwydion. Taran meets an ally named Eilonwy . They then find a king named Fflewddur Fflam and they become great friends. Taran finds Gurgi again and Gurgi joins the group. They eventually have a big fight with the horned king and rescue Hen Wen. Taran eventually finds Gwydion. They are happy. I recommend this book to people who like books like Harry Potter, Percy Jackson and Artemis Fowl because just like this book they have a lot of action. If you are extremely easily scared in books, I don't recommend it, because you'll get really frightened in many chapters."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"I fell in love with the Chronicles of Prydain many years ago and never forgot them. Lloyd Alexander ranks right next to C.S. Lewis in my opinion. The Book of Three (the first in the series) may seem like a child's story but it is only the start to a long, grand adventure. The books mature as Taran does in the story, giving you a true sense of Taran's journey and giving you an unforgettable adventure. Truly stunning and worth every second of your time to read and re-read again."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"I was 10 years old when I first read this book. It was my first full novel and brought me the wonderful world of fantasy fiction. Since then I have read this and the rest of the Chronicles of Prydain series numerous times.I love rich world that Lloyd Alexander created and its inhabitants, our heroes Taran, Eilonwy, Gurgi, Fflewdur and good old Doli and all the others. I have grown up with these characters, having read and re-read these books like visiting old friends and family.Lloyd Alexander shows us, through Taran's eyes that to be a great hero one does not need to be the greatest swordsman or most powerful magician. It is our choices that make us heroes and our friends and companions who make us great. That the simplest and meekest tasks, as a farmer or even that of an Assistant Pig Keeper can be the noblest of all.I highly recommend this for anyone from 10 to 100. If you have children, read this to them. You will not be disappointed. Someday, when I have a Taran of my own, I will read it to him every day."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"Over the Christmas holiday, I reread \\"The Book of Three\\" by Lloyd Alexander for the first time in almost three decades. It ranked as one of my favorites when I was a child and I was pleased to see that it remains an interesting tale. I first stumbled across the book when I was in second grade in 1982--and the book held up much better than the reviewer.Alexander draws from his time in Wales and he uses mythology to create an enchanted world where magic flows, lore is important and ancient evil looks to ascend. Tolkien's fingerprints are all over the work--but then could a writer draw from the mythology of the British isles and not bump into Tolkien? Still, Prydain is not in the ballpark when compared to Middle Earth--and honestly that's apples and oranges. Alexander made no bones about it; he wrote for children and his works should be judged as such. Tolkien had a different audience.\\"The Book of Three\\" works well for a number of reasons. Alexander is a fine craftsman of sentence and paragraphs and he keeps the plot moving. He also knows when to describe--and when horror and magic can be implied and not shown.The core characters will probably appeal more to children than adults--but again remember the audience. This remains a very solid book for children interested in fantasy adventure stories. Adults will probably find it less charming but it remains very readable and accessible after almost five decades in print."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"Finally, books I remember enjoying as a kid that still stand up to re-reading as an adult!They are sometimes described as coming-of-age stories, and that is true in the best sense of the term. Alexander is deeply concerned with growing up, and he examines many of its central, deepest, and most profound aspects, such as discovering one's personal identity, and responsibility. Each book in the series looks at these themes in different ways and builds on them a little more. My favorite in the series, Taran Wanderer (which I had expected to enjoy the least), deals with these issues so simply and directly that it acquires an almost allegorical quality. He teaches many important life lessons that are every bit as relevant to us grown-ups as to young adolescents just beginning to struggle with these issues. And he does so through engaging stories and a memorable cast of characters. From now on, whenever I find myself in a situation that tests my courage or integrity, all I have to do is think to myself, \\"A Fflam never falters!\\"Some people like to complain about the supposed similarities between these books and those of Tolkein, but apart from some basic structural features stemming from their common mythological roots, there really isn't a lot of similarity in the details. Even in the most obviously similar part---the ending---what is really interesting is how it differs. I can't say much without giving it away, but let's just say that Alexander, to his credit, ultimately says almost the exact opposite of Tolkein. No, Alexander's fantasy world isn't as complex and well-developed as Tolkein's, but these books were written for a younger audience, and let's face it, nobody can stand up to a comparison with Tolkein as far as that goes. I think if people, of whatever age, take these books on their own terms, they will find them to be a rewarding experience."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"What started as a fascination with Welsh mythology, brought me to the Prydain chronicles.

Besides the realism and great detail this book has a great cast of characters, including dwarfs, living dead, a hairy creature, and good and evil sorcerers. What really helps to bring this book to life is the great imaginable scenes of castles and wizards on cliffs edge and warm summer meadows with dead bodies and other things spread about them. Besides battle and death though this book includes happy times with great banquets and hard life on a farm. This book is very good although its plot takes a while to develop. I recommend it to those who like books of adventure, battle, betrayal, and good and evil magic. One thing that also makes this such a great book is the evil sorcerers and warlords that use all of their power to overcome the smaller and weaker armies that inhabit the magical land where it all takes place known as Prydain. Although the group, Taran, Flleuder, Gurgey, Ellonwy, Gallyn, and Dolli, is small they seem to have great strength against all of the evil that they may dare go against them or their homes.

Few books I have ever read have had such a vivid impact on the way I live my daily life now as did these chronicles, read when I was in the 5-6 grade."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"This was my first introduction to fantasy, and it remains one of my all-time favorites. It has everything-- thoroughly likeable characters, an exciting plot, honor, and one thing Tolkien and Lewis never included: humor. It can be taken at face value as a great fantasy, but I find it gains more levels the more times I read it. The Welsh mythology as a backdrop is also fascinating as Lloyd Alexander brings it all to life. Try this book-- it has something for everyone."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"The Prydain Chronicles is something to experience, for all ages, as are all Lloyd Alexander books. I must of read every single one of his works as a baby and I still love him. He is a rarity - a fantasy novelist for children who doesn't assume they are brain dead! Whether it's the Illyiad or Nausea with Sartre, Lloyd Alexander books are always something to be enjoyed."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"What can I say? This book was awesome. That doesn't exactly capture my feelings completely, but that's the best I can do for now. It's the only series I've read that I think can compare to Tolkien's writings (But Richard A. Knaak's &quot;Dragonrealm&quot; series is right up there too). As for all the people complaining about it being too much like Tolkien; By golly! I didn't see any rings get destroyed. In fact, I saw no rings at all. Sure, some of the characters were similar (If you stay up late nights thinking about it), but out of the millions (probably more) of books written, aren't the odds pretty high that some characters will be similar? Besides, there's never too much of a great thing. Oh well. Outstanding book. I read the whole series at least once a year. Mr. Alexander: You're awesome! Well, I'm off to have some crunchings and munchings. Farewell! P.S. &quot;A Fflam always makes the best character!&quot;"},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"Like all great fantasy series, the Prydain Chronicles will resonate with you for a long while after you put them down. The Book of Three begins the legendary adventure of Taran, Eilonwy, Fflewddur Flam, Gurgi, Doli, and Gwydion. The heroes are witty, warm, and wise; the villains are frightening, chilling, and insidious. You will laugh and shudder by turns as Taran faces the Death Lord's minions on his search for the cute and prophetic pig, Hen Wen.Lloyd Alexander's writing is first-rate and grand, like listening to a superb storyteller. His paints a vivid landscape peopled with truly unique characters. There is some argument about similarities with Tolkien, Star Wars, C.S. Lewis' Narnia, etc. Actually, you can take any epic about the battle of good and evil and point fingers, but isn't a good story worth another excellent retelling? This is one those rare treasures you read as a child, and rediscover as an adult again and again.Why? Besides the lovely writing, the characters aren't simple bystanders or perfect people caught up in the action. They make choices (and mistakes), face consequences, and struggle through personal challenges. It's reality in an unreal setting. In this first book, Taran, in a rush to grow up, leaves his post as Assistant Pig-keeper to become a Hero. Everyone who has ever been an adolescent can relate to wanting to break away. Finding yourself is the hard part, and one aspect of the series is about this universal phase.But it isn't all Serious and about Learning A Lesson. There is cheeky humor, poked at our valiant, though sometimes too earnest Taran. Things can't go according to the great Hero Plan with Eilonwy cutting him down to size, Doli scoffing at the young 'uns, and Gurgi wanting \\"munchings and crunchings\\" all the time. This is one of those books that you will feel ends too soon. Be sure to have the next one close at hand, because The Book of Three is just the beginning once you have tasted Alexander's magic."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"Until I reached the seventh grade, reading was boring to me. Then I was grounded to my room for a month(don't ask). I was reading \\"The Book of Three\\" in my english class and with all this extra time on my hands I actually decided to read the whole book for once. I was hooked. Then I got the remaining books in the series from my teacher and read them as well. I have been reading ever since. The book was just fantastic and I still enjoy re-reading them. Lloyd Alexander's books introduced me to a whole other world and showied me how much fun reading is. As a child I felt I could relate to Taran. Everyone I've lent these books to loves them as much as I do. I gave them to my teenage daughter to read the series still remains one of her favorites too. A great read for children and adults."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"I am about halfway through. This is great for Harry Potter fans. Even though it has hard words it is still a fantastic book!"},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"I got The Book of Three for my birthday, after my friend noticed one of my favorite Disney movies, The Black Cauldron, was based on this book series. While this book certainly captured the aspects of an old fairy tale combined with a hero's adventure, it didn't quite manage to capture my heart as well.Taran was an interesting main character who had to deal with both his pride and the fact that he's nothing more than Assistant Pig-Keeper. This annoys him to no end as he'd much rather be off adventuring and saving the world. Little did he know that he would get that chance and enjoy it far less than he expected to.The cast of characters was wonderful. From the bard who continuously breaks his harp strings with his excessive lies to the dwarf who wants nothing more than the ability to turn himself invisible. They all have their quirks and faults and little ways to make the story a bit funnier while bringing more danger into the story as well.Some parts of the tale dragged on and on and this relatively short book took months for me to read. I kept picking it up and setting it down again, never feeling a strong association with it. It was just an okay thing to read when I had nothing else to do and no other book around me.I'd recommend this book for younger audiences as well as those who like adventure stories and don't mind a build up to the actual action. The journey, I think, was what I had the most problems with, and that was the bulk of the book.I know the series can only get better, so I look forward to it!"},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"I first read The Book of Three in middle school and have been rereading it ever 4-5 years since.

The lessons Taran learns in this book and the ones that follow in the Chronicles of Prydain are relevant at any age, and I fall in love with the characters all over again every time I read it. Honestly, I usually have a good cry too. Added bonus, this book has a strong female character who continues throughout the series. She isn't the main character, but Princess Eilonwy is a a huge presence in the series. And really, whether your buying for a girl or a boy, that something we could all stand to see a little more of."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"It is the best ever. Looking for adventure?

And don't be fooled by those who say Alexander rips off Tolkien. The simularities are the same ones that virtually every modern fantasy story has with Tolkien."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"Before there was Harry Potter, there was Taran. THE BOOK OF THREE is the first book in The Chronicles of Prydain series. These five books are classics, beautifully and tightly written. In terms of literary influence, the Chronicles rank second only to Tolkien. These are books one can recommend to parents without hesitation as they introduce children to the moral dilemmas and complexities of adulthood without resorting to sex, bad language or undue violence.THE BOOK OF THREE introduces us to Taran, an orphan boy growing up in the care of a mysterious enchanter Dalben. Taran dreams of glory and longs for a noble title so his mentor Col dubs him Assistant Pigkeeper and tells him that his duty is to feed and wash the enchanted pig, Hen Wen. Since Taran has long been doing these chores, he's not impressed. But when Hen Wen runs off in terror at the approach of the evil Horned King, Taran follows her to bring her back.Along the way he meets an assortment of delightful characters who become his comrades throughout the series: the hairy simplton Gurgi, the would-be bard Fflewddur Fflam, the distracting Princess Eilonwy and Doli, the constantly complaining dwarf. Gurgi is not too bright; Fflewddur has a \\"truthiness\\" problem and Eilonwy is a stubborn minx. But their loyalty, friendship and bravery makes up for their faults.THE BOOK OF THREE enchants and charms. A thread of bewitching humor runs throughout, driven by the characters themselves. Both adults and children will appreciate the problem Fflewddur Fflam has: whenever he colors the facts too much, the strings on his magical harp break. Eilonwy's tangled metaphors and Gurgi's wet wolfhound odor increase the affection we feel for these characters; Doli's complaints don't conceal his competence.The only danger in reading this book is that you will be compelled to read the other four. If you have not yet read them, then you should do so without delay. It is always possible that you will appreciate them more when you are older, but if you are old enough to read them you will enjoy them and wish you had discovered them sooner."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"I first read the Prydain Chronicles when I was 10 years old, and can safely say that in my 45 years, I have never enjoyed a series of books more. To those who haven't read them, I am truly envious--to be able to enjoy and savor these books for the first time would be wonderful.The themes and lessons that Lloyd Alexander incorporated into this book were things that I was not able to appreciate until I was an adult, which is why I truly recommend this series to adults as well. But what makes these books really great is that they're fun to read. His sense of humor, his command of character and his instinct for a good story make these books truly great literary treasures. When they're old enough I plan to introduce these books to my daughters and hope they become as precious to them as they were to me."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"I read the Book of Three, and, quite honestly, it was one of the most unique books I have read. It started out with a young boy named Taran, who lived with a man named Coll. He wanted truly to get away from the small home that he had been condemned to. Then, just as he is longing for a more exciting place, the magical oracle pig named Hen Wen is frightened by something, and so runs away. It is then that Taran realizes that this is his chance to escape the monotonous drone of his everyday life and prove himself worthy of more exciting things. He runs after Hen Wen without looking back. As he looks through the forest, he suddenly runs right into the feared Horned King. He is known as the most powerful person in all of Prydain, even more so than Prince Gwydion. Taran, recognizing him from tales he had heard and passed off as a myth, runs away quickly! In all the racket, he bumps into a strange man who he doesn't recognize. Who is he? But then he realizes! Prince Gwydion! The ruler of Prydain, where Taran lives! Gwydion explains to him why the Horned King is in the forest. He wants Hen Wen, too! So Gwydion and the foolish assistant pig keeper Taran embark on an expedition to save Prydain. Along the way, however, an evil spirit named Arawn sends his dead-yet-alive cauldron-born to stop them. They capture them and bring them to Achren, an evil queen who lives in the Spiral Castle. The next thing Taran knows is that he is in her dungeon, and that he needs to find Gwydion. As he is sitting sadly in the dungeon, a little glowing bauble drops into his cell. Suddenly, there is a little girl peeking in at him, asking for her little bauble. Her name is Eilownwy, and she claims that she despises Achren, and knows another person in the dungeon. Taran just knows it is Gwydion, and together they form a plan to escape with Gwydion. Eilownwy knows secret passages that are unfamiliar to even Achren, so she plans to help Gwydion escape, and then lead Taran to him. But on the way out, one of the passages collapses, along the Spiral Castle! They escape just in time, and run to the forest where Gwydion is waiting. That's when Taran realizes... it's not Gwydion! He feels terrible! Gwydion was probably back in the castle when it collapsed! Gwydion must be dead! But who was it that he had assumed was Gwydion? Fflewddur Fflam, a wild looking man who is eager to help. Together they decide to warn the Sons of Don, the only ones who can help, but it proves to be harder than they thought. Read the book to find out what it is that can stop the Horned King, and if they ever find Hen Wen! The Book of Three by Lloyd Alexander is definitely worth reading!"},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"I learned to love reading through The Prydain Chronicles by Lloyd Alexander...

It is an easy, fast read with a very catchy story that keeps you hooked until the end. The rest of the series is just as good, maybe even better. The characters are wonderful and the story unforgettable. For somone who loves fantasy, humor, adventure, or just wants a good book: this one is for you."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"This book is one of those rare gems that people either read when they were younger and don't really remember now that they have \\"grown up\\" or never had at all because it is listed as a children's fantasy.But I would recomend this entire series \\"Chronicles of Prydain\\" to any adult out there interested in reading good fantasy. In fact I would recomend it over at least 3/4 of the more adult oriented fantasy novels I have read over the years.Alexander, being in part inspired by the masterful Tolkien, creates a world based on the landscape and mythology of Wales. The story and scopeseem very simple and it is a quick read, but I feel it is an important work nonetheless. In an era where fantasy is rarely original or is just written to make money (or Both), this is a nice bit of fresh air. Written at a time when fantasy as a genre was just beginning to take hold, this is a story that was written out of a love for his characters.Which is what this book and series is really all about. The evils they fight and the quests they take are shown to be not nearly as important as the characters learning from them and growing.Throughout this book much emphasis is placed on Tarans being an Assistant Pig-Keeper. But by the end, even though he has retained that title, it is seen how important he was as a leader, even though at the time his choices did't seem right, they were the right choices in the end.While with Taran we see how Choices build the character of a man, with Gurgi, an odd, scared shaggy half-man half-beast, we learn what it takes to be a human.My favorite character is Fflewddur Fflam. Spiky, yellow haired charcters always seem the coolest. He is always embelishing his stories which are kept in check by a rather unique harp. But you have to love him because he does not embelish to be deceptive, but because he gets caught up in the heat of the moment telling the story.One of the best things about this book is that it is full of lots of little truths. Which is something most fantasy books never touch upon. They are just full of war, death misery, joy and adventure, but they rarely touch upon what these things mean or how they can develop a person.Anyhow, I strongly recomend reading this book if your looking for a change of pace from mainstream fantasy novels."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"Assistan Pig-Keeper Taran is on the verge of manhood and as such young men do, he dreams of adventure and battles. Or if anything to get away from the too peaceful Caer Dallben. Unfortunately, as his 'title' suggests, his only role in life is to assist in taking care of the oracular pig, Hen Wen. But Hen Wen one day panics then runs away from Caer Dallben for no apparent reason. From then on, Taran is thrust into an adventure to help the land of Prydain from destruction. Long ago the Sons of Don had kept off the forces of evil King Arawn, Lord of Annuvin, from taking over Prydain. Now the High King Math and his son Prince Gwydion, descendents of the House of Don, are being threatened by Arawn's powerful warlord, the Horned King. Will Prydain be saved from a terrible fate? With a band of strange yet the best kind of friends anyone could ever have, Taran finds himself fighting so good can have victory over evil, so that Prydain will be safe from the hands of evil?Lloyd Alexander, author of the \\"Prydain Chronicles\\", wrote this series which resembles a bit of Welsh mythology and legends. Though under the category for young adults, I can truly say that even adults would probably find the world of Prydain fascinating. Victories in battle, good versus evil, relationship between friends, and responsibilities, \\"The Book of Three\\" has many good morals which we should have in real life. With lots of adventure, magic, humor, and excitement, \\"The Book of Three\\" has it all!The characters are what really draw you deep into the story. Taran is your average hero who is reaching the age of adulthood and is far from perfect. A bit cocky and rash in the beginning, he still possess courage and enthusiasm which makes him all the more likable. Then there are plenty more terrific characters who each have their own quirks: the wise and courageous Prince Gwydion, the funny creature Gurgi with his 'crunchings and munchings', Fflewddur Fflam the prince who wants to be a bard, Princess Eilonwy of the golden hair who is charming and a motor-mouth, Doli the dwarf who wants to become invisible, Dallben the wise, and Coll the warrior now farmer. And these characters are only the good guys! Of the bad people, I like Queen Achren the most, a very powerful witch who in beginning gave King Arawn his powers.Well, I can't really tell you anymore about the story except that the book doesn't end the story! The Chronicle continues the adventures of Taran as he grows up in \\"The Black Cauldron\\", \\"The Castle of Llyr\\", \\"Taran Wanderer\\", and \\"The High King\\". My favorites are the first three books though the last two books are a must read, too. And if you are wondering, yes, most of the same characters show up in the rest of the books and plenty more new ones! Have fun reading \\"The Prydain Chronicles\\"!"},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"I've read A LOT of sci-fi and fantasy over the years and The Prydain Chronicles is still one of my favorite series. It has everything a sci-fi fantasy fan is looking for: it has an epic scale, a beautiful setting that has many ties to welsh myth and characters that really grow as the saga progresses. I loved each of the books and have re-read them several times. I owuld even venture to say I liked these book seven more than sertain other books dealing with hobbits and rings.

It follows what has become a well-worn pattern--hero of humble origin has a series of adventures, involving a struggle against an evil force trying to take over the world, which ends in the hero's discovering that . . . Well, in case you haven't read too many heroic fantasy books, I won't tell you. Anyway, this series stands out from the pack (and yes, I'm afraid I think it is even better than Harry Potter, though I don't expect all you Potter fans to agree with me--check back with me in ten years and we'll discuss it; and yes, I hate it too when people say that to me!). It has lovable characters, humor, and, above everything else, an insight into how we make moral choices and come to be mature, honorable people. Taran starts off wanting excitement, but he comes to realize that if you really want to do things worth doing, you have to care about the thing you're doing more than about the fact that you're the one doing it. Of course, he has a lot of friends to help him in his moral development, especially the feisty princess (and sorceress-in-training) Eilonwy."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"I received the Chronicles of Prydain as a Christmas gift thispast Christmas, and it was by far my favorite gift. The series is abeautiful chronicling of an incredible adventure. Taran the Assistant Pig-Keeper is a character that will stay with me forever, as is Eilonwy Princess of Llyr. The Book of Three is a fabulous book, and the story is one that you will never forget. THIS IS NOT ONLY A CHILDREN'S BOOK! Even when I am an adult (I'm twelve now), I know that I will still adore the Chronicles of Prydain. The characters are wonderfully written (especially Eilonwy), the setting is perfect, and the story is completely flawless. If you want an exciting, beautiful, and just plain awesome book, The Book of Three is definitely for you."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"I know that this review will most probably attract nothing but negative votes (from flamers, if not from honest readers who take offense). Now you're probably looking at my 3-star rating of The Book of Three and wondering &quot;why&quot;.Just for the record: The Book of Three is painfully short, the plot is simplistic, and the characters do not achieve much development. Nevertheless, it is the perfect introduction to the amazingly written Chronicles of Prydain. It introduces you to a slew of believable, three-dimensional characters and Lloyd Alexander's unique kind of heartwarming humor.The Book of Three is short (read: it's too expensive for a hardcover its size). I finished it in about an evening (reading for the first time, carefully paying attention to details and memorizing the Welsh names). In some respects it is a tutorial to prepare the reader for the much more sober and grim books that follow it.What's the plot (or at least its premise)? Taran is an assistant pig-keeper at Caer Dallben, the safest, and perhaps the dullest place in all of the magical land of Prydain. A dark army gathers in the name of the Death Lord headed by a hideous leader, a man so grisly that Hen Wen, the oracular pig Taran is charged with, escapes into the forest. Taran follows it, and, after meeting with a few unique and interesting characters, learns that being a hero is hard and unfulfilling work, and that the only true wealth is that of spirit.This sort of uplifting, deeply spiritual fantasy rarely appears nowaday. You'd do well to pick up this book and the other parts of the quintet, whatever your age might be, if you want to bring the glow of simple pleasures into your life.The Book of Three (and the remainder of the books in the series) are closely based on Welsh mythology, particularly the Mabynogeon, although the good and evil are more precisely defined. There are a number of obscure references to Welsh mythology throughout the series (they don't get in the way of the plot)."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"This book begins the Prydain Chronicles, a classic coming-of age adventure tale that still resonates long after childhood. The books get better further into the series, climaxing with The High King. The whole set would be a wonderful gift to any inquisitive child."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"I enjoyed the whole series when I was a kid; I'm now going to e-mail the title list to my nephew,whom I'm sure would enjoy it just as much."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"The Book Of Three is a wonderful book, especially if you like fantasy or science-fiction books. It is very well written, and the content of the book shows that the author has a very vivid imaganation. Even though the book is a fantasy, it is very plausible, unlike some fantasys which are not at all belivable. I would recommend this book to anyone who has ever read and enjoyed a fantasy book, and to those who want to read a good fantasy story."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"My father started reading this series to me when I was about five. I LOVED these books for their humor and adventure. When I was in fifth grade they were assigned reading, but I was not in the least bored. The adventure and humor were still there, but I also began to appreciate more the richness of the characters. I was delighted that heroes were portrayed as people with fears and hopes, capable of making mistakes and of learning. Despite the fantasy, the people were real. Now, more than twenty years later, I have learned to read Welsh and recognize some of the inspirations behind the stories of Prydain. I have more respect han ever for the creativity that went into these tales and the sense of ballance and underlying faith that makes them worth reading again and again"},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"A review by AndrewThis was an excellent book I enjoyed it a lot. I think at the begging it was a lot like Zorro due to the fact that, one person does not know the art or the sword and one does. Then the one that knows the art begins to teach the other. There are some parts of this story that were familiar. I am not sure if those parts were so good that they were made in to a different story. It also could have been that they came from another story.I think that somebody that likes fiction should consider reading The Book of Three by Lloyd Alexander. This was more like a fantasy type story, but that doesn't matter it was pretty well written and had parts of suspense and mystery."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"There are books that you don't want to see come to an end.There are books that rattle in your brain, heart and soul, and stay with you, never to be forgotten.Lloyd Alexander's magnificent series falls into these categories. I first read them at the age of 13 and have just read them again at 35. This series was the first that I did not want to see end. It's what got me started on reading Tolkien, Lewis, Donaldson, Piers Anthony, Dune, and others. I'm glad to see so many people love these books as well.And why not? The characters are dynamic, engaging and more real than the average fantasy ones. The stories move along nicely with few if any slow moments. The classic elements of good and evil are all here with some twists.There were some aspects that I was too young to appreciate the first time. One was the humor, most noticeable in The Book of Three, as we see some of the characters getting to first know each other. The other aspect was the theme/message that the way of the warrior is not the only path to nobility, honor, and courage (or to adulthood). There is as much honor in taking care of a garden as there is in being a warrior, to very loosely paraphrase one of the characters. In this day and age, when so much of the culture says be the biggest, baddest, toughest, strongest, richest etc person who destroys or gobbles up things, the message of taking care of one's garden, creating something of beauty be it a woven cloak or a clay pot, or honoring a friend's request is refreshing and not heard enough.To the other reviewers who feel Alexander borrowed characters and motifs heavily from Tolkien, these have been part of literature and mythology for a long time. Long BEFORE Tolkien. If Dallben is Gandalf, well, Gandalf is Merlin. And Merlin was borrowed from other myths or folktales. Alexander borrowed some from The Mabinogen, the Welsh treasury of mythology. Tolkien borrowed from Beowulf and other English sources. These stories have been recreated or recast for ages. Sure, there are similarities but then this is a genre where dwarves, wizards, and enchanted objects are the norm. But assistant Pig-Keepers, frustrated ex-giants who whine about their lack of stature, a traveling bard with a second job as a King, or a trio of witches with an unusual, unpredicable sense of logic who switch identities daily(they deserve a book of their own!)? Hardly. And where have you ever seen a character quite like Fflewdur Flam? (Well, maybe in Dickens or Mark Helprin's A Winter's Tale)For the kids (or adults) who love Harry Potter: you've got till July before the 4th book is out. There are no Quidditch matches but Taran may remind you of Harry and Dallben may remind you of Dumbledore. Check these five books out. (But avoid the inaccurate animated version of The Black Cauldron)I've read the Lord of the Rings twice and for a long time considered it the best book I'd ever read. But it doesn't hold quite the special spot in my heart that the Prydain books do. And at least Lloyd Alexander spared us his version of those boringly long elf or dwarf songs and poems."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"I read this book for the first time about 30 years ago, when I was 10 years old. Recently I re-read the entire series, and was enchanted again.The tale of Taran and friends has everything a great children's book should: adventure, danger, good, evil, love and death. And, there is lots of humor, too, which you don't always find in similar clasics. The writing is great throughout -- this is not Goosebumps -- and the child who has the privilege of reading the Chronicles will surely be changed. The story, based on Welsh legends, subtly explores the great mysteries of life, and teaches lessons about bravery, honesty, compassion and devotion, without ever being preachy or obvious.These books belong on the same shelf as the L'Engle Time trilogy, Susan Cooper's Dark is Rising Sequence, the Narnia Books and a small number of others.Buy this for a favorite kid (maybe one that has gotten hooked on reading through &quot;Harry Potter&quot;), but get it for yourself, too."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"I have often jokingly told people to read this before reading JRR Tolkein because it's &quot;Hobbit&quot;-lite. But my jest is with all affection. &quot;The Book of Three&quot; is the first of five books (not including the 6th of short stories) involving the fantasy world of Prydain. Lloyd Alexander borrows heavily from Gaelic and Welsh mythology to create the tale of Taran, Assistant Pig-keeper for the enchanter Dallben. In this book we are introduced to Taran, a boy on the cusp of manhood eager to take part in the adventures of the world. Dark forces under the direction of Awran, the Death-Lord threaten the lives of all in Prydain, and none is more feared that the gruesom &quot;Horned King&quot;. After leaping &quot;headfirst into a thorn bush&quot; young Taran finds himself face to face with this dreaded champion of darkness who has come from Annuvuin in search of Hen-wen, the oracular pig under Taran's charge. I won't spoil any more of the story except to say that this book introduces many of the characters that appear later on in the rest of the series: the stubborn and lovely Princess Eilonwy, the king-who-wants-to-be-a-bard Fflewder Flam, the cantankerous Doli of the fairfolk, Coll- the warrior turned farmer, and more. Lloyd Alexander's fantasy tale, in my opinion, rivals that of Tolkein as a richly crafted work with wonderful images and a deep understanding and appreciation for the thoughts and feelings of a young man like Taran. The text is easy to read, and the story flows smoothly along. Each book can stand alone, but together create a magnificant epic tapestry. The names of the characters are a little hard to get used to, but not impossible. This is the kind of book you can read out loud at bed-time to young childern. The plot is engaging enough for the little ones and deep enough for adults to appreciate. I recommend this book to just about anyone, and especially for children who are old enough to be reading completely on their own and have reached that point where they are &quot;into&quot; adventures. The best thing about this book (and the series) is that what little violence there is is not glorified, there is no gratuitous sex, and there are morals espoused without sounding preachy. And its the kind of story that girls and boys can enjoy and its perfect for pre-teens and early teens. As the books progress, young teens can &quot;grow&quot; along with Taran, and understand some of his angst. All around, a most excellent novel, and only the begining of a fantastic story..."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"This first book in Lloyd Alexander's five-book series introduces most of the characters we come to know and love in the later books: Taran, Eilonwy, Hen-Wen, Doli, Coll, Dallben, Gurgi (with his many munchings and crunchings), Gwydion; and the evil players, Arawn, Achren, the Huntsmen of Annuvin, Gwythaints, the Cauldron Born, and the chief antagonist in this book, the Horned King (depicted on the cover).Alexander draws deeply from Welsh mythology to bring us one of the finest fantasy series ever written, teeming with colorful wizards, princes, dwarves, and assorted monsters. It's heavily laden with virtue and positive messages without ever preaching. In The Book of Three, our hero, Taran Wanderer cuts his teeth in adventure and battle against the Horned King, showing early hints the greatness to come.This first book is not by itself one of the great literary works, but is a worthy and required warm-up to the genius of the complete work. I believe these tales of the land of Prydain rank with Narnia and Tolkien's Middle Earth. Personally, I rank the Prydain series as number two behind the Ring Trilogy, and slightly better than the Narnia Chronicles. Alexander's books are easier reading than Tolkien's, but lack the depth. Of course, that's like saying K2 isn't as high as Everest.

Thus begins thestory of Taran, an orphan who is raised by the wizard Dallben. Taran dreams of the outside world and of being a hero. Even though I have read Tolkien's masterpiece before I came across this book and the rest of the series, I can see why older readers can get nostalgic about the Prydain books. When the psychic pig Hen Wen escapes the farm, a simple search becomes a quest to save Prydain against the Death Lord and his champion. Readers can really relate to Taran, especially younger ones, as he is just barely a teenager. The protagonists are ones that the reader can't help but to just like, and there are not really any slow parts in the book. It has the necessary elements of a fantasy book, but it has a good amount of humor, and is thought provoking. The Book of Three is a quick and easy read, and it motivates you to read the rest of the series. And the Prydain Chronicles is not easily forgotten.

He hates it there, and wants to be a hero. One day, his pig HenWen/his droid R2D2 runs off and this engages our young hero in an adventure where he meets a sage old wizard/jedi knight, a rogue-ish fflam/han solo and giant hairy sidekick gurgi/chewbacca.

At 36, I'm re-reading them, and they definitely stand the test of time.Though set in an imaginary medieval kingdom, the Prydain chronicles remind me of Star Wars -- or, to be more exact, Star Wars reminds me of the Prydain Chronicles, which I read before Luke ever heard of the Force. A naive, headstrong boy of unknown parentage dreams of glory while spending his days in dull farm chores -- until he unexpectedly finds himself in the midst of a cosmic battle between good and evil. He journeys away from his home and discovers beauties and terrors he never dreamed of. Although the adventuring life isn't at all what he expected, and his mistakes are many, he eventually discovers his own inner strength in ways he never imagined.These wise and witty books are gorgeously written. Adults with an ear for poetic language may recognize this; children may appreciate it without being able to identify exactly what makes this book more than just another sword and sorcery adventure.Although the Book of Three is probably the weakest of the series, it is the introduction to the marvelous world of Prydain, so it's worth finishing to be ready for the full flavor of the other four. However, you can still pick up the series in the middle: I started with the last book &amp; still got hooked!"},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"I hadn't heard of these books when I was growing up, but I am now beginning to look at books of future interest to my son, and I would say that this is definitely a book and series that we will enjoy together in a few years. This book came out ten years after Tolkien's trilogy, and though it would be difficult to avoid all similarities to that archetypal work, there are some surprisingly similar elements -- but also some that are very imaginative and original (an oracular pig!).Taran is a pre-teen boy who is bored with his job and friends and village. He longs for adventure and, as he soon finds out, he should be careful what he wishes for! Looking for a runaway pig, Taran soon runs into danger, and must venture far from his home. Along the way he meets characters such as Eilonwy and Gwydion who will help him, and others he must fear.Sometimes Eilonwy's ubiquitous use of metaphors gets tiresome, and the volume would benefit from the inclusion of a map, but overall this is a highly readable story with an interesting cast of characters, good pacing, minimal violence, positive character development, teamwork and cooperation, adventure and lessons about the consequences of choice."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"When Taran, Assistant Pig-Keeper of Caer Dalben, sets out to rescue the oracular white pig, Hen Wen who has been stolen by the Horned King, servant of Arawn Deathlord, he has no idea of the eventual end of the path on which he is taking his first, hesitant steps, nor of the life-long friends and companions he will meet.Many believe that Alexander's &quot;Prydain&quot; books are derivative of J.R.R.Tolkien -- they aren't.Rather, to a great extent, both derive from the same source, the ancient Welsh legends of the Mabinogion.Personally, i prefer the use that Alexander has made of the material -- it is more human and alive, focused tightly on the characters rather than concerned primarily with a grand narrative sweep.I was 26 when i came to these books; i'm 51 now, and in the intervening twenty-five years i have given away about eight or ten sets of them to family, friends and even chance acquaintances.After twenty-five years, i still believe that there have been Very Few better works of children's/YA fantasy than these books... and not a lot even as good, for that matter.If Harry Potter has left some young person you know with a hankering for the Good Stuff -- here it is."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"A Book of Three is an intriguing story of a young farm hand who dreams of becoming an adventurer. For all of his life, Taran lived at the quaint farmhouse called Caer Dallben. His real adventures start though when he's told to look after the oracular pig on the premisis. The pig escapes and rather than getting in trouble, Taran gives chase into the forest and comes face to face with the enemy of the land. This book, set in the mythical country of Prydian, which uncannily resembles Wales, takes you through an imaginary country with imaginary characters but real adventures throughout. As you read, you'll be pulled into Taran's life. You'll feel the pain as he encounters new troubles all the way to the end of the book. And by the time it's all done you'll be grasping for more. Luckily, Lloyd Alexander continued the adventures in four more books. I haven't read them but if they anything like the first then they'll be worth the time. Lloyd alexanders writing style will draw you in and keep you there.

In his search for his oricular pig he meets many friends,including the prince of prydain and many other interesting characters. He then finds his way around the magical realm of prydain.

I would strongly recommend this book to all people who like fantasy and magic."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"I read this book last year in my sixth grade class. I looked at the cover and thought it would probably be dumb, but when I read it I couldn't put it down. It was so good! Lloyd Alexander is a great writer."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"I don't know how The Prydain Chronicles can be dismissed as a children's book. It contains all the elements of great fantasy. Myself, I am ninteen and have read this series since Junior High. I think it is second only to Tolkien's Middle Earth and is even a step ahead of Brook's Shannara series. This is my favorite book in the series except for The High King. It tells of Taran's first adventure, when he began to become one of the great in Prydain while keeping the humble personality of an Assistant Pig-Keeper. I would recommend this book to all fantasy fans."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"This book is very thrilling and exciting if you like the medievil sort of thing. Its about Taran An ASSITANT PIG KEEPER. Taran joins a quest with a PRINCE named Gwydion. The quest is to warn the city of Caer Dathyl that a heavily armed army from Annuvin(the evil place in this series) with a champion called the Horned King leading this great escapade. Taran and Gwydion encounter many sidetracks and make new friends to help them along the quest. GREAT BOOK OF THE BEGINNING OF A FANTASTIC SERIES."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"The Book of Three by Lloyd Alexander is one of the best books I have ever read. I read this book in October of 2001 because it looked like a fantasy book and I enjoy fantasy.I recommend this book to all who enjoy fantasy . You might not like The Book of Three if you don't like books that contain things that are unrealistic or can't happen.Once you start reading this book, you won't want to stop and, when you're finished with the book, you'll want to read the next four books.This book deserves a definite five."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"This is one of the books that I read over and over as a child. In this book we are introduced to Taran, the Assistant Pig-Keeper of Caer Dalben. Little does Taran know, as he is growing up on this quite little farm what his employer is, and the powerful company that he keeps, and how being an orphan who dreams of heroics is going to impact his life. Parents need not worry about this series: there is no sexual innuendo, there are no demonic rituals, and there is no pantheon of deities that are worshipped. There is minimal violence, and Mr. Alexander does not glorify conflict. When heroes die in this series, they are not put on a pedestal and then glossed over; they are mourned. Death is not emphasised much in this series, but he does treat it in a realistic fashion. Most of all, Mr. Alexander does not pack this series with action, but tells a story almost custom made to develope the literary qualities of the mind. This series is good for young and old alike."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"I read Mr. Alexander's Vesper Holly series and was wondering what else he had written. So, I looked and I found the wonderful &quot;Chronicals of Prydain.&quot; The Book Of Three is a wonderful book. Even though it was written for children, I loved it. I would recomend this book to anyone that likes Irish mythology, Fantasy, or anything by Lloyd Alexander."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"Lloyd Alexander's The Book of Three by tells a great story of a medieval kingdom. Taran, who aspires to be a great war hero one day, despises working in his small town and wants to get out. In a moment of panic, the prophetic pig he was to look after runs into the woods, and Taran follows. He ends up finding a great warrior, Gwydion, whom he convinces to take him along on his quests. They end up getting captured and separated; Taran assumes that Gwydion is dead. Continuing on his quest to find the pig, Taran makes friends along the way and becomes the group's leader. He soon realizes that he misses his simple life back home. As the boy is on his quest, so is an evil king, who is also search for Hen Wen, the oracular pig. They race to find her and bring her to safety.The Book of Three shows that the image of a hero doesn't make the hero. The boy has imagined that the great hero about whom he has heard stories of is a man with elegant clothes and jewels. When he finds him in the forest, he doesn't believe that Gwydion is the legendary warrior he says he is. The boy also learns that Coll, one of his caretakers at his home, was once a great hero and stole the enchanted pig from the evil kingdom that had captured it. The boy wants to become a great hero and go on great adventures but soon learns that being a hero isn't as glamorous and fun as it may seem. When he becomes the leader of Eilonwy, Gurgi, and Fflewwddur, he understands that his soul, not his appearance, makes him a hero.The Book of Three was banned because it contains scenes of war and death, and it involves magic. I feel that these reasons are insufficient for banning this book. I think that almost any story that is a fantasy and adventure in medieval times would contain such topics; to ban this book because of its theme is like banning an entire genre of great books. . I understand that some extremely sensitive readers or parents don't approve of such violence, but turn on the news, it is all around us, and this story uses all the fighting to teach a lesson: heroes need not display the stereotypical qualities one would think a brave hero would have. I think that this is a good lesson for children to learn, and I think that The Book of Three does a great job of illustrating this idea."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"Lloyd Alexander achieved a wonderful masterpiece with this series of 5 novels.

The main characterm, a boy named Taran, is desperate for adventure. Heck, most boys are at that age. However as Taran learns, one should be careful for what one wishes for because you just might get it!The book is written for young adults and as such is fast-paced and doesn't go into great details. However the story isn't so watered down that adults can't get into it (although I blew through the book in a day as an adult). Gurgey's &quot;crunchings and munchings&quot; are funny and the romance between Taran and Ellonwy reminded me so much of the girl I had a HUGE crush on in 6th grade! Very sweet and nicely done!

We read them aloud as a family, taking turns reading one chapter each night. Eventually I began to read ahead & I've been doing so ever since.This is the first in the series & establishes the characters & basic themes. In many ways these books are all about the hero's journey, but not just for the main character, Taran. Each person here is, in his or her own way, walking the path towards self-discovery.For me the character of Eilonwy was always my favorite - probably in part because she's a girl & little girls need other girls to identify with in their books. When I was growing up girls like Eilonwy were few & far between in kids' books. She wasn't fluffy or dithering. She didn't a boy to rescue her, although she wasn't too proud to be rescued if need be. She was smart & interesting & independent & self-confident & competent. I identified with that (still do).This is a great start to a great series. It was nice to re-visit Prydain."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"The Book of Three is a fantasy about a boy named Taran who is plunged into an exciting quest. He lives on a small farm in Caer Dallben and dreams of heroism, but is only an Assistant Pig Keeper. When Hen Wen the oracle pig escapes, Taran runs after her. On the journey he unexpectedly meets prince Gwydion who is also searching for Hen Wen. They get captured by Achren, an evil queen. Taran gets separated from Gwydion, but manages to escape with the help Eilonwy. Eilonwy is an intelligent chatterbox girl who loves to speak in similes. They try to find Gwydion, but give him up for dead. A man named Fflewder Flem meets up with them as well as a creature named Gurgi. The four set off on a quest to warn the sons of Don about an attack planned by the Horned King, a vicious war lord.It's a fun and exciting story. I like Lloyd Alexander's writing and recommend it. I can't wait to read the rest of the series."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"I read Alexander's series as a young girl, and loved them. I've tried a few times to get my sons engaged in the story through reading it aloud, but struck out until this year when I tried the audio CD format. This has done the trick, and I recommend it as a great technique for introducing your child to new books when on a car trip, or even taking the pressure off of you to read aloud at night. My two sons, 9 and 7, have both gotten engaged by the story and are asking for the followons. The story features a young man, Taran, who is longing for fame and adventure. Through his travels, he meets new people and has opportunities to make mistakes, learn from them, and throughout displays good character and \\"doing the right thing\\" when really tough choices present themselves. At least one of the series is a Newbery winner, with another as a finalist/nominee (can't go wrong with this!). Highly recommend."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"It's true; for those of us who read Alexander's books as children and have now re-visited them as adults, they have endured. Smaller in scope and yet just as big in heart as Tolkien, with considerably more humor, I have always smiled when thinking of these books (and am forever sad that Disney screwed up 'The Black Cauldron' when they had the chance to enchant more generations with these stories). Unlike Tolkien - and many imitators/followers - Alexander's Prydain books, beginning with 'The Book of Three', are based on Welsh mythology, which has many similar elements to the Nordic and Celtic legends fantasy readers are so familiar with, but also has its own brand of scrappy, unusual style. Hen Wen remains one of the, ahem, greatest pigs in literature, and our introduction to other characters in the series - Taran, Eilonwy, kings and queens both good and evil and all the oddments in-between - is simple, swift and charming. Alexander doesn't fill his works with laborious action or heavy dialogue; he keeps everything sharp, streamlined and elegantly written.I have many fond memories of sitting in a corner of our local library with this book, re-reading it for the tenth or twentieth time. I hope more young people today will discover that happiness as well."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"This is the perfect book to get a young man to love to read. It has a lot of action, great characters, and very scarry bad guys. I didn't read it the first time until I was an adult, but have read it to each of my 7 children and they all love it. It is one great series! I recommend it to readers of all ages!"},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"This series is arguably my favorite set of books from childhood. When I got engaged, I read most of them aloud to my fiancee, and she loved them. We recommended them to a child, and heard a year later from the library that the books, which had not been read in years, had been taken out by one person after another nonstop, some children, but parents and others as well.Unfortunately, there is a scene of horror (the Horned King with people in wicker baskets) in the first 1/3 of the first book. While it goes by briefly, I think some people never get to where the series really takes off, when Eilonwy and Flewder Flam show up. The laughter, tears, wisdom and growth are exceptional. These books and the Lord of the Rings trilogy are probably the only books I have read more than thirty times, and enjoyed them each time. If you like fantasy of any type, or just good literature for all ages, don't miss this series!"},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"What a great wasy to start a wonderful coming of age story. I first entered Prydain 26 years ago. I became enchanted at the whole idea of this wonderful world of Alexander's. The characters, from the least important to main hero, are wonderful. It is an enchanting tale about a boy put in extreme circumstances who must figure out where he belongs in this world he's been thrust into. This tale has been told over and over through the millenia, but it still resonates when done right. Persons like G. Lucas did it with the original Star Wars series, and L.

Taran and his companions are quite likable and engaging, and their adventures are interesting and fun to follow.My only objection is that Lloyd Alexander doesn't do bad guys very well. At the various points in the stories where villians play a visible role, I found myself scoffing quite a few times at the silly monologuing and posturing.But these books are for kids, so I won't complain too much.All in all many hours of pleasurable reading."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"This book was a pretty good book, but far from perfect. The biggest problem was the final battle with the Horned King. It would actually be interesting if Taran didn't pass out right at the beggining and require it to be told to him.

The bad guys are maybe a little TOO evil, but Lloyd does a great job of making you dislike them, and fear them.

I am a children's librarian and I've long wanted to read this series. I had all the paperbacks on my personal bookshelf for years and often picked them up then put them back down. I have three children's series I want to read before I die: \\"The Dark is Rising\\" by Susan Cooper (read it a few years ago--very good); The Narnia series (I'm trying desperately to get through \\"The Horse and His Boy\\"); and \\"The Chronicles of Prydain.\\" I am thrilled to be able to tell you I recently finished this series. I just loved it! \\"The Book of Three\\" is one of the best in the series because it introduces the reader to most of the wonderful main characters. My favorites were Taran, the creature Gurgi (loved his way of talking, especially his fondness for \\"crunchings and munchings.\\"), the bard Fflewddur Fflam, Prince Gwydion, Dalben and Coll. Eliwony sometimes got on my nerves but I learned to like her. I'm so glad this was a series of five books rather than one huge one. I devoured them one right after the other but if it had been one big book I may not have read it. I also loved the last book in the series, \\"The High King\\" because everything came together. One of my other favorites was \\"Taran Wanderer.\\" The good vs. evil in this is so powerful. The characters, even minor ones, held this together. It is so very apparent that Taran grows up in these books. Eliwony does too but Taran is a likeable young boy and an even more likeable young man. The writing throughout the series is exquisite. I loved the line \\"...memory lives longer than what it remembers.\\""},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"When I was in sixth grade, my teacher decided that we were going to have reading time each day for an hour where she would read to us. I can't remember all the books she read to us, but one that I will never forget was The Book of Three. I fell in love with it and have read it many times since. I think that she read it to us to teach us a lesson: no matter who we are, even if we are only an Assistant Pig-Keeper, we are important and can make a difference. I hope all of my children will read it some day, too!Lloyd Alexander has a way of making you feel like you know each of the characters personally. I laugh every time I read the talks between Taran and Eilonwy! This book is definitely on my Top-Ten list, and I'm delighted to see that so many other people think so too! Although Mr. Alexander admits that it is perhaps not his best writing (it's certanly one of his earlier series'), he also says, in his proluge to the book, that it has been his favorite to write. I see why! It feels like Christmas Morning every time I reread this book!"},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"Lloyd Alexander has done an excellent job of creating a good fiction series that is actually more than just fiction, which is something that most modern fiction books fail to do. In this story, Taran is an Assistant Pig Keeper who longs to be a famous adventurer. Taran gets his wish, continually botches things while trying to be a warrior, and ends up concluding that perhaps he would rather be at home working in his garden than out fighting monsters and trying to save the world. It is a classic story of the battle between good and evil: there is a dark lord who has stolen the secrets of mankind and now man is forced to work the ground and labor to make a living. The dark lord tries to take over the world, and the forces of good rise to meet him. I would very much agree with those who think that Alexander borrows a lot from Tolkein. Gurgi is so similar to the \\"Smeagol\\" Gollum (when Gollum is nice for a while in the Two Towers) that it is almost impossible to miss the resemblance. It is not a bad thing at all, however, to have parts of a story be similar to Tolkein's. I would consider it a compliment actually.The characters in this book are great. Taran is a rash, reckless young man trying to be a leader and adventurer and often failing miserably, Gurgi becomes his loyal follower and his method of talking is rather fun, Eilonwy is a rather humerous heroine who, of course, always baffles Taran, Doli is an exceptionally grumpy dwarf, and Fflewdur Fflam is an extraordinarily funny bard who has a harp with strings that break every time he lies (he often feels the need to \\"add color\\" to the truth). I have rarely come across books with such a fun set of characters, and Alexander does a masterful job of weaving them together in this story.Overall grade: A-"},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"Lloyd Alexander's fantastic five-part Chronicles of Prydain begins with \\"The Book of Three\\", which is required reading for anyone who considers themselves a fantasy fan and/or a lover of children's literature - or in fact anyone who love a darn good book. And you can't stop there - make sure you have on hand the following volumes: \\"The Black Cauldron\\", \\"The Castle of Llyr\\", \\"Taran Wanderer\\" and \\"The High King.\\" Three of them have won or been nominated for the Newbery Award, and are loved by readers all over the world; they belong on the shelf next to \`The Lord of the Rings' and \`The Chronicles of Narnia' in terms of how beloved they have become.The series takes place in the mythical land of Prydain, a land of Alexander's own invention, but with many stylistic and legendary qualities borrowed from Wales' mythological traditions, as found in \`The Mabinogian'. Elements such as the Fair Folk, the black cauldron and the oracular pig, and characters such as Gwydion and Arawn are taken from real sources, and as such give the books a depth and resonance that is often missing from other fantasy books in which the authors make up the entire world themselves (or, as is more likely, copy from Tolkien). The over-riding story arc throughout the book is the battle between good and evil as waged by the evil Dark Lord Arawn and the heroic Children of Don, as seen through the eyes of a young Assistant Pig-Keeper - Taran of Caer Dallben.It sounds like a standard fantasy-fare, but Alexander infuses his work with delightful humour and wit, the afore mentioned shadow of Welsh legends, and colourful characters that are instantly taken to heart. Furthermore, he often puts more emphasis on the everyday vices and struggles of mankind rather than the more epic figures of good and evil, making the books more intimate and personal. The main struggle is encapsulated with Taran, a young boy living with the enchanter Dallben and the blacksmith Coll in a simple cottage. He dreams of glory and battle, but instead must spend his days tending Hen Wen, a white oracular pig. One day however, quite out of the blue he finds himself in the middle of an adventure, when a terrified Hen Wen flees into the forest, with Taran straight after her.Arawn's most feared warlord, the Horned King, is gathering an army to march against the Children of Don's stronghold, Caer Dathyl, and Taran soon finds himself caught up in the race to find Hen Wen before the Horned King and warn Caer Dathyl. On the way he meets with many allies and enemies: the talkative Princess Elionwy, the wandering bard-king Fflewddur Fflam (and his magical harp that snaps a string every time he lies), the bad-tempered dwarf Doli and the strange half-man, half-animal creature named Gurgi. From the sinister Spiral Castle, to the peace of Medwyn's valley to the mystery of the underground kingdom of the Fair Folk, Taran leads his odd company - hopefully towards a victorious end.Taran is a wonderful protagonist - full of lofty dreams and valour at the beginning, and gradually learning as the story progresses that war is not so glorious, and the burden of responsibility and leadership is a heavy one. Alexander constantly slaps him down, usually through the irrepressible Princess Elionwy, one of the most wonderful heroines of all time. Lessons about life, love, honour, loss, and tragedy are all contained within the story, but not so much that they become too preachy or overwhelming for younger readers. Alexander has a deft hand when it comes to incorporating such themes into his story, and balancing out these hefty messages with a healthy dose of humour (again, usually at the cost of Taran).If you have never ventured into Prydain before, then prepared to read a series of truly excellent books that you'll treasure forever. It goes without saying that \`the Chronicles of Prydain' have my very highest recommendation."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"I've been tutoring a fifth grader for sometime now and I assigned this book as an enjoyable read capable of truth and debate. This is a fabulous story with great characters, great adventure and some real values as well. The dynamic between Taran and Eilonwy [a positive woman character] is strong and Gurgi provides comic relief. For a young child who's seen Lord of the Rings but can't wrestle with Tolkien this is a good fit. This is up there with C.S. Lewis Narnia chronicles for best fantasy to read for third through seventh grade in my opinion.I loved it as a child and it provided a needed escape rereading it as an adult.

How exciting it now is to be able to hear this saga so consummately read. Actor James Langton easily inhabits each of the characters, bringing them to full life while never missing a beat. His pacing is perfectly tuned to the story of Taran who yearns for adventure.As some know it's difficult for an Assistant Pig-Keeper to find much to become excited about, that is until his pig makes a fast escape. A chase ensues which takes Taran through the woods and into great danger.However, in this classic tale of good vs. evil Taran meets a host of odd but wonderful companions who help him overcome the perils that have befallen him.A thoroughly entertaining listening experience.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"Mason Souza 11/30/03The Book of Three, Llyod AlexanderHas something ever happened to you that seemed small at first, but then snowballed into a major problem involving many people?

It changed very frequently which made it easy to move along. It was easy to concentrate on the story because you were sometimes given a vague description of a certain place, like if the characters were in a dark cave or grotto. This made you pay more attention to details than with other books and that is why I like that particular writing style. There were also surprises that you had to keep reading to find out about. All of this helped keep it from getting boring. And even though the story wasn't incredibly original, it did offer some unique twists that set it apart from other books. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys fantasy and doesn't want anything to be revealed too early in the story. I also think that fans of series like The Lord of the Rings should get this book, or even a realistic-fiction fan that is looking for something a little different."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"This book is the first of the 5 books which comprise the Prydain Chronicles. It introduces the reader to Taran, Caer Dallben's assistant pig-keeper, and his quest to recover Hen Wen, a pig with oracular powers. Through the course of the tale, the reader is introduced to the characters which accompany Taran on his adventures in the subsequent Prydain Chronicles.These books draw on Welsh myth for a large part of their names, background, and to a lesser extent, events. This is similar to Tolkien's use of Anglo-Saxon and Germanic legends to provide atmosphere to his tales set in Middle-Earth. I personally have always felt that this practice privided greater depth to their stories than fantasy novels which spring entirely from the imagination of the author.Now, caveat emptor: adults should be aware that this series is written for a young audience, with situations and dialogue aimed at that demographic. While the series is similar to Tolkien in spirit, it does not approach the depth of his tales set in Middle Earth. All together, it is lighter fare.I was somewhat disappointed that the maps present in the earlier editions were not included in the current printing. Yes they're primitive, but do help provide some perspective.IMO, no Fantasy library would be complete without the Prydain Chronicles."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"The Book of Three is an excellent adventure story by a fantasy king, Lloyd Alexander. The book follows the main character Taran, who is an assistant pig-keeper, as he journeys from his familiar home to the very heart of evil, trying to retrieve his oracular pig Hen-Wen before she comes into the clutches of the evil \\"Horned King\\"! Interesting characters include the king-who-wishes-to-be-a-bard Flam, whose harp strings break when he tells a lie, to the asinine Doli of the Fair Folk, to the beautiful Eilonwy, who Taran obviously begins to develop feelings for. With adventures like a rescue from an evil Lord's castle, the uncovering of a tomb holding armor and swords, and a battle with the Horned King and his evil minions, The Book of Three is an exciting and enchanting beginning to the five novels of Prydain. The other four in order are; The Black Cauldron(which was a Newbery Honor Book); The Castle of Llyr; Taran Wanderer; and The High King(which won the Newbery Medal). After you read The Book of Three be sure to continue the series with these other great epics!"},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"First off, I am a very picky reader and have had trouble finding one of those books you fall in love with and feel like you travel to that land or world. Prydain is like my enchanted magical land I can escape to when I feel like it. The feisty princess Eilonwy was my favorite character. She's wonderful in the Castle of Llyr. Taran is jealous! Well, all i have to say is don't disregard this book and not read it. Buy it!!! It's simply wonderful!!! The best book ever(especially if you enjoyed Narnia and Harry Potter)! I wish this series could last forever but sadly it is only five books."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"Even though this series is rated for children, I feel that it has much for adults, also. I first read this series when I was 11 and I have read them every year since (I am 25 now). Every time I read them, I discover something new about them. The flawed heros and heroines are charming in their realism. (After all, how many of us are anything like the tradional heros.) As well as each book containing a moral, which even though the books are fantasy, they still are relivant, but the stories have enough action and adventure to keep any riveted. I recommend them also to anyone who enjoys the Lord of the Rings. Definately a must have for any library."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"You better not get hooked ao this book if your Mom makes you go to bed early because this book will make you want to stay up all night long! This book is for people who like adventure,mystery and combat, for girls and boys. A young pig keeper (Taran) has a dream to be a warrior and a hero, he sets out with a prince warrior Gwydon. Little does he know that a big adventure with all kinds of enemies is about to begin. I guess my favorite part is when Taran meets his first monster, a cauldronbottom. I give this story five stars for the way it makes you never want to stop reading."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"I first read this book several years ago when I was about twelve, and I was thourouly enchanted from page one all the way to the end. Before this I hadn't read much fantasy and science fiction, but now that is pretty much all I read, since nothing else can quite measure up now! In this story, Taran Assistant Pigkeeper dreams of adventure far beyond the boring farm where he is fostered. He finds it sooner than expected, and is instantly catapulted into an adventure far beyond his wildest imaginings, as he and his newfound companions face terrifiying enemies, dangerous territory, and become a part of a much bigger scheme that is only just beginning to take shape... Taran himself in this book was not my favorite character, that spot being taken by Eilonwy, who is just plain awesome. She does what she wants no matter what anyone else says or does. This book was also easy enough, without lacking character development or action, so that I could easily lend the series to my younger brother who was 8 at the time. I would recomend this series to any young reader who loves fantasy, and even those who don't since this book might change their minds! In my mind, this series stands far above Harry Potter and many other less heartfelt fantasy books."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"This book is excellent. I loved it dearly when I read the entire series a long time ago. I want to read all of the books again and again. Great for children."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"Well, everyone has pretty much covered everything. I read these books about 12 or 15 years ago...I have never read a set of books so engaging. There are so many great characters in these books and their personalites all shine. By far I enjoyed these books more that Tolkkien's."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"While I first heard of the Chronicles as a young boy, I nevergot about to reading the series. A small card by the copies of bookssaid that in Sometown, Somestate stated that some parents wanted TBOTbanned from schools because the book was &quot;filled with black magic and evil incantations&quot; or something like that. After buying and reading the book, I realized that those parents obviously hadn't read the book. They made up garbage and probably thought that a skulled warrior on the cover certainly meant bad news for the mentality of their kids. Had they read it, I'm sure they would have found that they were sorely mistaken about their accusations and would have wanted to complete the series themselves. Lloyd Alexander has created a great tale about a boy who longs to be a hero, but he has glorified perceptions of what a hero is. Alexander made belivable characters, filled the novel with humor, and created another mythical region. Taran and the supporting characters have thoughts and feelings that everyone can relate to, and he wrote this book and the rest of the series in easy language. But this book is not just for 9-12 year old kids. As seen from the other reviews, people of all ages have read the Prydain Chronicles, as newcomers or for bringing back some memories of childhood. When this book is finished, you know you have to finish the series. Why any parent would want this book banned is beyond me. This book make you thimk of what false perceptions you may have once had, and how finding out the truth made made you a better person. Definetly recommended. END"},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"I have only read halfway through this book and have already fallen in love with it. many people who have read the chonicles of Prydain agree with me that Lloyd Alexander creates the perfect blend of and Welsh fantasy and universal mythology, creating what fanasy fans like myself love."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"I borowwed the entire series from my cousin and spent the entire summer reading of Taran, Eilonwy, and all the other lovable characters. The only thing I did not like was the fifth book- it ended! I encourage people to read this series 1-5, because It's been several years now, and I still think about the unforgettable characters. It had everything- adventure, magic, action, tragedy, humor, romance- This is a book for everybody of all ages (I was only 9 or 10) Please, If you liked the book of three, or the Shannara series by Terry Brooks, please read this series. It will leave you craving for more."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"I have been reading a number of young adult fantasy novels for research. I was not drawn into this one immediately, but after the first chapter the action of the story got moving and it was enjoyable. I especially liked the characters with the exception of one. Being female, I was not that amused by what I felt was kind of a stereotype - a \\"prattling\\", dim witted young female character that seemed to constantly annoy the protagonist. The back cover message promised romance, humor and adventure but I don't think romance was developed (no biggie)at all. It did have humor and adventure though. Overall, the book was good, a clean, uncomplicated storyline with well developed, diverse characters and descriptive settings."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"This was the best book I have ever read. What if tolkein copied his story from Lloyd Alexander? Besides, this is a pretty old book! so, theres no way people should rate only 1 star. Believe me! I read this book since 4rth grade(now im in 6th)it was the BEST BOOK i have ever read. I have also read the Castle of LLyr(wich is also by Lloyd Alexander), it was less interesting. THERE WERE NO BORING PARTS! If you have read the people that rated 1 star, and also said that there were boring parts, propably they just dont know how to read, or that read with difficulty.Im serious, READ IT!!!"},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"As a kid I read the Prydain books again and again. I can't resist some Harry Potter comparisons, and since they make a good common point of reference, I'll use the device here. The Prydain books aren't quite as exciting and magical as HP, but they have many of the same coming of age problems expressed through allegory, and frankly I find the characters better developed, more humorous, and more likeable. The Book of Three is the initial book of the Five, and Alexander gets things going pretty quickly in this one. He avoids formula, even though the plot when described could sound like a million sword and sorcerer books. The depth and likeablility of the characters lifts it above most fantasy books,though, especially fantasy books for kids. I highly, highly recommend them- at least as much as the HP books."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"More than any other series (other than Tolkien) this series of books firmly solidified my love of the genre at an early age.

Now I am in the middle of The Arkadians,another great book by Lloyd Alexander, and I also like it very much.I Iike The Book of Three because it's a good book, veryinteresting, and the characters are very realistic. I would liketo meet them! If you like Lloyd Alexander you might want totry Tamora Pierce and Diana Wynne Jones, too."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"Lloyd Alexander's Prydain Chronicles are one of the key series in children's fantasy literature, walking the fine line between being accessible to young readers and being appealing and engaging enough for adults to enjoy.The five wonderful books in this series feature an interesting cast of reoccurring characters, all centering on Taran, a pig keeper destined for great things. Others, including a stereotypical spoiled princess, a crazed Gollum-like creature, and a hapless bard, take part in a series of increasingly epic adventures.Because Alexander drew his stories from ancient myths and legends, the themes and situations always feel familiar. These will feel like stories you've read many times before, but never in a tiresome way. They're \\"comfortable.\\" And that's a welcome trait, especially when so many books try so hard to be different.This first volume if five, \\"The Book of Three,\\" is probably the weakest of the series (though it is by no means bad, or even average). Taran seems to get caught up in his adventure rather too easily, and initially, before we become comfortable with the characters, some of them are a little grating. Gurgi is almost a downright annoyance.But then the story really kicks into gear and develops into a nice adventure tale, setting the stage for the better Prydain books to come later. What \\"The Book of Three\\" does best is put in place the pieces of the great big puzzle that is put together throughout the next four books.And who couldn't love the delightful early stages of Taran and Eilonwy's relationship? Delightful and funny is every way. Children will relate to the characters and the way they pick on each other, while adults will smile knowingly as Alexander winks and nods.The writing is direct and lively throughout, and the pacing absolutely perfect. Just when one suspects a lull in the action is looming, Alexander races us forward and advances the adventure some more. Things are always progressing, always pushing forward, offering a tale that one is hard-pressed to put down.One of the great joys of this series is the steady progression from pure children's fantasy to more adult themes and a grimmer, more mournful tone, allowing the reader to grow along with the characters. The first book does not well reflect the last. What begins as a light fantasy becomes very serious. And that is a good thing.\\"The Book of Three\\" and the rest of the Prydain Chronicles are recommended reading for anyone who enjoys fantasy, especially classic children's fantasy."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"While waiting for the next Harry Potter book like so many others, I've been shopping around for a good series of books to read since HP rekindled my love of reading (and left me hanging slightly depressed at the end of the fourth book that the story was \\"temporarily over\\" until the next book comes out). Most of the recommended series (like Lemony Snicket's Series of Unfortunate Events) just didn't cut it. After the excitement, vivid imagery, and unforgettable characters of Harry Potter, they all seemed boring and shallow. Not so with Lloyd Alexander's marvelous Prydain Chronicles! My introduction to these books came several years ago (BEFORE our little wizard friend) when I saw Disney's animated film \\"The Black Cauldron.\\" Remembering that movie, I went to my local library several weeks ago intending to check out the first of the Prydain Chronicles, \\"The Book of Three.\\" Our library had five copies--and every single one was checked out. Rather than waiting, I purchased the book at a local bookstore and began reading it right away.What an amazing book! The characters have real depth, and the story moves quickly. From its beginnings in Caer Dallben, Taran's country home, the story takes us to an evil castle, dungeons, a secret underground village, and many points in between. With gentle humor woven in (Fflewddur's harp, for instance) and believeable characters in dangerous and exciting situations, this is among the best books I've read in the past several years. I finished the book quickly, then headed back to the bookstore to buy the next installment in the Prydain Chronicles, \\"The Black Caulron\\" which I'm enoying now.Harry Potter is a tough act to follow, but this book, written nearly 35 years earlier, does a remarkable job. It probably isn't fair of me to compare Harry Potter to The Prydain Chronicles, for the two are from different generations and tell very different stories. However, they are alike in the sense that both tell exciting coming-of-age stories with plenty of magic, humor, and terrific supporting characters. And, if you like \\"The Book of Three\\" there's no waiting for the rest of the Prydain Chronicles to be written and published--they were written in the 1960s and so, they're all available! You can read them just as fast as you like without having to worry about when the next will be available."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"I discovered these books almost 15 years ago when I was in grade school. At that time, reading was a tedious chore to me and I ended up getting them from the library to make my parents happy. I was, however, pleasantly surprised by the beautiful story line and the loveable characters. I can still remember passages between Eilonwy and Taran, and exactly how I felt when I came to the end of the series. I still read these books every couple of years because they are so close to my heart. With these books, I discovered other classics (adult and childrens), and eventually pursued my college degree in English. I have introduced these books to many people and they all agree this rates as high as CS Lewis, Susan Cooper, and even Tolkien. I highly recommend these books for anyone who is looking for a great story or trying to get a child to read...you won't be sorry with the results. To Lloyd Alexander--if you ever read this...thank you so much for writing the Prydain Chronicles and the Foundling and other tales. It was a wonderous journey into Prydain that I will never forget."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"I'm a real fantasy fan. I've read so many fantasy books that I've lost count. There's just something about magic and traveling warriors that captures my imagination and sends chills up my spine. The Prydain Chronicals are my absolute favorite. There are actually six books in all, though everyone thinks that there are only five. There's &quot;The Book of Three&quot;, &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot;, &quot;The Castle of Llyr&quot;, &quot;Taran Wanderer&quot;, and my personal favorite,&quot;The High King&quot;. Those are the most well-known ones. There is actually one more, called &quot;The Foundling&quot;. It contains a number of short stories about the land of Prydain, such as how Fflewdder Fflam got his harp, how Dallben was raised by Orrdu, Orwen, and Orgoch, how Coll saved Hen Wen, and many others. I would recomend reading this one first. Anyway, back to &quot;The Book of Three&quot;. I really liked this book, but I don't think it's the best of the series."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"'Unlike many readers, I came to the land of Prydain as an adult. When I was looking for a book to read aloud to my niece and nephew, my wife, having heard the book read to her as a child, recommended that I choose \`The Chronicles of Prydain.' It was a perfect choice.Lloyd Alexander's \`The Book of Three' is the tale of the first adventure of Taran, a young man who finds his life on a small farm in the mythical land of Prydain rather boring. The adventure that inevitably follows is less than remarkable to anybody who's read Tolkien, but the skill and humor which Mr. Alexander crafts his characters makes for a pleasant read for adults and a captivating experience for children.Taran, Eilonwy, Fflewddur Fflam, Gurgi and Doli, a group of unlikely adventurers, are thrown together in a quest to find the oracular pig Hen Wen and deliver her safely to Lord Gwydion all while avoiding the evil forces of Arawn and his champion, The Horned King. It's a rollicking adventure, firmly set in the \`classical' fantasy world originated by J.R.R. Tolkien.The many similarities between Tolkien's Middle Earth and Prydain are not by accident. Both spring from old folk tales of Northern Europe. Welsh folklore forms the base for Mr. Alexander's work, while Tolkien draws from folklore a bit more widely spread, including Beowulf and other Scandinavian sources.The distinctively Welsh nature of \`The Book of Three' (and all of the Chronicles of Prydain) is most apparent in the names of characters, places, and objects. Tounge twisters like Caer Dallben, Caer Dathyl, gwythaint, Oeth-Anoeth, and Dyrnwyn abound.Don't let that put you off from reading the book aloud. The writing, especially when Gurgi isspeaking, begs to be spoken.\`The Book of Three' isn't as heavy or as serious as \`The Lord of the Rings' and would be a great gateway into fantasy for readers a bit young to sit through Tolkien."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"My 9 year old son loves fantasy books.

But I've grown up a bit since then and so has the young adult fantasy genre, and, I think, the tastes of young readers. I think my daughter, who reads everything, will blaze through these books and quickly forget them, and my son, who reads only what is most rewarding, would find the first few books too dull and impenetrable to win his attention.The five books, together, plot the hero's journey of Taran, Assistant Pig Keeper. He's accompanied by a collection of companions, each defined by a few character and speech quirks that rather quickly grow dull. In the first three books they go on fairly conventional quests, which they succeed in by luck and happenstance rather than by any particular virtue of their own. Many curious elements are introduced, but nothing seem to come of them. The first book is titled \\"The Book of Three\\" and there is a \\"Book of Three\\" in it, but it plays no particularly important role in the story and you learn nothing about it. There's an oracular pig, who doesn't deliver much of anything in the way of oracles. There's a good wizard, who does no magic, but seems instead to spend all his time napping. An army of immortal evil warriors is introduced, but not confronted. It's all a bit perplexing, but it goes well enough with a hero who fails to be all that heroic.The plotting frequently seems rather clunky. You can see that the author needed something to happen, so he contrived some excuse for the characters to do it. Events don't really flow very naturally.It isn't until the fourth book, really, that the series begins to gain interest. In \\"Taran Wanderer\\" our hero seeks to find himself. He manages to shake off most of his annoying companions, and the book veers rather daringly into parable, generally the best possible way to be boring, but Alexander pulls it off. and the lessons Taran learns are deep and unusual.In the fifth book, \\"The High King\\" we finally get all the payoffs that were missing in the first three books. The oracular pig delivers an oracle, the wizard wakes up and does some magic, and so forth. The book is just payoff after payoff, and it is rather satisfying. So the long slog is rewarded in the end for the reader who persists.There is something of an issue with the female character, Eilonwy, who undergoes a backwards hero's quest. She starts as a half-trained sorceress and steadily loses power through the entire story, being trimmed more and more back to respectable femininity as the series progresses.Eilonwy's fading magic is partly standard 1960's sexism, but it's also reflective of the general distrust of magic in this series. You can find more magic on one page of Harry Potter than you'll find in this whole series. There's a lot more thumping people with swords going on than magic, and the magic is generally sternly disapproved of. It's a grim kind of fantasy that doesn't dare to have any fun with magic. That may have been the key attitude shift that led to the young adult fantasy explosion - celebrating magic instead disapprovingly stomping it down.So, it's a worthy series, but a touch dated, with many flaws, a slow start, and many dull and repetitive parts. It is not, by any means, going to be an automatic hit with most Harry Potter fans, but there are bits of it that are wonderful. I give \\"The Book of Three\\" four stars mainly because it is the start of a worthwhile journey. On it's own, I'd probably give it two."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"Just throw me onto the pile of Alexander worshippers.This series is not mentioned much in light of the advent of Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter but it should be. It's that good and, more than that, has more underpinning its tales than simple magic and wonder.Taran's journey is one of a boy becoming a man but it is also that of a child becoming an adult and therefore, I think, universal. The riff on celtic mythology is both puckish and authentic at once and Alexander's ability to get into the heads of his young characters is, frankly, unsurpassed.It's sad the Disney version added some tarnish to the rep of this tale but I'm confident that anyone who simply cracks the cover will recognize the magic within.Five stars."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"Readers who have watched the 1985 animated Disney film \\"The Black Cauldron\\" will no doubt recognize people and places from this novel by Lloyd Alexander. My advice is to enjoy the dark, creepy film but by all means, read Alexander's Chronicles of Prydain series. It's simply the best fantasy series written, ever.Before angry Tolkien fans berate me, let me just say that I loved the Lord of the Rings trilogy in book form as well, but some of his poetry is ponderous to get through. Alexander's sparse writing introduces us to a young man, Taran, who has recently been made Assistant Pig-Keeper by Coll, a farmer who lives with Taran at Caer Dallben. The pig Taran is keeping is named Hen Wen and her gift is foresight. She runs away, terrified of a vision she had and Taran chases after her. He eventually meets his hero, Gwydion, who is a prince and a warrior.Taran's journey to adulthood begins with this book. Most of the characters introduced her recur in the other Prydain novels, notably Fflewddur Fflam, Princess Eilonwy, Gurgi, Doli, Prince Gwydion, and Dallben. Taran learns much from Gwydion and his new companions about what being a warrior entails and before the end of the book, he has seen battle and engaged the book's foremost villain, the Horned King (also the villain of the 1985 movie).Alexander is a terrific writer and anyone who loves fantasy or action novels should read this series. It will stay with you long after you've finished reading. I first read the series in 1985-86, when I was about 17. I'm curently re-reading it for the third or fourth time."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"Based (though not strictly adhering to) pre-christian Welsh mythology, particularly the Mabinogion, The Chronicles of Prydain constitute one of the more original fantasy series written in the last 50 years.As the intended audience is younger readers, the writing is fairly basic and straightforward: no one over about 5th grade should have any difficulty with it. But the imagery and plot are interesting enough to hold an adult's attention. The characters are generally amusing and likable: some have called them derivative, but as this series was written decades ago, you must understand that it is other books' characters which are derivative of Alexanders', not the other way around.I think a copy of this series belongs in the library of every family with your readers, and the library of any serious fan of the fantasy genre."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"Being a big fantasy & fiction fan, I was looking for some new books that would interest (me and) my 9 year-old son. I came across a new looking set of Chronicles of Prydain at a local book store w/beautiful foil accent paper covers along with a pronunciation guide inside.I have highly recommended these books to many friends. I would urge anyone who may be put off by the Welsh character names, to not give up - but read this first book for at least 3 chapters. Great story about friendship, sacrifice, and determination (with some humor too!)Other books I would recommend: City of Ember, People of Sparks, Peter and the Starcatchers, Harry Potter, and remaining books in Chronicles of Prydain series."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"In this book you will learn the life of Taran.

It is very well written, and the content of the book shows that the author has a very vivid imaganation.

The characters are the most endearing part of this book-all from silly to gallant. The two main characters-Taran and Eilonwy are likable and relateable. Overall, The Book of Three is an adventurous coming of age story.This is not necessarily bad, but the book is EXTREMELY reminiscent of The Lord of the Rings. I mean like Alexander-ripped-off -Tolkien reminiscent. But, that's probably due to the fact that both series are based on the same Welsh mythology.At times, I was a little bored with the story. I could put the book down for a few days without reading it. It's a great story, but not a page turner."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"This is a great series.

I have read more than ten of lloyd Alexanders books including the five in this series. I is writed with such amagination and skill and at the end of the last book 50 different small actions and unsolved mysteries and everything about the book just comes all together and after reading a combined 1500 pages it is the most awsome thing. I have not met a person that has not liked it and now I read a lot. This is the first book and if you want your kid to get into reading then this is the book. Other ggod books of his are THE REMARCABLE JOURNEY OF PRINCE JEN, THE FOUNDLING, TIME CAT, THE TOWN CATS, WESTMARK, and anything writen by Lloyd Alexander"},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"When I was ten, before I'd ever heard of The Lord of the Rings, and long before Harry was even a twinkle in J.K.'s eye, my mother gave me _The Book of Three_ to take to camp with me. Before long, I'd devoured it and demanded the rest of the series, in which the Assistant Pig-Keeper Taran bumbles through high adventure with the help of a motley assortment of companions, and eventually finds love, himself, and his destiny before the story culminates in a grand finale in _The High King_, which won a Newbery Children's Literature award in 1968. Along with the Narnia books, it was this series that set me on the path to becoming a staunch fantasy reader all through middle and high school.Some twenty years later, I've pulled these down off my shelf for another read, rather the worse for wear on the outside, but as charming and endearing on the inside as they were when I was in Grade 5. Though the stories are written with a beguiling simplicity, their messages are hardly simple, but instead are heartwarmingly universal, and delivered with humour and compassion. The characters are vivid, if sometimes a bit stock, and everyone can sympathize with the trials of growing up that Taran and his friends encounter.Waiting for the next Harry Potter and have somehow missed these? Give them a try! Even though they're aimed at a younger audience, they're a great read."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"I would recommend it for any child or any adult. Taran, assistant Pig-Keeper, is a smart sympathetic character. The love between him and Princess Eilonwy is humor-filled and sincere. Taran's mentor, the wizard Dalben positively inspires. And Taran's charge the prophetic pig Hen Wen is just outrageously loveable. Other characters to look out for: the dashing High King Math, the nasty beautiful and complex Queen Achren, and the prince turned bard, and maybe he's not that good a bard, Fflewddur Fflam. This is an affectionate and magical series."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"\\"The Book of Three\\" is the first book in a five book series called the \\"The Chronicles of Prydain\\". This first book follows a young assistant pig keeper named Taran. He is a ward of old scholar and a middle age farmer, but Taran is unsatisfied with his life. Taran wants of adventure and soon finds it when his pig, Hen Wen, runs away one day. While searching for him Taran runs into several soon to be allies, Gwydion - a warrior prince, Gurgi - a furry humanoid creature, Eilonwy - a beautiful and magical princess, Fflewddur Fflam - a traveling bard, and Doli - a dwarf. Through the course of his adventure Taran and his allies are often hiding from or dealing with the dark forces of Arawn ( the Death-Lord) and his warrior servant The Horned King.The book has some obvious influence from the \\"Lord of the Rings\\", the furry Gurgi resembles the far darker and more conflicted Gollum. The allies that Taran gathers is not to unfamiliar to the Fellowship that combines in LOTR. Even the antagonist, The Horned King, strikes a resemblance to Sauron. Despite the similarities and thetongue-tying Welsh based character names. \\"The Book of Three\\" does mange to find it's own voice and rise above most of the clich&eacute;s. In fact it's a rather good primer for younger readers interested in fantasy. The plot goes in some unexpected directions and the ending is quite good and surprisingly grounded. There are better books in the series of Prydain, but \\"The Book of Three\\" gets things off and running."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"Never have I read a series of books that has commanded as much of my attention or affection as Lloyd Alexander's Prydain Chronicles. I was a fan before I even read the books, having been told about them by my older brother whose third grade teacher would read them to her class every day after lunch. At the mention of Gurgi's name, and hearing the phrase \\"crunchings and munchings,\\" I HAD to read this book, and soon thereafter swiped a copy from an aunt.And the book itself didn't disappoint! Taran leaves the safety of his home to find his runaway pig, only to encounter his hero, Prince Gwydion, and the most terrible warlord in all the land, the Horned King. After he and Gwydion are captured by the evil queen Achren, Taran is joined by the Princess Eilonwy, bard Fflewddur Fflam, and simple-minded creature Gurgi on a quest to warn Gwydion's people of the Horned King's threat.The excitement continues all the way to the end, Taran becoming older and wiser with each new experience he faces and person he meets. Entertaining for all ages, and a perfect introduction to the land of Prydain. I can't recommend this highly enough."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"Lloyd Alexander's \\"The Book of Three\\" is the first book in a series of fantasy titles collectively called The Chronicles of Prydain. In \\"The Book of Three,\\" we meet Taran, a boy who dreams of adventure but who leads an unexciting life - until the prophetic pig he is supposed to be guarding runs away. Chasing the pig through the woods takes Taran, the Assistant Pig-Keeper, far from home and into danger,...evil is stirring in Taran's homeland of Prydain. Meeting many unusual and oftentimes comical friends and experiencing the adventures about which he has dreamed, Taran must fight in an effort to keep the malevolent and mysterious Arawn from seizing control of Prydain.Adventure, magic, heroic battles, and the struggle between good and evil are secondary to the personal growth Alexander's main characters undergo during their journey. Although these characters seem stereotypical at first glance (a princess and a bard, to name just two), they are, in fact, unique and quite unlike many of the one-dimensional \\"fairy tale\\" characters one generally encounters when reading fantasy fiction.Taran and his compatriots make mistakes, say and do amusing and sometimes infuriating things, and find themselves maturing despite their foibles. Leaving these endearing companions behind after just beginning to know them would be difficult. When \\"The Book of Three\\" reaches its conclusion, one is delighted there are four additional books that allow us to continue to enjoy these characters' exploits."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"I grew up with fantasy books, totally on my own. The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings were my favorites, and were the books that I thought defined the genre. I vaguely remember coming across the Chronicles of Prydain in a library catalog while I was looking for something to read, and my take on fantasy has never been the same since.The five books in this series are usually marked as \\"Young Adult,\\" But as a thirty year old man, I have just read them for the umpteenth time and been totally enchanted. Yes, they are written for youngsters, but that just makes an adult voracious to read them faster. What drives these books are the characters, hilarious and tragic at the same time. Alexander's chronicles will always hold a place in my bookshelf as long as I live."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"I was alarmed at the number of reviewers who claim that this book is derivative of Tolkien's books. If anything, it is derivative of the Mabinogion, which inspired the names of many of the characters. I have read both series many times, and while I would put them in the same genre - fantasy - I would not compare them otherwise. I suppose they compare in this: if you did like Tolkien, you will probably like Alexander, and vice versa."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"The book of Three was an awesome book. It had loads of adventure, loads of creativity, and loads of fun reding. I recommend that everyone read this book. It all starts with an assistant pig keeper named Taran that lives with Cole and Dallben at Caer Dallben. But he is not related to Cole or Dallben. One weird day, there was a storm and one of their pigs, who is extremely smart, escapes. This pig, Hen Wen, senses that the Horned king, a very evil person is near her home. Taran was supposed to be watching her so he goes after her. Then the adventure begins. There is also an evil warlock named Arwin that gets in his way many times. To see what happens next, read The Book of Three by Loyd Alexander."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"If you've ever seen Disney's &quot;The Black Cauldron,&quot; you may already know that it's sort of a hybrid of the first two books in Lloyd Alexander's timeless Prydain Chronicles. &quot;The Book of Three&quot; is the first in the series, in which we are introduced to the characters who will stay with us through to the last book -- young Taran, the foundling who longs for adventure; wise Dallben, the ancient enchanter who raised Taran; noble Gwydion, prince of the realm; Gurgi, the ever-hungry what-is-it who befriends Taran in the woods; Eilonwy, the pretty young chatterbox who aids Taran's escape from the wicked queen Achren; and Fflewddur Fflam, the valiant bard with a tendency to embroider upon the truth. Evil is spreading through the land of Prydain (loosely based on the ancient kingdom of Wales), and it's up to our heroes to stop the advances of evil Arawn, lord of Annuvin, land of the dead. Arawn's champion, the Horned King, seeks the destruction of Dallben's oracular pet pig, Hen Wen; he himself can be destroyed only by one secret weapon. Can our new friends accomplish the impossible? New readers have been discovering the answer to that question for over thirty years."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"Lloyd Alexander's &quot;The Book of Three&quot; is an absolutely fabulous fantasy novel. It has a wonderful cast of characters, despicable villains, dwarves, and other fantasy creatures. One thing that makes this book so good is the way you can feel for the characters. This novel also has a load of adventure and battles.The novel revolves around Taran, an &quot;Assistant Pig-Keeper&quot; in the village of Caer Dallben. After an oracullar pig named Hen-Wen escapes, he is involved in an adventure to find the pig and deliver a message to The House of Don that The Horned King is in his way there.But all of this is stalled after another turn of events, which has Taran held prisoner in a palace. Throughout the adventure Taran meets wonderful supporting characters like Eilonwy, Fflewddur, Doli, Medwyn and tons of other people.The world that Alexander has created is fabulous in itself. With tons of villages and palaces, cultures and groups, you can never become bored with the land of Prydain.One reason I think I enjoyed this novel so much is because of the adventure and action. Alexander does a fabulous job here, and any reader will become spellbound with the way he hooks you with this.With all of this in the book, Alexander keeps the reader in suspense turning pages a mile a minute. He is able to weave everything together to make a most enjoyable read. Not to mention the amazing ending...Some of the things presented in this novel are amazing too. Like the way Medwyn has a special ability to communicate with animals and they know they're safe with him. Hen-Wen's abilities are really cool too.Being a novice to fantasy and wanting to read more epic stuff like Martin, Jordan, Hobb, etc., this was a great novel to really get me hooked. If you are starting with fantasy, then this is the perfect place to start.I have not read a novel this good in a while, and hope the other entries in the series are just as good. I reccomend this novel to young children and adults alike. Anybody will be able to comprehend the novel and will be held in suspense.&quot;The Book of Three&quot; is nonstop adventure from cover to cover. Lloyd Alexander takes some Welsh lore and mixes that in with his own outstanding ideas, and that equals a brilliant story. I definitely enjoyed this novel and am looking forward to reading the rest of &quot;The Prydain Chronicles.&quot; This is a definite must read.Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"I purchased this book based on a recommendation from a friend. My son has attention deficit disorder and absolutely hates to read. Our school system participates in the Accelerated Reader program, so independent reading is a huge part of the curriculum. Choosing a book with action and adventure is a must. We would read together every night -- and I never had to force him to sit down and do it like I have had to with other books for so many years. He would remind ME that it was time to read.The story is told so vividly that we could both picture what was happening. I could close my eyes and see the battles, the scenery and the characters. And the characters have virtue - something missing in so much literature for middle readers. I've already ordered the next in the series -- we can hardly wait!

I have also read the Castle of LLyr(wich is also by Lloyd Alexander), it was less interesting. THERE WERE NO BORING PARTS!

I bet if I went through the book I could come up with a hundred examples, but just off the top of my head:Gwydion - introduced as disappointing, scruffy figure just like Aragorn, later revealed as princely character; has broken sword; also, &quot;dies&quot; and comes back similar to GandalfGurgi = Gollum (but basically good, instead of basically bad), initially despised by Taranmythological hunter figure = Valar Oromegwythant = flying Nazgul mountCauldron-born = NazgulHorned King = Lord of the NazgulArawn = SauronAchren = Saruman/White Queen from NarniaNoah figure = Beorn/Radagast/Tom Bombadil, giving Taran/Frodo a Galadriel-like choice to stayMountain storm plus forbidding Black Lake = similar events facing the Fellowship trying to cross the mountain and at Moria's steps..etc, etc.Don't get me wrong... this is an incredibly inventive classic book, and many original elements could be listed, but I was stunned by some of the SPECIFIC QUOTES (e.g. Gurgi) taken from Tolkien.Obviously, Middle-Earth and Welsh legends share common sources, but Alexander was pretty obviously specifically inspired by Tolkien. I recall later books are much more removed from Middle-Earth models."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"book shipped much faster than expected and was in excellent condition. was so happy to find a hard cover of these stories!"},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"I teach 4th Grade and I had a small group of girls read The Book of Three.

The book is weird,funny,and exciteing,some of the book was boring."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"THE GOOD:* Good Welsh atmosphere.* Wholesome story for kids: good, clean, old-fashioned fun.THE BAD:* Hard to take the first book seriously because the main characters spend most of it looking for a pig.* Too many names and characters and nary a glossary in sight, save one for pronunciation.* Cliched situations.* Thinly-disguised liftings from Tolkien abound."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"I found this book via the vagaries of Amazon's recommendation system. Apparently I missed that it is children's literature -- as an adult reader I found it wanting in terms of depth, detail, character development, etc. It seemed like several elements were borrowed from Tolkien as well, which is probably fine if you're a 12-year old yet to read the LOTR trilogy, but not OK if you have. Anyway, I read George R.R. Martin's \\"Game of Thrones\\" after this, which I found to be much more engaging (and set in a similar, if less magical, setting), so if you're old enough to get into R-rated movies, I suggest that one instead."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"The book of three is an exciting tale of heroism, triumph and persistence. Like all good fantasy book it is a tale of an insignificant person rising above his or her containment's. In the case of this tale; it is Taran, an assistant pig keeper. Taran is the main character of this book, however had it not been for his friends and companions he wouldn't have gone far. He was rushed from his home on a small quest and found himself on one that held the fate of his world in its relevance. Taran is a humble yet dreaming young teenager, who finds that any one can evolve and change for the greater or the worse given the right circumstances, and time is not needed for these changes. In my opinion an exciting book not only needs a good plot, but good evolution as well. In the book of three one can watch the characters evolve and change to suit their situations and to learn from each one. I think that the way that the characters in this book learn and express their new knowledge of how the world works can be used to better ones own life. If I learned as fast as the characters in this book did I would get straight A's in school. The pace at which the characters evolve is a quite bit fast then it would be for the rest of us, but it doesn't hurt the story in The book of three to a great extent. I think that all in all the book of three is a good book with a great story and is interesting to many fantasy lovers."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"This is one of the first booksI read .And one of the best .I could not put it down , I was too interested Tarans' adventures to even try .

The author describes what is happening so well that it almost feels like you are in the book. The story is full of adventure fantasy and suspense; when you start reading it you can not put it down because you always want to know what will happen next or how it will happen. That is why I highly reccomend this book. I hope if you read this you will enjoy it just as much as I did."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"A friend of my father's brought me a box full of used books when I was 9 or 10. Tucked away in the bottome was The High King, the last in the Prydain Chronicles....it sat for quite awhile in my bookcase before I picked it up and began reading. What an experience it turned out to be! The adventures of Taran (Assistant Pig- Keeper), Eilonwy, Gurgi, Prince Llyr, and all the other charming charaters in their quest to beat the evil Horned King opened my eyes to the wonderful world of fantasy in children's literature. Indeed, after reading the High King I ran out and spent all my allowance (preciously saved) on the rest of the 5-book series.Lloyd Alexander writes with a refreshing and unpretentious stye, neither speaking down to kids nor falling into any of the cliched storylines or dialogue of many writers of fantasy literature. Indeed, I believe many authors of modern adult fantasy would greatly benefit from studying Mr. Alexanders writing style.I credit this series for the beginning of my 25+ years of affection for Celtic, Gaelic, and Welsh mythology and would strongly recommend this series for any lover, young and old, of fantasy and mythology."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"My dad bought me these books when I was young, and I read them throughout my childhood. Even as an adult, I re-read from time to time (part nostalgia, part loving of the story and the characters). I think these books are as good as The Lord of the Rings on many levels. If I had children, they would be the top of the list of books I would have them read. Great fantasy, great strong male and female characters, and lots of action, magic, and frights! Not to be missed!!"},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"The Book Of Three is an enchanting and inspiring tale for kids ages 9-13.

Along the way Taran picks some interesting friends, like Gurgi, Fflewddur, Eilonwy and Gwydion (Taran's role model). The Future of Prydain rests on them."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"In this, Alexander's first book of the Prydain Chronicles, the author weaves from simple beginnings a truly spectacular tale fit for all ages. The basis is the challenges of growing up, believing you are prepared for the world, and finding out to your surprise that the world is ready for you instead! That is the framework for a wonderful tale draped in magic, evil versus good, and the hope every young man holds out for himself, that in someone special's eyes he can appear to be a hero. The book is a must-have, one that parents will want to share with their children and their children's children. Get the new hard-bound editions of the entire series; ... they're a steal! Plus you get the original cover artwork from Evelyn Ness, which is so superior to the \\"Hollywood\\" art on the paperbacks."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"I had not read this series in close to fifteen years, and had forgotten many of the details of it. It was nice to be re-acquainted with Taran, and Hen Wen and Gurgi and Eilonwy and all the rest. But I had also forgotten how seamless the story was. It just flowed together with a smoothness that I nearly envy as an author a-borning and which any reader could appreciate.The story itself I enjoyed immensely, and found it a wonder that as many times as I read this as a child that I had forgotten so much of it. Most important of all, I found that I enjoyed it as much as an adult as I did when I was a child. This was especially enheartening, as much of the entertainments I had as a child I have outgrown. I have re-found a treasure."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"This book is one of the best books I have ever read. I liked this book a lot because it is a fantasy book and it is about an adventure. Those are my favorite kinds of books. I haven't really been reading that much because once I read this book I really didn't like and that discouraged me. After that I didn't really read much, until this book. It helped me realize that not all books are as boring as that one book I detested.This book is about an assistant-pig-keeper named Taran who wanted to have an adventure but was always just kept inside the safe and watchful eye of Dallben. That all changed when Hen Wen, the pig he takes care of, ran off into the forest and Taran was forced to chase after the pig. He met Prince Gwydion and later Gurgi, all of whom are very important characters later on in the book and later on in the series. In the end he is the one who helps defeat the Horned King (the \\"bad guy\\" of the book). People who journeyed with him will come out much in all the later books like Doli, Fflewddur Flamm, and of course, Princess Eilonwy.I liked this book a lot since it was kind of like the King Arthur books since there is fighting with swords and everything like that.

I read these books when I was young, and re-read them throughout my teen years and into adulthood. Sometimes the messages seem a bit heavy-handed now, but that is part of what makes it so good for kids. The characters are engaging, the life lessons not too complicated, and the story moves nicely. As a parent, I appreciated having romance develop without having sex as a part of it. Good clean fun. My daughter is looking forward to re-reading them, and I believe the characters will be \\"friends\\" to guide her through adolescence, as they were to me."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"The notable American writer Lloyd Alexander (1924-2007) won several awards for the 5 volume \\"Prydian Chronicles\\". The first book in that series is \\"The Book of Three\\" published in 1963.The following comments are for the unabridged audio book version of \\"The Book of Three\\" copyright 2004 by Random House. The audio book consists of 4 cassette tapes with a total play time of 5 hours and 3 mins. James Langton reads and does a commendable job with both the pronunciations and the changing of his voice as he represents the various characters.I was pleased that this audio book was unabridged so my comments can be based upon the entire contents not just some editorial decision of what to leave out and what to include.I well understand that these books are beloved by many readers but I must be honest and state that I am not inclined to listen or read any the additional volumes in the series. I found the plot convolutions predictable, the fantasy characters clich&eacute;d and the \\"quest\\" analogous to those found in Tolkien, C.S. Lewis and other writers. I am sure if I had read these books in the 60's and 70's, as a young adult I would of loved them. Of course I would not of had any knowledge of the literature to judge them against.I would certainly recommend these books to young readers and then urge them to followed up with Lord Dunsany, Jack Vance, Lewis, Tolkien and Lovecraft if they find an interest in these types of tales."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"Taran dreams of a life as a brave warrior, fighting the deathless soldiers of Arawn Death-Lord. But a life like that seems out of reach for a lowly Assistant Pig-Keeper who doesn't know who his parents are or where he comes from. When his charge, an oracular pig named Hen Wen, flees her pen after a terrible vision, Taran leaves the safety of Caer Dallben and sets out to find her. Along the way, he encounters a half-animal, half-human creature named Gurgi, the beautiful and clever Princess Eilonwy, and the stouthearted minstrel-king Fflewddur Flam. Together, the companions start on a journey that pits them against the Horned King, Arawn's most deadly minion. The Book of Three is the first book of the five Chronicles of Prydain, an epic story of one lost boy's quest to become a man and discover the true meaning of heroism.The Chronicles of Prydain brilliantly tell the tale of a young man grappling with his identity. During the course of the series' five books, Taran grows from a whiny, nave adolescent into a wise leader comfortable with himself and his adult masculinity. Young readers will feel encouraged by his successes and failures as he struggles to grow up. The Black Cauldron was a Newbery Honor Book in 1966. The High King won the Newbery Award in 1969."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"The Book of Three is the first book in Lloyd Alexander's Chronicles of Prydain series. This book series is inspired by Welsh mythology, and the geography of the book was inspired by the author's time spent in Wales during World War II. This book starts off as a traditional fantasy story, with Taran the farm boy going off on an adventure. However, through the course of this book, the story becomes far from ordinary. Taran is revealed to be a very flawed protagonist, who is a more adept hero in his imagination, than he is in reality. The book also introduces many more interesting characters: Eilonwy, the sarcastic and scatter-brained princess, Gurgi, the timid and self-loathing man-creature, Fflewddur Fflam, a truth-stretching bard, and Doli, the ill-tempered, yet loveable dwarf. The reason this book works so well, is that it avoids fantasy stereotypes, and tells a believable story. For any fantasy fans who are tired of the same old story, The Book of Three is a must read"},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"Best book I've ever read next to Harry Potter!The characters really come to life.

You tore your eyes cross words with the sensation that your eyes were slowly drying out; but it wasn't fun. Most stories given were about young boys and them eventually having to shoot their childhood dog (Old Yeller really isn't the only standout in what seems to have been a genre on its own); I only really enjoyed myself reading about myths and legends, because, on some small way, you could believe them and not be assumed completely insane (just insane with a respect for tradition).(Asterix was also popular with me, even though it'd be another 5 years before I'd start getting the historical in-jokes.)These books changed that; they were the first books that I read that showed something developing from little; Taran starts as the everyday protagonist, and hits many (especially those acquainted with the works of Lewis and Tolkien) as somewhat cliche. It's the fact that he and his band of friends don't stop when they're first introduced; they grow and change and learn from already interesting established characters, an aspect of narrative that were so negligible in the stories I was to read.These are stories that will give birth to a love of myths and literature; fantastic for anyone in the 9+ reading range and starting to find their feet in what genres they will grow to love."},{"Title":"The book of three","review":"The Book of Three is the first book in the Chronicles of Prydain (which the movie The Black Cauldron was based on).

We started in January with the first book, The Book of Three. The first book in the Chronicles of Prydain didn't hold up to the second, The Black Cauldron, which I read many times when I was younger, it was a favorite. Perhaps these many reads of the sequel are what lead to me not quite enjoying it as much as I would have. We are introduced to quite a cast of characters. Our main being Taran, the assistant pig keeper, and his pig, Hen Wen (I love that name, I wonder if it means anything).Taran meets up with an odd assortment of companions in the form of the annoying (at least to him) girl Eilonwy, and the bard, Fflewddur. They find themselves rushing to beat the bad guy, The Horned King, to the castle so they can warn the good guys about the attack. The story is enjoyable and easy to follow, but occasionally moved a little too fast for me. I could tell the author was trying to convey a feeling, but he moved on before it had sunk in.

This one may not have yet been made a movie, but I think it might be my favorite one of the bunch. Why? Well, I would have to say that it rests in the fact that the main character maybe on of Ellroy's darkest. The story picks up from the other books in the series, but from the perspective of Dave Klein. Klein has a number of demons haunting him, but as he deals with other events. The events get beyond him and he gets tied into a number of things that he simply cannot talk himself out of, so he has to become something new. In the process of all the action and manipulation we are treated to a good insight into the depravity of the human soul. Get it and enjoy."},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"This is the most amazing book I have ever read, taking me inside the mind of corrupt,insomniac rogue cop and lawyer Dave Klein, the most memorable of Ellroy's alienated hard men. The plot is tight, zig-zagging all over LA and through a map of the darl underside of fifties America. Although Klein has quite rightly been described as a repulsive human being, like all of JA's characters he is true to himself and has the shopsoiled integrity of a true noir character. The jewel of the LA tetrology, as well as the one that ties up the loose ends from the other three books, this is one that you just have to grit your teeth and read. (Not being distracted by Klein's punch-drunk internal monologue or the gore level, which is high even for Ellroy). A classic of the mystery genre, and of American literature as well."},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"Yes, I loved this book. It's got the usual Ellroy hallmark of big plots, dark characters and that obsession with the dark side of 50's/60's LA. Not as good as LA Confidential which is a masterly piece of work, but still a vital read, if only to finish off his classic LA Quartet.The writing style is the test to whether you enjoy any of his books. If you can't get to grips with it then I suggest you get something a bit lighter, but if you feel up to the challenge then I promise you a riveting read."},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"Ellroy is a gambler. In *White Jazz*, he lays a long bet that after a race through bloody L.A. streets, pulse thumping with the staccato jazz beat of the prose, eyes opened wider than wide, senses rattled by shotgun blasts of obscenity, love, intimacy, breathless from the searing heat of the thing, his reader will survive still lucid enough to savor the poetic brilliance of his final pages. In my case, Ellroy wins. The bet pays big. The novel's final notes are worth every moment of disorienting dissonance that they follow.The reader savvy on Ellroy knows this is a bet he has made before. Think *L.A. Confidential*. And it's a bet I've never seen him lose. As in that other dizzyingly intense novel--as with so many of Ellroy's characters--the end transcends the means, the means defy imagination, and closure is some kind of myth only mentioned by quack-shrinks to movie stars.Ellroy tells this story through the unflinchingly sharp eyes of cop/attorney/slumlord/bagman/enforcer Dave Klein. To spill details--any of them--is to say too much. In part, this is because Klein's burning need for details drives much of the action. In part, it is because Ellroy weaves a plot together with such panache that to reveal how any of the pieces fit is to insult his craft. Suffice to say: L.A.'s wretched past will not stay buried; Klein's own past is unearthed with it; the demons that are exhumed are hideous and riveting.Here Ellroy's prose is even more stripped-down than in *L.A. Confidential*. It resonates with the bebop jazz rhythms that were the soundtrack of those hot L.A. nights. Sometimes I felt lost in it, disoriented and battered by the explosive riffs. Other times I rode crescendos to moments of clarity in which I knew I was catching just that vibe that Ellroy meant to deliver. Just as great jazz rewards the attentive, energized listener, Ellroy's prose repays the focus and effort it requires to follow it. Musical metaphors fall short, though. Ellroy's prose style makes for a tough, at times jarring read. I find his prose-craft to border on the poetic, form and content aligning to enhance the reading experience. But no doubt some readers will find his prose unpleasantly sparse, sharp and intense. Yet the very sparseness of his prose if one of Ellroy's strongest tools of characterization. We learn about Klein not just from the details he notices, but from the mountain of things we know he ignores. The sharp sentences help sting us with the violence and horror of the content. And with respect to intensity, I will say only this: No one writes action like Ellroy. It is something to behold.To the reader savvy on Ellroy: There is nothing new here. He creates again the same burning, sulfur-stinking, hell-tinged world you have come to expect from him. He peoples it with black-hearted, twisted, sadistic men. He sets them against one another. And he telegraphs the chaos. But he telegraphs it masterfully and finishes with such a flourish that I regard this as one of his finest novels.He transcends genre. The man doesn't write crime fiction. He writes brutal, resonant, savagely real literature. And he writes it well."},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"WHITE JAZZ stared at me from the shelf for two years before I cracked it open. I read a few pages and put it down, annoyed. It was confusing. I couldn't adapt to its beat. But I picked it up again and plunged in deeper. The rhythm of the staccato prose kicked in. The urgency of the plot swept me up. This stench of corruption overwhelmed me. It was intricate, complex, assured -- brilliantly freeform but always tightly structured. Late night reading led to swirling nighttime visions -- jazz that kept playing long after the pages had been slammed shut. Dangerous. Addictive. Feverish stuff."},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"This is probably my favorite entry in the L.A. Quartet, mainly because there's a sharper focus and economy of narrative that I sometimes felt the other books lacked. Much as I loved The Big Nowhere, for instance, it contained a number of passages that felt bloated and needlessly repetitive. White Jazz is a much leaner work, with a clipped style that perfectly matches the setting and plot. While many readers seem to think Ellroy took his staccato prose too far with The Cold Six Thousand, in this book there's a nice balance of short bursts and longer, more elegant lines. (Personally, I thought the style of the Cold Six was brilliant, but can understand why some might find it a distraction.) For devoted readers or those just getting acquainted with the Demon Dog's canon, White Jazz is a strong and satisfying read."},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"Creeps, crooks, perverts, drug fiends and freaks...welcome to the LAPD. If you've never read Ellroy before welcome to his world, a rather dark and disturbing place.This novel, like American Tabloid and The Cold Six Thousand, contains Ellroy's machine gun prose. It is at first off-putting, but ultimately terribly satisfying. His writing style is spare, no unnecessary words at all, brief descriptions that still give great detail. Fantastically drawn / evil characters that collide at the end.In short - bit weird but I loved it."},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"(Actually 4.5 stars) As a reader I was relatively new to James Ellroy and his work. Having purchased this book at an airport shop I wasn't expecting a great deal from it. Boy was I mistaken! What amazed and enthralled me more than anything about White jazz was the way in which the characters draw you inexorably into their own corrupt, upside-down world. Weaving together a cast of magnetic (if morally suspect) people and a Byzantine plot Ellroy manages to immerse us totally and effortlessly in Dave \\"the enforcer\\" Klein's seedy L.A habitat. This being my first brush with Ellroy I (like a few others evidently) found his staccato, machine gun style of prose hard to follow at first. But after a while I found that the writing style suited and complimented the content greatly, and if anything it added to the overall effectiveness and weight of the story.White jazz works both as a good old fashioned crime noir, and as a fascinating look into the darker recesses of the human soul. Brilliant stuff."},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"This is the creation of a new type of writing style. No other book (even of Elroy's) has it. He backed away from it after this book.

But after easing myself into Ellroy via his earlier books, I found White Jazz utterly compelling and moving. His characters faults and virtues are so strong and intensely conveyed that I now have a problem reading anything else - it's all just too bland compared to Ellroy. The violence isn't heroic and glamourous, it's ugly and disturbing - like it should be. The plot is, as usual, very convoluted. Although the details are convincing, the story as a whole isn't. But it doesn't matter - style and imagery makes up easily for this. A masterpiece, again."},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"Ellroy takes his already twisted prose on an even moremindbending direction.

His prose reads like the straight whiskey or speedballs his characters inhale like food and water. I do not know if our culture is a better place because of him and I know my psyche is not in its best shape since a recent bout of reading him, but I know this: White Jazz joined the pantheon of great crime novels the moment it was published. Hammet, Chandler and even Thompson would be wigged out and frightened by Ellroy's tough as nails realism and characters over the edge of morality, but they would recognize him as a member of their club without question or hesitation.In this book, Ellroy's writing is at its improvised, scatty best. His prose has a swinging rythm unlike anything I have ever read: it has patterns, ebbs and flows. He builds to crescendos which have a feeling of inevitablilty but also manage to shock, scare and thrill the reader with a force unlike anything I have ever read.

Its plot revolves around the activities of anutterly corrupt member of the Los Angeles Police Departmentin 1958. All of the book's characters are totally withoutconscience and have virtually no redeeming features, thereare no Chandleresque 'white knights' walking these meansteets. Ellroy portrays an anarchic world in which the pur-suit of money and power (political and sexual) have drivenout every shred of human decency. Even that bastion of theAmerican way of life, the family, is shown to be invaded bythe darkest of perversions.LA in 1958 was a get-rich-quick boom town; in fiction thistype of environment is often portrayed as bringing out thebest of the American can-do spirit. But here Ellroy showsthat it can also attract the moral dregs of humanity. Thestory is told in a relentlessly concise and frenetic stylewhich hard to get used to at first but which is entirelyappropriate to the frantic, grasping almost demonic peoplehe portrays. James Ellroy has shown us the darkest side ofthe American dream - set in the city of dreams itself, butunlike so many of Hollywood's attempts to show the bleakerside of life, there is no redemption here, no ultimatetriumph of the good guys and the 'American way'. This bookis a challenging read, both because of its style and itssometimes shocking portrayal of evil, but it is a thoughtprovoking one."},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"Dave Klein's as bad as it gets. B&amp;E's, beatings, murders, erotic fixations on siblings, even slum-lording.He's a cop.And he's the main man in James Ellroy's WHITE JAZZ, an new-fashioned pulp tale juiced on speed.Ellroy's become famous for crackerjack plots, in-your-face bad cops, political backroom boys willing to deal, and a threadbare style north of Hemingway. All these elements are present in WHITE JAZZ.It's a fast read--sort of like flying through LA at 80 miles per hour (you catch a glimpse of things sailing by, but you never see enough of any one thing to truly take it in). If anything, this is the major problem with the book: you get hyped images but you never slow down long enough to see the view (Klein himself is a bag of unpleasant characteristics, never quite jelling into a character).This is due to the slash-and-burn style Ellroy deploys here. A master of whip-sharp declarative sentences, in JAZZ Ellroy pares down past the bone into the marrow; the result is often amusingly blunt, but in spots, confusing. The fleshing out of characters is a casualty of the style; sentence fragments do not a human make.The plot, too, is a bit much. Though it's probably based on actual events, Ellroy might take heed of Tom Clancy's view of fiction vs. reality: &quot;Fiction has to make sense.&quot; In JAZZ, every law-enforcement agency is so out of control, credibility is broken about halfway through; the best way to enjoy the second part of the book is to imagine it as a satire.This is not to say there aren't good things in it. It's never boring, and there are some memorably twisted motivations among the bruises and gore. The final chapter is stinging and almost laugh-out-loud funny.On the whole, though, it's not a work worthy of the author of AMERICAN TABLOID."},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"Ellroy is at his most depraved in this story of corruption and murder in the LAPD during the late Fifties. He piles one atrocity upon another until the whole thing sinks into a grisly, self-conscious parody.The plot is way too complicated. Ellroy acts as if he felt that in order to make this book stand out he had to litter the landscape with more perversions per square mile than any city could possibly hold. Then he layers in one of those sad, squalid, improbable love affairs that tough/bad/sick cops are supposed to thrive on and drags us along for what seems like an eternity before he reveals everything. I still don't know exactly what happened, and I don't care.Ordinarily, I like Ellroy. He has an excellent, clipped style that sounds like rocks being chipped from a boulder. But in this case, the sculpture that emerges is ghastly and unbelievable. Try something else, unless -- you're a masochist.EKW"},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"And the review below by 'Stone Junction' is dead on! :) This one wraps up the LA series pretty well, and carries on Ellroy's tradition of subtle almost-justice for the antagonists and very heavily intertwined plots.

Everybody else should just start with The Black Dahlia."},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"As an enthusiast of dark, humorous fiction, I took to Ellroy immediately. And this book is the best of his that I have read (except, perhaps, American Tabloid). Ellroy has trimmed the fat from his prose, and the book comes on hard and fast, with enough plot twists, cussin', blood, guts, and grit to jolt even the most blase reader. In White Jazz, I find Ellroy's closest literary equivalent to be Celine--it shares a common bond to Celine's frantic energy, sylistic indulgences, obsessions, and amoral fatalism. This is a brilliant walk down a very dark path. Not recommended for the sqeamish, the politically correct, or those who do not like experimental writing styles."},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"I've become a somewhat obsessive fan of Ellroy's novels -- his style is immensely enjoyable (for some), his plots are always intriguing, and his characters are always engaging.

Confidential,&quot; or &quot;American Tabloid.&quot;At the end, I didn't feel completely satisfied (but do you ever really feel &quot;satisfied&quot; after reading Ellroy?!!) -- I kept hoping that there would be something more. Still, if you enjoy Ellroy's style, then this one's for you -- it's dark, hard-hitting, cynical... Basically, it's everything you'd expect from Ellroy! Dave Klein is one of the most complex and intriguing of Ellroy's characters and that's says a lot! Although I despised him, I also felt sympathetic towards him... It was very similar to how I felt towards Jack Vincennes, Bud White, and Ed Exley in &quot;L.A. Confidential.&quot;"},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"L.A. in the Fifties?

Go, Mr. Ellroy."},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"\\"White Jazz\\" is the fourth and final installment of James Ellroy's L.A. Quartet of novels, with \\"The Black Dahlia,\\" \\"The Big Nowhere,\\" and \\"L.A. Confidential\\" preceding it respectively.While The Black Dahlia and L.A. Confidential are naturally more well-known to mass audiences because of their film adaptations, The Big Nowhere holds its own as an example of -- to plagarize the critcs -- \\"hard-boiled, no-nonsense 1940s-50s corruption and decadence.\\" White Jazz is an okay book, and the same kinds of language and style are found here too, but it just isn't as good as the other three. I think White Jazz is passable, but it may have acquired the status of \\"classic\\" based on the greatness of the other three rather than on the strength of its own qualities.Each of the three novels preceding White Jazz gets increasingly difficult to read, with fewer and fewer connecting words and phrases, and often resorts to stream-of-consciousness tactics a la Virginia Woolf, albeit on a more profane and graphic level. If one were to read out loud, for example, excerpts from L.A. Confidential or The Big Nowhere with no previous experience reading Ellroy's work, that person might encounter some difficulty with adapting themself to his style of writing. To read out loud from White Jazz without familiarizing one's self with the almost incoherent writing style may result in the reader sounding like they're muttering a lot of violent and racist gibberish. Needless to say, the LA Quartet isn't for everybody, even if people really thought and spoke the way Ellroy portrays in the 40s and 50s..White Jazz isn't as good as the previous three novels, in my view, for three main reasons:1- its story doesn't sound as original as the others; it seems like slight rehash of Ellroy's earlier storylines, and the whole incest angle strikes as inherently repulsive rather than locally grotesque2- it is even harder to read than his earlier novels, making it a somewhat laborious experience3- the story -- what there is of it -- just isn't as engaging as the plots of the previous three booksI read \\"The Black Dahlia\\" in only a few days, same with The Big Nowhere, but I keep finding myself setting White Jazz down because it just doesn't grab my attention like Ellroy's other books. That's about all I can say about this book without spoiling plot points, so I'll just end with the advice that if you're an Ellroy fan (like I am) you'll probably find things to enjoy about this book, but it's harder to read, and therefore you might have to invest more effort into simply understanding what's going on. Whether or not it's worth it, is up to the individual reader."},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"I am a big Ellroy fan. I have read almost all of his works. L.A. Confidential and the Black Dahlia are probably his two best. So far, I think this is his worst book. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I wasn't bothered by the violence or the plot, or the fact that Dave Klein is not much of a hero for a central character. He's even more flawed than Bud White. What made this book such a disappointment was the writing style. Even for Ellroy, it was too clipped, too abrupt. It was not only hard to read, but it sounded forced; like someone trying to write like the voice-overs in B-movie film-noir detective stories. It just didn't ring true."},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"If I recall correctly, this story is written in crime noir. I am not as familiar with the procedures and the jargon used back then as I am with current procedures and jargon. Therefore, I found the story more difficult to understand than I find current crime fiction to be. This is not because of TV shows like CSI, etc., although I watch those with close attention."},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"Disappointing considering it's an Ellroy. If it were written by someone else, it would be a great book, but I hold him to a higher standard since I know he's capable of it.Like all of his books the plot is an intricate web of corruption and nefariousness whipped up to the nth degree of complication. The \\"hero\\" is the usual motley mix of petty corruption and feeble instincts for good. The prose is standard Leonardese, chopped up, manic sentience fragments that should fail utterly but come together in a weird poetry of immediacy and power. Still, despite all that, this book disappoints utterly and completely."},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"Elleroy does a fine job of making me feel like i don't know what's going on.

So much so, that I often wonder if I am on Candid Camera."},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"I really liked his earlier books, but Ellroy has let the reviews go to his head. He no longer writes, he just jots down phrases. It is not a leaner prose this way, just jerky and slow.Hemingway and Hammett wrote lean prose -- in complete sentences"},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"White Jazz was intense and lived up to all my Ellroy expectations...the only problem is that that description only applies to the last 160 pages! Having loved the Black Dahlia and American Tabloid, I picked up White Jazz. It took me three tries to get past page 200 before it was a story worth reading. If you love Ellroy, go for it. Newcomers, ABSOLUTELY do not make this your first taste...Something more to Ellroy's credit is that I found Klein to be a fascinating character (unlike some of the reviewers)...he was bad, real bad, but human and you can't ask for much more than that in good fiction."},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"Ellroy's style -- terse, rapid fire, compelling (at times). Like porno, attracting, fascinating, repulsing -- ultimately boring. Bad cops, bad guys, murderers, dopers, low-lifes. Life at its lowest, meanest. Evil with no insight.Who lives? Who dies? Waste 'em! Who cares?"},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"I hated this book. Why? The style Ellroy wrote in made it difficult to follow exactly what was going on; his typical prose is great, but here it's almost like a play script. Except, he'll take away the notice of who is speaking, and it breaks up the rhythm of the read. You have to go back and figure out who is saying what in a multi-person dialogue. It's annoying. This experiment bothered the hell out of me.Secondly, why are all his plots and characters roughly the same? The protagonist: an ethnic German cop or ex-cop, usually brutal, usually corrupt. The main bad guy? Always a mastermind highly corrupt cop. Throw in depraved sicko sexuality to taste. The setting is always L.A., but that's Ellroy's signature and I like that.In short, this is the worst Ellroy novel I've read but I still had to finish it."},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"This book is the last, and worst, of the LA Quartet, but let me hasten to add that White Jazz only suffers by comparison to the earlier works. Black Dahlia, the first in the series, may be the best novel of the 20th century. Read Hollywood Nocturnes first to get an idea of Ellroy's prose, then dive into Black Dahlia. Killer on the Road is an excellent stand-alone novel."},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"Totally unreadabl"},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"This book stinks. Pe--yew. I normally enjoy Ellroy's flashy style, his from the hip dialogue and narration; Ellroy's style tends to attract today's short-attention spanners. But, this reads like Ellroy's normal style hopped on the speed his characters like to pop. You must have to be on meth to be able to follow this garbage.

When his publisher protested, the author cut down the book to itspresent length by eliminating verbs, articles, adjectives, and most other parts of speech. The result is a breathless gallop through a darkly fascinating world of murder, incest, perversion, corruption, greed, and lust. And that's just for starters!Reading WHITE JAZZ is like reading Anthony Burgess's CLOCKWORK ORANGE. The language is a m&eacute;lange of English, LAPD crimestoppers' jargon, and 1950s pulptalk. Be prepared to deal with 187s, B&E;, bootjacking, hinkiness, FIs, 459s, IAD, rebop, snarfing with soshes -- among other things.What makes it all worthwhile is that Ellroy has a great story to tell, and he tells it well even if he invents his own language that only tangentially resembles English. Be prepared for harsh lights thrown into the darkest parts of the human soul. Beprepared for almost universal corruption, varying only in degree. As you spiral into the depths with Ellroy, you can almost feel the walls converging and the floor dropping from under you.This is a worthy conclusion to the author's Los Angeles Quartet. Be sure to read the novels in sequence for a sweeping panorama of 15 years of postwar degradation: THE BLACK DAHLIA, THE BIG NOWHERE, L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, and -- not least of them -- WHITE JAZZ."},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"Dig: Every book in the L.A. Quartet is a must. Every one of them. Feature you read just one or start in the middle, you're a chump. White Jazz - a great closer. Can't miss.After reading the first three novels in the series, I was reluctant to read White Jazz. I was scared off hearing so much about Ellroy's deepening usage of staccato prose and unattributed dialogue. I was led to believe the book was almost written in an experimental language. Well, I am writing this review for one purpose: to keep people from being fearful of this amazing book. If you like Ellroy, and if you've enjoyed the quartet thus far, you'll love it.Is White Jazz my favorite in the series? No. I still prefer L.A. Confidential, followed by The Big Nowhere. But White Jazz is much more evolved than The Black Dahlia. And as brutal and dark as it is, White Jazz has more laughs than all the other quartet novels combined. While the novel's halting presentation doesn't allow you to roll through the pages, that's almost a blessing, because every line is dense with nuance and information. You want to pay attention.I absolutely recommend reading the series in order, and if you're through L.A. Confidential, you simply must complete the quartet. White Jazz strikes the perfect notes in capping the series, and ties up a few ends along the way. It is beautiful, savage, powerful and stunning.Feature it's more challenging than a Grisham book. Feature that's a good thing. Dig: No big deal. Don't get scared off. Brass knucks/brain swelling/reading in bed. Big fun - big reward. CRAAAAZY."},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"Feature: Chief of Detectives Edmund Exley, the once morally ambiguous hotshot in LA Confidential, now revealed to be a dangerously polished hyena is mad at the Feds, who are now launching a full fledged investigation into his insalubrious efficient gutter that is the LAPD. At one of his many press conferences, he says of the probe: \\"It will fail because he (the Fed head of the probe, Welles Noonan) has grievously underestimated the moral rectitude of the Los Angeles Police Department.\\" No such luck, moral rectitude is never an issue here. The only thing an inquirer may underestimate is the survival skills of the inquired.The slime-balls are all here. James Ellroy's White Jazz is the authentic feeling, brilliantly foul continuation of the life and times of the various parasites that populate the 50s LAPD and the corrupt politicians, drug-pushers, tabloid hounds, pornographers, pimps and prostitutes they feed on. It is a first person account by lieutenant Dave \\"the enforcer\\" Klein. A casual murderer of numerous witnesses and others that happen to be in the way of where ever he's going. He doesn't feel bad about it, probably doesn't have time to. But he does admit certain queasiness after a kill. Ellroy's novel is too hardboiled to be one of redemption, but he does offer castigation to all his sinners. There is for instance Klein's unsubtle incestuous obsession with his sister. In fact, incest seems to be Ellroy's preferred method of punishment. A longing that can never be satisfied, and if satisfied will be the source of infinite desolation. At the center of this hell is a diseased family Klein observes as an investigator. They are a crime family, long involved with the LAPD. Their numerous afflictions are of the darkest kind, and are the source of the novel's deceptively euphonious title. The family is also a reflection of Klein, of his irreversible destination.Often in crime tales (both films and books), characters seem to have becomes criminals for the exclusive privilege of spouting phrases like \\"waste em\\" or \\"clip em\\". They seem to be enjoying sounding like criminals, which of course menas that they are not real criminals. They are the work of a cuss-happy author delighted by all the evil he can shock us with. Ellroy is something else in this regard. He recognizes that corruption, for whatever reason, is more inherently attractive then goodness in fiction. His characters speak the language that most readers will believe is the language of criminals, then imbues their world with such loathing that the language seems merely functional. Not comedic. His characters are all slaves to their lives, some happy, some dead. But almost all, incapable of change. If you consider White Jazz, the only one that seems to be at peace is the that joyously eloquent scoundrel Dudley Smith. He is distinguished as villain in a world of villains only by the apparent cheerfulness with which he goes about his nastiness. If you're interested in the dark corners of Ellroy, you may want to check out Irvine Welsh's appetizingly titled FILTH. That novel achieved a magnificent scatological poetry of self-mutilation from which Ellroy deliberately eschews.Ellroy's style is ofcourse an integral part of all his work. You'll find it mimicked and explained in almost all the reviews, a source of both complaint and admiration. I personally felt that it was a two edged sword. On the one hand his bizarre stream of police form consciousness, with those one, two or three word sentences is often disorienting and opaque. It is always a relief when a character speaks, complete sentences for a change. It resembles a departmental form, ambiguously filled out by the narrator and understood by the few who have had similar experience. Soon enough, you get used to the rat-a-tat rhythm, recognize the names, but White Jazz remains, to the very end, exhausting to read. On the other hand, the style adds to the realism of the whole thing. If you have to exude such effort to get into this world, then it becomes that much more vivid. Your enjoyment of the novel will depend almost exclusively on your acceptance of Ellroy's prose. Once that hurdle (or blessing) is bypassed (or embraced), your are left with an uncensored stream of shocking facts. JUST THE FACTS as that TV show in LA Confidential used to advertise. And they're incredible."},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"The final showdown that LA Confidential promised us comes together in this novel. Ed Exley and Dudley Smith finally go at it through a most unusual go between who doesn't know what hes getting into between these two, Dave Klein. Klein is a corrupt Vice cop in every way. He's out for himself. But when he gets drawn into the big chess match played by Exley and SMith he starts to question what hes been doing and who he is. A great finish to the authors LA crime novels. Don't be afraid of the style and prose. You'll get used to it quick."},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"Situation: Ellroy at his most unflinching.

Not much.Progress: time off, eyes refocus. Hammering lets off a bit. Later: return to the scene. Synapses screaming. Masochist: back to playtime.Done. Fadeout: brain circuits, dark. Rest. Brutal."},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"I'm a big fan of a wide variety of fiction. Regardless of genre, I admire bold experimentation with prose technique. It doesn't get any better than Nabokov or Faulkner for me. I also like writers who tell far more conventional stories but do so with a flair for language, like Robertson Davies or, in the detective fiction area, Chandler and Hammett.The bottom line? Ellroy deserves to rank not only among Chandler and Hammett for quality of his crime fiction, but, with White Jazz, among Nabokov and Faulkner for the style of his language. White Jazz mainlines the experiences of the protagonist straight into your nervous system, white hot and unfiltered. It takes some adjusting. For the first thirty pages or so, my head hurt. Then something clicked and I was utterly blown away. Perhaps the most visceral read I've ever experienced. And aside from the style, the story is a gripping descent into the dark side of human nature, as typified by the crime and police world of 50s La. This is really as good as crime fiction gets, and some of the best writing from any author of the 20th Century.American Tabloid may be his most satisfying book in a lot of ways, but White Jazz is a work of art. Grim, disturbing art, to be sure, but I find that necessary at times."},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"I really liked the style this novel was written in and I agree that it should not be a reader's introduction to Ellroy. His rat-a-tat-tat narrative and dialogue is at it's most efficient and elliptical. True, it is sometimes hard to follow. But never in a frustrating way. My god, I read too many reviews on this site that slight a book for being hard to follow. This is hard to follow and I'm thankful for it. It challenged me, forced me into a closer reading. If I have any criticism of the book it is that the style overwhelms some of the characters. By the end, I wanted the main character's behaviour to reflect the manic, fragmented tone of the story he is narrating... it never quite got there for me. Still, it's one of Ellroy's most engrossing books. Better than Black Dahlia, not as good as LA Confidential."},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"This is a great, almost experimental, work of noir fiction. Like Ellroy's other great books in the L.A. series, the protagonists are all either good/bad guys or bad/good guys. No one is simple and nothing is straightforward, but if you can hold out and get into the spirit of the prose - which is no mean feat - the story becomes a rollercoaster of driven excitement. Ellroy always experiments with language and stylistic devices in setting his story properly in time and place, but this book is somewhat extreme in that regard and reading it requires some attention and a willingness to surrender to the language.The pace of this book, both in terms of stylistic intensity and in densley plotted action, is more hurried and frenetic than previous Ellroy novels. The territory and characters, though, should be familiar to anyone who has read The Black Daliah or L.A. Confidential. This is some great writing for all those who like their crime fiction on the gritty and harsh side of truth."},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"Just spent the past three weeks devouring the LA quartet. Oddly enough, the two books I expected to like the best (LA Confidential and Black Dahlia) were my least favorite. Not that they weren't good, I was just pleasantly surprised to enjoy White Jazz and the Big Nowhere as much or more.These books were just awesome. Gritty, compelling, page turners. I haven't watched tv in weeks. All I want to do is read the next book by James Ellroy."},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"James Ellroy's characters live unpleasant lives. But they certainly are exciting. If you're a fan of American Tabloid, this is the Ellroy novel for you, as it is written in that classic Ellroy staccato style. The story isn't nearly as involved as LA Confidential, but is still pretty byzantine. Great, great stuff."},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"After finally reading through La conifidential, i had to read the next one to see what happens to the characters next. I wasnt disapointed. Ellroy, is simply put brilliant. He creates wonderful new character Pete b, Chick, and Dave klien, who is a smart bud white. I also , liked how justice finally shined on Dudley Smith, who maybe crime fiction's best villian. I mean, this guy sells drugs to only negroes, has other negroes beat like slaves jsut to kill them off, he ordered the killing of six people just to take over a porno enterprise, and he killed a district attorney who was probably going to squeel on him. If he isnt evil, i just dont know what it is."},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"In the final novel of James Ellroy's LA quartet, corruption has become ubiquitous on the LA police force, which becomes the battleground for two powerful men who both want to become DA as a stepping stone to greater things. Dave Klein, a detective who has risen through the ranks by following orders no matter how distasteful, finds himself in the middle of a complex situation involving a federal corruption probe, a family of informers, Howard Hughes, and a low budget horror movie shooting in Griffith Park. Hard-as-nails Klein becomes increasingly friendless except for a beautiful starlet who may prove to be his downfall.Unfortunately, I've been reading these novels out of sequence. I need to circle back and pick up \\"The Black Dahlia\\" and \\"The Big Nowhere\\" to get the full sweep of Ellroy's LA panorama. \\"White Jazz\\" is a fierce, inventive novel with a powerfully unique syntax that is a bit challenging at first, but give it a chance and you'll get used to it. It's an effective stylistic choice that gives the narrative a frenzied, chaotic energy."},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"The story takes place in 1958 Los Angeles with all of the historical elements in place: The Dodgers moving from Brooklyn to Los Angeles, gangster Mickey Cohen sliding into oblivion, cheesy independent horror movies, and of course the notorious police corruption/racism within the L.A.P.D.. (Be warned: No racial epithet is spared.) For those who don't know, 1958 was the pinnacle of corruption in Los Angeles and James Ellroy just tears into it with historical accuracy.Our hero or anti-hero, David Klein, is a crooked yet very intelligent, Lieutenant in the L.A.P.D.. He is also a bought and paid for, yet a reluctant strong-arm, for the mob. He has a law degree, some psychological problems too mainly centering on his beautiful sister who he is attracted to but as the story evolves, things change and you begin to root for him.The story is tense and violent, Our hero has been thrown out as \\"bait\\" between the Feds, the L.A.P.D., corrupt politicians, and of course the mob with all of the above trying to keep their secrets safe. Subsequently the tension just builds and builds and you wonder how the hero is going to pull it off. The ending is believable and very 1950's.The narrative alone is worth the read. In most detective fiction the narrative is written in first person but White jazz takes this a step further. It is written as if everything is happening instantaneously. At times during the actions scenes the narrative is stream of consciousness and as chaotic as the scenes themselves. During intense dialog sequences the lead character, David Klien, deconstructs the meanings and significances of the dialog as they are happening so you hear his thoughts and words almost concurrently.Though the narrative maybe hard for some, I feel this book is a real contribution to the detective genre and literature itself."},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"This is my second Ellroy's book, the first being &quot;Black Dahlia&quot;. Stylistically this is a much more difficult story to follow due to his internal monologue in short sentences. You really have to pay a lot of attention and read every sentence carefully. Black Dahlia, I found, is a faster reading and more gripping. In White Jazz, there are alot of plots that are so gripping that you just can't put them down, but for the reason mentioned above, I have a hard time tying up together. The internal monologue style -- very similar to James Joyce latter part of Ulysses -- is unique, and require a great deal of adaptation to fully understand. I feel I have to re-read the neitre book to understand fully the enitre plots."},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"Blip,blip,blip, dig James Ellroy and his Craaazy books! I just finished White Jazz and loved every moment of it! Murder, intrigue, suspense, it's all here! Very dark, but if you dig Ellroy, you'll dig his darkness."},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"White Jazz is so frenetic it is like reading a speed freak's Beat poem. But it works- Dave Klein (the central character) is so caught up in the chaos around him that the prose must drive hard and fast- dig fast. The plot is a bit ponderous and lacks the grisly facination of some of Ellroy's earlier stuff, but all in all it is a bad cop's fever dream gone haywire! A good read."},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"I found White Jazz to be a probable once in a career achievement for Ellroy. He is at his best when writing a first person narrative, as in Black Dahlia or My Dark Places. White Jazz may be stylistically more advanced, but the story is too convoluted. Great ending, though the reader never knows the characters like they knew Bleichert or Meeks. Ed Exley becomes more formulaic. Even with though there is the Captain Smith dilemma, there should be a movie version with him."},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"White Jazz is the culmination of everything Ellroy wrote previously. It helps having read his previous works to get into the flow of his narrative style. But I agree with the one previous reviewer who stated that it's hard to find anything else to match Ellroy. After reading an Ellroy novel I have to search for months to find anything to compare and rarely succeed until my next Ellroy &quot;hit&quot;."},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"Forget Ginburg, Kerouac and all the rest- Ellroy is the poet of the 20th century and White Jazz is his best yet. He's like Burroughs on crystal meth riding an A-bomb into 1990s south central. He proves once again characterization, story and setting ALL matter and can be equal elements. Thanks to the man behind the James Joyce glasses."},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"Apparently this book is on the hit list of policemen across the nation. That alone caused me to read it. Policemen like to read dimestore novels while enduring the boredom of the beat. This book depicts police officers as corrupt, willing to slice the truth in half for their own purposes, and involved in lot's of mischief themselves. The outcry by police officers for depicting police as \\"perverts\\" and \\"hypocrites\\" shows what a fragile ego members of that vocation have. And to think Ellroy capitalized off it. I truly think is was a sense of \\"revenge\\" that Ellroy wrote this book. Apparently Ellroy had a tough life and was frequently treated shabbily by police officers when he was arrested frequently for shoplifting. Apart from the merits of Ellroy's own shortcomings, I have to laugh at the reaction police officers across the country have had to this book."},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"I am relatively new to James Ellroy. I read Ellroy's Black Dahlia and thoroughly enjoyed it. The man knows how to tell a story.I was definitely interested in checking out more Ellroy so I bought White Jazz. At first I was a bit discouraged because the writing somewhat mimics the scat stylings of jazz music, voice or otherwise. The writing is all over the place and zigs here and zags there and morphs into different time frames at the blink of an eye. There is not too much in the way of nouns, adjectives, or even verbs for that matter. This is no doubt a read the requires focused attention. I mean really focused attention.It took me a couple of tries to read this book. I would start it and then lose my focus. I had to keep at it in order get the rhythm of the book. I eventually tuned into the timber and beat of the book and was able to go with the flow of the book. Once you get to that point, you will find this a really engrossing read. You wouldn't think that this book would be vivid given its stylized writing but the author delivers a visually stunning read as well.I won't even go into plot points here because there are quite a few but I did find the main character David Klein to be really interesting and was definitely interested in reading what he would do next.Some people will be put off by the rather frank use of racial and socially deplorable epithets but realize that Ellroy is writing as people were likely to be and to speak. It's an ugly but probable reflection of life in L.A. in the late 50's. But I won't lie, it took some getting used to.I thoroughly enjoyed this book in all of its rawness and am sure other peoples would too!Enjoy!"},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"Plenty of other reviewers have recapped and given you a sense of the book, so all I will say is that \\"White Jazz\\" may be one of the best books written in the last twenty years (Right up there with \\"White Noise\\" by Don DeLillo). It is most certainly worth reading but if you haven't read anything by Dashiel Hammett, Chandler, or the other hard-boiled writers, then you really arent getting all the fun out of Ellroy's novel. It's much more than a great police detective story. \\"White Jazz\\" takes the genre's terse and pointed style to a ridiculous extreme. I burst out laughing at some of the passages and how the style played into the frantic stream-of-consciousness narrative. It's a fun read - definitely recommended!"},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"A big fan of Ellroy and crime fiction in general, White Jazz is the best out there. Lieutenant Dave Klein is the epitome of &quot;anthero&quot; and the thought of cops like him both saddens and terrifies me. The love interest is believeable, which is not easy to do in this bleak a story, and the prose style does resemble jazz, and is extremely rewarding after one gets used to it. White Jazz is Ellroy's most experimental and stylish novel to date, and highly recommended for someone looking for something beyond the Leonard/Lehane mold."},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"&quot;White Jazz&quot; is about a good cop.Well, at least as good a cop you can expect in a James Ellroy novel. Basically, Dave Klein is a good cop who makes one impassioned mistake and gives the mob fodder to blackmail him. Rather than sulk and collapse, Klein figures that if he's going to be on the take, he might as well be good at it.The story, ostensibly, is about Klein's tightrope act between the cops, the mob, and all shades of grey in-between. &quot;White Jazz&quot;, though, is ultimately about an unhappy truth that when giants fight, it's the little people that get crushed. As the sequel to &quot;LA Confidential&quot;, it's about the continuing power struggle between Ed Exley and Dudley Smith. As a southern California tale at the end of the Eisenhower era, it's about Republicans vs. Democrats. As a 50's piece, it's about pinkos, civil rights, and the Great American Pasttime. As the story of Dave Klein and his many associates, it's an up close and personal morality play about being chess pieces - all expendible with varying degrees of worth.&quot;White Jazz&quot; has a stream of thought first person narration that can be jarring at times, but then the story itself is like free jazz - different threads playing along roughly together and toward some common end. Whereas &quot;LA Confidential&quot; had a tight narrative so that it could key on a small number of plot threads as they developed over a span of time, &quot;White Jazz&quot; takes place in a matter of months, presenting a survey of what was going on in the city with a depth that the first novel couldn't.In the end, &quot;White Jazz&quot; plays all the right notes as a follow-up for the unfinished business left over from &quot;LA Confidential&quot; and the unfinished stories of life in the City of Angels."},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"The final part of the L.A. Quartet, White Jazz shares the common traits of its predecessors: huge story, struggling characters, frantic pace and a vivid descripition of L.A. in the 50's. As English is not my primary language, I have to confess that I had some trouble with the writing style of the book, and the first 30 pages or so took some time to read, but afterwards you grow accostumed with the style. It is also important to note that, wheter it was intentional or not, the writing style fits the way that the main character would describe such facts, so it helps to set the mood right. Even if the plot is not as powerful as The Big Nowhere and L.A. Confidential, it brings the story arc of a number of characters to a very fitting close, and that surely gives the book more weight"},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"I really enjoyed this one, the last of his LA quartet.

He has become one of my favorite authors."},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"I truly don't see how anyone can think this is a good book. It reads like a gritty Dr. Seuss novel. It's a string of 2 word sentences that leaves everything to the imagination because it says nothing. The characters are stereotypes and under developed.

Horrible book."},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"White Jazz is a fitting end to the quartet of novels that begins with The Black Dahlia entitled the L.A. Quartet. The narrator, Dave Klein, is new, but the novel sees Ed Exley finally square up to Dudley Smith, the quartet's long-standing villain. This finale completes the set stylistically as well as chronologically, moreover, bridging the orthodox noir that The Black Dahlia remains and the machine-gun paced, rock-era trio that American Tabloid inaugurates. Indeed, this novel provides a foretaste of American Tabloid with the appearance of one of its characters, Pete Bondurant, in a minor role. Enough said, in the interest of avoiding spoilers. White Jazz is a must if you have read the first three books of the set. If not, please begin with The Black Dahlia!"},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"The fourth and final installment in James Ellroy's epic L.A. Quartet is one of his bleakest titles (and that is really saying something) but overcomes this with a rollicking and jittery energy that never lets up. Police lieutenant Dave Klein is stuck between a rock and a hard place: he's murdered a suspect, one of many crimes he has committed in the line of duty. The federal prosecutor is bearing down, threatening to prosecute him unless he rolls over on corrupt LAPD colleagues. In the midst of this, Klein becomes obsessed with the break in and animal mutilation at the home of a family colluding with drug dealers and the LAPD, a case that puts him the the cross-hairs of the cops and the crooks. This is one of Ellroy's most complex novels, drawing on characters from past novels and introducing one that would be critical in his following Underworld USA cycle of novels. His version of Los Angeles is unrepentantly dark: everybody is on the take, everyone is a potential killer or victim. In this world of predators and prey, Klein has only one goal - to stay alive. Despite the darkness and complexity of the world he has created, Ellroy remains absolutely fascinating to read. He tells a story that never stops for breath; in clipped sentences that ring out like machine gun fire. Especially fascinating for me was the way jazz was one the periphery of the novel throughout. Ellroy, a classical music snob of some repute, knows his jazz well, setting one scene at a club with Art Pepper on the stage and others where the lonely detective sits on stakeouts listening to bebop on the radio. Simultaneously fascinating and repugnant, it's classic Ellroy."},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"Everybody in the L.A. Police Department (circa 1958) from top to bottom, from the Chief of Police to the cop on his beat, is crooked. A feature columnist at the scandal sheet, \\"Hush Hush Magazine,\\" has been telling that to his reading public for years, but no one has taken particular notice until the U.S. Attorney's Office started investigating the L.A.P.D.According to _White Jazz_, the L.A.P.D., crime boss Mickey Cohen (now a federal witness), Howard Hughes, and others are involved in bootlegging, illegal slot machines, narcotics peddling, burglary, sale of stolen merchandise, murder, blackmail and shaking down homosexuals. There is even a little \\"wife swapping\\" and incest thrown in for color. There is no hero in this book or anyone I even remotely liked or cared for. Meanwhile, the body count keeps mounting from chapter to chapter. To make wading through this vast cesspool even more unpleasant, intersperced throughout _White Jazz_ are the corrupt attorney/police Lieutenant Dave Klein's incoherent, private thoughts, as if the plot were not incomprehensible enough."},{"Title":"White Jazz: A Novel","review":"Ellroy here asks us to join him in a riff of incest and pornography, accompanied by sociopaths and tedious plot riddles, all written in a bizarre bare style that starts to wear thin after about ten pages.

Subtract 300 pages from this atrocity and you still have a book too long, with no plot and no redeeming value, and mostly, totally unbelievable. In other words, a mirror image of the characters the author tries to develop.Ellroy's obsessive hatred of all of what he considers \\"right wing\\" gets tiresome very quickly.Ellroy scored some impressive successes with LA Confidential and American Tabloid.

With a successful campaign of distortion and manipulation of evidence, the Israeli foreign ministry, with the help of the United States, succeeded in hiding from the world the horrors of Jenin, and even worse, in intimidating anyone daring to tell the truth about what had happened there.This is the great significance and enormous importance of this book. \\"Searching Jenin\\" is the first systematic account, through eyewitness reports, on the events in April 2002. Two other books appeared in Arabic, but this is the first one in English. It puts the events in context and it highlights the true nature of the crime, while not falling into the pitfall laid by the Israelis who succeeded in drawing the UN inquiry commission into supposedly academic discussion of how to describe a massacre. As comes out vividly from this book, Jenin was not just a massacre, it was an inhuman act of unimaginable barbarism.Noam Chomsky, in his introduction to the book, puts it in the context of crimes sponsored by America and he is someone who recorded meticulously these crimes in the past. Ramzy Baroud, in his preface, notes rightly that the book will not answer the question of how many people were killed, nor will it cover every aspect of the crime. But it does convey the message, as one of the witnesses put it that, 'what I haveseen are crimes; sometimes greater than an earthquake'. And this is not just an impression, as this book makes it all too clear: every aspect of the Israeli actions in Jenin can easily be identified as war crimes, according to the Hague convention.Testimonies like the ones presented do not only help to shed light on many of the chapters hidden by the Israeli screening and news' manipulation, it also brings forcefully the emotions, sounds and smells of the catastrophe. The pain is still there in those telling the stories. The book conveys the lingering agony through the italic interventions of the editors. Through them, we learn that while witnesses recall the horror of April 2002, like Hussein Hammad, they have to stop several times - sometimes to repose and occasionally to weep, before able to resume, like Hammad does, their stories.Sometimes the testimonies, at first glance, seem not to tell enough - as if the survivors wish to repress the horror rather then tell it in full. But the economy of words reveals quite often, even more about what had happened. Rafidia al-Jamal is very laconic in a way, in her testimony, but the full extent of the atrocity comes out in a very short sentence she utters. This is the case when she describes how she prevented desperately her husband - who had saved her life a moment earlier - from searching after his sister. \\"Don't go\\" I told him, \\"She is Dead\\". And then she reports dryly: 'my children have nightmares'.Other witnesses, especially mothers, feel the need to expand when it comes to their children's nightmares. Each with her own way of coping with the persisting torment of their children. Mothers all over the West Bank, and not only in Jenin a year after the massacre, spent sleepless nights with terrified children who witnessed the brutality at first hand. In Jenin, Farid and Ali Hawashin are such typical victims of continued nightmares of fear, that according to their mother, haunt them even during daylight. For them it is mainly the noise the disturbs their peace of mind: that of the loudspeaker that arrived near midnight at their home, that of the brutal burst into the house, that of the men pleading with the soldiers before being thrown out to the street, and then, worst of all, that of shots, the groaning of wounded and the silence of the dead. Noise and death repeat themselves in the memories of everyone in this book.With these memories of sound and vision, the search for Jenin continues throughout this powerful document. It is a search for truth, but for other things as well. It is a search for loved ones unaccounted for, long after the massacre ended, and then there is a search for a remedy to the pain of the nightmare, and these searches were far more important than the question of how many exactly died in Jenin. Even without this question being answered, there is a sense that this is the most authoritative report we will ever get.Each reader will take something different from this book. For me as an Israeli, I find the description of the soldiers' conduct the most disturbing and most convincing part of the evidence. It is a story of the dehumanization that raged in Jenin. This is so well epitomized in the chronicles of Nidal Abu al-Hayjah as reported by Ihab Ayadi. After Nidal was wounded and lay crying for help, anyone who tried to come to his rescue was shot by Israeli snipers. He bled to death as so many others. Technically, he was not massacred, he was tortured to death. The deadly precision of the snipers as a means of deterring rescue operations is being reported in other testimonies in this book, such as that of Taha Zbyde, who was killed eventually by a sniper. This mode of action was and still is enacted wherever there is an Israeli operation in the occupied territories. It is part of the vicious repertoire of the inhuman occupation - the daily physical harassment and mental abuse at checkpoints, the prevention from pregnant mothers or the wounded to get to hospitals, the starvation and the confiscation of water. No wonder some Israelis felt this brings back memories from the darker days of the Second World War. I remembered Anna Frank's diary when I read Um Sirri's horrorific recollection of how women tried to swallow a cough that irritated the Israeli soldiers standing above them, pointing their loaded guns at them.But there are ways of opposing the inhumanity of the occupier. This is why mothers in this collection talk proudly of babies born after the massacre. The expectant young Sana al-Sani decided to call her baby, if it is a girl, 'Zuhur', which means 'flowers'. This wish is expressed in the book after Sana recalls one of the most horrid memories brought in this collection. Her husband was slaughtered on his house's doorsteps, and yet it is not revenge or retribution that guides Sana, but a dream of having a different kind of life.But can flowers such as Sana's daughter flourish once more in the 'camp of martyrs' as the survivors called what was once their home? The flowers will have to overcome the desolation and bareness. Most of the houses were destroyed during the invasion. The Israeli army, after it expelled the resistance forces, located its artillery near the mosque and shelled the camp indiscriminately. Moreover, for blooming to take place where death once reigned, the smell would have to evaporate first. An American volunteer, Jennifer Lowenstein, until today can not sleep as the odor of death still troubles her nights and the nights of those few westerners, who gave evidence in this book, and who were fortunate enough not to be killed. They helped to tell the world the truth of what had happened. One of them is Tevor Baumgartner, who is the one who revealed the existence of mass graves, an allegation that was refuted early on in the Israeli denial, a denial that was so eagerly accepted by the United States.This is a must, albeit a very difficult, reading. The campaign against the continued dehumanization of the Palestinians in the occupied territories can not be based on slogans and general accusations. There is a need for indictments such as one provided here, which will hopefully very soon arise enough public indignation so as to vie governments around the world to take acting to save the Palestinian people before it is too late."},{"Title":"Searching Jenin: Eyewitness Accounts of the Israeli Invasion","review":"This is an excellent book which brings together some fresh thinking and reporting on a controversial subject matter. The massacre at Jenin has become the pawn of those playing politics, but this book tries to bring the reader back to the need to find the truth and to explore all aspects.Ramzy Baroud is a well known columnist whose writings have explored many subjects that are often considered taboo by the mainstream \\"embedded\\" American media -- imagine the new ways that term will be used. I found the collection of essays to be a fascinating read that challenges the perceptions about what the Israeli military really did in Jenin and forces the reader to ask hard questions about the bigger picture of brutality and unfairness.The goal is truth, not a political view. Ramzy Baroud's book helps to refocus the reader toward that goal and away from the partisan politics that plagues much of the writing that exists in other books.Thanls Ray Hananiawww.hanania.com"},{"Title":"Searching Jenin: Eyewitness Accounts of the Israeli Invasion","review":"Finaly a book that teels the truth. It teels how Israeli solidiers massacred Palestinians. It's a must read for everyone who wants to know the truth."},{"Title":"Searching Jenin: Eyewitness Accounts of the Israeli Invasion","review":"The personal accounts of the war crimes committed in Jenin are almost impossible to comprehend. How can humans treat other humans in this manner? The actions of the Israeli government and military (for all appearances one and the same) as well as the acts of individual Israeli soldiers are well beyond the bounds of basic human decency. The closing of the camp to journalists and medical workers is proof that the war crimes committed were intentional. That we in the rest of the \\"civilized\\" world stood by mutely and allowed this to happen and failed to demand that the perpetrators be held accountable makes us complicit in this horror.This book is difficult to read because of the painful stories of the victims of Jenin but I believe that this is a book which must be read and made part of the public discourse. Failure to confront difficult facts only allows the perpetrators to continue their ethnic cleansing in Palestine and the wanton destruction of human life. There is no possible justification for the decimation of the people and the homes of Jenin.This book is well written and is a \\"must read\\" for anyone who cares about basic human rights as well as the rule of law."},{"Title":"Searching Jenin: Eyewitness Accounts of the Israeli Invasion","review":"This book is an important addition to the literature of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I recall reports of the Jenin invasion very well: it was massive, thorough and presented by the Israeli government as justified. Understandably, the residents did not see it that way. This book is an attempt by journalist and author Ramzy Baroud and his team to tell the survivors side of the story. Their stories do not make for easy reading nor, in my opinion, should they. They were, after all, the targets of the IDF's invasion. If you want to hear and understand what the experience was like for the Palestinian residents of the Jenin Refugee Camp, then this is a book I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Searching Jenin: Eyewitness Accounts of the Israeli Invasion","review":"What the Palestinians endure is shocking. From a wide range of observers, this book documents (as best as can be expected given the circumstances) war crimes by the IDF and what can only be called state sponsored terrorism by Israel.

The book includes a Forward by Noam Chomsky an honourable observer and critic of the pro-Israeli bias of US Middle East policy which has constituted a major obstacle to a peaceful solution of the conflict.Many of the reporters commissioned for the book put their safety, and in some cases, their lives on the line to collect account after tragic account for this book. Because of their integrity and professionalism, they were able to interview many high profile figures that refused being interviewed by any other news agency.\\"Not only does the book include scores of telling accounts of residents who witnessed and survived the invasion, but it includes interviews with people such as the wife and the mother of Mahmud Tawalbe, the leader of the resistance in Jenin. Tawalbe was shot and killed by Israeli forces. The book also includes a detailed interview with the only eyewitness to the extra-judicial execution of Abu Jandal, the second in command of the Palestinian resistance in Jenin.The courageous reporters who combed the streets of Jenin, interviewed medical personnel, resistance fighters, and even children, including an 8 year old girl named Rund, who complained that the army broke her only doll. Rund's father was later shot and killed by the army. They also interviewed an elderly widow who explained how she implored Israeli forces as they demolished her small home, burying her disabled son alive under the rubble. Her son's body was never recovered."},{"Title":"Searching Jenin: Eyewitness Accounts of the Israeli Invasion","review":"WARNING: This book is very disturbing, as it provides detailed, first-hand accounts of a truly horrible act of terror from the victims who have witnessed and suffered through it.This book allows the reader to experience this event from the eyes of the Palestinians (and internationals). Many of these eyewitnesses have lost their homes, children, spouses, or other loved ones from direct fire by the Isreali army. This book will not answer the great question of how many casulties resulted from this attack, but through these first-hand accounts, it portrays the the terror, the absolute hatred, and the complete disregard for humanity that the IDF demonstrates towards the Palestinian people (and continues to demonstrate today). Most of these victims were just regular civilians who had no involvement in the uprising or the suicide bombings. This is required reading for anyone who possesses this unfounded illusion of the Isreali forces as heros who are simply defending their own people."},{"Title":"Searching Jenin: Eyewitness Accounts of the Israeli Invasion","review":"This book is a powerful indictment of the regime of Israel's Ariel Sharon. What happened in the town of Jenin, in early April, 2002, brought to my mind the wrong doings of Great Britain's Oliver Cromwell against the Irish people, at Drogheda, in 1649. I found the eyewitness accounts, by the local people of Jenin, that survived this tragedy, to be very credible and extremely moving. At least, 63 Palestinians died in the siege of the town by the Israeli armed forces. The military attacks lasted two weeks. It is long past the time, for the citizens of the world, to speak out against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. What occurred at Jenin, in April 2002, should be Exhibit \\"A\\" in their argument for that occupation to end."},{"Title":"Searching Jenin: Eyewitness Accounts of the Israeli Invasion","review":"Most of the reviews that I've read concerning this book made me wonder where the hell they were when the invasion happened! I'll tell you, they were all at home sleeping in their warm beds having lovely dreams about life, while the Palestinians are telling their prayers before being slaughtered on the hands of the Israeli army.But let's not argue about what happened in Jenin, as most of you don't believe what happened there or may be don't want to believe what happened there, but can you argue with me about what happened in 1948, and I mean the massacre at Deir Yassin, or can you argue about what happened in 1994 and I mean the murder of forty Palestinian worshipers by Baruch Goldstein at a mosque in Hebron, or may be someone will dare to argue about what happened in Lebanon in 1982 and I mean the 20,000 civilians slaughtered by the Israeli air force in Beirut, on orders of Ariel Sharon (the current prime minister of Israel).This book stats some horrible facts about the Israeli army, but when I thought about it I realized that there's nothing new about that, I mean I'm not surprised any more because Israel never respected the international laws and during the last 60 or 70 years Israel proved that it doesn't respect anything... laws, traditions or even religions."},{"Title":"Searching Jenin: Eyewitness Accounts of the Israeli Invasion","review":"There have been plenty of accusations against Israel. Every time Israel defends itself against attack, there are claims, justified or not, that Israelis have stepped over the line.Sometimes, this strategy seems to work, as Israelis start to ask themselves what went wrong. They ask if there was a way to use less force and put fewer civilian lives at stake. And some of them help give the impression that Israel is doing something inherently wrong by defending itself at all.Anyway, this time, the doves in Israel won out, and Jenin was handled in a truly heroic and humane fashion. That made no difference to many antizionists, who automatically told the same lies, such as the ones in this book. But it made a big difference to the Israelis, the vast majority of whom are very proud of Israeli behavior in Jenin and see the lies about Jenin as far worse than those about many other battles.The battle for Jenin was a test for antizionist writers. And many of them flunked it. This book is a good example of that."},{"Title":"Searching Jenin: Eyewitness Accounts of the Israeli Invasion","review":"This book is so filled with lies that even its title is a lie. Based upon hearsay and fabricated evidence, Ramzy Baroud comes to conclusions even the Israel hating UN and human rights organizations deny ever happened:1. \\"The 'invasion' of Jenin\\" was not justified - FALSE. The TRUTH - Operstion Defensive Shield was responding to the fact that at least 3 major Palestinian terrorist organizations were utilizing Jenin as a base of operations to launch their vicious homicidal attacks against Israeli Jews and Israeli Arabs (over 450 murdered 9/2000 - 4/2002), as well as a major recruitment and training center for Palestinian terrorists.2. Israeli destruction of Jenin was massive and indescriminant - FALSE. The TRUTH - The total area destroyed was less than 100 X 100 meters and was limited to areas known to be used by HAMAS, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Fatah and al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade.3. More than 250 Palestinian civilians were massacred by the IDF at Jenin - FALSE. The TRUTH - 54 Palestinians (the overwhelming majority \\"militia\\"/\\"fighters\\" armed with assault rifles, submachine guns and RPG's) were killed along with 14 Israeli soldiers. Most of the Israeli soldiers were killed in a ambush where the Palestinians used a 12 year-old boy to lure than into an enclosed area before exploding the boy and the sodliers into bits.4. A child died when Israeli tanks flattened a Palestinian house - FALSE. The TRUTH - This never happened. The footage that \\"proves\\" this was doctored. The man who produced this footage, Muhammed Bakri, has admitted to doctoring the footage.5. The IDF endangered a hospital treating Palestinians - FALSE. The TRUTH - The IDF guarded a \\"Palestinian\\" hospital's water and oxygen supply and blew up nothing that might endanger the hospital despite the fact that it served as a refuge for several fugitives. Baroud's \\"witness\\" was in fact being treated in a hospital while the Jenin operation was occurring. The hospital was in Afulla and is an Israeli hospital.There was one rather shocking truth excluded from Baroud's Book. Wounded Palestinians treated by the IDF refused transfusions of Israeli blood on the grounds that \\"Jewish blood was always tainted and impure\\" (an old Joeseph Goerbels charge). The IDF responded by having \\"acceptable\\" Arab blood flown in from Jordan at NO small expense to transfuse the Palestinians.In short, Ramzy Baroud's book is [incorrect] supported by unsubstantiated heresay, false accusations and fabricated evidence."},{"Title":"Searching Jenin: Eyewitness Accounts of the Israeli Invasion","review":"By 2004, all of the actual facts regarding Jenin have been out in the open for quite a while.
