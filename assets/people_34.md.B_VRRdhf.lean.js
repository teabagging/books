The book was a gift from my grandfather when I was 7 years old. It was lost many years ago, and now I relive both those days and the moralistic views of Aesop that had such a profound effect on that young boy's outlook on life. This is a book for the children of all generations, for it is timeless in its everlasting tales. But as an adult, it also functions to remind us that sometimes we need to refresh our outlook on life."},{"Title":"Aesops Fables","review":"\\"The Fox and the Crane\\" is one of my favorite Aesop's fables. I am surprised it is not better known. Glad it's used as the cover for this edition.Whenever I see Westerners trying to use chopsticks to pick up food from a plate, it reminds me of this delightful fable. I of course act like the fox and laugh at the silly attempts. It seems funny to me when people borrow ideas halfway, only based on hows and whats without any understanding of the whys.Chopsticks is designed to shove food from the bowl into the mouth and plates work best when food is delivered to the mouth by forks or fingers. Different tools are designed for different purposes to accommondate different arrangements.Strange enough, crane is revered by the Chinese and the Japanese and is the embodiment of elegance and other lofty spiritual concepts. Fox on the other hand embodies different meanings.I bet this is news even to Aesop."},{"Title":"Aesops Fables","review":"Aesop's fables short tales in which animals act almost as if they were human , rounded off with a good 'moral' are the first instance of , and perhaps the most memorable of the fable form in literature. Only Orwell it seems to me in ' Animal Farm' does something far surpassing the original.But Aesop is a classic , and one often used as first literature for children. I have never found the morals very deep or profound or the stories the most moving in the world, but this does not change the fact that they are part of Western mankind's fundamental vocabulary in literature and story."},{"Title":"Aesops Fables","review":"I'm sorry but referencing Rumi? I don't think you ever even read it. Judging from the interpretation that this silly Aesop fable has anything at all to do with of - The Mouse and The Frog, Rumi's Mathnawi , the author completely misses the point and takes a very lazy view of the meaning of this great poetic work. The Mouse and The Frog is a powerful LOVE STORY not a tale of ~revenge presented by this author. READ THE ORIGINALS YOURSELVES, PEOPLE!"},{"Title":"Aesops Fables","review":"This translation goes so far as to change gender in these fables. (For instance the fox that fools the monkey king becomes 'her' in this 'translation'. It totally changes what the fable is delivering, injecting a lame, shallow feminist theme where one never existed before.) For anyone who knows fables and folk tale type works every detail has meaning, and changing a detail as central as gender is like gluing a new appendage to a famous sculpture.Ms. Gibbs has molested these ancient fables. Her 'work' doesn't deserve to be mentioned even as a translation.May the sick academic culture that produces such shameless, pedestrian acts somehow, some way come to an end soon.Pathetic."},{"Title":"Aesops Fables","review":"I was hoping to be able to share these fables with my boys. While reading I found that I had to edit on the fly. Some are not kid friendly. So when you're reading about Mr. Duck and you see that he gets eaten by the lion, you could understand my dilemma. Perhaps this is a good exercise for improvisational reading.Some of the tales are downright puzzling as well. If the moral of the story is saying \\"Huh?!?\\" then many tales accomplish that objective.I would prefer a book that's edited for 21st Century taste and with appropriate fables for kids. I'm sure the book is faithful to the original literature but that's not what I was looking for here."},{"Title":"Aesops Fables","review":"It is rather sad that someone who sets herself up as being scholarly cannot accurately interpret the meaning of those simple fables. For example, the tale of 'Zeus and the Tortoise' #508 has no connection whatsoever to 'home is best' but, more accurately, that 'there is no God but there is Mammon' or alternatively, 'he who weilds the sword never wears the crown'! There is a profound social message to learn from all Aesop's fables but regretfully many do not originate from his pen but accreted around his tales with the passing of time."},{"Title":"Day by Day Baby Care: A Parent's Manual for the First Three Years","review":"I love this author.

The book also has growth charts in the back where you can record your children's height and weight progress and compare it against several norms. I'm reviewing this book now because I'm on-line to order the upteenth copy for another friend who is expecting."},{"Title":"The Soul of Latin America: The Cultural and Political Tradition","review":"First of all, let me say that I found this book to be educational. I learned a good deal about the political process in Latin America that I was not aware of before. I would even say that for the average general reader, including those that have (like me) at some time taken a survey course on Latin American history, it will be illuminating. If it were possible to give the book three and a half stars, I would.Having said that, I can't avoid the feeling that the book is worth the read in spite of itself. For one thing, the title is, in my opinion, unfortunate; one might be led to expect a review of Latin American literature, or maybe music. At worst, it could be some eccentric essay on the Hispanic \\"alma.\\" It is none of these things. It is a survey of political thought in the Iberian world (i.e., Luso-Brazilian as well as Hispanic) done from the historical point of view.Perhaps I should say from the \\"diachronic\\" point of view, since Professor Wiarda is almost apologetic about writing what he feels is cultural history, and he apparently prefers to be seen as a social scientist. The first third of the book is the roughest going; it reviews the presumed influence of the Greeks, Romans and Arabs on Iberian political thought. Truth be told, while there is a solid cultural bedrock inherited from the Romans in modern Spain, not least of all in the language, it is hard to prove the case that the Greeks and Romans provided much of a direct legacy in the sphere of political thought, except perhaps as an unconscious echo of ancient evenings; it was rather the reinvestigation of Greek and Roman thought in the Renaissance that made what the ancients had to say of relevance in Hispanic thought. And while the Arabs left a considerable legacy behind them in the social sphere, I personally doubt that they had little influence on the formation of political life in any direct way.Things pick up starting with the period after 1500. In this we are advised about the reformulation of Aquinas' thought by thinkers like Francisco Suarez, and then considerable detail is spent on Rousseauan liberalism, Comtean positivism, corporatism, and the anarchists. Most of these movements are of marginal interest in our own history or the history of the rest of the English-speaking world, but they had a tremendous impact on France and Southern Europe - and on Latin America; it is impossible to understand Latin American politics in this century without some comprehension of what these movements sought to achieve. The book also discusses Arielismo and Hispanismo in detail. Most students of Latin America have heard of these movements, and unfortunately don't pay much attention to them. This is a mistake, since if there are any movements that directly affect Latin America's relationship with the USA it is these two.The end of the book, however, ends up advising us that all of what came before may have no relevance to the future, what with the decay of the traditional institutions in Latin America and the submergence of the entire continent in the mass marketing culture of the twenty-first century. Maybe this is true, but it leaves me no further on, and I found this objectionable.I also found Professor Wiarda's style a bit difficult to take; he is almost obsessive about enumerating the points that he is making and summarizing everything to the point where it becomes almost juvenile. In this respect the book reminded me of some term papers that I wrote when I was in school. And whoever edited the book should be fired; it bristles with tautologies of the type you find in a poorly edited copy of something done on a word processor. Yale University Press, for shame!Professor Wiarda obliquely advises us by the end of the book that not all of the academic community would agree with his approach. Well, let me say that in general he has argued his position reasonably well. One of the problems with North American approaches to Latin America, and particularly to Latin American politics, is that we gringos tend to assume that from the political point of view Latin America is a massively dysfunctional place, and the sooner that their politicians give up their comic opera style and become more like us, the better. This book shows that there is such a thing as a definite direction in Latin American politics, and that Latin American leaders have as often as not been attempting to serve the public good, based on the tradition that they have had to work within and the challenges that they have had to face, just as within any other political system. Of course, Latin America has had demagogues and dictators, and maybe the system provides more opportunity for that sort of leader to arise, but that does not permit us to condemn their system as inherently not in the public interest.Despite the flaws the book is worth a read, if the subject interests you."},{"Title":"The Soul of Latin America: The Cultural and Political Tradition","review":"This book is a must read for any person that wants to understand Latin America. It is very easy to follow and provides unique perspectives on the culture, religion, and politics in Latin America."},{"Title":"The Soul of Latin America: The Cultural and Political Tradition","review":"Plenty of folks more knowledgeable than me on Latin America, but after I read this I felt like I was catching up.

Reading things like 'How to profit from your contradictions' and 'bringing together the paradoxical sides of yourself to achieve outstanding results', I feared it might turn out to be kind of vague and superficial. But I decided to give the book the benefit of the doubt, because I quite liked Jerry Fletcher's previous book \\"Patterns of High Performance\\".How wrong can you be in your expectations...The book turned out to be a downright fascinating read! The book describes with great clarity a very specific step-by-step method by which you can identify seemingly contradictory characteristics of yourself (the authors call this your 'core paradox'). Both of these contradictory characteristics can be expressed either in a negative way or in a positive way.When these contradictory characteristics are expressed in their most negative way, a nightmare-scenario can follow. When this happens, a person swings back and forth between the two (negative) sides of the paradox, leaving him or her hopeless, without energy and ineffective. However, when these contradictory characteristics are expressed in their most positive way, both (positive) sides of the paradox are simultaneously present.Because of this, you can produce creative resolutions of dilemma's that previously seemed intractable. Using a tool called 'Fletcher's pendulum', you can figure out how to get from the negative expression of your core paradox to a positive expression. How this exactly works, you should of course read in the book. It has many examples and is packed with practical wisdom. I found it extremely valuable."},{"Title":"Paradoxical Thinking: How to Profit from Your Contradictions","review":"Jerry L. Fletcher and Kelley Olwyler examine how you use paradoxical thinking - contradictory ways of approaching a situation. Then, they discuss ways to use your paradoxes to your strategic advantage. You can use their \\"pendulum\\" to help you recognize the positive and negative ways you express these paradoxes - so you can apply the positive actions to difficult situations. They invite readers to analyze themselves and resolve a current problem. The book can help you devise more creative solutions to personal and work situations. However, while the system is fairly straightforward, elements do seem complicated and may be difficult to apply on your own. We [...] recommend this book as a novel approach to problem solving and a worthy way to regard goal setting without the nagging voice of consistency in your ear."},{"Title":"Paradoxical Thinking: How to Profit from Your Contradictions","review":"Paradoxical Thinking is a very effective step-by-step guide for really getting down to understanding the core aspects of our individual nature and how they can work together synergistically-- or cause a nightmare of inner conflict. Jerry and Kelle show us how to discover and reclaim our seemingly contradictory qualities and use them to get through apparent impasses. This book is great for self-help, for coaching, and for collaborative thinking. Recognizing my own oxymoronic nature is definitely helpful in making my way in the world. Discovering my &quot;Nightmare Oxymoron&quot; was a blast. I recommend it."},{"Title":"Paradoxical Thinking: How to Profit from Your Contradictions","review":"I have got to say I am thoroughly impressed by the process in this book. The idea that we pendulate between two types of extreme responses (go for it and depression!) to problems we can't solve is perhaps not inspired but how to actually use our personal paradoxical reactions to create new options is. At first I thought \\"Oh great! A whole book to learn the process\\" but it's actually quite simple and the majority of the rest of the book is examples of using Fletcher's pendulum in action. I am absolutely going to use this in my coaching practice and if you have problems you can't make any headway on this is definitely the book for you. One of the best personal development reads this year."},{"Title":"Paradoxical Thinking: How to Profit from Your Contradictions","review":"The book arrived in excellent condition and on time.Thanks"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I found Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice to be a historically informative and interesting read. I am fascinated with the society and culture of the past, and find that only through reading can I visit this era. I found the dialogue very amusing as well as the characters mannerisms and behavior. As to their behavior, Ms. Austen could not have captured the essence of human nature any better than she did. She is able to show people's tendency to be insecure; selfish; arrogant; judgmental; opportunistic, and overly passionate. Elizabeth Bennet, was refreshingly unconventional with her frank and direct honestly and her wry humor. The conclusion satisfies the thirst for an outpouring of emotion, for Ms. Austin establishes a good degree of tension, which increases the farther in the story one goes. What I found unfavorable was the plot's slow progression and its tendency to drag. Mr. Darcy is rarely heard in the beginning although I admit he does appear more during the end. I also feel that Elizabeth's dislike of Mr. Darcy lasted too long, which resulted in choking the romance out of it. Along with its slow progression, I found the book to be slightly confusing at times. This is due in part to the language that I find simultaneously charming, as well as to the characters' tendencies to go on and on about a subject of no particular importance."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is a satirical commentary on nineteenth century society. Austen uses dry humor and irony to show the absurdities of her time. Extreme characters such as Mr. Collins and Mrs. Bennet are used to accentuate the sexism of her society, and characters such as Miss Bingley and Lady Catherine De Bough are used to show the culture's obsession with wealth and power. Austen uses the character Elizabeth Bennet to counter these negative values. Elizabeth does not conform to the society's beliefs of how women should act, and she believes in marrying only for love. This novel is enjoyable to read, although it is at times wordy and somewhat predictable. The general plot is not overly exciting or suspensful. However, the problems of sexism and egotism examined in this work are issues still prevelent today. Therefore, readers, especially young women, can relate to this novel. As an AP English student, I would not highly recomend this novel to other AP students. While I did enjoy reading it, I did not find it to be on the same level as the other books I read this year. It took little analysis to find the &quot;deeper meaning&quot; of the novel. Although it was not as chalenging as other books that I have read this year, many of the themes would lend nicely to the final thematic question on the exam. I would not replace another AP novel with this, but I would read it as a supplement to the AP curriculum."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book was in amazing condition.

The main character struggles to find her place in the world while dealing with social pressures and expectations. She falls in love with a man that is from a different rank, so the commentary on society ends up being wrapped in a love story.

Therefore, I am left without an option but to base a review on the level of my enjoyment, which is no reflection of how great the novel is written or what a classical piece of artistry it may be. I cannot give this novel 5 stars because I truely found my attentiion wavering, and I felt thankful that the book, which seemed drawn out to me, was closing to end. It is undoubtably a classic storyline, the 'prejudice' of Mr Darcy, the love developing between the unlikely, but I had seen the movie, and generally knew the storyline, but felt to fully apperciate this story, I must have read it. Maybe that contributed to the sense of boredom that came with this novel to a degree, particularly whilst it was winter (in the novel) and Mr Darcy and Jane's friend were out of town. I got sick of the letters in the book, and began to think about other things while reading them, increasing the time it took me to read it. Sadly, I think with a increased patience, I could have really liked this novel, but I just was thankful I had finished it. I am sorry to burst any 'Pride and Prejudice loving' bubbles, just telling it how I saw it.

I just adore this book, I could hardly put it down, I finally had to stop reading when my butt started falling asleep. I is so exciting to find out who will marry who, and to see Mr. Darcy change his manners and Elizabeth change her mind. The elegance of the novel truly added to the characters and the setting.

The characters are so real- granted, some are a bit exaggerated, but that seems to be Austen's point...exaggerating the faults of society. The tension between Elizabeth and Darcy, and the subplots with the other characters draw together a fine novel.

There's something about opening the book and reading the lines those lines which are so familiar to me that gives me a comforting feeling,. It's the same feeling as coming home after a long time.

After I read Pride and Prejudice, I realized that there are books out there that are worth reading for fun, and ever since, I have always been in the process of reading a book for fun, even in addition to the books I read for my high school classes.

There were parts of the book that were long and confusing for me, but they were certainly overshadowed by all of the many exciting and romantic scenes! A must-read book!

The romance between Eliza and Darcy is thrilling. The characters of Eliza's parents are hilarious. I loved the style of the writing-not flowery or rambling.

The characters are realistic, yet all are classic 'types'. Elizabeth and Darcy play well off each other, with quazi-ralistic dialoge and beautiful settings.

Austen tells a wonderful story with side plots and interesting characters. You'll laugh at Mr. Collins' speeches and Mr. Bennet's way of looking at the world, get angry at Lady Catherine and her high handed ways, and dispair over Lydia's and Mrs. Bennet's silliness. A great book to curl up with."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is so great that if I didn't have school the next day I would read the book within a day. It's so amazing when I finished the book and I reread parts of the book when I finished. Boys might even be interested in this book. I recommend to all teenagers, esp. to the females out there.I'm speechless mostly to tell the truth of how great this book is. I'm going to go buy my own copy."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Beautifully written from start to finish. The story captures all of your attention as it slowly unfolds. I get lost in all of the beautiful words. Highly recommend to strong and romantic women and men alike."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I personally enjoyed the book. A little slow at first but other than that a classic. It is one of those books that should be read just to have in the archive for reference."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"~3.5/5[Also available on my blog.]I think I'm going to try and keep this review short, just for the fact that I don't have as high, or much, of an opinion as most people do. But I might have more to say than I think.This is my first Jane Austen book, and, while I'd wanted to read it for a while, the main reason I finally got around to it, was because of The Lizzie Bennet Diaries. Which, if you aren't watching those, whether you've read the book or not, you should. It's... simply amazing. I love it.But I'm talking about the book, so let me get back to that.When I started the book, I was afraid it was going to be long and droning and boring, given the time period it was written, and it kind of was, in parts. There were a lot of dry parts in this book, a lot of slow points, and the language was rather boring at some points. There were long sentences, huge paragraphs, not nearly as much dialogue, and sometimes it was a bit hard for me to follow. There were, though, some scenes, some chapters or plots, that I really enjoyed, and those went by really fast, whereas other ones took way too long to get through.My main annoyance with the writing was how tell and not show it was. There were countless times that the reader would be told about something that had happened, some scene we didn't get to see, and sometimes even some kind of characteristic that a character had. And the one reason I'm even a little okay with those things is that, with the characters, it was made apparent in their attitude that what we were told was true, and with the scenes, if we were shown them, the book would have been longer, and I probably wouldn't have enjoyed that. It still annoyed me, though; is probably the thing I least liked about this book.Next, the characters. I liked Elizabeth enough, I suppose, but didn't really care too much about her either way. The same with most of the characters, actually. I liked Mr. Bennet. I liked the romantic relationships. I wasn't too big a fan of Bingley, most of the time, because he just seemed too prideful and full of himself (which I will talk about again in a minute). I didn't think I got to know Lydia very well. Jane seemed alright. I didn't like Caroline, because she was... not a nice person.I liked Darcy at first, but then later on was kind of iffy about him. I knew what was going to happen with him and Lizzy, but somewhere in the middle, his attitude bothered me. I think it just seemed like too big a jump, from him being standoffish to really nice to her. But, thinking back on it, it wasn't too bad, actually. I did like their relationship, so there's that.Now, the pride thing. After reading the book, I understand what the title means, and I'm kind of okay with it. I don't mind the prejudiced thing. But the pride part just annoyed me so much. All of the characters were prideful about one thing or another. Bingley was rather full of himself. As was Darcy. And I just... I guess I feel like some development should have been done there, instead of it just continuing to be that way. They aren't the only characters that were prideful, a lot of them were, but they just made the biggest impression on me.I think that's all I have to say, really. The book wasn't horrible, even if it was droning and boring at times, and had way too much telling. The rating is really so high because of the story line. The plot was good, what with what happened with Lydia, and Jane's change in attitude halfway through, and the ending, and even how some of the characters acted. There were some parts that I really enjoyed.I don't plan on reading any of Austen's other books, though. I do plan on watching some of the Pride and Prejudice movies, and am at the moment watching the miniseries, but that might take a while. They're just so long, and kind of boring to me. I know that most people love this book, though, so don't take my word on it all.I would suggest watching the web series The Lizzie Bennet Diaries, though, because it is amazing, and I honestly think it's better than the book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Loved this book, I have lost count of how many times I've read this book. This is my go to book, for a good dose of true romance."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I loved this book. If would have read it in high school I would never have understood it or appreciated it as much as I did now."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is undeniably a great love story that warms your heart. It is very entertaining and full of rich and gratifying literature for the soul."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"In my opinion, Pride and the Prejudice is a work of art.From a teens point of view its quite beautiful. That leaves you in tears. Some might say its in a old time theme, but I would like to think the romance in this story is so typical every 2000 kinda day. We live in a world where men and women play the \\"I don't like you card.\\" Even when we have already fallen for that person. Instead of realizing right of the bat they were meant to be. Anyway, if you're looking for a nail biter, empty box of tissues, this is an amazing book. Don't over look it because of the title or date written. It's really a piece of art it's self."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Having seen the film and I think I have read the book before too, this reading absolutely took me into romantic bliss. Well worth the reread and I think I'll wait a bit before the next reading. But I will read it again.

The language is lively, the attention it commands is constant, and the parallels that can be drawn across time hold true."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have seen parts of the movie but never the entire story so it was enjoyed.

My memory. It was just as good as I REMEMBERED."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I buy the books for my wife and she is enjoying them in her retirement along with all the other products we purchased from Amazon"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Since it was free, I decided to read \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" again. I was hoping I would like it more than I did when I was in college. I know you are all going to hate me, and never look at another one of my reviews, but honestly it is one of the few titles that I actually believe I liked the movie better. There, I said it. Maybe it is because modern screenwriters are able to present their attraction to each other better than Jane Austen could in 1800's. The movie is one of my favorites. I still get chills when Mr. Darcy tells Elizabeth she has bewitched him. If you haven't read it, you simply must, just so you can always say you read the book that started it all--romance novels that is. Anyway, there you are. That's my review, and I'm sticking to it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Sorry, I don't want to step on any toes, but I found Pride & Prejudice to be slow and plodding. In fact, I finished it only for the sake of doing so. Since it was written by a woman and is told primarily from a woman's perspective, given its considerable popularity I can only assume that it is enjoyed more by women than by men. If it wasn't a classic I might even have given it two stars (and I enjoy many of the classics very much)."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Why is this still being published? How does anyone finish this stuff? The women are pathetic, their lives meaningless; the men are shallow; thank goodness I don't have to live in such a self centred universe. I'd rather shoot them all in the first five pages, and let characters who are trying to contribute to others' lives get more oxygen. Talk about suffering for Austen's art - she did, so we have to too?

I love being transported back in time to chill with 'high society'"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Amongst a world of the fragile words of fly-away stories that never quite made it, Pride and Prejudice stands out. Classic literature is often difficult to comprehend, and can be quite defunct, but this book takes a clean, solid stand against common stereotypes. Leading the way about victorian age, this book is full of class and holds a meaningful victory in it's pages. Though old and historic, this timeless treasure will remain in the shelves of classic literature for years to come."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"pride and prejudice is wonderful i love it.i just love elizabeth, she is so smart !! and mr Darcyyou hate him at first but at the end...you really get a big smile with this bookread it"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The book was fantastic. The details that Jane Austen injects in her story tellings paints a vivid picture of the era in which the story in told. The story rates 5 stars, the reason for the 3 stars is as follows:The binding of the book was horrible. In fact sections of the book came out and I had to jostle pages to keep them in order. I've never had that problem w/a book I've ordered from Amazon before."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have watched the movie many times, so I wanted to see what the book was like.

Unique and brilliant"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Anything by Austen is a must-read and P&P is the best of all.

I fought my way out of the pilot seat against the compiling G-forces and scrambled with a sob in my throat through the open hatchway.Tumbling in free fall. Feeling of helplessness. Cold air rushing past my ears.

I got a mail telling me it is a free download at 0.00 $, but then Amazon tries to pull 2.30 $ for this 'free' classic. Seems they need every cent now to survive the iPad threat."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I enjoyed \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" by Jane Austen a great deal more than \\"Sense and Sensibility\\".Elizabeth's sense of humor made her a much more interesting heroine in my opinion. She and her father seemed to enjoy a love for the absurd, although her mother's behavior did embarrass her. Other than that there are many parallels among the characters in the story: Elizabeth and Elinor, Lydia and Marianne, Jane and Mrs. Dashwood, Wickham and Willoughby.It still bothers me that all the women think about is finding a husband, that an \\"accomplished\\" woman \\"sang and played all day\\", but I have to assume that was the world Jane herself was exposed to at the time.You know that with a family that size and all those dinner parties, there had to be some people working very hard in that household, but they are barely ever mentioned and then only in brief passing and only in their concern for the family.Fifty years after these novels were published, we see books such as \\"Little Women\\" by Louisa May Alcott depicting an American family. In this book the characters are much less one sided. Although some of the girls were still thinking primarily of finding husbands, they had to pitch in and help make the world around them.Another fifty years later, \\"Anne of Green Gables\\" by L. M. Montgomery describes a young Canadian woman from a very different set of circumstances who puts the romantic side of life into perspective.Both Jo and Anne are charcters that I would encourage young girls to meet early in life. The Austen women in the books I've read so far, although they may be a study of women from a certain subsection of society in England at the time the novels are written, are not ones I'd place before my daughters."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I picked this book up from my daughter's bookshelf and thought it might be fun to read such a classic. I have to say I am disappointed. About halfway through, I grew so thoroughly bored, I had to put the book down for a few days. It is just a predictable romance novel, nothing especially wonderful or exciting. There is so much conversations and it can get really confusing sometimes."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice, what a long book!!! Pride and Prejudice consists of 3 books. In those days, authors were forced to write extremely long novels, if not, chances are, the novel would have not been printed. With sitting by a fire, and reading the favorite means of entertainment, novels had to be long , to take up time. Basically, thats all Pride and Prejudice did for me, take up time. If the novel would have been condensed into one book, it would have been much better, and probably would have received 5 stars from me. Elizabeth, the star character is very likeable and we all seem to look up to her. Her epiphany......&quot;how despicably have i acted......till this moment I never knew myself!&quot; Is worth reading the novel for."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"i know she is supposed to be one of the classic greats, but i just can't get into her writing (i force myself because i feel that i should read the classics, if only to make me a well rounded reader). i found the book slow going and to be quite honest, boring."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I think I got about a quarter of the way through it and hoped it would get better. The story is hard to follow, too detailed about mundane things. The story line is so slow I just gave up. I enjoy historical romances and I figured a classic, right? Should be good. Nope, it was a waste of my time."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I did not have a favorite chapter but the chapter that I found most interesting is chapter eight because in that chapter Elizabeth and Darcy meet again at the Bingley's house and Darcy feels dumb because Elizabeth had rejected him, and they had not seen each other since that had happened.I feel that this book is for the age group of 20-40 and I think that it's more for girls then guys. I'm not trying to sound sexist, but I don't think that guys would find the story interesting.One literary device that I appreciate is the conflict between Elizabeth and Darcy. Elizabeth does not like Darcy at first, and she rejects him when he proposed. But then she falls in love with him.I found the book all right; it was not that boring. However it was really long and I did not have enough time to read it and understand it well. I would not read this book again because it's not my type of book. I would rather read about action or something that relates to me, or that is interesting to me.By Manuel Rosales"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"i read this book becuase i heard how great it was. it has so many great reviews. honestly i think the book was just ok... too much of nothing was written. i found myself forcing to finish the book thinking it was going to get better. the best part was the end. now i can read a better book. sorry jane austen but this now makes me think twice about reading your other books. i was disappointed."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Of course, literature does not have to be realistic to be great, but for me, it has to have something that is at least so in a figurative level.

I thought P&P would be a good start since they just made another movie on this book.. but I was wrong! the book was boring and plotless. Sure nowaday women are still searching for Mr.Perfect like Lizzy was. But today's women have to deal with much more complicated life problems and worries while searching for the right guy.. The whole book was about drawing room,dinners, and occasional conversations with some ladies urging Lizzy to get married. I better off stick with the modern love stories with real people problems. Glad women have grown so much tougher since the old days."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This story was written in the early Victorian era, and hence it is quite old. I was pretty much forced to read this book for a summer reading assignment. I found it to be utterly boring. The real question here is why do I really care if the mother has all of her daughters married off to wealthy parnters, or any partner if it must come down to it? Maybe it was a big deal back in the time, but nobody cares nowadays. Maybe it is a 'literary masterpiece', but then why the heck is it so boring? We need to move on from the old 'classics'. They mean nothing to readers (are there many left?) of the modern society."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and prejudice, is a novel on the love and hate of a man and a woman who are perfect for each other from the beginning but do not realize it until the end. It is about how a great love overcomes the prejudices that two of the main characters have for each other. This novel, in my opinion was everlasting and boring. One would be able to predict the outcome of the novel from the beginning, but must spend endless hours of reading to finally see the plot unwind. Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy have a great hate for each other in the beginning, but slowly, thorough out the novel, begin to bid farewell to their prejudices of each other and find a love for each other they never knew they could have. I did not enjoy reading this novel due to the fact that romance is not my favorite topic, especially when it is \\"old school\\" love. I did not appreciate this book in anyway and wish that I never chose to read it. I would not recommend this book to anyone who hates reading as much as I do and is disturbed at the fact that one would enjoy reading about love when they can just look out the window and see it happening right in front of them. Pride and Prejudice is a novel that did not interest me, but may interest those old grannies that jump and express their happiness when everlasting romance novels end in happiness."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I hated this book. It was difficult to read, because Austen never seemed to get to the point, and everything seemed to happen so slowly. The characters seemed so pompous, it was ridiculous. I had to read this book for a class, and disliked it so much, i didn't even remember that I had read it (repressing it in my mind). It wasn't until one of my friends who had also been in that class reminded me that we had read it that I even remembered that i HAD read it. Then i remembered why i had forgotten it as much as possible!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"this is possibly the boringest classice ever written, which is saying a lot considering the fact they're all quite boring.

Go and waste your money on Harry Potter or something."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I loved the audio book.

By-the-way, what's Mr. Darcey's first name?"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"While cultural pundits try to convince you that some literature is better than other literature, the truth is that all art is relative to individial tastes. Thus, it doesn't make any sense to think that a novel like this one is really any better than say, Michael Crichton or Stephen King. Aesthetic standards can't be grounded.Thus, don't listen to anyone who tries to distinguish between &quot;serious&quot; works of literature like this one and allegedly &quot;lesser&quot; novels. The distinction is entirely illusory, because no novels are &quot;better&quot; than any others, and the concept of a &quot;great novel&quot; is an intellectual hoax."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Please, this was an utterly unconvincing and boring novel. If it wa written today it would be internationally acclaimed for being a dummed down soap opera. Unfortunately, having been composed in, what, the 1830s, it has become a period drama style romance novel, where instead of foreplay, they have to bow and curtsy and everything. Althought this may appeal to worthless romantics, it will not perform well to the MTV generation. The movie starred Hugh Grant. Please........."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" by Jane Austen, is a book about the life of a girl, Elizabeth Bennet. She has five sisters and lives with her mother and father in 18th century England. The story tells of her sisters' loves and marriages. Elizabeth's youngest sister gets married to a man of questionable character, who happens to be the friend of the man that Elizabeth herself loves, Mr. Darcy. Of course Elizabeth's love isn't that simple, since she first has to hate Mr. Darcy and then blames him for everything that her sister is going through. Jane, Elizabeth's oldest sister, falls in love with another of Darcy's friends. All the trouble that any of Elizabeth's not-quite-normal family has is blamed on Mr. Darcy.Basically, the whole book is about an 18th century girl whining about her upper middle class life. Of course, at the end, she gets exactly what she wants and everyone lives happily ever after. There is credit to be given to Jane Austen, since she wrote the book in an American household in the early 1800s, with no support from any of her family. She had to hide her writing under knitting or sewing whenever someone approached. She then had a friend publish the books she wrote, without telling her husband. Considering all that, the story really isn't that bad, but in general, if you were looking for a book by Jane Austen, Emma would be a better read. If you want a predictable love story, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a good book for you."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"In the Pride and prejudice era, a woman's means of survival and finances was determined by the men in her life-first her father and then Her husband. This is the story of the five Bennett sisters and their quest for suitable husbands. Their felicity in life depends on overcoming pride and prejudice to follow their heart in matters of matrimony. This was a fun story that left me longing for social norms of yesteryear."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I read it in high school but really didn't appreciate it then. Upon re-reading it I loved it even more. The story line is relevant, and the story is a classic.

I want a man like Darcy even if he was arrogant oh and amazing book indeed !"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It's a classic, no two words about it. But most of all, it brings to mind the author (Jane Austen) who managed to intertwine her own experiences into this book (the movie 'Becoming Jane' is worth seeing on the occasion).Brilliant language, captivating dialogs and complexity of feelings."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I first fell in love with the story after watching the movie. The book is so much better, it was all I hoped for and more."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Well I'll tell you that at first I could not understand what they were saying but I got the hang of it. This is my new favorite book. I Love Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett, or shall I say Elizabeth Darcy. I recommend this to people who like a good romance blindness and you got to be able to understand the language in which the book is written in. Then after or before you should watch the movie or/and the short tv show of pride and prejudice."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is by far my favorite book! Elizabeth Bennett was ahead of her times, a lady who paled in the beauty of her sister. And I would love to meet someday a man like Fitzwilliam Darcy who can see through her lack of means and radiating sister to see the real woman whom he can truly love. And each of the five sisters represent a stereotype of women in literature in those days. The beautiful, the independent nurturer, the bookworm, the flirt, and the follower. Everyone ends up with someone in the end who matches their personalities with the exception of Mary, who stays with the woebegone father. A must for anyone who is a romantic at heart."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is a story of love between a proud man and a prejudiced woman. It's delightful to see how the characters change as the story proceeds. Unlike most other novels that I read , the supporting cast is also elegantly developed, each with a character of it's own. Rich in content while keeping the plot simple."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have read Pride and Prejudice 17 times and the wonder is that I fallen in love with it.The cheerful nature of Elizabeth,the admiration of Mr.Darcy,the family's joys, sorrows,hopes,fears have been so well described by the writer Jane Austen,that anyone can like it. The story depicts the charactes of the beautiful Jane,witty Elizabeth,their mother and father,the handsome Mr.Darcy, the Bingleys and the Lucases.Jane Austen's spirited Elizabeth,charms her way into the proud and cold heart of Mr.Darcy. And this love story is certainly CHARMING."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is by far, in my opinion, the best of Jane Austen's works. I can't really say what makes it that fabulous, but once you started reading, you can't stop. Jane Austen had fully developed the characteristics of Elizabeth, and made her very human. The feelings stitched into the story has made an impact on the readers' mind, enabling to feel for the characters themselves. This, I think, is a very important point why I consider this book one of her best."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"WONDERFUL!!!! That is the best description of this wonderful love story. I fell in love with the book from start to finish. It was magnificently written and the charecters were wonderfully portrayed. It is a glorious love story which has much below the surface. It is simply the best work of hers that I have read yet. As I said before it is WONDERFUL!!!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book was such a delight from start to end! The romantic &quot;tension&quot; between Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy was wonderful!

Everyone should rush out and get this book..if you haven't read it yet..you should be shot...Buy it now!!!!!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's subtle wit and piquant characterizations are at their best in this, her most famous work. Lizzy Bennett is the most delightful heroine of all time, and Darcy will spoil women for real men for all time. The plot moves rapidly, the dialogue is clever, and each character is well fleshed-out without being overpowering. Everybody gets what they deserve in the end, and there is not a loose end to be found. Brilliant."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I've read hundreds, possibly even thousands, of books in my life and this is one of my top three favorites. Austen is an incredible writer who draws you into her story until you feel that you are one of her characters. It is comical, passionate and even sad at parts.I have a hard time finding books that have appropriate themes for my age yet are still intellectually stimulating. This is an enjoyable and even slightly challenging book that I reccomend to EVERYONE! I love it! Rebekah Robblee"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book was a required reading for university. I was not quite certain what to think.....that is until I started to get into the book. This novel is a delightful and intriguing romantic comedy. The pride of Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett's prejudice against him are overcome as they learn that love can and does conquer. Elizabeth was a character I could relate to. She was not afraid to stand up for herself and overcame conventions, like walking through mud to see her sick sister, Jane!Perhaps I am not the most qualified to write a review of Jane Austen's work, but I know what I like. This book had me laughing from beginning to end. With Mr. Collins' &quot;speeches&quot; and Mrs. Bennett desperately trying to marry off all her daughter's, who can help themselves? I am now hooked on Jane Austen because of this one book. Read it and experience it for yourself."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is probably the most classic romance novel of all time. I get shivers every time I re-read it and fall in love with the story over and over. While I love most of Austen's other books, this is the one I return to at least once a year."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is truly a love story classic. I enjoy all of Jane Austen's work, but this one has always been my favorite. It is beautifully written and has a wonderful ensemble of characters that give real life to the story. Their loss is your loss, and their joy is your joy.A must to read and cherish forever."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have read this novel 6 times and I never get bored of this novel! It seems every time I read this novel that I realize something new about the characters that Jane Austen so cleverly created and what's more is that I enjoy the novel each time as much as I did the first time I read it!! I would definitely recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys a great classic with whitty characters and an excellent love story."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"A friend of mine knew that I was working my way through the classics that I didn't read in school, and got me a copy of P&P; for Christmas. Personnally I think this is one of the best works Jane Austen came out with! It took a couple of pages for me to adjust to the antique english, but once I did, I loved immersing myself in a culture long gone. Once or twice I even caused my husband's brows to raise when I accidentally answered him in Olde English!Austen gives just enough detail (thankfully not enough to bore you), allows her main characters to be fallible, and whisks you off into a tale that is wonderfully wrapped up at the very end. None of that here's-the-last-page-sorry-you-still-have-questions nonsense (fine for a series, but definately not a stand-alone)!If you too are looking for an extremely well-written, entertaining classic with a happy ending, don't let all the collegiate level stuff scare you!

I have to admit, as and avid Austen fan, I'm a bit obsessed with this one. One cannot come upon better characters than the beautiful and witty (way to be a smart girl!) Elizabeth Bennet, and the tall, brooding, but devilishly handsome (not to mention exceptionally rich) Mr. Darcy. And of course, what better way to start off a romance than with two characters who hate eachother? And Austen does it complete justice--for we all know that they can't stay disgusted for long! However, did we ever expect Lizzy to actually refuse a man who has ten thousand pounds a year? Heck yes! And that's why we love her. I've never come across an author better able to create stunning characters than Miss Jane Austen herself. She's timeless. I highly recommend this book to every person who comes across it. Pride and Prejudice merits the title of MY FAVORITE piece of literature ever written!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"One reviewer (Jane Stewart) thanked me for my input on the \\"revised\\" setting of P&P. My reasoning came after my desire to have the setting be the end of the beautiful 18th Century - not the industrialized 19th. Jane Austen wrote the book in 1796, and it was published 17 years later, but it was the SAME book, and she naturally wrote about her time period. So I deducted 17 years from 1813, which equals 1796. (Note: An astute reviewer on Amazon also pinpointed the timeframe of 1794-1796 with a French action that Jane Austen mentioned, related to P&P.)"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"If you're looking for the Regency as memorialized by Harry Flashman, the regency of his father, with country house parties enlivened with chaps p---sing in corners and keeping all hours (as Flashy says), you've come to the wrong shop (as Flashy says).If you're looking for Sharpe roaring about Spain doing his Peninsular duty while beautiful and passionate ladies shrug off those gauzy empire gowns to reveal naught, knickers not having come in fashion, Miss Austen will give you the right about, and, if that fails, have the servants throw you out.The post-sixties restoration of Austen has I think its origin in a rejection by Western elites of the \\"spirit of the 1960s\\"...which was mostly chaps p---sing in corners and keeping all hours, a second Regency.It was Byronic, it was Blakean, it was mad, it was creative destruction, or destructive creation. I can't remember but it sure was fun.But creative destruction, may I introduce diastolic reproduction? People must be fed, infants amused, servants chastised, houses kept up, and daughters married off.However, \\"creative destruction\\" versus Austen's faith in a serious reproduction of fortunes and daily life forgets and shuns another -tion.This is exploitation. The sensitive reader is appalled of course in a minor key by Mr. Collins' toadying of Lady Catherine. But what's unsaid is that the land on which Austen's heroes lived was stolen land.I would have killed Jane Bennet off in her first fever. In my version, John Paul Jones lands and sets the Bennet's house to the torch. Elizabeth would have been abducted by a motley crew of Red Indians, pirates and Jacobins, to wind up at Waterloo crazed with love for a D'Arcy of a Frog, and nothing to be done.But: the work of art must be accepted on its own terms."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This CD is wonderful.

I never thought this book was slow, although some might disagree because of the older english. I personally found the language in this book to be beautiful. I love the character of Elizabeth Bennet.

While Emily Bronte's \\"Wuthering Heights\\" is one of my all-time favorites, I always dreaded reading Jane Austin. She can be very bland, dry, and boring. This book is a bit different, with the characters showing more wit than Austin usually provides.I recently read the \\"Zombie\\" format of this work and found it absolutely laugh-out-loud funny! Can't wait to see the movie!

I know that some people are not up for the task of 19th literature, but if you can just give it your all and dig in, Austin will certainly make it worth your while and more."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is a great book full of forbidden love, greed, bribery, sorrow and triumph. Jane Austin, once again, has written a beautiful novel that should be read by everyone! Not only does she describe everything well, but the way that she writes lets you infer how the character is feeling and thinking.Mr. Darcy is a great villian/hero when you read because he is so lovable and caring without being obvious.Lizzy Bennet is one of the greatest characters ever written about! She is spunky, speaks her mind and she is supportive of all of her sisters (which is very important when Lydia takes a turn for the worst). She is a great, admirable person in the story, which makes reading Pride and Prejudice so enjoyable. Jane Austin really knows how to write!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Regarded as one of the classic pieces of literature, Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice does not disappoint. The novel chronicles the life of Elizabeth Bennett, a young woman pressured by 19th century standards to marry a man with favorable prospects. Elizabeth, however, is a quick witted and intelligent individual whose strong character is too valued by readers to face a miserable fate by marrying without love.The story begins with a certain Mr. Bingley and his friend who come to stay at a neighboring state of Netherfield. The eldest daughter, Jane, seems to be the daughter of his fancy, and after several balls and gatherings, the Bennets grow acquainted with Bingley, his two sisters, and his friend Mr. Darcy. Where Mr. Bingley plays the gentleman, charming, sociable, and pleasant, Mr. Darcy appears proud, introverted, and rude. Mr. Darcy's initial haughtiness towards Lizzy and his continual dismissal of those around him make him disagreeable at first, but through Austen's subtle description and dialogue of him, readers see him as a misunderstood character. The conversations between Elizabeth and Darcy at the balls or in Netherfield are where Austen's writing shines. Elizabeth's witty and charming dialogue challenges Darcy's cynicism and brutal honesty. The tension and anticipation Austen weaves merely through these interactions solidifies Darcy and Elizabeth's possible romantic relationship.As the novel progresses, Elizabeth is faced again with the prospect of marrying a wealthy man when Mr. Darcy proposes to her. Shocked, and above all, full of indignation upon hearing that he would marry her despite of his character, Elizabeth flatly refuses him. Darcy must then prove himself worthy of Elizabeth's attentions and Elizabeth must realize she was too quick to judge on first impressions.BY steffi castillo"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The manuscript for Jane Austen's best novel, originally titled First Impressions, was rejected and returned to the author. After some revisions, the novel was published as Pride and Prejudice. It has remained one of english literature's most popular novels. Pride and Prejudice did have its share of critics, perhaps one of the most notable of those critics was Charlotte Bronte, author of Jane Eyre, who called Austen's novel a disappointment. I wager many people would heartily disagree.Even people who have never read Pride and Prejudice have heard the names Elizabeth Bennet and Mr Darcy. The main protagonists of the novel have become trademarks of the British Regency era. In the novel, Lizzy and Mr Darcy appear to be the epitome of opposites. Upon their first encounter, Elizabeth Bennet believes herself perfectly aquainted with Mr Darcy's character and hopes she will never find herself in his miserable presence again. The phrase \\"don't judge a book by its cover\\" aptly applies to Mr Darcy.Pride and Prejudice is one of the finest novels I have ever read. I love it not only for the romance (which is unparalleled), but also for its humor. The televised adaptations of this novel, some dating back to 1940, are excellent. The BBC version starring Colin Firth, and the 2005 movie starring Keira Knightley are amazing. I don't think I could pick a favorite if my life depended on it. If I had to be stranded on an island with just one book, it would be Pride and Prejudice. If I could dream a fictional character to life, it would be Mr Darcy. Pride and Prejudice, an unforgettable book filled with unforgettable characters."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is a pandora's box of characters. Best friend, worst enemy, love of your life, and the one you love to hate, all found caught in a romantic tale that combines all the elements of human nature into a realistic struggle between true love and social status. The characters are phenominal. I don't think Jane Austen missed a single type of person, or disposition in her novel. As you learn of her characters and begin to relate to them you will run the emotional gamet. From anger to tears this book will take you into the perspective of multiple people. You will not only see through their eyes but feel what they feel. I don't think there is a single person who couldn't relate to someone in this book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"After reading BRIGID JONES: A DIARY and knowing it was a modern version/take on PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, I decided to read P&amp;P again. It is a beautifully written, carefully crafted story of an English family with five daughters, and they may be on the verge of losing their home and means of support. The main character Elizabeth is a very focused, honest, caring person. She says what needs to be said and does the things that need to be done. She is very observant of peoples personalities and what drives them, at least she believes she is until she meets Mr. Wickham and Mr. Darcy. That the daughters must marry due to their impending financial situation is never questioned, but who will the future husbands be? What makes Mr. Right, Mr. Right? How can one sister's Mr. Right be so wrong for everyone else but her? With all the social customs and duties is it possible that two people can actually find each other, fall in love and marry? There are characters you will love and characters you will love to hate. It is filled with humor,romance and drama, and enough twists and turns to create a wonderful and very enjoyable story."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is Jane Austen's best, except maybe Northanger Abbey. I wouldn't know, I haven't read it (yet). I couldn't like the characters in Emma, in Persuasion it was depressing, all that worrying it would have a sad end, in Mansfield Park, she was so meek(and no reason for him to fall in love), Sense and Sesibility was meatless, but P&amp;P sparkles. Likeable characters, romance, social commentary, everything."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I previously wrote when I was only Half-way through. I would like to update on what I read since then, now that I have finished the book. It is very well written, with a great plot.

They are completly wrong for each other, or so they think. Mr. Darcy has too much pride, he thinks he deserves the best of everything, including women. Elizabeth Bennet is prejudiced against him; she believes the gossip she hears about him. Who would ever think the two could ever get along, much less fall in love with each other! Meanwhile, Elizabeth's sisters try desperately to find the men of their dreams. I started reading this book a little timid. My mom told me that I just had to read it because it was a classic, but mainly because she read it and loved it when she was my age. So I had my doubts; my mom and I have different tastes in books, and I didn't trust her opinion much. I started reading it because I didn't have much time before I had to finish my book report. I found I loved the book more than I imagined I would. This story is romantic; it leads you in and out of the complicated minds of the Bennet family.

It IS a romance, this fact may turn people off, but (as far as I have gone anyway) there is much more to the story!

Not only are the characters perfectly sculpted into lifelike images (both charming and deceitful), but the romance is original, heart warming and honest. Darcy is not only dashing, but mysterious and compelling. Elizabeth is simply charming and delightfully strong willed. The supporting characters are simply wonderful; the mother's sillyness to Wickham's deceitfullness, Miss Bingley's almost comical bitterness to the absurb notion that Darcy could ever marry Lady Catherine's pitiful daughter. It all comes together to make the most wonderful book of love, social commentary and humour. I read this in one weekend-I couldn't put it down. If you have never read a &quot;classic&quot; and love romance read this. It'll charm your socks off!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I cannot express in words how much I loved this novel! Austen's wry humor and perceptiveness shine through in all her characters. I know it sounds cheesy, but I still do get excited over whether Elizabeth and Darcy will ever see eye to eye.

This is a classic story of (stating the obvious) pride and prejudice.

I could read it a million times and I cannot stress it enough for you to buy this book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride And Prejudice, written by Jane Austen, is an amazing work on the nature of love. Austen uses beautiful language and intriguing characters to tell this story of courtship in a time when reputation was everything. The main character, Elizabeth Bennet, is a clever-witted woman who manages to gracefully glide through the lines set up by society. Although she does not always come off as lady-like, her charm and confidence demand the reader's respect. She is surrounded by a cast of diverse characters, creating a riveting plotline. Her mother is a rather quirky character who wants nothing more than to see her daughters wed. Her father, on the other hand, is a sarcastic and intelligent man who favors Elizabeth for her wit. These characters are brought together with the Bingley's when Elizabeth's older sister, Jane, falls for Mr. Bingley. Here, we are introduced to the stubborn and proud character of Mr. Darcy. He seems to be above everyone else and completely opposed to the idea of love.When Elizabeth Bennet catches Darcy's eye, however, a battle between the mind and the heart begins. These two chracters are faced with the obstacles set up by a strict, Victorian society. Their largest obstacle, however, will be to overcome their own pride and prejudice, and discover their love for one another. Is this a battle that the heart can win?"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Austen's novel Pride and Prejudice, is one of the most superb novels in English literature. This novel includes love, lies, and lively characters. Austen's style of writing is superb, her use of the English language is music with words. Austen is able to give the reader an all around view of each character, since it is written in third person omnipresent, but through the many letters, the reader is able to understand each character in a personal way.Austen's heroine, Elizabeth Bennett is an exception to the typical women of her era. Her lively wit and determination not to marry for money is a model for women of all time, these qualities allow her to transcend time. Elizabeth stands up for herself and in the end is rewarded for her steadfast constitution, by marrying the man she loves. Although this situation is not typical in everyday life, that same quality is what makes this novel loved by all. Pride and Prejudice feeds into the illusion of true and perfect love. The man comes to rescue of the woman he loves and in doing so saves her and her family. He goes against his family's and societies wishes to marry the woman he loves.The unique way Pride and Prejudice is written enhances the story. The reader is able to get an inside look into every character's personality. The reader is able to see the flippant way Lydia writes as she decides to run away with Mr. Wickham, how truly ridiculous Mr. Collins is, and how sincerely Mrs. Gardiner loves Elizabeth. Through the letters we learn about some of the most important event in the novel. Mr. Wickham's true character, Lydia's elopement, and even Darcy's involvement in fixing the scandal.It is every woman's dream to be Elizabeth Bennet. To marry the man she loves become rich and live happily ever after. This novel plays on everybody's want to find true love despite all the obstacles in life. I loved Pride and Prejudice because it transported me to another simpler more beautiful place, where love conquers all."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Being the first Jane Austen novel which I have ever read, I was very pleasantly surprised to find that Pride and Prejudice was nothing at all as I had expected. Full of wit and humor, as well as a romance both entirely innocent and mature (a virtue sadly lacking in much of this age's romances), Pride and Prejudice also conveys the polished skill with which Austen writes. I was most surprised to find that Austen, with her sophisticated style, was in her late teens/early twenties when she wrote this novel.I could easily go on about her style, vocabulary, and intricate sentences (I had a little trouble following her sometimes), but the main focus should always be given to the story itself. Insightful and often hilarious characterization gave texture to the story, as did the complex personalities of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy. Mr. Bennet's off-hand remarks and Mary's deeply celebral, pompous observations on morality brightened up the scenery considerably. Jane Austen exercises expert storytelling to catch (and keep) interest until the very realistic, very satisfying, conclusion.Pride and Prejudice has earned its way onto my \\"feel-good\\" list of books, and I'm sure I'll be re-reading it for many years to come. Don't be discouraged by its old-fashioned front. Pride and Prejudice is one story that no one should be deprived of.Oh, and if you haven't seen the movie, go see it!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a great classic and should be read by anyone who enjoys Victorian Romance. The beautiful, intelligent, head strong Elizabeth Bennet has finally met her match in the arrogant, proud Mr. Darcy. Their tumultuous romance is extremely humorous and delightful to read.Although Jane Austen was a talented novelist, she was harshly criticized during her day for writing about marriage and the social life of well-bred, 19th century British women as opposed to more serious topics such as the French and American revolutionary wars. I however, believe that Ms. Austen was ahead of her time, exploring the world of gender politics with every witty heroine she created.Pride and Prejudice is a timeless tale that is just as enjoyable today as it was centuries ago. In fact, You may notice that this story is very influential in modern films and books, most recently in Bridget Jones's Diary. I recommend it highly!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"OK, maybe the title was a little much, but from what i have read...it is. Elizabeth Bennet is a young, satirical, young woman who is prejudiced against Mr. Darcy, a charming yet snobby man. The two argue throughout the entire book but when she realizes her misperception of him, they finally begin to love one another. This is perhaps one of the best parts of the novel, in my opinion.The characters are amazingly sketched out and Mrs. Bennt takes the cake! I had a lot of fun reading her comments as well as the sisters.Even though I am only thirteen, I believe that I fully grasped the novel. The words are a bit confusing, so keep a dictionary on you at all times.Jane Austen is one of my favorites, if not my most favorite, and I want everyone to read at least one of her novels!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"If you enjoy British 19th century literature, you are sure to like this book. I read it for a book group selection, and am so glad I was able to get a copy of it. The dialogue is so wonderfully witty, and full of meanings that are not immediately discernable to American readers that are less familiar with this more formal manner of speaking, as I was. I still enjoyed it, as the story is a romantic comedy that I feel has a little something for anyone that enjoys a good romance. It is definitely more subtle than the kinds of things one reads these days, but that seems to be a good thing. The BBC televised version with Colin Firth is also very good."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It's been awhile since I've read any literature involving flowery language and staunch manners but I'm so glad I came back to it!!! Pride and Prejudice is extremely well-written and the characterization is fabulous. Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy create delicious sparks with their constant head-butting and romantic tension. Elizabeth can probably best be described as someone who embodies the best manners, heart, and intentions without being sappy or spineless; she is incredibly intelligent and strong-willed. It's interesting to read this book and think of how women of the time had to play the love &quot;game&quot; and marry above their station to progress in society. It also sheds light on Jane Austen's own independent state of mind that her most darling character was a total fireball! This book will give you constant butterflies and provides a nice glimpse into the comedy and pettiness of the society of the time, all the while, weaving a charming tale not soon to be forgotten."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"i loved this book the moment i started reading it. each and every event in it beacame my very own; Jane austen definitely knows how to weave her stories into the hearts of the readers. elizabeth bennet, the heroine, is a vivacious spirited young woman who speaks from her mind and learns from her heart. mr. darcy is uniquely unfolded as a man of principles and convictions. he starts to make you think of what you truly stand for. this is a story full of warmth, tenderness and love from the heart. you'll enjoy every moment of this scintillating experience."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Well, I first readthis book last week and I think it's amazing. I saw the video of it last year and I think it is possibly one of the best dramatisations ever. I loved Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth in P&amp;P and this week I am hoping to buy Bridget Jones's Diary (being released here in England on Saturday). I find this book has a romanticism about it and when you read the book, you feel a longing to be back in the period where men where gallant and women were graceful. The sexual chemistry between Elizabeth and Mr Darcy was wonderful; you felt as if you were actually there.If you've already read it, read it again and if you've never read it... well, you've never lived!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride... and prejudice... just like it says... Allows us to spy on a world and in a time we'll never know, where pride rules at the expense of others, and prejudice is at its best... If you see yourself in the pages, it's a good thing to step back and think about how to change... or read just for the enjoyment."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is my favorite Jane Austin novel. The characters are so well developed and the descriptions so perfect I felt I was there with them. I loved getting lost in the story and couldn't wait to read what happened next. I would recommend this book to anyone!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen had great sociological, cultural and anthropological insights at her time. However, most of her works sound quite applicable and reasonable today as well, so many years onwards, i.e. after her. Nonetheless, her literary talent and skill are still unsurpassed. This story in particular is told in a very intuitive and psychological way, being very personal and touching, at the same time. The author is constantly flowing in the realms of human mentality, feelings and emotions; whereas keeping very sound and practical judgments on the wide social world surrounding the protagonist. Overall, it is a lovely story involving a whole spectrum of human moods, feelings and conditions, such as: love, romance, grief, happiness, longing, desire, rivalry, remorse, achievement etc."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Admittedly a challenge in verse from today's language... once beyond that, one is easily transported back in time and entranced by Austen's story-telling!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Of course you know why this rating is a five. Pride and Prejudice is one of the most amazing love stories I've EVER read. Honestly the writing style is not something I could read often, but this is a beautiful-reach in and touch your soul kind of read...Of course the movie is amazing as well, but I stand by what I always say-The book is ALWAYS better."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I know most teens whine & complain when assigned classics to read for school, but this book is so much more than required reading. I first read it in 5th grade (my reading level was advanced for my age #humblebrag lol) and I read it over and over, never tiring of the crisp, Victorian language or heart-rending love story. Read with an open mind!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Product was received a promised. I find ordering from Amazon to be very convenient and all products are usually price competitive."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Hadn't read this book in years and couldn't put it down just like last time. Very happy to have found it for free and didn't find any errors or differences that would make me believe it was different."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"You know how you decide to read a classic becuase you assume that any book that has survived for this long to be great? Then the entire time you read the book you hate it, but you are sure there is some reason it's a classic. Finally, at the end of the book, you realize that you just wasted your time reading an awful book. Well, this book isn't like that. It's actually really great. There are twists in the plot, a surprising end, good characters, and a loveable heroine. If you like romance, then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The description was exactly as written. Fast shipping and great costumer service. I would recommend the product and the seller."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"What more can be said about one of the greatest works in the English language? A life lived without reading this book must be deemed a complete failure on all counts."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is the first classic that I have ever read! I think that it was a great first choice to start reading these sort of novels.Recommended! :)"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Good story but quite difficult to read. The dialect seems archaic and hard to follow many times. If one can interpret the dialect, the story is charming."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Excellent 100% fulfilled in time, form and quality. Congratulations, and hopefully always remain so and so retain the confidence that you deposited your customers"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I own both Insight Editions of \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" and \\"Sense & Sensibility\\" and I only wish they had continued this series to include all of Jane Austen's major novels - Northanger Abbey, Mansfield Park, and Persuasion. The notes in the margins provide historical context, insights into Jane Austen's own life, and chatty asides from the editor that make you feel like you're reading the book along with an intelligent friend or book club. It is a fun introduction to Jane Austen's books for those new to Austen, and it's just another way to enjoy this classic book and really feel a connection to and a part of the kinds of conversations of \\"Janeites\\" JASNA meetings and book groups. It is an accessible edition of the book - less academic than the Norton Critical Edition, without compromising the experience of just reading Austen's books for fun."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have always been a romantic. I\`m that sucker who is always looking for a great romance novel or movie to captivate me and make me fall into the wonders of love overcoming all obstacles. So, yes, you could say I have seen and read my fair share of love stories, but this is the best.I first read this book when I was 12 after hearing incessesantly about how it was such a classic and a must-read (and of course I heard it was a romance, so that little fact right there solidified any scruples that I may have had at the time). I was mesmerized.Yes, of course it was rather difficult to understand the language at first and I did expect that. Instantly, though, I read it a second time and I locked in with Austen\`s flow of words and the sensations that I went through while reading her novel were incredible.Elizebeth Bennet is such a fantastic and relatable character and I believe any woman can relate to her. She\`s dignified and witty, but at the same time she\`s shy and believable. She\`s never ridiculous or over the top. Mr. Darcy....where do I begin? The changes in him and Elizabeth are just incredible and no matter how many times I read this book I can\`t help but fall in love with them all over again. Mrs. Bennet is truly ridiculous, but she means well. Mr. Bennet is a man who always settles and never really has determination to go ahead. He keeps to himself, sometimes it seems like he even avoids the truth of things unless it becomes dreadfully grave. Nonetheless, a great character. Mr. Collins; What a man! He will keep you laughing at how absolutely ridiculous he is. And Elizabeth\`s younger sisters are truly precious. Jane and Bingley are sweet and endearing. Miss Bingley is the perfect &#34;mean girl&#34;. Mr. Wickham is delightfully decieving and really supports the phrase, &#34;Looks are decieving.&#34; And lastly, the Gardiners are easily my favorite characters after Elizabeth and Darcy.The whole plot is wonderfully paced, and I will confess that first time reading it that it may seem slow and boring. But, when you really take the time to delve into Jane Austen\`s world and understand the truths that she expresses with such precision that still resonate in todays society, you really become intranced. You really feel like you know the characters and maybe even recognize the truth in them and recognize people you know. Austen was insightful and really understood people and characters and the morals of her time. She was brillant and I really wonder what it would be like to have met her if she was alive today. Pride ad Prejudice is my favorite novel and I really hope this review has done is justice. This is the best of the best and it will forever remain my favorite novel.Thank you Jane Austen for sharing with the world your characters and your truths."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"love this classic!!! only, what's with the incomplete names/titles? eg: ----shire ? I've read my grans' copy of this and it did not have those...."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I am not sure why everyone is so negative about this timeless classic. Yes there are no big car chase scenes, no unusually attractive female that makes everyone go \\"gaga\\", or large scale destruction. If you can get away from this and look at the story with a open mind and conscience, you will get a story that is moving and just right for just about anyone. I loved it and I think that it never gets old. Slow is the way and steady is the hand that created this masterpiece."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"a true classic. i have always wanted to read this book, and i was not disappointed.Although set in the 1800s it continues to teach life lessons and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I adore Elizabeth and the fact that she is headstrong and opinionated in this time when that was beyond frowned upon. I like Jane and her shyness. I LOVED Bingley and his charismatic charm. I also really love Mr Bennet and his sense of humor. Mrs Bennet & Lydia Bennet on the other hand were those characters you alway wanted to smack in the face for being so stupid...like so:And then there is Darcy.... At first, like everyone else, I wasn't very into him. He was standoffish and he insulted Elizabeth behind her back mere moments after meeting her! Seriously, what is wrong with you dude? I was fuming as much as Elizabeth...but then you realize that he is shy and awkward when conversing with people he doesn't know and he does all this amazing stuff just to help Elizabeth. I followed Elizabeth right down the rabbit whole when she started to fall for Darcy.My only real complaint, oddly enough, was the prose. I truly did not expect the way it was written to bug me. I am an historical romance novel fanatic so you would assume that this would be right up my alley, no?But it really wasn't. Apparently I only like to listen to them speak this way, not read it. When I hear them speak, it's like aw! He is paying her an extreme compliment and using all these pretty words. When I read it, the dialogue I can handle, but the entire page of description that basically amounts to \\"they lived in a large house called Longbourne that had many rooms and a lot of land with woods\\"....well I wasn't so into that. And when Mr Collins spoke, I had the biggest urge to just yell at him to spit it out already! Seriously dude, pull your head out of Lady Catherine's ass and speak for yourself! Stop paying Lady Catherine compliments every other word! Trust me, we understand that you think she is the awesome.Wow...this is probably the crappiest review I have ever written, but seriously there are tons of reviews out there that really explain what this book is about as well as several films, so if my review has left you confused, please go consult one of them (or just google it) and they will answers your numerous questions."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"After reading so many modern fiction popular titles it is so refreshing to go back to a classic. Pride and Prejudice really is at the top of my classic favs list."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I am mad that I put off reading this book for so long. I absolutely loved the story, the characters, just everything about it. I couldn't put it down and was sad when it ended. The progression of Elizabeth's and Mr. Darcy's relationship and love was beautiful. The family dynamics of the Bennetts was so real. Amazing story, beautifully written."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have, to this point in my life, successfully avoided reading any Jane Austen books, supposing them to be superfluous and archaic. I really only read this book because I wanted the foundation and familiarity with the story prior to reading the adaptation entitled ''Pride and Prejudice and Zombies'' by Seth Grahame-Smith. Because who can pass up a good zombie book, after all?I started this book begrudgingly but was soon intrigued by the language. I amused myself by reading aloud a paragraph of flowery language to my husband and then paraphrasing it in a sentence. I proclaimed and bemoaned the inefficiency of the writing style but persevered and slogged on. About halfway through the book, I surprised myself by really wanting to know what happened next. And here I sit, 1am in the morning, having to finish the book tonight with the absolute stubbornness of having to know Elizabeth's disposition!Hands down, I loved this book. Shame on me and my ignorance for Ms. Austen's talent. I hope to read many more of her books. After I read the zombie version of 'Pride and Prejudice'. :)"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"My English master at school made us read P&P out loud and we did enjoy it but I still have no idea why. Since then I have read it many times but still can't put my finger on the reason that it is so good. One of the problems is that we have all seen the TV adaptation and the movies especially with that background music. I recently read it out loud to a class of school children in Africa and they were captivated. But why?"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This tale is a classic, and for good reason. It has managed to stand the test of time and even after so many generations, Jane Austen is still able to capture your heart and pull you into this charming, little world and endear you to her lovable, fleshed out characters.

If you enjoy a smart romance, sharp wit, and the humor of peering into the character flaws of those about you, you won't be disappointed. Austen wrote my favorite heroine of all time within the pages of this novel. Elizabeth Bennet absolutely steals the show!The Bennet sisters, under the hand of an often dramatic and obnoxiously silly mother and a father, who abounds with dry humor but mostly abdicates his role, face life, society, and courtship in the English countryside. This is no easy task, for the young women have no considerable wealth or lofty position to aid them in a time when that was quite important.Pride And Prejudice chronicles the romantic fiascoes of the Bennet girls. Jane, the eldest sister, wins the love of the young and well-to-do Mr. Bingley, although certainly not without trial and tribulation. But jealousy and interference leave her happiness in serious doubt. Lydia, the middle child, selfish and flighty, refuses to comply with propriety, and her actions threaten the chances of all the sisters. The two youngest, Mary and Kitty, while affected by the goings-on, don't figure as prominently in the story. This leaves Elizabeth, the novel's main female character, to entertain with her bold wit and keen observations during her own adventures in life and love.When Elizabeth Bennet first encounters Mr. Darcy, she at once understands him to be prideful and ill-mannered, founding her long lasting prejudice. Adding to her less than friendly impressions are the accusations against Mr. Darcy by the family's newest acquaintance, Mr. Wickham. Circumstances, however, continue to throw the two together, and the time spent coming to know Elizabeth begins to alter Mr. Darcy's opinions. His change in behavior leaves much to be desired, and it isn't until after Elizabeth's scathing face-to-face assessment of Mr. Darcy's character flaws that he confronts his pride whole-heartedly, and Elizabeth faces her prejudice.Strength of character, probing dialogue, and honest reflection turn their opinions of one another into something altogether different as Elizabeth and Darcy, each in their own way, dare to break with convention and hope in love.After reading Austen's original again, I am more than eager to dive into the first sequel on my list! Reading the varied takes on what the Darcy's love affair may have looked like once they married intrigues me to no end.~Moira"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I'm slightly embarrassed to say that it took me this long to get around to reading Pride & Prejudice. I don't like romance novels and I'm generally wary of anything that is too popular. And yet here I am, giving P&P one of the few 5-star ratings I've ever bestowed. Jane Austen is, without a doubt, among the wittiest, cleverest, most talented authors I've ever read. I laughed out loud repeatedly, thoroughly enjoyed many of the characters (the protagonists were refreshingly frank and the stupid ones were delightfully annoying), and don't you tell anyone but I had tears in my eyes when Darcy and Elizabeth finally sorted things out. I'll be thinking about this book for a long time, and I imagine that I'll be delving into Austen's other books in short order."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is an amazing classic. Those who have seen the movie...READ THE BOOK! Austen does a wonderful job in her character development and capturing the emotions and making them tangible. I don't think I have ever enjoyed a classic more and I hope to endulge in many more."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I understand that classics have their worth, but most of them bore me. Pride and Prejudice, however, is one of the few lit peices that makes me smile and want to finish it.This book is free on Kindle-- there's absolutely no reason not to download it and give it a chance."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride & Prejudice is one of the few books that I can honestly say earned its status as a classic with a huge fan base. It is brilliantly written plot-wise and character-wise, set in the time of propriety and manners in Regency England (early 1800s). Jane Austen at her bestSynopsis: (WARNING POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT!!!)The novel opens with the arrival of a wealthy young gentleman, Mr. Charles Bingley, at Netherfield Park, accompanied by his rather haughty sisters and friend, Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy. Seeing the wealthy newcomers, the Bennet family of the nearby village of Longbourn, is in great excitement. The silly and impractical Mrs. Bennet thereupon aims to marry off at least one of her five daughters: Jane (the eldest and the kindest), Elizabeth (the most sensible), Mary (the most studious), Kitty (the simple-minded), and Lydia (the silliest). Almost immediately, the amiable Mr. Bingley is well-liked by the community, while his friend, Mr. Darcy, appears just the opposite. From the start, since he rejected her at a ball, Elizabeth's first impression of Mr. Darcy is to be arrogant, proud, and conceited. Her dislike of him is only heightened when she hears an account of Mr. Darcy, as ruthless and cold-hearted, from a handsome and sociable young officer, Mr. George Wickham. Meanwhile, despite Mrs. Bennet's embarrassing meddling, Mr. Bingley and Jane Bennet begin to develop an attachment, and though unawares, Elizabeth's liveliness and intelligence grows on Mr. Darcy, who unconsciously falls for her - despite all his objections to her inferior birth status and her ridiculous mother and younger sisters. As Elizabeth, the main protagonist, eventually discovers, one of her two admirers - Mr. Wickham and Mr. Darcy - has all the appearance of goodness, while the other has all the genuine goodness."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"As a high school student I was not sure I would like this book at all. This book was an easy read because of how well it was written and how much the story grabs on to you. Ever since reading this book I have gone on to read all of Jane Austen's book and found that they were equally as good."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is an excellent novel that explores how love fits into a society consumed by an obsession with marriage. As expected from a nineteenth century British novel highlighting upper society, Jane Austen's writing uses a proper and sophisticated syntax. Working with the dignified tone, the syntax often coats the characters' bluntness and turns them into seemingly kinder remarks. These situations tend to be the most humorous, because the readers and the characters all know what is being said beneath all the comments. These dialogues also add important dimension to all of the characters. For example, Elizabeth is very witty and can uphold amusing and complex conversations with Mr. Darcy, but afterward her reflections show that she has insecurities despite her verbal strength. Without the depth of Elizabeth's character as well as the depth of the other characters, the novel would seem much longer and more dragged out than it can be at times. If the readers have the patience to get through some of the slower parts and can focus on the brilliant interactions between the characters, then they will be incredibly satisfied at the end of the beautiful novel."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I first read this book this past school year (11th grade), with a teacher who is an active JANSA Member (The Jane Austen Society of North America). The one thing I will always remember from him, was that in this book the characters are so real that you can see them in your everyday life. Along with my teacher we took a trip down to memory lane and saw all of Jane's characters in his High School (he wrote this as an essay he read at a JANSA congregation). And of course he ended by finding his Elizabeth, who's name is actually Jane (ironic isn't it?).I TRULY recommend this book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Meet the Bennet sisters: demure Jane, witty Elizabeth, bookish Mary, impressionable Kitty, and lusty Lydia. It's the usual story: they don't have much in the way of dowries but need to marry upstanding English gentlemen...Elizabeth Bennet quickly emerges as the heroine with her wry sense of humor and take-no-prisoners attitude to social life. She puts all twentieth century heroines to shame when she tells off Mr. Darcy (while maintaining perfect decorum). Unusual twists and turns spark up the &quot;marriage plot&quot; of the book. There are some great villains, too."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Let this serve as a warning that at least one of the reviews below details most of the plot developments of this most endearing of English novels. In the unlikely event that you haven't already read Pride and Prejudice, and you like to have some surprises the first time you read a novel, you explore farther at your own peril."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I had to read this for school and at first it was really hard to get into it. After awhile, though, it seemed to get better. Some of the words were really hard to understand and I needed a dictionary by me. It is actually a really good book. I was suprised because a lot of people said it was boring. It was boring at first, but if you stick to it and make yourself read it it will get better. I recommend this book to people who like to read romance. The characters are very well developed and the theme of the story is good."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"With pride and Prejudice Austen has at last created a heroine that does not go to pieces at the first sight of an eligible young man. elizabeth Bennett's mind rules her heart not the other way around. thus Mr. Darcy who is attracted to her must first prove his love and loyalty before Elizabeth will consider him. this novel is one of austne's finest and I found myself captured by the story. In those days marriage was essential to a woman's happiness and thus she strove to do all in her power to find a suitable match. it is a task that frankly has not totally died even today despite all the social change that has taken place since this book was written. One has to wonder what Austen would think if she was alive today. the main message of this novel is not to rush to judgement in regards to others. A notion wich still holds great importance. Though at times a little too lighthearted this book nevertheless is an enjoyable read or in my case a listen. Naxos did a great job in making Austen's novel come alive. the narrator read the text with the right amount of tone and intonation and the classical music breaks between scenes was a nice touch. When it comes to audio classics noe one does it better then Naxos. I will have to buy more of Austne's work done by them.this audiobook contains 3 CD's and is abridged; yet i do not think i have missed anything in regards to the overall story. I found listneing to the book very pleasing and will be a fine addition to my audio library."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is only the second Jane Austen book that I have read, but certainly not the last! Though the numerous characters and complex sentences provide the reader with a challenge and requires some concentration, the end result is definitely rewarding. Complicated characters and complicated relationships leave the reader constantly on their toes, and you never know what to expect next. What's so wonderful about this book is that the characters are so real. There are so many memorable characters in this story about Mrs. Bennet attempting to marry off her five daughters, and these characters aren't perfect, merely human, making them easy to relate to as well as laugh at. In reading this book, you see yourself in the same tough situations and awkward moments as them and realize that we sometimes forget that we don&iexcl;t have to be flawless. Everyone is proud and prejudiced at sometime or another; we aren't perfect, and it's okay!Though perhaps an easier read than Emma, Pride and Prejudice is similar in that it is also full of the same brilliant dialogue and subtle humor. This book is great for anyone who is interested in a romantic comedy that will that twirl you around with its genius and surprises."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It seems like a simple statement. Mr. Darcy, the hero of our novel, simply doesn't have time to write to his overbearing aunt to inform her of his engagement to be married. But, like most things in Jane Austen, it has more meanings than one.I will be the first to admit that the plot of the novel is transperent. Anyone who has read a romance can see from the outset that Darcy and Lizzy (a.k.a. Elizabeth Bennet) will end up with each other. The only question is how, why, when, and who will be affected. To find that out, you'll have to read the story. I don't believe I'm giving anything away by saying that the seemingly sub-human Fitzwilliam Darcy (he's got quite a name, has he not?) will thaw eventually, and that Lizzy will warm to his new, altered state. For, simply put, the point of the novel is not the story, but the beautiful prose and dialogue. The deliciously satisfying banter of the newly-engaged Darcy and Lizzy in Chapter 18 of Part Three (some versions are not divided into parts, but I trust you can find this chapter) leaves you tingling with glorious anticipation of their soon to be union.The reader will thrill when he calls her &quot;Elizabeth&quot; for the first time (as opposed to a cold &quot;Miss Bennet&quot;), and the effect is somewhat heightened by his adding a passtionate &quot;dearest, lovliest&quot; before the name. For Darcy, despite his reserves, is a deeply passionate man.Back to my original point. There is something deeper in Jane Austen's seemingly silly and pointless escapades. The novel is an examination of human foibles (sp?) and follies, a critical probing of the pitfalls of society. Austen's points are timeless, for some things never change. In any case, when Darcy says, in response to Lizzy's inquiry as to when he will find the courage to write to his aunt, the despised Lady Catherine DeBourgh, who greatly opposes his marriage to Lizzy, that he is more likely to want time than courage, it means more than it seems to. He is saying, subtly perhaps, but he's saying it all the same: he treasures his time with Lizzy, and he hates to darken it with a cloud of impending doom. Besides which, he loves to talk to his fiance, and wile away hours wandering the country lanes in a state of happiness beyond that which he has ever known. Why waste the precious minutes writing to that stupid Lady Catherine, anyway?As you can see, a philosopher like myself can find reams of meaning in a simple sentance of Austen. If that isn't reason enough to read her novel &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, I don't know what is.--Child of the Burning Heart"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The most striking feature of my experience with &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is the sense of overwhelming changes in society in the last 200 years.

The characters are very real and the period well represented. It is also funny. I could not put it down once I started and at the end, I just went back and re-read it!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I am reading this book all over again for the, hmm, I really have lost count - let's just say the umpteenth time. Reading it was supposed to be a \\"filler\\" until the time I could lay my hands on an as yet unread book. Needless to say, though I have other books in line now, I am completely drawn in and am not willing to give up reading Pride and Prejudice till I reach \\"The End\\" again.This is a book which keeps growing on you and you like it even more on each subsequent reading. The characterization is simply brilliant. The dialogues, though too convoluted and flowery by today's standards, are a treat to read. The characters are all mostly likeable. Though it is supposed to be a romance, there is a whole lot more to the book. Each reading brings out subtler shades and makes you nod your head delighted as the new facet presents itself!Pride and Prejudice has to be one of my most favorite books of all time. I can read it any time and love it all over again. You are missing out on a real treat if you have not read it yet - go get it :-)!Another note: I think because the protagonist is female, women tend to enjoy this book a whole lot more than men!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Of all of Austen's novels, and I've read them all, Pride and Prejudice stands out to me as the most dynamic. The characters are richly developed and the plot woven skillfully in and out of the quirks of society. This book can be boring and tedious to read if you let it, but with a little imagination and an enjoyment of the language it can take flight and transform. I have read the book five or six times and studied it in an English analysis class, and each time I find something new to discover and relish in Austen's witty commentary. Read it once for the plot, then read it again for the social critisism, and it will blow you away!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"If you are like I was before reading this wonderful book, you probably can't imagine what could be so wonderful about Pride and Prejudice. How can it be interesting, you're thinking, when it's written in such a stuffy time period? I'll stick with my science fiction/romance novels/westerns, thank you very much. And it's true, you can't find any lusty young rogues, aliens, or gun fights, but that doesn't keep it from being an extremely wonderful book to read. The characters are full of life, the plot well constructed, and the entire story full of charm and humour. Don't be put off by the language either. It takes some getting used to, but once you're going it's not only completely natural, but makes today's English seem completely dull and simple. I cannot stress enough how wonderful this book is. (By the way, in case you think I'm someone who thinks a 'good time' is a trip to the museum or a riveting game of chess, I'm not. I take sick pride in my love of the uncultured, but even I can't help but love this book.) Once more, with feeling: Don't avoid this book because of the time period it's written in."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"When I first started to read this book I thought that it would have alot of old time english that I couldn't understand and that there would be alot of slow spots and bore. But as I got into the book (which didn't take very long) I found a REALLY great novel.The plot is amazing, it's one of those books that make you think about it when your done.I have read alot of romance novels in my life and this is by far the best one.I also think this book gives an important message: You should get to know a person before you jugde them because for all you know they could be your true love.If you are looking for something a little more than just a silly romance. Look no further than Pride and Predjudice."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The construction of the story and the storytelling are wonderful. It is a page-turner even though I know how it ends. I wish to find its equivalent in contemporary literature."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a great book full of love, scandal, humor, wit, and drama. Whether you are young or old, I am positive that this novel has an aspect of interest that will catch your attention right away. Set in an 18th century English society, Jane Austen does a fantastic job of adding comic relief and wit to a society where men have almost ultimate control. The estate of the Bennet family is entailed to Mr. Collins, so the five Bennet daughters must find suitable husbands if they wish to have a home or property in the future. The book revolves around conversation and thoughts the characters have about each other. Austen never gives a complete physical description of the characters, so the reader is left to make an opinion on each character based on their first impression of them. This style of diction and syntax eventually leads to the discovery of a major theme: do not always trust your first impression of someone. Irony is another common device Austen used in the novel. The Bennet's second daughter, Elizabeth, and Mr. Darcy end up falling for each other despite every obstacle that was thrown at them. Problems with social status, money, Mr. Darcy's pride, and Elizabeth's refusal to settle on a man caused drama in the beginning stages in their relationship. The novel's ending proved that one should not judge a person on a first impression and that true love truly can conquer all. Those facts will always make to novel relevant to current times, contrary to those who call the novel out of date. Read this novel and fall in love!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The diction and the story line of the novel is so amazing, The Darcy/Elizabeth chemistry is amazing and great for any romantic reader."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Great read, and the plot is just so easy to follow, the romance and wit is what sealed the deal for me."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Brainy sophisticated and hilarious.

It's a classic that can still be related to today.

Really a splendid author describing quite effectively lively characters."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"a fun book once you got used to the language it was impossible to put down. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Writing styles such as Jane Austin don't usually keep my attention well and, at first, this book was no different. I had to force myself to read the first 6-7 chapters. By a quarter though the book, I found myself enjoying the writing and storyline much more. It was an enjoyable read and I liked the book very much, but I can't say I agree with others who say it's one of the greatest novels ever written. Then again, it's just not my preferred writing style. Also, I got this on my Kindle for free and the formatting was just fine."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I recently had a chance to see the full Masterpiece Theater production of Pride and Prejudice (if you have never seen Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy, you haven't lived) and loved it as much as ever. Now that I have a Kindle and many of the classics are free I couldn't resist. I recalled that the dialogue in the series was almost verbatim from the book but I hadn't read the book in so many years that I couldn't recall how well the rest matched up. They are different because the book does a lot of narration that in the film had to be shown by activity, so it gives a different insight into your favorite characters. I was delighted to find so much in the book not in the series.The book is a perfect delight and it obvious why this treasure by Jane Austin ranks so high in the lists of English literature. Austin's skill at dialogue, character and plot development are unmatched. I had intended to just skim the book to pick up the pieces I wanted but I read every word and was delighted with the extra sections in the book not in the series. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I just finished reading the book about half an hour ago. I read it in almost two weeks, since the complexity of my life's schedule did not let me finish it in less time. Let me assure you that it is a good title, and I look forward to reading more on Jane Austen. I enjoyed the reading so much in my Kindle that one day was reading at the University, waiting for some Registration assistance, and I began laughing on the occurrences of Lady de Bourgh at Longbourn.I gave this title a 4 star review since some formatting problems on the Kindle edition; including capital letters where there was no need, word and line spacing, and not coming with a list of the Chapters to be read.Although I found these errors sometimes annoying, I enjoyed quite much the experience of reading this ebook, since I never thought I would enjoy an 1800's title.Enjoy your reading!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I read this book because I have been trying to catch up on some classics of literature that I haven't read. I expected to find it to be boring and stuffy, but I vowed that I would read it. To my great fortune, my prejudice against the book turned out to be completely wrong. It is wonderful book and a great read. It is witty, funny, and perceptive, with great insights into human relationships and the structure of society during its era (late eighteenth century England)."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I've read this book so often, I can actually quote word for word. Within the first few pages you forget which century you're in, and really feel for Elizabeth and Jane as their sisters and mother embarrass them in society. You feel poor Darcy's bemusement at falling in love with someone from a (perceived) lower class, and you ache for Lizzie to unbend a little and cut the guy some slack. When they finally get it on, I breathe a huge sigh of relief that everything's turned out so wonderfully. Yes, even though I must have read it over a hundred times. And that's timeless fiction."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Please note that this review is on the hard cover edition offered here via Barns and Noble. Amazon, for reasons known only to themselves, have chosen to lump every review of the classic piece of literature together no matter the format. As I go through these reviews I find that hard cover editions, e-books, books on tape, unknown bindings, paperbacks and I don't know what all have all been thrown into the same bag.Let me be perfectly honest and tell you that as far as Austen's work itself, I would give it ten stars if that were possible. This is NOT a review of her work though, rather a review of this particular edition...as stated above. I recently went of a book buying spree for my wife to replace worn out, lost (she is a great loaner of books and many of those loaned books never find there way home), and simply misplaced books. She, like me, is a big Austen fan.Anyway, the Barns and Noble edition book described on this product page is a very fine book when you consider the cost. It is difficult to find a decent paperback book these days, much less a hardback version of anything that does not cost an arm and a leg if bought new.Now so with this printed hard back version. The book is well made. The paper, while not of fine are quality, is certainly nice enough. The binding appears quite good...I know about such things and for a mass produced books this is about as good as you are going to find anywhere. The cost is more than reasonable . (Hey...a supersized extra value meal will cost you more), and font used is extremely readable and easy on the eyes.If you order this book you must pay shipping charges; something to consider. I personally bought mine, along with a number of the \`classics' in this series directly at a B&N; store, (We drive to the big city at least every other month), thus saving the cost of S&H.;For a big bang for your buck, I can hardly see how you can go wrong with this one.As to the work itself; if you have not read this one, do so. You are in for a true reading treat. If you have read it before, then read it again! If you are one of those that simply do no like Austen's work...well, don't read it at all!Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I consider myself a moderately well read person, as I have read a few of the must read classics, yet I had not embarked on one of literature's most celebrated journey, the journey into the land of Longbourn and Pemberly as seen in Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. A few years ago I selected the book to attempt to read it, but I became immediately bored with the literature and tossed it aside, deciding against finishing it.I came across a book claiming to be a sequel of Pride and Prejudice (and a bad sequel I must say) and I decided to give the classic another try.I cannot ascertain why, but this time, something was changed. Before I finished the first chapter, I was completely entranced in the story of the Bennet's and later, Darcy and the Bingelys.At first, I was completely ignorant of the time period's lingo and I was flailing, reading slowly to completely understand the richness of the grand words. But by the middle of the book, I was fluent in the old English tongue and my native tongue, American English, was past.The plot and dialogue was like no other book I have had the pleasure of reading. The sheer brilliance of Austen's artfully crafted words and wonderful plot left me wishing the book would never reach its finish.But it did.I nearly cried when I bid farewell to my newly acquainted friends, Fitzwilliam Darcy, Elizabeth Bennet, Jane Bennet, Georgiana Darcy, Mr. Bingely, Charlotte Lucas, and the laughable Mr. Collins. An emptiness accompanied me, as I put the book the down, the aching, despairing emptiness that makes you wish that you were in the book, and lucky enough to know the characters.And this is why I encourage you to pick up Pride and Prejudice. You may be like me and either be intimidated by the vast use of vocabulary or have sampled the book before and found it not to your taste.I urge you to try again. All it took was another try and just like that, I was in love with the book forever.Look past the hard words or the moderate length and look directly into a charming book that is sure to captivateyou and draw you in as it did me.Pride and Prejudice is a timeless classic, full of eloquent words, beautiful romance, and a few twist and turns. Pride and Prejudice will always be my favorite book and will always have a hallowed spot on my bookshelf.Is anyone else in love with Mr. Darcy?"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I can't even begin to tell you all how much I loved this book (I loved it most ardently!). It was sweet, heartfelt and real! I felt connected to the characters in a way that I have never been connected with a character before, and that's saying a lot because I'm a very intense reader. I ususally grieve when I finish a book I love, and this was no exception. I think I'm still grieving a little, and It's been almost a week since I've read it!Jane Austen is one of the most if not THE most admirable writers of all time. You can't stay out of her stories. SHe grabs you and pulls you right in there with Elizabeth and Darcy and everyone else, making you fall in love with each and every character deeply."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have always loved reading a good book but I am a romantic at heart and when I started searching for Kindle freebies I came across many different categories of authors. (My mind likes to organise and categorize things). There are the Christian romance authors who explicitly introduce concepts of God and his love for us as they enfold and develop the love story between the main characters. There are the Sex-driven romance authors who give you great details on the physical attraction between the characters and then give you a front row seat (in your imagination of course) to all or some of the sexual experiences in the story. There are the sci-fi based romance authors whose love stories are mystical and many times quite unthinkable. And of course there are the action based romances where the hero is invariably going to end up in some situation (like a fight or car chase) where his machoism will be displayed to the full appreciation of the heroine. And then there are the Historical romance authors who may take any of the aforementioned slants but just given from a historical stand point. Their stories tend to have lot of substance since their work is more often than not well researched and offer detiails and facts of how society and life in general was in the past.Jane Austen's work in Pride and Prejudice falls into none of my categories. You see although she mentions that the characters went to church, she never quite gave us a sermon. Even the value of sex within marriage was the standard of the day and as she dealt with this topic it was in no way an attempt to be \\"preachy\\". It is not sex-driven for there are no sex scenes and quite frankly many physical details on the characters are missing and instead an overview of the person's features are simply stated as \\"Mr. Darcy was tall and handsome\\". There was no mysticism or any element of science fiction and the greatest action any of the characters indulged in was taking a walk. The men did not even work hard but rather spent a lot of time reading in their libraries or playing indoor games (like cards). And while we read of carriages and horses and an England of long ago, the truth of the matter is that this is neither the work of a historical romance author because Ms. Austen wrote about her own time and the dependence of women on marriage for economic security and as a means to escape social ridicule and shame. And yet it is a wonderful and probably the best romance story I have ever read (even though I hace not yet categorized it) and not because of its quite ancient philosophies of women but because it is so frank and honest when told through the eyes of the female protagonist, Elizabeth Bennet.It is a pure work of art and Ms. Austen not only transported me to a different time but to a different place and I was amazed at how enthralled I was at this very \\"wordy\\" books. Yes I love words too but there is a definite art in the way she strung words together with witticism and/or sarcasm for the various dialogue scenes.When held up next to this masterpiece, many modern day romance stories look so immature and hurried. Their creators would do well to read literature such as this! This book has stood the test of time!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason. While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\\").It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love. An absolute must-read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I absolutely adored the movie Pride & Prejudice with Keira Knightley. I then thought it would be fun to read the original novel on my new Kindle. Even though it took me three days to read it I was not dissapointed. I had the movie running in my mind the entire time I was reading so I was able to compare the movie with the novel. I must say it enhanced the experience. I so loved each time Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy communicated in any way. Just reading their conversations was such a delight. The book really filled in all the conversations that didn't make it into the movie.This story reveals how it is possible to go from hating someone to loving them completely. The journey Elizabeth must go through to love Mr. Darcy is fascinating and complex. There are many letters exchanged and gossip Elizabeth must sort through to find the truth. The reader really feels the hatred she feels and then feels the warming of the heart as each page goes by. Truly this is one of the best romance novels ever written. I'd recommend you watch the movie first and then you will have something to compare this to.

A suitor proposes, is summarily rejected and marries someone else within days. A woman doesn't like men but wants to get married anyway. A sixteen-year-old runs off with a man and doesn't marry him right away, much to the chagrin of both her parents and sisters. A mother has no use for her daughter's suitor but happily accepts him into the family because he is wealthy. The less money a family has, the more important it is that all their daughters marry and quickly. If the family lives in the country, they must work harder to get these daughters married. Sound like your favorite sitcom and/or your favorite cousin and her family? Well, it's Jane Austin's timeless PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. I recently reread this comedy of manners that I hadn't read since high school. Here we have much ado about getting the daughters married. Even though we in the U. S. have lived through the 60's and the &quot;Women's Movement,&quot; sixty percent of law students now are women, and many things have changed about the way young women are brought up and what they do with their lives, I still saw a lot of families I know here. Everything changes; yet everything remains the same.Everybody points out what is so unique about this novel as well as the rest of Austin's works. She does very little to place them in any given time. They are quite wonderful in what they don't tell us. Austin doesn't give us a lot of specificity about a lot of things. For example, The Bennetts are always entertaining yet we don't know much about what they eat other than &quot;venison&quot; or &quot;meat.&quot; While people often &quot;color&quot; when they blush, the only color named in the entire novel is blue; Wickham may wear a blue coat when he gets married. The young women often play music but we are never told the names of the pieces they play. We do know that Elizabeth plays rather badly. I kept thinking that these young girls have too much free time on their hands. They need more hobbies or part-time jobs. Of course young women of a certain station in Austin's day didn't work.The ironic first line of the novel is well-known: &quot;It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.&quot; With that great opener, we are off and running.Parts of this novel will make you smile; others will make your laugh. My favorite character is the father, Mr. Bennett, who is quick to see and point out his wife's and others' foibles but never sees his own."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I downloaded the illustrated Kindle version of Pride and Prejudice for free from Amazon. Thank you Amazon! This is one of my favorite books and one that I have re-read several times and will read again.OK. So you know this isn't a bitch and complain session and that I am appreciative of the freebies I have gotten from Amazon. So here it goes, the good, bad, and the suggestions.This illustrated version of Pride and Prejudice - offered by Amazon - is beautifully formatted for the Kindle. It is attractive and appealing and like most Kindle books is a pleasure to e-read.The only problem that I can see - or actually CAN'T see - is the muted e-ink illustrations or the text below each illustration. Even when I zoom in on the illustration, though I can see the illustration better, I still can't read the writing :( I have a Kindle DX (larger Kindle), so this must be a serious problem for people with regular 7 in. sized Kindles.If the e-ink problem with the nine illustrations were solved, I would gladly pay .99 cents for a copy of this partially illustrated book. If the problem were fixed AND each of the sixty-one chapters were presented with one of the Brock illustrations, I would gladly pay $9.99 for the e-book. And please don't tell me to buy the newer, smaller Kindle because the e-ink is sharper. I have tested it out at the store, and though somewhat sharper, it is not sharp enough to make up for 60 year old eyes when e-ink is muted.Any way, I will make due with this freebie from Amazon and keep searching the web site from time to time for the improved edition:)"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice was published in 1813 in three volumes, the customary presentation of a novel in the early 19th Century. Penguin Press has provided Kindle owners with a wonderful enhanced version of the novel preserving the three volume format without attempting to standardize or modernize the text.The Penguin book is presented by Juliette Wells, Enhanced E-book Features Editor. It is edited with an introduction and informative notes by Vivien Jones. The result is a very readable yet scholarly treatment of the novel, with a biography of Jane Austen, 19th Century reviews of the book, descriptions of how to make tea and Jane Austen's eating habits, and much more.The last time I read Pride and Prejudice was in 1966 in an English literature class in college. I challenged the professor's choice of reading material as completely irrelevant given the Vietnam War and the Civil Rights movement and protests on my college campus, San Francisco State. It was a pleasure to reread the book with the wisdom of age supplemented by the excellent notes throughout the three volumes. Kindle owners can, with a spin of the wheel and a click, read explanations of the semantics of the vocabulary used by Austen, consider content interpretations, view illustrations of fashion, learn historical dance steps, and see period architecture.The focus of the production, of course, is the novel with its themes of first impressions, pride, vanity, seduction, feminism, prejudice, sexism, fatal attraction, society, intellectual domination, morality, etiquette, marriage, heritability, class structure, the family as a purposeful unit, and personal happiness. I highlighted many passages and notes to read again and enjoy. One example is from Volume 1 when Darcy says to Elizabeth, \\"There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.\\" Another example of my highlights is from Volume 2 when Elizabeth states, \\"The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense.\\" And here is an example of an explanatory note I highlighted from Volume 3, \\"e3. Elizabeth's determination here matches her effort throughout the novel to pursue what she considers to be her own happiness; compare her response to Mr. Collin's proposal of marriage in chapter 19.\\" The novel, notes, and other features allow the reader to experience the historical context of the first edition.Before reading Pride and Prejudice, I reread James Joyce's Ulysses on my Kindle with Don Gifford's Ulysses Annotated paperback book as a guide. It would have been a better reading experience to have this excellent source integrated with the novel. Penguin's enhanced e-books with built in reference features will be excellent for new publications of classic novels. I learned a great deal more about Austen's novel in the convenient Kindle format than I did 42 years ago in college. Hopefully, I'll be able to add many enhanced Penguin classics to my Kindle Library."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This edition has a nice binding and the illustrations are charming. However, the margins and type are both too large and the result is a 476 page book which is awkward to hold.

It's such a masterwork of the English language, so richly layered and textured and such a sharp observation of the society in which Austen lived. Read only at surface level, it seems little more than a sweet romance but when the text is examined deeply the mastery of Austen becomes apparent.Was Austen a feminist? I'm not entirely convinced of this but what I do know is that she was keenly, keenly aware of the way her world worked. She knew that the only power a woman had was to charm and flirt until she captured herself a rich husband. A woman did not have the power to seek her own occupation and a sharp and educated mind was not exactly appreciated. This is why Austen and her most bewitching heroine Elizabeth are so very subversive. Austen's creation, like Austen herself, bucks the convention of the time and is determined to see her life played out on her own terms. She will not settle for anything less than love and though that may seem simple to today's reader, it was anything but in an age when money and status meant everything. Elizabeth is not perfect. She makes mistakes and she is judgmental at times but her greatest strength is her determination to be true to herself.And yet even though Austen makes such a strong case for independence of spirit, she is also kind to those who bow to convention. Though Elizabeth's dear friend Charlotte makes a choice that initially seems extremely repugnant, it is easy to see that, really, Charlotte is simply doing what she must to survive. It is not that Charlotte is any less true to herself than Elizabeth, it is simply that she is rather more practical and pragmatic. She sees her situation in a very clear light and, in the end, chooses what is for her the lesser of two evils. I think that Austen respected this as well. Being brave and forging a new path is not for all of us.As for Darcy, he is also a product of his time. He behaves in a way that society feels a man should. At a very young age he must deal with gross abuses of his father's trust and a rather horrific betrayal of his family's kindness. He is forced to shoulder responsibility at a time when his peers may have been busy gambling and chasing skirts. There are few in whom Darcy can confide and he holds his cards so close to his chest that he must shut out others who could perhaps be of assistance to him. Though his wealth and status seem to suggest that he is above the slings and arrows of society, it turns out that this assumption is a naive one. Darcy is no more free to do whatever he likes than Elizabeth is.What makes this book so satisfying is that the hero and heroine triumph over their adverse circumstances. At heart, Austen was a romantic. She clearly had hope that the narrow confines of her world could stretch enough to allow for happiness and self-fulfillment. She believed in the power of love to conquer some very daunting obstacles and she believed that love could help people grow into a better version of themselves. I think it is this optimism that makes Austen so appealing to her readers."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is Jane Austen's most popular novel and it is remarkable that it has sustained such a high popularity 200 years after it was originally published. The primary plot of the story follows Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy in a highly contentious courtship that begins with mutual contempt but evolves quite unexpectedly for both into very different feelings. Subplots involve her sister Jane and Mr. Bingley in a courtship of their own as well as the romantic entanglements of various other sisters and friends. The story is a bit of a roller coaster ride with soaring hopes and crushing disappointment in store as events unfold. I won't reveal the ending for the handful of people who haven't read it but suffice to say that the novel concludes in a way that leaves the vast majority of readers well satisfied.Darcy and Elizabeth are complex and multi-layered characters who both grow and change somewhat as the book progresses. They are the heart and soul of the book and about as well fleshed out as any characters you are likely to see. The supporting characters, however, are considerably less deep and are more caricatures than anything else. Some are good and kind like Jane and Mr. Bingley, and others are ridiculous and vain like Mrs. Bennet but none are remotely as substantial as Darcy and Elizabeth. So, does this ruin the book? Hardly. These secondary characters offer a wealth of material for the author as she plays them off of Darcy and Elizabeth.This novel is almost certainly the one where Austen best displays her sharp-edged wit both through Elizabeth's dialogue and in the narrative voice describing some of these characters and their actions. If some of them were less ridiculous, the potential for the satire would be weakened considerably. And make no mistake, Pride and Prejudice is as much a satire of the time it was written, as it is a romantic drama. Even today, the prose is quite funny and enjoyable. The Enriched Classics edition is also nice because it includes footnotes explaining some of the language and/or references that were well known at the time but confusing today's readers.In summary, this is a great novel. Admittedly, there were a few times where I thought a character's behavior was a bit over-the-top but the overall story is so riveting and the book so compelling that I just can't find any serious fault with it. Pride and Prejudice is deserving of its reputation and I highly recommend it to Austen fans and newcomers alike."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I originally read this for my sophmore English class, and didn't enjoy it too much because of all of the analysis we were required to do. I re-read it the following summer and discovered it makes much better leisure reading. I'd say the ideal audience is obviously female (considering the main character is the fiesty heroine Elizabeth Bennet), of any age.Even though it is a classic, it still manages to be quite a page-turner, with unexpected plot twists and witty dialogue. The most enjoyable aspect of this novel is watching the relationship between Elizabeth and Darcy develop. I've read the book several more times, and each time I find myself anticipating their eventual confession of each others' feelings for one another. Although the ending of the story is predictable, it is how this ending is reached which makes for an interesting read.The book is largely character and dialogue-based, so I'd shy away from it if that isn't your thing. However, to any classics-lover, this book is a must! I'd also highly recommend viewing the BBC mini-series (the one featuring Colin Firth as Darcy, and Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth) to fully experience the Georgian England setting. But, trust me, you won't want to simply ditch the book to watch the movie version. Nothing can quite compare to Jane Austen's original writing."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Like all the other jane austen books i loved this one just as much. jane austen is famous for her characterisation and this book proves it to you even more.elizabeth bennet and mr. darcy intertwined into their own fixed judgements and opinions make this book not just a must read for its witty satire and humour but for its indepth understanding of true love. eliza,prejudiced ....Darcy, too caught up with his high society unfold their true character gradually making you enthralled and wanting more.mr. collins the cousin, catheran de bourgh his patron bring out the best in subtle humour.mr. and mrs. bennet, both of them a class apart...their uniquely opposite personalities creating sparks. the four sisters: genuine, bingely:awesome...the story i leave for you to unravel. you'll love it to the best of your ability.trust me; you're caught. you won't be able to get your hands off it. its the work of a great woman and a great writer, a true genius who to me is just as equivalent to shakespeare. but then thats just me.a book that shows us how two minds can eventually meet and harbour friendship and love.

That means that not only is it telling an entertaining tale, it is also calling to something deep in the readers' souls. Examination of available books shows that at least a dozen sequels to it have been written; I have reviewed one and will soon review another, but I am not going to buy and read all of them. Therefore I might be missing something I would enjoy.But what I am not missing is this: Jane Austen believed in sense and sobriety. She believed that the happiest marriage was one between a man and woman who were intellectually and spiritually in tune with one another.To the readers, I say: Go thou and do likewise. Read the book. Then do what Elizabeth and Jane wold approve, and you will find yourself happier in the long run than those who ignore the principles Pride and Prejudice is meant to exhibit."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I've been a fan of Austen for 20 years and this is one of my favorites.

Jane Austin gives details of the characters' thoughts that make the story, especially the development of the two main characters, convincing. The other characters are amusing and vivid. The dialogue is delicious with treats like, \\"Is not general incivility the very essence of love?\\"In my Kindle version random line breaks occur. For example, one often encounters \\"Mr. [line break] Darcy,\\" even when \\"Mr.\\" is almost the beginning of the line. Although this is a little annoying, the Kindle version can't be beat for price and convenience."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"My mother used to read me a chapter a night of this book when I was about eight. I didn't get it. For reasons lost in the mists of history, I picked it up on my own in my 20s and found, to my delight, that I couldn't put it down. Since then, I have bought, read, and reread everything Austen ever wrote, and was a member of the Jane Austen Club back in the early '80s, loooong before she became so fashionable.What I've learned from my frequent readings of her works is that each time I read them, I get a little more than I did the last time. Her language appears convoluted to us, yes, partly because she wrote with the voice of her time and partly because we are probably like, you know, as inarticulate a people as ever lived. So do we denigrate Shakespeare or Chaucer for their voices?The themes of Austen's works are all similar - they all relate to the difficulties of women finding their own places in a rigidly structured society in which women were defined strictly by the men in their lives. In fact, when I visited her burial place in Winchester Cathedral, I was surprised to find a 6-foot marble slab fully engraved with a lengthy narrative about her, until I realized that there was NOT ONE WORD about her writing - she was described and defined strictly in relation to her father and family. So she definitely knew whereof she spoke; in her time, there was no life for a women outside of marriage, and the frantic attempts of parents - and the girls themselves - to marry off their daughters, which appears funny to us in our more enlightened age, is actually painful and somewhat pathetic. (Almost as pathetic as the efforts of many women today to find their own rich, indulgent Mr. Darcys... especially in light of their many other options.)One of the characteristics of Austen's writing that I find most interesting is that while she writes in great detail of the lives of her characters and their immediate surroundings, there is not one word about the greater world. I doubt that the word &quot;London&quot; appears in any of them except briefly in &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;; they all take place in small villages somewhere in the middle or south of England, and rarely wander further than the distance of a post-lunch walk. The novels were written at the end of the Napoleonic era and the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, so there was plenty of upheaval, social and otherwise, occuring all over England and the Continent, but nary a whisper of it ever rears its ugly head in her works. She holds her magnifying glass very close to her own garden gate; her perspective is entirely microcosmic without being claustrophobic - that's part of her genius. She can turn over a rock and document the frantic scurrying underneath it in its own terms, drawing no inferences from the activity under the rest of the tree. Good? Bad? I don't know, and I think it doesn't matter - but there is probably not a better, more detailed, or more honest picture of time and place in all of English literature.I am torn between being glad that students are exposed to literature, and sorry that the teaching of it is so pedantic that all the humor and magic of great books is buried. I only hope, for those who were force-fed on Austen and others of her ilk, that they will pick up these works on their own later in life and derive from them the pleasure that is there for the asking. Meanwhile, I strongly recommend periodic infusions of all of Austen's works, of which I believe &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is the most accessible."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I enjoyed this classic totally. I thought the way Jane Austen developed the characters personalities was incredible. I have reread it many times. I am amazed at how much an author can get across without the overuse of sex and violence (that we see way too much of today). I have also enjoyed her other works Emma and Sense and Sensibility. I have not read the others.I have found the Pride and Prejudice movie from A&E; with Collin Firth to be one of my favorite movies and I think is an excellent addition to have. The Annotated Pride and Prejudice is very helpful and enjoyable by David Shapard. The World of Her Novels by Deirdre Le Faye is also very helpful though at times seems a bit heavy. It gives you a real feel for the era and thus the settings of the book.A word of caution. When you enjoy something you don't want it to end. Of the countless spinoffs of the original I totally disliked one and am in the middle of another. Mr. Darcy takes a wife is unbelievable and totally devoid of character. Seems there are sex scenes on almost every page in the beginning. I grew disgusted. The account of things from Darcy's point of view by Pamela Aidan has been enjoyable. I am only half way thru the first book, however.The Annotated Pride and PrejudiceJane Austen: The World of Her NovelsMr. Darcy Takes a Wife: Pride and Prejudice ContinuesAn Assembly Such as This: A Novel of Fitzwilliam Darcy, Gentleman (Fitzwilliam Darcy Gentleman)"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The \\"truth universally acknowledged\\" that begins Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is one of the best opening sentences in English literature; its irony, subtle and caustic, perfectly sets the tone for the novel, which is about the manners of courtship and the classist attitudes toward marriage in Regency England. The message Austen is conveying is that the rules of the marriage game are, at least to the propriety-conscious gentry, more interesting than the romance that leads to marriage.The novel's heroine is Elizabeth Bennet, the second, and the wittiest and liveliest, of five daughters in a middle class English family. Her mother, a simple and silly creature whose greatest desire in life is that her dowry-deficient daughters should marry well, is ecstatic when she learns that a wealthy single young man named Mr. Bingley has moved into a nearby house; she imagines him a potential husband for one of her daughters. Bingley turns out to be charming and friendly, but his friend, Mr. Darcy, also wealthy, single, and young, snobbishly appears to consider himself superior to the Bennets.Jane, Elizabeth's older sister, falls in love with Bingley, but Darcy tries to discourage his friend from courting a girl of a social status lower than his. Elizabeth and Darcy develop a strangely flirtatious relationship that is partly affectionate and partly adversarial, provoking the jealousy of Bingley's attention-starved sister, who is attracted to Darcy. Elizabeth must also fend off the affections of her cousin, a clergyman named Mr. Collins who is amusingly persistent in his marriage proposals to her; fortunately, her rebuffs finally cause him to marry her less attractive friend instead. Collins shamelessly panders to his patroness, the haughty, imperious Lady Catherine de Bourgh, who practically demands that Darcy (who happens to be her nephew) marry her diminutive daughter, and Elizabeth had better not get in the way.A charming young soldier named Mr. Wickham, whose father was employed by Darcy's father and who became Darcy's father's ward after his own father's death, enters the story. To Elizabeth he claims that Darcy is withholding money from him that is due him; Darcy responds that Wickham is a freeloader who is not entitled to any more money than he has already gotten. Wickham risks damaging the Bennets' reputation when Elizabeth's youngest sister Lydia, who is as prattling and frivolous as her mother, impetuously decides to elope with him.If the \\"pride\\" in the novel is Darcy's self-regard, the \\"prejudice\\" is Elizabeth's initial opinion of him as an insufferable snob, because by the end she learns that he is quite honorable and charitable after all. He reveals to Elizabeth that he was raised by his parents to feel superior to the lower classes, but her willingness to stand up to him and his conceit has taught him modesty and humility and endeared her to him. It is this transformation of character, similar to a gender role reversal of \\"The Taming of the Shrew,\\" that distinguishes Austen's novel as a special achievement of 19th Century English literature."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is truly a classic, the book is the apex of Ms. Austens writing. The characters are so vivid and they stay with you. The heroine Elizabeth Bennett is such a modern thinker and she is resolute and always true to herself. Ah and Darcy, he is such a great creation; at first glance, distant, shy, seemingly full of pride. The way the book evolves into one of the great love stories in literature is wonderful, it's a jouney everyone should take. Even if you have seen the great A&E version or the new Kiera Knightly version, you still should read the book. Ms. Austen is a great writer and though the two afore mentioned films are well done, they still can't match Ms. Austens proes, it's such a shame she died so young and we did not get to see her writing evolve, to think she died in her thirties a spinster, I suppose it takes someone like that to write such an uplifting, romantic book and not be, dare I say, cynical about romance and waiting for that one love...maybe she found her Darcy after all."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves; vanity, to what we would have others think of us.\\" Jane AustenI let my own foolish pride, my own ignorant prejudices; deter me from ever picking up a Jane Austen achievement until about a month ago when I finally decided to give her a shot. This classic novel was definitely not on my \`must read' list, but somehow, someway, it landed on my lap one afternoon and I decided to at least take a quick peek at it while no one else was looking. After all, a man's man like myself (whatever that means nowadays) has no time to read early 19th century Chick Brit Lit., let alone a sweet, love story like this one. Especially during football season! I could almost hear Bukowski's ghost laughing at me when I opened up the first page and read those unforgettable first lines regarding man and marriage. However, I forged on, just Jane and I, and when it was all said and done - I can't believe what a fool I've been all these years! Yes, this classic is a thing of beauty. And like Jane's main protagonist and narrative voice in the novel - Elizabeth Bennet - I too learned a valuable lesson about not judging a book by its cover. Isn't evolution great?Don't make the same mistake I did. I love classic literature, but for too long now I avoided such greats as the Bronte's, Wharton, Cather, et al... because of my foolish male ego, my ridiculous machismo pride. My biggest regret though, was avoiding Austen all these years. Now, I may not go out and rent the movie anytime soon (of course the wife made me promise that I would watch it with her after I introduced her to \\"Scarface\\" the other night), but I will definitely be purchasing some more of Jane's classics (Emma, Persuasion, Mansfield Park, etc...) and if they are anything like this pleasant surprise, I am going to be one happy camper.Never a dull moment, never a page not worth perusing, simply put - Austen is awesome!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Miss Jane Austen (1775-1816) was born into the home of a clergyman at Steventon Rectory, She is the gem of all English authors in the realm of domestic romance and comedy. Jane needs a few middle class and wealthy families living in a rural setting to set her genius afire. Pride and Prejudice published in 1813 is justly the most famous, liveliest and perfectly plotted of all her few novels. You must read Pride and Prejudice if you have any claim to being a well educated person. The book is the grandmother of all the thousands of books that have been set in the Regency period featuring a love story between a young lady and a rich Byronic hero. None of these books can match Pride and Prejudice in its witty dialogue and insights into the human heart.The main characters are:The Bennet Family-Mr. Bennet is a fuddy-duddy bookworm of a clergyman. He is a poor father more interested in spending time in his study than it helping raise his rambunctious girls.Mrs. Bennet is a fatuous fool. An ignorant, self-indulgent, flippant idiot she has one goal-getting her five unwed daughters wed in prosperous matches with the local gentry and soldiery.Jane Bennet is the oldest \\"Miss Bennet\\". She falls in love with Mr. Bigley. She is an innocent, sweet young lady.Elizabeth Bennet is the novel's heroine and the most delightful young woman in all of English fiction! She is witty, wise, lively and beautiful. Elizabeth is probably based on Jane Austen. Her love is for Mr.Fitzwilliam Darcy whom she is preudiced against due to what she perceives as his rudeness to her; his suppposed effort to break up the affair between Jane and Darcy and his putative mistreatment of soldier Wickham.Lydia and Kitty are younger daughters who are man-crazy, brainless daughters. Lydia elopes with the cad soldier Wickham.Mary is the bookworm daughter who is made fun of by Austen for her overly serious demeanor.Charles Bingley-the love interest of Jane Bennet.Fitzwilliam Darcy is the prideful scion of great wealth who falls in love with Elizabeth. He resembles characters in such fictional products as those penned by Samuel Richardson; Fanny Burney and women authors enjoyed by the young Jane Austen.Hilarious minor characters include the odious clergyman Mr. Collins who weds the impecunious Charlotte Lucas. Charlotte is on the verge of becoming an old main so she weds the ludicrous Collins. Collins had earlier proposed marriage to Elizabeth but had been refused.Lady Catherine DeBourgh-Darcy's aunt she is cruel and hateful to everyone she holds in disdain. She is one of those old dragons which populate the pages of great classic English fiction.The novel was written during the period of England's life and death struggle against Napoleon but there is no mention of the nation's affairsAusten keeps her keen but restricted focus on the lives of her ordinary people living in the retired village of Maryton.Many famous novelists list Jane Austen as their favorite author.

I was optimistically hoping to finish it within a month.But I really liked the movie with Keira Knightley and wanted to see how closely it compared and if it was as good as the movie.Two weeks later, I am done, and I am pleased with the ride.Plot:Mr. Bingley, an eligible, wealthy bachelor, moves nearby the Bennett family, who have five unmarried daughters. The Bennett family must secure good marriages for their daughters since they will inherit nothing when their father dies. Romance is in the air between Jane Bennett and Mr. Bingley, while the first sparks of love appear between the proud, wealthy Mr. Darcy and the exuberant, Elizabeth Bennett.Good:There are so many good parts to this book! I don't quite know where to begin!The characters are believable and real. Elizabeth is a well rounded character. She starts out proud and prejudiced against Mr. Darcy but as she learns of his true quality is not afraid of changing her mind. Mr. Darcy was sweet, opinionated, and equally prejudiced against Elizabeth's \\"poor connections\\".The plot was wonderful and well paced. It kept me on the edge of my seat (although it was not an action book); I couldn't wait to see what would happen on each page.I enjoyed the arguments between Elizabeth (and her fiesty personality) and Mr. Darcy (stiff and proud). The quips they came up with! The chemistry between the two was perfect!Lastly, I enjoyed how the author emphasized (via Mr. Bennett) to marry for love and not for money or connections or the like. This is something very much beyond her time (as many marriages in the late 18th century were arranged).Bad:Well, this is being exceedingly petty, but the language of this book makes it difficult for a modern reader to fully understand the nuances of what Jane Austen is trying to say (the notes at the appendix help with this, however).Dialogue/Sexual Situations/ViolenceNone. Talk is made of how Lydia and an officer run off to live with each other without marrying. None.Overall:Sweet. There is no better word for the free-spirited, witty romance between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth. I would have to say this is the best, purest romance story I have ever read (besides, maybeThe Princess Bride). The movie does a fabulous job with the book, but the book is even more enjoyable than the movie (if you can imagine). You will not be displeased with this one."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I'm a recent newlywed who decided to raid his wifes bookshelf and this was the first book of hers that I picked up. Wanting to be better read and enjoying the movie &quot;Sense and Sensibility.&quot;I recommend to anyone that is curious but apprehensive of Austen like I was to see a film based on one of her books. You will hear the use and cadence of victorian speech which will, in my humble opinion, make her books more accessible and easier to read. This is the first Jane Austen I've read and I am now bonafide fan.This is one of those stories where the destination is not important but the journey is. Within the first ten pages, the stage is set. The two headstrong protagonists, Miss Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy cannot stand one another at the beginning of the book. Sparks fly and meet with typical results. The characters are distinct and memorable. Mr. Bennet, Elizabeth's father, was one of my favorites. Anyone who is an admirer of dry &quot;british&quot; humor will find themselves in stitches. It is the first book in a very long time where I found myself laughing out loud and on more than one occasion.A moderately quick read for those used to victorian prose. I for one am glad that I got over the &quot;girly&quot; stigma that's usually associated with Jane Austen. It has made me consider other books in my wifes arsenal I normally would not have otherwise.I will, however, pass on her &quot;The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood&quot;Great book. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I never thought I'd have a favorite book or author until I read Pride and Prejudice. It is, by far, the most beautifully written love story in literature, in my opinion.Miss Eliza Bennet is the second eldest daughter of an English gentleman whose estate can only go to a male successor upon his death. Because he and Mrs. Bennet are unable to conceive a male child, it is the best course for the girls to marry and marry well. The great advantage the girls have is that they are beautiful, with the eldest girl, Jane, being the most beautiful of them all.The Bennets live in Longbourn, a small village just outside of Meryton, a quaint little town. The story begins when Mr. Bingley, a very amiable and wealthy young bachelor, decides to lease an estate in the area. At a ball, Mr. Bingley introduces his best friend, Mr. Darcy, another wealthy bachelor, and his sisters to the local society. It is here where Mr. Bingley meets the Bennet girls and starts to fall in love with Jane Bennet, and it is also here where Mr. Darcy meets Elizabeth. Elizabeth immediately dislikes Darcy for several reasons but mainly because he insults her by first refusing to dance with her and then by saying, with Elizabeth within hearing distance, that he isn't in the habit of asking girls, who have been rejected by other men, to dance.Elizabeth is a complex character, a young woman who is wise beyond her years, reserve, has a dry sense of humor, friendly but very cynical of her world and of love. In contrast, Jane is sensitive, likes to think well of people, very friendly, and somewhat fragile. Bingley's personality is a perfect complement to Jane's. He's friendly, generous, somewhat nave and looks up to Darcy. Darcy is brooding, quiet, reserved, prideful, and yet loyal and protective of his friends and family.The story progresses to where Darcy discovers his growing attraction to Elizabeth, despite his best efforts, and proposes to her. Because of his social status and wealth, Darcy expects Elizabeth to say \\"yes\\" to his marriage proposal. To his surprise, she not only turns him down, she also tears right into him: His haughty behavior, rudeness, and his part in driving Bingley and Jane apart. Yes, Darcy had been up to no good in breaking up Bingley and Jane. This sets the stage for heartbreak, courtship, scandal, intrigue, and reconciliation and finally a happy ending for both couples.Jane Austen paints her characters and their dialogue with such splendidly crafted sentences, such as \\"I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!\\" She takes time to enrich the story with picturesque descriptions of each setting, and describes each character in such a way that you easily understand the layer of complexity in each. For example, Elizabeth dislikes those who she thinks are vain, but yet she prides herself in her ability to read people's personalities and they're like. Wickham, the protagonist in this story, is, on the surface, well-mannered, kind, and has a \\"good face,\\" but is really a liar, thief and a gambler.I highly recommend this book. I've read it numerous times and there's always something new to discover with each reading."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Adopted the thrift edition of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice to reduce the textbook expenses for a college-level literature class.

Let me tell you, when I was required to read this in the middle of the school year, I did not think I would be this addicted. I was so happy to find out that Amazon had this for free so I immediately downloaded it. I read this book on my phone every morning and every afternoon. I actually don't mind the rest of the techs as long as I didn't have to flip through pages on the subway."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is Austen's second,most well know,and my favorite novel.The story starts when a rich young man named Mr. Bingley rents a house in the neighborhood. Mrs.Bennet has five daughters and is hoping that Mr.Bingley will fall in love and marry one of them.Mr.Bingley and her eldest daughter the beautiful sweet Jane seem to strike up an attachment.When Bingley's best friend Mr.Darcy,a proud gentlemen and Mrs.Bennet's second oldest daughter a playful witty girl named Eliazbeth(the main character)meet lets just say Elizabeth thinks Darcy is the most disagreeable man she has ever meet.Including some of Austen's most memorable characters:Mrs.Bennet and her husband Mr.Bennet(the father of dry wit)make one of the funniest,unhappily married couples in history,and Mr.Collins(one of the suitors)is the model of everything a girl doesn't want in a guy.I love Elizabeth and Mr.Darcy.They have some of the most bewitching conversations and never has Austen's ear for dialogue been better then in her second novel.I was charmed by Pride and Prejudice and hope you will be too."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is one of the excellent works that has to be studied for chosen words. I have studied it. I have checked all the definitions that I didn't know. She has used rich vocabulary that adds so much. If you don't check the meaning, you will lose on the context of it. You need to think constantly and be alert while reading. Words put weight on the meaning that when you're tired, you might not understand fully what the author has meant. Understanding its meaning gives you so much pleasure.The author states the situation the character is in by finding the perfect word to describe it. The words chosen were so perfectly used in given situations.Some dialogues may seem unnatural of the words spoken. Did people really talk this way? But after getting deeper into her work, you just get used to it like to the commodity in everyday life.I loved in Jane's work the development of the characters. It is extraordinary and so complex. The author has captured in most not an ordinary way of life back then making it in every sense very realistic.The feelings of being modest, shy, and lacking self-confidence when in love were perfectly presented. Readers who look for romance won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Irene Sutcliffe is fantastic. She needs to do more Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I first read this book when I was eleven or twelve, and I really enjoyed it. Now, I am spending a year in a foreign country, and found a couple of Jane Austen books on sale. I bought both Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility. And it was simplly wonderful to have such a classic to comfort me, while being surrounded by another culture and language.This is a romance story, but for me, though I am a die-hard romantic, I have fallen in love with the prose, and romance of the age, not the actual romances between the characters."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"When you finish this book-you'll sigh* (I did) and then you'll be stuck remembering all the characters and how you recognize them in your present relationships (Lizzy's dad was one of my favorites) -- you'll find yourself thinking about Jane Austen and wondering what she was like... so you'll talk about her and find that EVERYONE loves her. and then your neighbor will lend you all the Austen movies (that BBC one will steal your entire afternoon!)--and she'll actually have a whole bunch of literary criticisms and Austen biographies...and you'll become obsessed. (I did)...hope you are able to take care of yourselves through it all. stay hydrated."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I cannot claim that Pride and Prejudice is my favorite novel of all time. After all, I am a guy and disposed to guy-ly things like action movies and bbq ribs. Pride and Prejudice, on the other hand, is a quaint British novel about a group of daughters and their various courtships and marriages. The main plot concerns whether one of these daughters-Lizzy-can or cannot overcome her initial dislike of a good man who subsequently falls in love with her. The device by which this plot operates, and extends into over three-hundred pages, is that everyone is either too scared, or too proper, to say what they really feel. The novel is conversation, conversation and more conversation, and almost all of it in an affected upper-class British speak where one talks around things, never about them. It does not entail much action-when it does it is usually characters traveling to a new locale to talk some more, and there is no bbq to be found at all, and so as I say, it is not, and by its nature cannot be, my favorite novel of all time. And yet, it is a testament to the skill of the author (and this is the first Austen I've read, and she has lived up to the hype surrounding her name) that, despite my lack of inherent interest in the subject matter, she managed to sustain my attention and, what's more, I can say that I completely enjoyed the reading. I would even be willing to read more of the same by the same. Her characters are interesting, distinct and likable, her dialogue true, and her descriptions sparse, witty and to-the-point.I give the novel 4 out of 5 stars because I enjoyed it, liked the characters and thought it well-written overall. It only loses its one star for being about things that do not compel me particularly; I'm sure that those who are predisposed to like conversation-driven British literature about social mores and marriage will rate it the full five."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"My first experience with Jane Austen was an unfotunate one since, like many people, I had her prose rammed down my throat by a dodo high school English teacher. To make matter worse, the instructor, Ms. Z was a retired hippie who wore burlap sacks to school and worshipped Freud. At one point she had me write a paper comparing the three principle characters to the id (Lydia) the ego (Elizabeth) and the superego (Jane). At the tender age when a youth's mind is ripe for absorption and exploration, mine was already acclimated to the professional academic practice of ideological regurgitation of canonical literature.But years later, I saw the mini series and really enjoyed it. I promptly reopened the novel after many years and discovered the intensely liberating sensation of rereading required highschool texts without pedagocical intrusion.Austen's portrait of Victorian society is a sociological gem. And this time instead of taking my teacher's word for it, I actually found the book enormously funny. Much of the language, environment, and social circumstances are completely out of date, but in order to appreciate them, one must read the book in context. Some argue that it is too verbose. But there were no malls, cars or televisions in Victorian England. People entertained themselves, among other ways, by reading and writing and corresponding with each other. Words played heavily in the day to day lives of the middle class and aristocracy.I recommend that anyone who detested this book in high school, reread it and enjoy it. And I recommend that educators present this book in context so that students can appreciate it's humor, language and historical perspective."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Even if one considers Pride and Prejudice to be a cautionary tale for men to avoid getting caught up in the affairs of women, or with recognition that Austen is truly showing that women have an amazing ability to manipulate men and essentially control their world, one cannot overlook the sheer boredom that reading Pride and Prejudice creates. Set this one aside and pick up The Scarlet Letter if you are looking for a classic worth reading."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Read this and many of Jane Austen's other novels as a teenagers. Downloaded this on to my new kindle and was as enchanted as the first time I read it. A classic romantic novel with exquisite characters and reflections on the way of life of that time. Timeless and a must read for the sad romantics amoungst us."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have been reading classics, but this did not rate for me. I read half and stopped. I found it extremely boring, the descriptions went on and on, and the book was hard to read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"What makes a book a \\"classic\\"? Is it the language? The fame of the author? The date of publication? Or, as my high school English teacher used to say, is a book a classic \\"because it still says what it needs to say\\"? In the case of Jane Austen's masterpiece, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", I'd venture that it is all of the above. Though it was one of her first published novels, it's probably her greatest, and features some of the greatest characters ever written in what is quite possibly one of the oldest stories ever told.The plot itself is timeless. The Bennet family of Hertfordshire has five daughters, and with no sons and an estate entailed along the male line, it is important that the girls find good husbands if they don't want to be turned out of their home upon the death of their father. As is common in most families, each child is very different. Jane, the eldest, is quiet and serene, and always sees the good in everyone. Elizabeth is intelligent, while Mary is preachy and a stuck-in-the-mud. Catherine (Kitty) is a follower, and the youngest, Lydia, is an out-of-control flirt. The story begins, rather famously, with the arrival of new neighbors at Netherfield, a home a few miles away. The house has been taken by a young man with a large fortune, and almost immediately, Mrs. Bennet begins scheming that the as-yet-unknown Mr. Bingley will marry one of her daughters - preferably the eldest.As luck would have it, Bingley and Jane hit it off right away. The same cannot be said for Bingley's socially-awkward friend, Mr. Darcy, and Jane's sister Elizabeth. Almost immediately, the two get on each others' nerves, begun with Darcy insulting Lizzie within the hearing range of the latter and continuing as the Bennet family (with the exception of the two eldest) make fools of themselves at every opportunity. When a regiment of soldiers comes to town, Elizabeth is quick to enjoy conversing with a Mr. Wickham, one of Mr. Darcy's least-favorite people, and eagerly believes everything Wickham says about his former childhood friend.Of course, not everything is as it seems. Darcy and Elizabeth continue to meet over the course of the next year, while she is visiting a friend near his aunt's home, and even on his estate at Pemberley. The more they get to know each other, the more they realize they may have been mistaken about one another. And when Lizzie's youngest sister does the unthinkable, the Bennet family's misfortune may end up being the shove Elizabeth and Darcy need.The greatest thing about this book is its characters. Jane Austen was a master of the absurd, and she has captured it beautifully in the obnoxious Mr. Collins, the haughty Lady Catherine deBourgh, the foolish Mrs. Bennet, and so many others. Everyone is drawn to life, and as you are reading it, you realize that, even though the book came out two centuries ago, these are personalities that still exist in all of our lives. The dialogue is witty and to the point, and though the novel is relatively short, the action never lags. There's a reason the 1995 BBC miniseries adaptation clocks in at close to five hours; a LOT happens in this book. With the 200th anniversary of the novel happening this year, it's definitely time to take an enjoyable look back at one of the most famous - and well-loved - books ever written."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I had seen the films, and knew what was going to happen. This may be part of what bored me about the book, but I just couldn't bring myself to finish it-- I don't normally quit reading a book either."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I read this book quite a while ago, in fact when i was in year 9 and my older sister was studying it for GCSE, i saw the book and seeing as i was bored i decided to read it. to my surprise i actually liked it. it turned out to be very interesting and amusing at times too. the relationship between Darcy and Lizzy interested me very much as i found Lizzy's retorts and critical behaviour great as i am a great believer of speaking your views. For Lizzy to do that in that kind of society was very brave of her and i admired her for it. Since then i have read this book so many times it's unbelievable and it still interests me greatly. i never get bored with the storyline and i live along with the characters and feel for them as if i was reading the book for the first time. It's an absolute classic and i love it. i really recommend everyone to read it. don't be put off by the fact that it is set in old times. U will be pleasantly surprised to find that it's actually great."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Austin lays out all of her witt and charm within the first three pages of this novel and by the third and fourth chapters you won't be able to put the book down. If you find yourself unable to keep up with Georgian style of writing (or if you are guy), however, this may not be the best book for you. ;)"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Being a student (10th grade), I feel obliged to relate to other students not only how much I enjoyed this novel, but also that it may not be right for everyone. It seems that many other students do not particularly like the novel, especially the male crowd. If my class was ever assigned P&amp;P I am sure that there would be many complaints from my classmates... but they complain about every novel we are assigned, and therefore I can never really trust their opinion. If you are a student looking to read P&amp;P I highly recommend it. My own ideas on this novel are quite favorable. I am sorry that not everyone has a taste for Austen. I consider her one of the best authors who ever lived. I enjoyed reading Pride and Prejudice as well as other Austen novels. Her novels, especiall P&amp;P, are quite funny and I have often found myself laughing outloud on many occasions (which is not an easy feat). Pride and Prejudice is not a novel to be over looked."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is one of the finest of Jane Austen's work. The novel centres around the Bennet family, who are the principal inhabitants of the village of Longbourn. Mrs. Bennet is a marriage obsessed mother, whose dearest wish is to see her five daughters married and settled. As it is, the Longbourn estate is entailed on a distant male cousin, for Mr. and Mrs. Bennet lack a male heir. This makes the five sisters, Jane, Elizabeth, Mary, Kitty and Lydia, increasingly dependent on husbands to provide for them, if their father was to die. We see the different personalities of the five sisters, but the two that stand out are the two eldest, Jane and Elizabeth. Elizabeth Bennet, the heroine of the novel, challenges and changes the established rules of class barriers. Her marriage to Mr. Darcy, an aristocrat who has an income of \\"ten thousand a year,\\" allows Elizabeth to climb the social ladder and cross social boundaries, despite the strictly stratified class lines of Austen's time. Elizabeth's eldest sister Jane, also makes an advantageous match with Mr. Bingley, a member of the noveau riche. Times were changing even as Jane Austen was writing. Although Mr. Darcy's aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, lamented over her nephew's and Elizabeth's engagement, her angry objections were overruled. The ancient aristocratic voice became faint and was silenced as times changed."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is my favorite book of all time. I have read it so many times that the cover is falling off and the spine is incredibly damaged. Basically, Pride and Prejudice focuses on Elizabeth Bennet, a young and independent woman whose mother is trying to marry off her and her sisters to the highest bidder. They have several suitors, including Mr. Darcy, Mr. Bingley and Mr. Wickham. At first glance, Pride and Prejudice seems just like a regular Regency romance (making you wonder why it is such a widely acclaimed book); however, it is much more than that.In Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen offers social commentary on a wide range of subjects, including corruption of the Church, marriage, and women's rights. In addition, each time I read it, I realize more and more that not only is Jane Austen a genius, but she also has a great sense of humor (this can been seen through Mr. Collins, the wordy church leader, Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth's social-climbing mother, and many of the other characters). Several of the minor characters are used as stereotypes in order to get Austen's point across (for example, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, one of the snobbiest rich women in all of literature, and Lydia, Elizabeth's flighty youngest sister).Even if you don't care about Jane Austen's views on the society of her time, Pride and Prejudice still offers a lot. Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy have perfect chemistry, as do Jane and Mr. Bingley. Elizabeth is way ahead of her time--no women of her stature were expected to be picky about who they married, but Elizabeth is not willing to settle for anything but the best. Then of course, there's the idea that you shouldn't judge people before you get to know them and that you shouldn't let your pride get in the way of your opinions about others (hence the name Pride and Prejudice).This book is great for everyone-it contains romance, comedy, and even politics of Austen's time. Although the language might be hard to understand at first, it's definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It is almost 200 years since \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" was first published. It ought to be the equivalent in literature of those faded, dried flowers that used to be found pressed between the pages of the old family bible. Instead it is redolent of freshly cut flowers still carrying a sprinkling of morning dew.The freshness and the perfection of form are certainly astonishing. Jane Austin is as good as story teller as ever picked up a pen, knowing exactly how to construct plots, and what incidents and dialogues to detail in full and what to briefly summarize. Her \\"world\\" is small but intricately constructed. Every characteristic, quality and idea has a precise and fixed value, all being ranked strictly and sternly according to decorum, logic and morality.Despite its architectural perfection, however, a recent re-reading reveals one or two construction features that are questionable. How could it be, for example that Fitzwilliam Darcy could have such a dragon for an aunt? I also wonder about the friendship between Darcy and Bingley. How did it begin? It is obviously important to each, but we are given nothing of its history.Jane Austen lived long enough to see this book published and enjoyed amongst her own family and a small readership. Her mother entertained family members with it, reading it, in Jane Austen's estimation, a little too quickly. Distinguished British actress Lindsay Duncan reads it with perfect timing and inflexion in this highly recommended audio tape format, which presents the novel in an unabridged version of just over twelve hours."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is the best book I have ever read.

There have been many off-springs, sequels, movies etc. in the tradition of P&amp;P. Jane Austen is the master of interpersonal relationships and her tales take us back to a gentle era where things not being equal, women have to make the most of whatever situation they are born into. Austen introduces us to Elizabeth Bennett, a strong woman who is a devoted sister and daughter and very honest with her heart. She has become one of my favorite heroines in Literature not only because of her heart, but also for her ability to grow. One of the most enjoyable aspects of this book was watching as the main characters are transformed throughout the telling. Mr. Darcy, who is perhaps one of the more idealized men in fiction, recognizes his weaknesses through Elizabeth and she in turn learns from him.The cast of characters are some of Austen's most unforgettable. Mr. Collins the dim-witted cousin who thinks he is quite a pious man and a good catch for any women. The annoyingly cheeky Lydia, Mrs. Bennett the nagging mother with not much upstairs, but good intentions none the less, and many more. They all held my interest throughout the book and left me wanting more of them. I highly recommend this book to be read and re-read many times.

When I was young, I read Nancy Drew, Perry Mason, and Agatha Christie novels like food. I found the titles of such classics as Pride and Predjudice, One Flew over the cuckoos nest, The Great Gatsby, Death of a Saleman, and Wuthering Heights, to be pretentious; and if they didn't have murder and suspense, I didn't bother opening the cover. But one day while watching A&amp;E, I saw a glimpse of the BBC production of Pride and Prejudice, and I was hooked. I was amazed that a book written way before my time could be of any worth. After watching the movie, I picked up the book, and read it from cover to cover. I found that Mr. Darcy and Ms. Bennett were intriguing characters, and I was utterly surprised when Mr. Darcy confessed his &quot;ardent love&quot; for her, also when he wrote the long letter of rebuttal to her claims to his bad character. At first, you despise Mr. Darcy, but as the book progresses, you find yourself liking him more and more. This whole book was very well-written and interesting, and now ranks with my favorite novels of all time, along with the classics listed above.

Jane austen is a great writer."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a very nice story. However it is difficult to read because it is written in Old English. My favorite character would be Elizabeth Bennet, or Lizzy as she is frequently reffered. She is willing to let love walk out the door because another woman is interested. Lizzy definately dislikes competition. She does make her presence known. Not rudely, but can get very defensive and in that quite comical. Lizzy presents herself very well. Like they say &quot;A first impression is a lasting impression&quot;. I picture her as tall, very beautiful, and soft spoken. Unlike others she has a beautiful smell and good taste in clothing. Lizzy reminds me a lot of Emma Woodhouse in Emma and Elinor Dashwood in Sense and Sensability. Coincidently, both of these novels were also written by Jane Austen. The reason I believe these three characters are alike is because they each either search for love for other people and over-look their own need, in the case of Emma, or they simply allow other women to appear to fill in the role in the cases of Elinor and Lizzy. Another thing that relates Lizzy, Emma and Elinor is the fact that they are all very dependent and become so in the coarse of the novels. Their love interest are not a priority and they do not depend on their parents support emotionally. Lizzy grows as and individual when she spends two weeks at their friends house with her sister Jane. This seperation allows her to grow away from her parents to take care of Jane and make some of her own decisions. While there, she does not allow herself to show many emotions toward other people and over looks emotions displayed toward her by others. Mr. Woodhouse, Emma's father, dislikes going out past their fence and that forces Emma to go out to social events on her own. In a way she becomes too dependent and doesn't realize what she may be missing out on with other characters of the book. Elinor appears to be unconcerned. Her love interest pops in and out of the novel and her true feelings are not completely revealed until the end of the novel. Her independence comes from helping her moher raise two of her sisters, Margarette and Marianne. I would reccomend this novel to someone who is enterested in branching out their reading experiences to old English romance. I enjoyed reading this book because of its interesting characters. There was always a mdest joke or disagreement, I was never bored. I also enjoyed picturing the events in my head. Some of the scenes were so beautiful. Taking place in lovely gardens you see only in your dreams, and extremely elegant mansions. Reminding me of the time I went to Mount Vernon, the home of George Washington, and Montecello, the home of Thomas Jefferson. Back then people were so polite. Rudeness was severly frowned upon especially when directed at or in the presence of a lady. Very different from today's society. It is interesting to see what it was like back then for entertainment without a television or radio. I enjoyed this novel very much as well as some of Jane Austen's other works which have been made into major motion pictures that are also very enjoyable."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I though is was a wonderful and Romantic Book.

The genre is British Romance/ Realistic Fiction. This story is about a girl Lizzy ,(or Elizabeth), who had a \\"poorer\\" family who was very prejudice against Mr.Darcy who was very wealthy.The five Bennet sisters - Lizzie,Jane,Lydia,Mary and Kitty - have been raised well aware of their mother's fixation on finding them husbands and securing set futures...and keeping the family name \\"strong.\\"However, the spirited and intelligent Elizabeth strives to live her life with a broader perspective, as encouraged by her father.Mr. Darcy ,on the other hand, lived a life of luxury with his little sister,(age 15). Mr.Darcy and his friend Mr. Bingly's sister were very prideful of themselves.Mr. Bingly fell in love with Lizzy's oldest sister,Jane, and Mr.Bingly's sister fell in love with Mr. Darcy. And Mr.Darcy fell in love with Lizzy but he was to prideful to admit it.When the good-natured Mr Bingley abruptly departs for London, devastating Jane, Lizzie holds Mr Darcy culpable for contributing to the heartbreak. But a crisis involving youngest sister Lydia soon opens Lizzie's eyes to the true nature of her relationship with Mr Darcy.It is a book about British \\"classes\\" (or ranks) in government and also society : (people were treated differently because of their \\"class\\". Many people who were poor could not even skeak or even stay in the same room with the \\"rich and famous\\" in the 1800's. It is a great peice of English literature.Each family was very close..most of the time. Lizzy's family for example, was all about marrage to a wealthy man or the family name. Mr.Darcy's \\"family\\" was more of just him and his sister who were very close. Lizzy acted the same toward everyone and \\"full of life!\\" but Mr.Darcy was only truely happy with his little sister and later, Elizabeth. Otherwise he would not dance at balls (unless he danced with Lizzy) and he hardly even laughed.In the end,(without giving it away), Mr.Darcy AND Lizzy had a differnet perspective of life and family.

My biggest impression is relief that I did not live in that era, when the most a woman could hope for was to be good at needlepoint and marry well. I understand that is how it was, but I still felt nauseous reading about all the silly, manipulative man hunting tactics of the women. The dialoge was sometimes very witty, but other times rather difficult to follow because of the older style English.I also could not stand Darcy; any man who has the audacity to say within earshot of a woman that she is too ugly to tempt him or to dance with him is a jerk, period. I would tell him to take a hike if he came around. I don't understand how women find men like Darcy, Heathcliff, and Rochester to be attractive; cold indifferent, sarcastic, and cruel men don't interest me in the slightest and I can't for the life of me understand how they get to be such great romantic interests in these type of novels.The main character, Elizabeth, is different from the others and is very likeable; she redeems the book from being a 1 star. I admire her intelligence and refusal to go along the societies norms. I don't understand how she begins to like Darcy, but I guess that is just me. Elizabeth's ability to spar with Darcy and hold her own was the best part of the book.This book is is not as good as \\"Jane Eyre\\" but is better than \\"Wuthering Heights\\" in my opinion. A decent read, but not a rave."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I am an avid reader of English classics so naturally, I came across P&amp;P fairly soon after I discovered my love of literature. I had heard so many glorious things about this novel (that it forms young women world wide, that the characters are incredibly convincing and realistic, etc.), that perhaps I was expecting a little bit more. Sure, Austen claimed she wrote about the &quot;things she knew about.&quot; Unfortunately, there were many other authors, female artists to be most specific, who were her contemporaries and wrote far more incredibly mind blowing novels (Mary Shelly comes to my mind).I will begin by saying that this book was wonderful to read. It was witty and the story line was intriguing enough that I had no trouble completing it a few days after beginning it (I will confess, I even gave up a few nights of slee to find out if Elizabeth's character flaws would resolve). The characters were convincing, the book well developed and not extremely predictable. Unfortunately, these assets did not redeem the novel in my eyes, because shortly after finishing it, I simply could not believe I had wasted a few days of valuable reading time to devote to a relatively 'numb' piece of literature. Simply put, I felt it lacked depth, and although it was witty and enjoyable to read, I do not exactly understand why it has lasted as a classic depiction of human existance. The plot was unrealistic, the ending contrived, and besides the obvious message that 'pride and prejudice are evil and indulging in either of these flaws will cause misery' I did not receive any further enlightenment by reading it. It is an excellent documentation of courting rituals during Austen's time, as well as what I imagine to be a realistic depiction of the concerns of upper-middle-class English society, but to be perfectly honest, who cares? If these subjects interest you, I'm sure you will be enthralled by Austen's work. I appreciate her and respect her because of the history she represents, and for this reason, you should NOT AVOID READING THIS BOOK, but I do not think I will ever be able to say her work moves me. Of course, I could be missing something. I'm only sixteen, so my distaste for P&amp;P could be the result of youth and foolishness. If any of you have read this novel were sincerely moved by it, I'd love to hear from you.

While her older sister, Jane, has her own troubles with Mr. Darcy's friend, Mr. Bingley.This is a love stories for more than one, full of marriage do's and don'ts. It is also full of wonderful dialogue and a timeless plot.This is one of my very favorite books. I love how everything that could possibly go wrong does go wrong. My favorite part about it is that I can relate to the story although it obviously was not written in this time period.My favorite mix up is how Mr. Darcy is convinced that Jane does not love Mr. Bingley so he separates them, causing Elizabeth to refuse his offer of marriage. He then goes through a long process of tiny deeds with the hope of redeeming himself in Elizabeth's eyes.One of my favorite characters is Mrs. Bennett. Forever causing her daughters' grief with her thoughtless comments and impropriety, she contributes to much of her daughters' unhappiness; Although all she wants for them is to be well-married and happy.I recommend this book with a love for classics who do not get bored with a lot of dialogue (like my sisters do).E @ 3 Book BeesOriginally posted @ [...]Ima swagbucks superstar @ [...]"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It is beneficial at times to step away from our classics of literature, to take them down from their high pedestals and look at them without pretension. No novel, no matter how well-regarded, is universally esteemed - Twain, Emerson, and Charlotte Bronte all savaged Pride and Prejudice in print - so let us, for a few moments, stop treating it as holy writ and just look at it as a novel, at how it holds up to a modern casual reader.Pride and Prejudice (1813) is Jane Austen's novel of manners - it thoroughly explores the ins, outs and economics of nineteenth-century courtship. The novel's central character is Elizabeth Bennet, one of five daughters, whose family lives in a country village. Two wealthy, eligible bachelors move to town, and romance, confusion and animosity ensue.Austen populates her novel with all manner of flawed characters. Many of them are annoying - that is, they behave badly and are antagonistic toward the main characters - but they all show at least some depth. No one here is without flaw, but no one here is without virtue, either (except Mr. Collins, the most ludicrous of them all). And this is why the novel works: because Austen treats her characters and their social milieu gently, delicately (well, except Mr. Collins). If she had done otherwise, if she had been more cutting, she would have lost the sympathy in the reader that many of these characters engender.To the modern audience, Austen's plotting is rather sluggish, although it must be recalled that novels moved at a rather more leisurely pace then. At any rate it often seems that there is one too many side plots, or perhaps one too many visits to relatives, and there are patches that can be quite hard to get through. But you don't go to Austen for plot - you go to her for clever dialogue, for a delightful turn of phrase. That is what she thrives at, and that is what she is best remembered for. And in spite of the novel's overlength, Austen delivers a full and completely satisfying payoff. Rarely is a happy ending so fulfilling, and it may not be until the last few pages of the book that it becomes evident to the reader how masterfully Austen has set it up. And this is a large reason why the novel has such enduring appeal.Much of the nuance in Pride and Prejudice may be lost on casual modern readers. For example, the character of Mrs. Bennet is the object of great scorn from many readers, and this has only been exacerbated by the film adaptations of the novel. But while marrying for love is the norm today, then, it was not; Mrs. Bennet is the only one looking out for the Bennet family's financial future.Pride and Prejudice is, on the whole, a satisfactory and clever novel, and, at present, one whose merits are diminished mostly by readers too far removed to understand it in its fullness, or whose tastes have diverged too far."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I bought this book because my own copy was severely damaged after years of peruse. The picture of the cover was not available online at that time. I was sorely disappointed when the book arrived and I realised that this is not Jane Austen's original novel, but a severely butchered version, probably adequate for 8 year olds.So, should you be looking for a present for a child, this is probably an excellent choice. Should you be looking for a cheap copy of the master novel, search further."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I decided to go to the library and take out the book after seeing the movie a few weeks ago. The movie was good but the book is so much better. It was well written, funny and everything you can expect from a good novel. Definitely a must read even if it is not required for class."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"If you only read one Jane Austen book, this is the one to pick. But if like the rest of us, you find something so completely witty and enjoyable in Pride and Prejudice, you'll pick up the rest of her books and read them all."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Who could not get swept up in the thorny romance of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy? And what girl hasn't fallen in love at least a little bit with the prickly yet big-hearted Mr. Darcy? This book has been made into mutiple miniseries (the A&E one is hands-down my favorite) and movies, while many modern screenplays have borrowed (and downright stolen) from this classic, romantic comedy of errors--or prejudices if you will--and for good reason. Like a fine wine, this novel just seems to keep getting better with (my) age."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Reading this book is like taking a sailboat ride to the world's best locations: exciting, smooth, tumultuous, but all in all a fantatic ride. Austen delightfully teases you in your role as omnicient reader, leaving you tantalized by the characters in all of their plots and sub-plots. You want to reach into the book and tell the characters you know the solutions to all their problems. You cheer the characters on through their pleasures and foibles. The language is as smooth as silk and as alluring as diamonds."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is Jane Austen's finest novel and one must assume that the author identifies rather strongly with the female protagonist. The book is the perfect balance of story, prose, structure, and characters. It evokes many emotional responses in the reader. The novel is among the greatest novels of all time on par with for example Flaubert's \\"Madame Bovary\\" or Tolstoy's \\"Anna Karenina.\\"The present novel is about a young woman, Elizabeth Bennet, who comes from an upper middle class family living in rural England. She has four sisters plus an interesting mother and a wise but witty father. The novel follows the romances and complications of the Bennet girls, especially Elizabeth and her sister Jane. Beyond knowing those facts, you should not read any more about the plot until you read the novel, or you will risk spoiling the read. I will not give away the plot, but will only describe the writing style and structure.I read Austen's \\"Mansfield Park,\\" then read some analysis by Nabokov from his Cornell \\"Lectures on Literature\\" and the comments of Jane Stabler from the introduction of the Oxford version. After that I got a bit excited and read Austen's early writing \\"Sense and Sensibility,\\" along with the analysis by Margaret Doody in the Oxford version. Yes, I guess I am now an Austen fan, and it is a pity that she did not live longer. \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is my third Austen novel and so far the most fun to read..Based on the three novels written over two different time periods, it is clear that she developed a certain fixed writing style and a common structure. She uses the early pages to introduce the families, and other characters, and give start the story. She moves characters around from place to place in part for time shifting. She does a wrap up in the last few chapters.Those opening chapters are an obstacle for most readers. She uses her own vocabulary and has an unusual way of structuring her prose. That structure is a trademark of Austen's writing. Also, she manages to work in a lot of drama and social issues with some humour and irony.Based on what Nabokov and others are saying, she got her inspiration from Sheridan, Richardson, Henry Fielding, Sir Walter Scott, and the poetry of Cowper. She modulates the complexity of the prose to reflect the characters - such as making the sentences of Sir Thomas Bertram in \\"Mansfield Park\\" somewhat elaborate instead of describing how the character is dressed or a similar description to convey qualities and traits, i.e.: she uses the complexity of speech to convey character. Also, she uses lateral shifts and epigrammatic notations and similar literary techniques. These techniques are interesting for some readers but just confusing for others. It is all part of the price of admission to entering the world of Jane Austen, and it is part of the fun in reading her novels.Overall, once you get past reading and digesting 50 pages or so and have absorbed the Jane Austen vocabulary (words such as felicity, remonstrance, countenance, etc.) and understand the structure of her prose, the book becomes a compelling read. The second Austen novel seems much easier than the first.This was written by a mature Jane Austen and many think it is her best work and it is one of the most delightful and pleasant reads. One must conclude that the very intelligent and witty Elizabeth character is a reflection of the author herself."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have always loved P&P it is timeless both in its writing style and it's subject matter. Like Romeo and Juliet this book's story line have been shamelessly borrowed by novelists and film makers for years. I can think of at least a dozzen books and movies made within the past couple of decades which attempt to rehash this untopable novel. I love the social commentary Austen makes in the book through the interactions between the Bennett family and others in the book . I heartily recomend this work to the romantics in this world, and all others who just want a timeless storyin which love, honour and to some extent vulnerability trample the strictist rigitity of class, snobbery and aloofness."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Austen's finest work is, in my humble opinion, \\"Emma\\". This is, however, the finest work that the average man can actually read without being entirely baffled by the intrigue of the female mind. This, my second Austen, is perhaps the best to get anyone interested in Austen's style of writing. But be warned, \\"Pride and Prejudice can keep you rivetted for hours..."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is mainly focused on Elizabeth Bennet and her romance with Mr. Darcy, which comes about in a very interesting, if not humorous way. Elizabeth first judges Mr. Darcy to be arrogant and conceited, while Mr. Darcy finds himself falling in love with Elizabeth. Another main character is Elizabeth's sister, Jane, who has a troubled relationship with Mr. Bingley, Mr. Darcy's friend. Many exciting events take place involving the many sisters of the Bennet family in this great English story that will keep advanced readers interested.I have to admit, this was a very difficult book. I struggled through most of it, and I like this book much better now that I am finished with it. I guess that means that I like the story, but it took a while to get through reading it. One downside was that there was not much said describing Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy's romance. That might have been somewhat due to the time period in which this story was written. However, I really enjoyed the great detail, which allowed Austen to paint an amazing picture of society in that time period and middle-class expectations. I bought this book, which I am glad I did, because I plan to read it again. This definitely seems like it's one of those books that the reader will enjoy more the second time it is read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I was truly surprised by this tale. I was drawn from the very first page by Mrs. Bennets gossip. What was equally delightful was the sarcastic manner in which Mr. Bennet responded to her chatter, and she was none the wiser. And so begins a tale of wit that engages the minds.From the moment Darcy is mentioned, with his ill manners, we know that he will be key to the story and surely he is. The engaging repetoire between Elizabeth and Darcy is what makes the novel such an interesting read. From their haughty demeanor to falling in love, this tale is rich with engaging conversations.This novel gives an enlightening aspect to the 'higher' society of British life. There is a wicked vein that runs throughout the book, for the outlook on such a life seems quite vain if not ridiculous. Miss Austen does an excellent job of conveying that life to us, with enough wit and sarcasm.I enjoyed this book immensely and would recommend it to anyone wanting a witty read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This plot was definitely fit for me. I am into the suspensful love stories that pull you into the story and won't let you go. This book was like that for me. I felt I could relate to a lot of it in that the girls were fighting over a guy or gossiping about who they think is prettier, or who they admire the most; something i could see my friends and I doing a lot. I think a part of the book that portrays the similarity between my friends and the girls from &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is when the Bennet and theLucas women get together the morning after a ball and discuss all of the details. Mr. Bingley is the hot item in town and they are trying to decide who he likes the most. &quot;Oh!---you must mean Jane, I suppose---because he danced with her twice. To be sure that did seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he did--I heard something about it---but I hardly know what---something about Mr. Robinson.&quot;&quot;Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies....and which he thought the prettiest? And his answering immediately to the last question---Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that point.&quot; (pg. 20). I also love all of the characters in her novel. For each one of them i could tink of someone I knew who was exactly like them. I feel like I know Elizabeth, Jane, and Charlotte so well because they each have qualities almost identical to some of my friends. My favorite character throughout this book had to be Elizabeth. She is strong, witty, and extremely intelligent. She has a lot of the qualities that inspire me to be a stronger person that stands up for my beliefs. I love that she is able to battle with Darcy about what makes the &quot;perfect&quot; woman. Her intelligence makes Darcy drool over her. I think Elizabeth would be a good role model for a lot of girls who need to learn what the meaning of independence is, and how to use it. A quote in the book that shows Elizabeth's strength. &quot;My fingers, said Elizabeth, &quot;do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women's do. They have not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault--because I would not take the trouble of practicing. It is not that I do not believe m fingers as capable as any other woman's of uperior execution.&quot; &quot;Darcy smiled and said, &quot;you are perfectly right.&quot;&quot;Another reason I love this book is because of Jane Austen's writing style. She uses such a large vocabulary that thouroughly illustrated everyone's feelings so well, that it made it hard to put the book down. Austen's wording just seemed so elegant and flowed together perfectly. I felt smart just reading her book. It was definitely challenging because of the old fashioned wording and advanced vocabulary, but it feels like such an accomplishment finishing such a great book. I reccomend this book to anyone who wants to enjoy a great story and get a sense for the social status of women and men during the 19th century. It's a great book, and I have nothing bad to say about it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is the original and most amazing novel of all of Jane Austen novels.The most wonderful chapter is chapter eight where Elizabeth Bennet shows off her witty and exhilarating character. She is very beautiful and has a shining personality.This novel has amazing, fantastic wording as well as chapters. The appropriate age for this novel to be read would most likely be from 16 years of age and up because younger readers aren't mature or they don't have the knowledge that has to be applied to read this novel.Jane Austen beautifully brings out irony of fate; everything is expected to go one way but ends up another. For example, when the Bennet family thought that Wickham took Lydia to London to elope. The family thought the worse. They kept in mind that Wickham could possibly try to bed Lydia and not consider that he would propose to her. They were scared for Lydia and Wickham. At last they were found and brought back to Longbourn estate and surprisingly they were safe and engaged.This has been the best novel I have ever read in my life. I have never indulged in a novel like Pride and Prejudice. I adored the truth and reality that it holds."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is a book based in the 19th century in England. It was based on the era when money, pride, love, and marriage arrangements had to be the best and the most important thing. In this book the major conflict was their pride and prejudice of the main characters. The book's main characters were the Bennet Family, Bingley, and Darcy. The Bennet family consisted of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, their daughters Jane, Elizabeth, Mary, Kitty, and Lydia. As this story starts we meet all of them along with others minor characters. We find out that they are all concerned about social classes.The best chapter in this book is when Darcy and Elizabeth become engaged. To me it is the best chapter because that shows that they overcame their pride and prejudice. These two characters were deeply in love but couldn't show it to each other not only because of their own pride and prejudice, but also because their family and acquaintances had influenced them wrongly.The literary device I appreciate is comedy. A comedy, in general, is a story that ends happily. The hero or heroine of a comedy is usually an ordinary character who overcomes a series of obstacles that block what he or she wants. It's usually a plot where two young people meet and fall in love. The young lovers must face obstacles to their marriage. At the end of the story Elizabeth and Darcy overcome their conflicts to get together and be able to show their feelings towards each other.I like and recommend this book to anyone who likes to read love books with a little comedy. This book is age appropriate for teens and older people because it gives you a chance to appreciate the differences in lifestyles and beliefs in the 19th century from those of today. This book makes you think of how people believed women had only one futurein life, and that was getting married and raising a family."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It is unfortunate that most first time readers of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE see it merely as one more book to be endured in 11th grade English. However, most soon enough catch the magic of an author (Jane Austen) who can weave a spellbinding tale of love, romance, satire, and passion while all the while poking a not so gentle thrust at the social mores of the early 19th century. This book is no frilly ancestor of a Harlequin romance, even if it shares with the dim-witted heroines of Harlequin a time-honored plot of lovers who meet and find an instant dislike that later morphs into enduring love. PRIDE AND PREJUDICE starts off with that basic premise, but what sets it off as classic is what goes on behind the lovers, Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy. A careful reader usually notes the society in which Elizabeth and Darcy play out their little games of cross-purpose verbal repartee. The world of Austen's PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is a society ruled by conniving and single-minded women who see men only in terms of the size of their wallets. Whenever a new bachelor appears on the scene, the women of the novel (with the exception of Elizabeth, of course) immediately try to guess his income so that they can decide if one wishes to marry him. His age, his looks, his habits are much less significant than his income. A fat purse compensates for a fat head.Modern readers typically call such schemers 'golddiggers,' and according to modern values, perhaps they are, but these readers ought to judge the book's morality against the age in which it was written. Austen (1775 - 1817) lived in an England that prized manners and breeding over all else. It is no surprise, then, that since the reclusive author felt most comfortable only in the company of women, that she would limit her book only to the thoughts, feelings, emotions, and habits of women. In PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, men are never permitted to occupy center stage, nor are they shown interacting independently with other men. If a man is present in any scene, so must a woman to control and observe his actions. Men--even the eventually triumphant Darcy--are generally portrayed as vain, sycophantic, sarcastic, and totally aware that they they are prized only for their money.The world of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, especially if one has seen the fine film version starring Greer Garson, is one that seems to have been built for women to inhabit. All the women wear flouncy, bouncy dresses with huge flowered hats that Scarlet O'Hara might have worn in GONE WITH THE WIND. Even those ladies that complain of poverty never lack the funds to afford those outrageous outfits. Further, Miss Austen stages a ball in just about every third chapter that permits single women to size up eligible men. As these dandefied women and uniformed men speak to each other, the modern reader probably will be surprised at the excessive politeness and deference tossed unerringly about. This strict adherence to a surface morality ought not to fool the reader into assuming that the characters are as inwardly noble as they are outwardly polite. In fact, behind this massive wall of formal phrasing and good manners lies the same fears, jealousies, and general backstabbing that pervade a modern disco. What gives PRIDE AND PREJUDICE its perpetual charm is the biting irony that causes the reader to wonder: 'Did that character say what I think he (or she) just said?' The modern reader can best appreciate Austen's wit if she can read between the lines to sense the tone of the moment. If such a reader can see that this book is a polite if powerful indictment of a way of life that even Austen wished to poke fun of, then perhaps this reader can appreciate the charm of a book that grows with each successive reading."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Neither but I could not, I repeat could not read this book I fell asleep through the first chapter and could not seem to muster enough effort to read the second chapter. I do like Jane Austen movies, but I think in her books she tends to elaborate on things a bit much for my taste. I commend anyone who has read it through though. It is a wonderful classic with humour and romance this is a must read if you can get through it without dozing off."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"**** UPDATED September 30, 2012 (edited here. Extended comment at bottom) ********Pros: A great heroine and romantic story.Cons: The language can be a struggle in the beginning.The Bottom Line: The heroine of the story, Elizabeth Bennet, is one of my top 10 favorites.The story:A young woman, Elizabeth Bennet, is the second eldest of five girls (no boys as the heir). She is a very realistic woman who doesn't believe that beauty or wealth should hinder her from a happy life and marriage. While her sisters give their hearts out to people too quickly. The mother allows all five girls to be \\"out\\" (allowed to find suitors) due to her fears. She is worried that when her husband dies they will be destitute - which is true at the times lifestyle.Elizabeth takes her time in finding her ideal man. She is very proud of her family and prejudice toward the wealthy. Lydia and Kittie (two youngest sisters) are hilarious, and they believe in love at first site of a navy sailor. This doesn't go so well for one of them - i.e. a Mr. Wickham. Mary is the unfortunate middle child whom is neither gifted in \\"the arts\\" nor with words. Jane and Lizzie (Elizabeth), the older two sisters, are more reserved with their hearts. Mr. Darcy also is prejudice and proud, especially when he tries to ruin Jane and Mr. Bingley's relationship. His reasons is that he doesn't see Jane's love towards his friend. The connected relationships all fit perfectly together. Jane Austen shows a new ideal marriage when Mr. Bennet intends to marry off his daughters only if their mate was equal to them - meaning that the marriages should be equal.The language:It's a little difficult to read at first, and my only suggestion is that you should remember that it was written before our time. Most of the words are in the dictionary, but the grammar has definitely changed over the century. Jane Austen also enjoys excessively writing about one subject in the story, which can be difficult to sit through to read. But it still shows that Jane is a great author, especially during her time.My thoughts on the book besides the ones that I've already given is that the book is one of my favorite Austen books, because it has a strong heroine character that I can relate to. The family values are very modern, but yet it also gives a feminist-like style when the characters like Elizabeth are intelligent, and aren't too afraid to speak their mind. This book is a great classics book that I have read numerous times, and am still interested in reading in the future.cheersmichelle (2002)******UPDATE********So 10 years later and after an excessive amount of writing and reading classes, I feel this needs an update.Austen's writing is always a woman's point of view. It's beautifully written with rich characters so that you always feel like you're apart of the story. Austen's fan base is more popular with woman rather than the macho man because she expresses feelings. Her characters communicate to each other rather than shut their feelings away. In the case of 'Pride and Prejudice' these feelings spoken won't always help the character due to either their pride or prejudice.In my experience men are not keen to the idea of talking about how they feel. Austen not only shows this but she allowed woman of her era to have a voice - even if it wasn't etiquette. So men, you should just bear through all the woman talk. And when reading through their blabbering, think about their behavior. Are they childish (I.e. Lydia and Kitty)? Are they behaving with etiquette?The romance in this book is genuine. I can't help but wish for a Mr. Darcy for myself. Austen did a good job in \\"showing\\" us her characters love - rather than today's authors whom \\"tell.\\" This is the example of show your feelings rather than verbally giving them untill our heads are bashed in."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane creates a colorful cast of characters to people this moral tale of hasty judgement.

It's about 7 1/2 hours each way (because I actually go the speed limit!!!) and I wanted to try something new while driving. So, I decided to try an audio recording.I found one from my local library of Pride and Prejudice. : Why not go with a classic book for the drive home?So, I listened to Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen.Pride and Prejudice is the story of the Bennet sisters, Elizabeth and Jane. Both are of marriageable age but do not come from the wealthiest of families. However, they live in a time when marriage to someone with wealth is of utmost importance.Since they have no brothers, when their father dies his estate will go to another male relative, as they are unable to inherit.One summer a new family comes to live nearby, and Mrs. Bennet, their mother insists that Mr. Bennet make an acquaintance with Mr. Bingley, the new bachelor who is very wealthy. At a ball one evening he is immediately taken with Jane Bennet who is admittedly beautiful, of a sweet nature, but perhaps below the standard of wealth into which he is expected to marry.But the problem really is his friend, Mr. Darcy. A haughtier more proud man has never existed, and though that same night at the ball many women did not have partners as men were few, Mr. Darcy makes it clear that he thinks pretty negatively of Elizabeth Bennet. He is cold, unfriendly, and seemingly unkind . . .Mrs. Bennet is determined to see her daughters married and encourages Jane and Mr. Bingley, but is desperate to make a match for Elizabeth, including pushing her to accept the proposal of marriage from her most insipid cousin.We follow the story of the Bennet family as others do everything they can to keep Jane and Mr. Bingley apart, and Elizabeth is forced into close proximity with the awful Mr. Darcy repeatedly.Will Jane and Elizabeth ever find true love that others will accept? Or will their less wealthy state be their destruction?Read Pride and Prejudice to find out!This is a total and complete classic. There are over 2 million copies sold worldwide, hundreds of editions, and quite a few different audio recordings, not to mention TV and movie versions of this story.If you haven't actually read Pride and Prejudice you simply must! It's a beautiful, wonderful story full of lively characters with personality oozing from them. Mrs. Bennet is incredibly silly, a trait which seems to have rubbed off thoroughly on several of her daughters. But Jane and Elizabeth took far more after their father with much more sense. It's the story of how pride and prejudice can keep you from truly seeing another's character, and how opinions can change when someone is given a true chance.I highly recommend this book to everyone!5 out of 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"In all seriousness, this is a classic piece of English literature.

A great read!!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason. While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\\").It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love. An absolute must-read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It is beneficial at times to step away from our classics of literature, to take them down from their high pedestals and look at them without pretension. No novel, no matter how well-regarded, is universally esteemed - Twain, Emerson, and Charlotte Bronte all savaged Pride and Prejudice in print - so let us, for a few moments, stop treating it as holy writ and just look at it as a novel, at how it holds up to a modern casual reader.Pride and Prejudice (1813) is Jane Austen's novel of manners - it thoroughly explores the ins, outs and economics of nineteenth-century courtship. The novel's central character is Elizabeth Bennet, one of five daughters, whose family lives in a country village. Two wealthy, eligible bachelors move to town, and romance, confusion and animosity ensue.Austen populates her novel with all manner of flawed characters. Many of them are annoying - that is, they behave badly and are antagonistic toward the main characters - but they all show at least some depth. No one here is without flaw, but no one here is without virtue, either (except Mr. Collins, the most ludicrous of them all). And this is why the novel works: because Austen treats her characters and their social milieu gently, delicately (well, except Mr. Collins). If she had done otherwise, if she had been more cutting, she would have lost the sympathy in the reader that many of these characters engender.To the modern audience, Austen's plotting is rather sluggish, although it must be recalled that novels moved at a rather more leisurely pace then. At any rate it often seems that there is one too many side plots, or perhaps one too many visits to relatives, and there are patches that can be quite hard to get through. But you don't go to Austen for plot - you go to her for clever dialogue, for a delightful turn of phrase. That is what she thrives at, and that is what she is best remembered for. And in spite of the novel's overlength, Austen delivers a full and completely satisfying payoff. Rarely is a happy ending so fulfilling, and it may not be until the last few pages of the book that it becomes evident to the reader how masterfully Austen has set it up. And this is a large reason why the novel has such enduring appeal.Much of the nuance in Pride and Prejudice may be lost on casual modern readers. For example, the character of Mrs. Bennet is the object of great scorn from many readers, and this has only been exacerbated by the film adaptations of the novel. But while marrying for love is the norm today, then, it was not; Mrs. Bennet is the only one looking out for the Bennet family's financial future.Pride and Prejudice is, on the whole, a satisfactory and clever novel, and, at present, one whose merits are diminished mostly by readers too far removed to understand it in its fullness, or whose tastes have diverged too far."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"MY DEAR READERI cannot but be rendered in the highest of spirits upon completing this volume yet again, as I have always preferred extensive reading to trivial pleasures.Dwelling on particular passages and turns of phrase, I am reminded of how ardently I admire and love the prose that issued forth when Miss Austen put ink to paper many a fortnight ago.Neither common, nor dull, nor threadbare, each chapter engrosses completely with accounts of gentlemen of handsome countenance and ladies both sensible and silly.And though its conclusion is known most intimately to my own heart, anxiously I turn each page to venture ever farther away from the misconstrued encounters and lamentable conduct of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy.When finally all is concluded and the mistress of Pemberley assured, only then can I chuse another distraction to engage my solitary hours.

Lizzie being so bright and level headed was refreshing in comparison to her younger sisters and even with her older sister Jane, the kindest one.

It encompasses Austen's fabulous use of irony, wonderful examples of females subverting the economic conditions that control them through their wit, and a wonderful contrast in descripitions of landscapes that are prevelent in all of Austen's books. However, this book stands out as one of the best of the nineteenth century for many reasons. The first is that Austen's use of irony in this book is readily apparent, especially in the dialogue and actions of the characters. The wit that Lizzie exudes, especially in her conversations between Mr. Darcy, her unexpected love interest, and the Lady Catherine de Burgh provide endless entertainment for the reader. The reader develops a line of sympathy for Lizzie as she struggles to make the best of her unfortunate financial situation. Another reason to love the book not only includes the wit of Lizzie Bennet, but of her father and Mr. Darcy, which provide wonderful view into the superior workings of Austen's mind in terms of her characters' personalities. The landscapes would provide a wonderful escape for someone stranded on a deserted island because they provide many Romantic countrysides with transcendental descriptions along with wonderful descriptions of London that make the reader feel as if they really are staying with Mrs. Gardner with Jane. The description of Pemberley alone provides a wonderful example of the grandeur of nineteenth-century estates in England. Since I am supposedly stranded on this island on Valentine's Day, the love story contained within Austen's indirect ocmmentary on the hardships of economics on women in the nineteenth century, provides a hope that each person will meet not only the perfect person, but that person will also recognize them as their destined mate. This book incorporates the Romantic notions of Byron and Wordsworth into Lizzie, while allowing her to retain pieces of realism that makes her supreme to all of the other female characters. Austen also provides a wonderful sexual tension between Mr. Darcy and Lizzie that has never been equalled in any book that I have ever read, and being an English major, there have been many. I have read this book many times and still find motifs, themes, images and nuances in the plot that provide me continually with enjoyment. For this reason alone would I be content with having this book as my sole company on a deserted island. The villains in this novel are also so much fun to hate because they prove to be the very foces that try to keep Lizzie and Darcy apart. The two characters, however, persevere, which would be a very important theme for a person stranded on a desert island. Perseverence would be the only way one would survive the lonliness, aside from an excellent book, of course. Austen was truly ahead of her time as critic after critic will tell you, but only after you have read one of her greatest works will you understand why it has crossed the time and custom boundries and to this day remains a wonderful piece of literature that will continue to provide enjoyment to each new reader that endeavors to read it. Enjoy!

Elizabeth's younger sisters are silly young girls who favor their senseless mother. Her father loves her dearly. He adds humor to the novel with his near-sarcastic views of his family. The other characters in the novel range from her completely silly and senseless cousin Collins, to the conniving Miss Bingley, to the indescribable Mr. Darcy, Elizabeth's beau. Austen uses the perfect combination of humor, romance, and suspense in this unforgettable story. I was unable to put this book down, but I regretted it not being any longer"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"As always, Austen ridicules the conventions of the time, but acknowledges that they must be accepted. Women must find men (hopefully rich) to marry them; any feelings of love or respect in marriage are wonderful, but not always necessary or relevant. The characters are far from perfect --- pompous, superficial and greedy. Even the heroine of the novel, Elizabeth, is prone to prejudice. She is a willing participant in the titillating conversations with the proud Darcy and the envious Bingley sisters which serve to amuse and entertain the reader"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"the English countryside during the 1800's.Imagine this: you are the second eldest of five sisters, you have a flighty mother who is fixated on marrying you all off, and you have a father whose indolence and disillusionment with life have led to the faulty upbringing of your three younger sisters. What would you do when an attractive, rich man moved in next door and fell in love with your older sister (who is the most beautiful and eligible woman in the surrounding countryside)? You would be happy for her and you would do everything you could to help her marry the man she loves...and you'd be pretty upset if his best friend stepped in and talked him into not being in love with your sister and thus removed your sister's chance at happiness and an improved situation in life. Then what if your socially inept, silly, pedantic cousin asked you to marry him after you had only known him three days? Oh--then what would you do if he proposed to your best friend the day after you refused him, and she accepted?! To top it off, what if the same person who took away the love of your sister's life fell in love with you and asked you to marry him?!Well, that is Miss Elizabeth Bennett's position at the outset of this hilarious and endearing novel which details a year in the life of a genteel English family and their neighbors. During the course of the novel, three proposals of marriage are made to Miss Elizabeth; one proposal is made to Jane (the eldest Miss Bennett); and their youngest sister (who is only sixteen) elopes with an English Army officer who has a worse reputation with the ladies than Wilt Chamberlin. Jane Austen is a masterful storyteller who is able to sketch characters through a plot that is never quite what the reader expects. This is a tale of life, and much can be learned from the proud and/or prejudicial acts of its participants which is applicable even today."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"If this book needs a recommendation, it would be that it has been delighting readers for almost 200 years. In Elizabeth Bennet, Jane Austen has created the quintessential spunky heroine who refuses to let her somewhat low position on the social ladder dictate her behavior. Her mother is determined to marry off her five daughters to the highest bidders, but Elizabeth refuses to look for a marriage of financial convenience. She is hopeful that her sister Jane will marry the amiable Mr. Bingley, but she has no real matrimonial ambitions for herself. She has a particular disdain for Mr. Darcy, from which comes the \\"prejudice\\" of the title. He is a prideful man, thus supplying the other half of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". The language of the book is, of course, quite different from modern-day phraseology, but it's worth plowing through the conversations of manners and morals to uncover the delightful story of this star-crossed duo. May it continue to delight readers for the next 200 years!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This novel grabs you so hard that you just want to know what is going to happen next and why is Darcy and Elizabeth acting this way, what is the deal with all this pride and the prejudice?Even though that their life style in the novel in general does not seem very exciting like our present life style; however I think they were much more sophisticated than we are; they all read, write letters hence mastered the art of writing, and they all can play the piano! nice. in short, the novel is brilliant! that is it!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This classic novel follows the Bennet sisters as they search for marriage. The joy of this book is relating it to modern day romance and marriage. Many parts of the conversations and desires are familiar to today, while many other parts are foreign. Austen also has a great sense of humor, although many times I wondered whether it was intended as funny or whether it only appeared comical from a modern point of view."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is by far my favorite novel. I read it for the first time in 10th grade and have read it 4 times since. Every time I get something new out of it and the story never loses its charm!Austen is an undeniably talented author and Pride and Prejudice is arguably her best work. All of the characters are wonderfully developed and full of life. The plot seems to have a mind of its own, twisting here and there. Unlike some books were the plot doesn't seem to fit together in the end, Austen has worked out every detail.I also think this book is wonderful for the social commentary that it provides. Again, some novels I have read do not do so well with balancing social commentary and plot/character development. This is not so with Pride and Prejudice. This book is a true gem. Witty, fun, shocking, scandalous, romantic, and entertaining!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Almost everything that can be said about this book has been said. It has appeared in countless other books and media. I love this book for it's wit, it's humor, it's unconventional love story and because it is almost the singly best early example of individuals rebelling against conformity. This book is amazing, and I recommended it to anyone."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is a superb book. Each character has a unique personality. For example, Mr. Darcy is arrogant at the start of Pride and Prejudice. While Darcy is arrogant, Elizabeth Bennett is smart, beautiful, and independent. Elizabeth is the protagonist and is the liveliest character. I rooted for her from the start to the end of the story. Miss Bennett seems to somehow always find herself in difficult situations. The plot kept me entertained. There were several times when I couldn't put the book down until I found out what happened next.Pride and Prejudice is sometimes a little wordy. And because it was written in the 19th century, the English isn\`t contemporary.Overall, this book is excellent. In fact, it is considered one of the best novels in English ever written. It is therefore a classic. I recommend it to readers who want to read an engrossing book with a lot of dialogue."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is one of the best i have read in years.

I appreciate the positive reviews as they motivated me to start a classic which I may not have begun without some encouragement."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"My favorite chapter was chapter eleven in volume two because I found it amusing that Elizabeth turned down Mr. Darcy's proposal. I think that Elizabeth's own prejudice against Darcy didn't allow her to see his affections for her. Darcy accuses Elizabeth of having too much pride, and she accuses him of prejudice, when in both cases they both show pride and prejudice.I think this book is appropriate for students in high school because it is not complicated to read and therefore they should be able to read it. I like the fact that the author uses a lot of dialogue to reveal ideas and personalities of different characters. In my opinion dialogue is very important because sometimes it helps me understand what the characters are like, or it can reveal a character's look, and that helps me develop a picture of that one character.I like this book because it wasn't as hard to read as I thought it was going to be. One thing that I learned was that you should carefully read the story because sometimes you might miss the important parts."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"STORY LINE:Being not very wealthy, Elizabeth (Lizzie) Bennet and her four sisters find it hard to find good marriages in society thirst for position and good fortunes.

However, the reading of it is bogged down a little because of the speech ( wonderful, but tedious at the same time). Not for immediate gratification people but I will be reading all her works in due time..."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I read the book Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austin. It takes place in 18th Century, Longbourn, England. The two main characters of this book are Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy. In the beginning of the story they do not get along at all. I think that the antagonist of this story is Lady Catherine de Bourgh. This story is about the interaction between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. They have several encounters throughout the book and some of them weren't so friendly. Elizabeth is witty and sarcastic, while Mr. Darcy is perceived as proud and arrogant. This book is about the both of them learning to overcome their differences and falling in love somewhere in the middle.I really like the way Jane Austen writes, it is very descriptive and you can see a clear picture in your head of exactly what she's saying. She starts out with her main character and you know exactly who they are and where they're coming from. But then you get to read and see how they change throughout the story. I think that the theme of this story is to look from other people's perspectives and not be so centered on yourself and you might be surprised what you find. When I was first assigned to read a classic I wasn't thrilled, but then as I got reading I came to find that I really loved this book and now it's probably one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"That was a very interesting audio book - I had never read the book and now I know."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride & Prejudice has turned out to be my favorite book when it comes to romance novels...and that's saying something since I'm a 21 year old who reads ALOT.Elizabeth Bennet is such a smart and kind, yet of course flawed heroine, that I felt like I actually got to know her. Austen made her characters so tridimensional I was amazed...not many writers arecapable of that.When it comes down to Mr.Darcy, I was extremely satisfied with him as well, and every time I read a scene with him and Elizabeth , I giggled at their witty replies to each other, they most definitely made me swoon.Learned from this.

If one posesses that taste they can not doubt that Pride & Prejudice is her best work.-VCH"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\\"I'm going to be honest. This novel didn't get interesting to me until page 202. If you look above at the total page number, you'll see this is WELL into the novel.I didn't feel any tension? Any real conflict?So there's a woman living in a house with her parents (both of whom are pretty kooky, though Mama Bennet takes the cake) and four sisters (only one of whom seems remotely redeemable.) They talk, they walk, they go to parties, they get interested in marriage then get dumped, then someone else wants to marry one of them but moves away, more parties, some sewing, some cards, yada yada yada.I read this novel searching for WHAT in the world it is people like about it.Then it hit me: the tension is the life depicted.Jane Austen was living this life-an exceedingly intelligent woman (evidenced by her prose) who is made to reside behind doors hoping a man will marry her and hoping he is someone she'll respect.An insipid existence. A passive life for an active mind.The conflict isn't within the characters. The conflict is between the author and her readers.So how does Austen portray the absurdity of her life without alienating her readers? She creates an intelligent woman and then contrasts her with absurd characters. She gives us Jane, a sweet woman who is considered beautiful by everyone (though her mind is given no notice.) She gives us Elizabeth, a smart girl who is forever compared to her socially perfect sister. She gives us a mother who wants nothing but five sons-in-law, a father who can barely stand the presence of any of these women (or their prospective boyfriends), and a trio of silly sisters either buried in books or the mirror. Their ultimate life goal? Marriage.Having no money makes acheiving this goal very difficult.Wanting love? Equality? Conversation that isn't empty? Nearly impossible.Along comes cranky but rich Mr. Darcy.Somehow Austen has to find a way to make the rich guy see the poor woman's intelligence, and the poor woman see the rich (arrogant) guy's shrewdness.Both of them are trapped in an absurd game. Both of them know it's an absurd game but neither of them can say it's absurd, and Austen daren't let on she knows it's absurd because everyone buying the book is trapped in the very same game.She displays her novel as a light-hearted love story. In truth, I think it's a firestorm. She's shouting, as loud as she dares, \\"Does anyone else think this is stupid?\\"If you're reading for entertainment, it starts around 202. If you're reading to see Victorian society laid out on a surgical table and diced with style, it starts at page 1.4/5 for Pride and Prejudice."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Published in 1817, twenty years before Queen Victoria came to the throne, this novel allows the reader to travel through time to a bygone era where the pace of life was much, much slower than what we experience today. News came only through the mail or newspapers; travel was by horse-drawn coach. Listening to this work is thus a truly refreshing experience.In addition, the main characters, the Bennett sisters, have limited interests. With no educational, professional or political concerns, their only concern is to get married, what will guarantee their future social and financial status. They lead simple, sheltered lives and apparently have no notion of the work and efforts put in by servantsto produce dinners, balls, gowns, etc.The writing style is congruent with the times. The work itself is very long, meticulously written with very slow, restricted action.The audio book's narrator is truly excellent and succeeds, while remaining unaffected, to add dramatic interest by very astutely modifying her voice for each character.All in all, this novel is heartily recommended for a worthwhile escape from our hectic 21st century."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is amazing and perfect for anyone just being introduced to Austen.

It is unfortuante I waited until my 30s to read it. A true classic I'll never tire of reading again and again!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"What could I possibly say about Jane Austen's most famous novel that hasn't already been said? Even those who haven't read it surely know the name Mr Darcy, and how he's the romantic ideal of every housewife around the world. Everyone knows that he and Elizabeth Bennett are one of the most famous examples of a dislike-at-first-sight acquaintance that gradually matures into mutual respect and understanding, and I'm sure a healthy portion of that generalized \\"everyone\\" also knows that the novel also contains Austen's requisite commentary on class, marriage, wealth and families. Witty, self-deprecating Elizabeth is one of the most beloved heroines of all times (to this day, I find that I will always like a female protagonist if she reminds me of Elizabeth) and the novel itself begins with what is one of the most famous opening lines in English literature: \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of good fortune must be in want of a wife.\\"The true meaning of this line is obvious, and sets the tone for the entire novel: that it is not young men who are on the search for wives, but young women who are in want of eligible husbands, and that it is only society and decorum that dictates that the search should be undertaken by the men. Like all Austen's novels, the story is told from the point of view of a young woman, just beginning to find her place in the community and the world, and who is expected by everyone around her to be on the look-out for a husband. Yet this is not the first thing on Elizabeth Bennett's mind - as the second of five sisters, she's more preoccupied with keeping her younger sisters in check and making sure her beloved elder sister Jane is well matched in life. And if it's to a wealthy bachelor, then so much the better! Although reasonably well-off, the Longbourne estate is entailed on a cousin of their father, and so the girls face grim futures if they do not marry well before their father's death.A cynical and sarcastic recluse, Mr Bennett spends most of his time either baiting or avoiding his vacuous wife, whose most pressing concern in life is to marry off her daughters. Her prospects are suddenly promising when news comes that the neighboring estate of Netherfield is being lent out to a young man by the name of Mr Bingley: pleasant, wealthy, and immediately smitten with Jane. However, society is considerably less impressed by Bingley's companion. Mr Darcy is cold, arrogant and snobbish, who, on being invited to dance with Elizabeth, says of her: \\"\\"she is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt me.\\"Elizabeth takes an immediate disliking to him, an attitude that is only enforced when she meets the charismatic Mr Wickham who tells her he was the son of the late Mr Darcy's steward, and that the present Mr Darcy robbed him of his rightful inheritance as stipulated in his father's will. A further black mark against Darcy is drawn when Elizabeth learns that he (along with Bingley's spiteful sisters) has deliberately forced a wedge between Mr Bingley and Jane, in the attempt to \\"save\\" his friend from a bad match.It is to her utmost astonishment then, when Mr Darcy tells Elizabeth that he's in love with her and proposes marriage. Telling her that he's struggled against his will, reason and character in order to take this action, (and pointing out obvious disadvantages of the match - on his side), Elizabeth is hardly impressed by his assumption that she'll accept him, and takes the opportunity to tell him exactly what she thinks of him.And yet after this disastrous encounter, Elizabeth begins to learn more about her rejected suitor and his circumstances. Perhaps she's been blinded by her own prejudice against him, just as his pride initially made him so un-gentleman-like toward her...One misconception concerning \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the belief that Elizabeth and Darcy are an early example of the \\"belligerent sexual tension\\" clich&eacute;, in which two characters hide their secret attraction to each other by pretending that they dislike each other. This assumption has always bugged me, as it is certainly *not* what is at work here. Austen is not only poking fun at the notion of love at first sight, but more importantly, is riffing the idea that two people would try to hide their passion by pretending that they don't like each other (the foolish Mr Collins believes that Elizabeth deliberately refuses his marriage proposal just because women often pretend to reject their suitors to hid their true feelings). Elizabeth and Darcy are legitimately unimpressed by each other at the start of the novel, but it is their growing understanding and desire to become a better person for the sake of the other that makes up their storylines. Both of them have to change in order to deserve each other: Elizabeth to overcome her prejudice, and Darcy to realize that he \\"has been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle.\\"In a similar vein, it's important to note that Elizabeth - although prejudiced - is not entirely mistaken when it comes to accessing Mr Darcy's character. Although there is more to the Wickham story than meets the eye, her perception of him as arrogant and proud is indeed correct. It is her words to him after his proposal that force Darcy to reassess all that he's learnt in his lifetime; yet when she learns the truth and cries \\"till this moment I never knew myself,\\" we can see just how shaken she is to learn that her judgment is not as infallible as she thought it was.Different readers take different things from \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" - at its most simplistic, it's a Cinderella story about a worthy young woman who marries the man of her dreams and by doing so elevates her social standing. On a more contextual level, others approach the text as a vigorous satire of the social norms and expectations of Austen's day, in which the desperate hunt for a husband to ensure a woman's future has to be hidden beneath the constraints of civilized society.Although the novel may seem deceptively small in scope and content (in regards to the setting and general theme of marriage) this is a story that explores the depth of human relationships and the need for personal growth; a simple story about complex characters. Though it is not widely thought to be Austen's best novel - that distinction often goes toEmma- whichever way you look at it, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is considered Austen's lightest and most entertaining read, and is certainly her most famous.

Thanks!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This -its author's most popular novel-revolves around the Bennett family which consists of Mother,Father and 5 daughters.The family is not wealthy and marrying off the progeny to suitable young men is a financial necessity, something felt particularly sharply by the Mother.The family and the district roundabout is thrown into confusion by the arrival of 2 wealthy young men both of whom are unattached.There is Charles Bingley who leases a house close to the Bennett home ,and his friend Mr Darcy with whom he shares. Visits are exchanged between the households and Bingley falls in love with the eldest Bennett daughter ,Jane.The second daughter ,Elizabeth, and Darcy circle each other warily.There is much verbal sparring and Elizabeth-clever,witty and ironic-finds herself intrigued by Darcy while being repelled by his apparent aloofness and seemingly arrogant demeanour.She also hears negative things of him from other people.Events conspire to keep the pair apart and a mix of social snobbery,self-will and just plain misunderstandings are other barriers that must be overcome if true love is to triumph over its enemies -pride and prejudice.I have concentrated above on the relationship between darcy and Elizabeth but while this is the key relationship in the book it also has some well drawn supporting figures such as Lady Catherine de Bourgh ,a monster of snobbery and self-satisfaction personifying the aristocaracy at its worst and Mr Collins ,the oleaginous and toadying clergyman whose true colours emerge in his cringe worthy proposal to Elizabeth.The book is popular as a romance and while recognising this dimension to it have to say that for me it works best as a social comedy and an acute dissection of manners and relationships.It is among the great literary comedies as well as romances and is very clear eyed and unsentimental about such matters as marriage and social convention .This is not just a museum piece and deserves its wide readership"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This was an assigned reading book in 7 grade. When I first started reading I thought it was boring then something happened about 20 pages into it. I discovered a perfect romance. Austen puts so much life into these characters. The book draws you in to their story. The only downside is it ends to soon."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book! I admit without pleasure that I am partial to romance novels from the same time period. I also admit that it was very refreshing to read a less formulaic and shallow, meaning more creative, intelligent and worthy book set in this time.My favorite character must be Mrs. Bennet. Can anybody be more delusional, obnoxious and wacko? I laughed and cringed each time I heard her voice which I really did hear as I listened to the book on my mp3 player. And then there is Elizabeth Bennet, the heroine. Right at the beginning of the book she meets Mr. Darcy and it's dislike at first sight on both sides.Since her sister and Darcy's best friend fall in love, Elizabeth has to encounter Mr. Darcy repeatedly. Other events force the two to meet again and again and Elizabeth almost laughs out loud when finally ... but I don't want to spoil your question of \`what will happen if anything between Elizabeth and Darcy?'.I really liked Elizabeth' character development. I admire her steadfastness and honesty."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"What a wonderful book. It was written in 1797 and is still a most incredibly romantic story, even for us modern women! Jane Austen's observations of people's characters and behaviors are excellent.I recommend this book to anyone who has seen the movie, and wants more!Or to any hopeless romantics. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Austen wrote PRIDE and PREJUDICE in the mid-1790's and it is definitely a reflection of it's times. She speaks of an era where 'true' gentlemen did not engage in 'trade' (a term encompassing what today would include professions) and doing so would definitely lower not only him but his extended family's social status. Women were considered educated if they could play the piano well, or sing, or draw or were skilled at decorative needlework. The only acceptable occupation for a gentlewoman was marriage, an enterprise that her extended family was commited to helping her achieve for the alternative was spinsterhood as a dependent to some family member.PRIDE AND PREJUDICE centers on the Bennet family, a quiet country gentleman of modest means who lives with his wife and five daughters in southern England. As the story begins his family is in an uproar over the news of an eligible gentleman moving to the neighborhood. To the delight of Mrs. Bennet it quickly becomes apparent that Jane, the eldest daughter, has caught his eye. This is of special importance, since at 22 Jane's prospects are beginning to fade. The romance is not without obstacles which are further complicated by the romance of her next younger sister, the outspoken Elizabeth and the outrageous behavior of Lydia, the youngest daughter. In the end though, love, or at least matrimony, conquers all.The story begins rather slowly but the descriptions of the characters alone make it worth pressing on to the finish. Austen manages to bring them to life to the extent that the reader will probably be able to describe each in detail. PRIDE AND PREJUDICE has been called the first comic romance, and, although subtle by today's standards, some of the comic scenes are hysterical.If this novel were written by a 21st century author it would probably be about a third shorter, not a better novel but a more accessible one to a modern reader. The 18th century style with it's long, complicated sentences filled with detail make for slow reading, frustrating for a reader who is anxious for some action. It is also a bit difficult for a modern day reader to comprehend the culture that Austen is describing, one where a young woman walking alone is considered improper, where having a lawyer in the family is an embarrassment, where a wealthy country family could select the local minister. For a reader unfamiliar with this time period, particularly for a younger reader, an annotated edition would probably be helpful."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is Jane Austen's most popular novel and it is remarkable that it has sustained such a high popularity 200 years after it was originally published. The primary plot of the story follows Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy in a highly contentious courtship that begins with mutual contempt but evolves quite unexpectedly for both into very different feelings. Subplots involve her sister Jane and Mr. Bingley in a courtship of their own as well as the romantic entanglements of various other sisters and friends. The story is a bit of a roller coaster ride with soaring hopes and crushing disappointment in store as events unfold. I won't reveal the ending for the handful of people who haven't read it but suffice to say that the novel concludes in a way that leaves the vast majority of readers well satisfied.Darcy and Elizabeth are complex and multi-layered characters who both grow and change somewhat as the book progresses. They are the heart and soul of the book and about as well fleshed out as any characters you are likely to see. The supporting characters, however, are considerably less deep and are more caricatures than anything else. Some are good and kind like Jane and Mr. Bingley, and others are ridiculous and vain like Mrs. Bennet but none are remotely as substantial as Darcy and Elizabeth. So, does this ruin the book? Hardly. These secondary characters offer a wealth of material for the author as she plays them off of Darcy and Elizabeth.This novel is almost certainly the one where Austen best displays her sharp-edged wit both through Elizabeth's dialogue and in the narrative voice describing some of these characters and their actions. If some of them were less ridiculous, the potential for the satire would be weakened considerably. And make no mistake, Pride and Prejudice is as much a satire of the time it was written, as it is a romantic drama. Even today, the prose is quite funny and enjoyable. The Enriched Classics edition is also nice because it includes footnotes explaining some of the language and/or references that were well known at the time but confusing today's readers.In summary, this is a great novel. Admittedly, there were times where I thought a character's behavior was a bit over-the-top but the overall story is so riveting and the book so compelling that I just can't find serious fault with it. Pride and Prejudice is deserving of its reputation and I highly recommend it to Austen fans and newcomers alike."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is probably my favorite classics. I don't devote too much time to reading classics but I've read some good ones before. They are not really my style but I do like the ones I have read. The different style is refreshing.The book is written much differently than books are written these days. I was reading the begining of the book while I was tiered. I realized that I hadn't understood anything I'd read. I had to go and read again when I was completely awake.It was enjoyable. I loved the characters; they were smarter than so many characters in other books and were very well spoken. That may, however, been how most people were in the 19th century.It was fun to watch Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy go on with their love hate relationship. Until the end it was a lot of hate.I thought it was a good classic but having not read many classics I'm not sure how it compares. Better than Wuthering Heights and not as good or as good as Great Expectations.-cdm"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice: a probing study of human nature or just another love story? Jane Austen's novel enables the reader to embark on a journey with moments of laughter, suspense, frustration, and delight. Although Pride and Prejudice may seem like a love story on a superficial level, a deeper look reveals the complex themes of reputation, class, stereotypes, and first impressions.Exploring characters from different walks of life, Jane Austen effectively and passionately develops the personas of her characters, enrapturing the reader. First impressions can be dangerous and the author implies that society must discard preconceived notions and, in turn, explore beyond the surface. Elizabeth Bennett, the novel's protagonist, captivates the reader with her independent, free-spirited, and quick-witted nature. An anomaly of her time, Lizzy refuses to marry solely for status, for love is essential and she will not compromise her values for power and wealth. Her character is refreshing as compared to her marriage-obsessed mother, materialistic and pedantic sisters, and pompous aristocrats. However, no matter how much the reader hates these characters, he or she realizes that Austen has accomplished her goal of exposing these diverse individuals for who they truly are.The development of relationships and the characters themselves also enthrall the reader. First appearing as a pompous snob, Darcy initially repulses the reader, but through the progression of the novel, the reader begins to see Darcy as the kind, generous man that he is. On the other hand, Wickham appears to be the helpless victim of Darcy, but this false impression is quickly erased. Appearance versus reality is a reoccurring theme throughout the novel which forces the reader to resist deception and search for truth.The reader laughs with Mr. Bennett, cringes at Mrs. Bennet, sympathizes with Jane, flinches at the haughty remarks of Caroline Bingley, and wants to knock some sense into immature Lydia. The strength of the story lies in Austen's depiction of love as an element that can surmount class boundaries. Taken through twists and turns, the reader experiences love ignited, love broken, and love rekindled. But is this is a typical love story? Although Pride and Prejudice ends like a typical enchanted love story, Austen's development of the characters, storyline, and her shattering of class shackles enables the reader to acknowledge that the story serves a deeper purpose."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice: a probing study of human nature or just another love story?

It was not only a touching love story, but also an accurate reflection of the Victorian society in that era. The story evolved heavily on the complications among different classes. The pride within each character and prejudice between them further enriched the novel. Some characters, such as Darcy and Lizzie, found themselves fighting among their pride, prejudice and their affections for each other revealed an idea that true love outweighs anything and everything. Each character in the novel contrasted significantly in terms of their characteristics. We can recall these contrasts among the five Bennet sisters, Mr. and Mrs. Bennets, and Darcy and Bingley. Another interesting point revealed by Jane Austen is that characters with similar characteristic attracts. We can see this through the two loving couples, Jane and Bingley, Lizzie and Darcy.These complications and challenges that each character had to struggle within themselves made the novel Pride and Prejudice a great masterpiece."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"In comparison to Tess of the d'Urbervilles, Pride and Prejudice is a refreshing romance comedy which brings to life the humor of 18th century society. Jane Austen's style is so stellar. She leaves nothing unsettled or unhappy. They way each character is tied in with the plot is amazing, from Mr. Collins and charlotte's marriage, which brings Elizabeth to lady Catherine and Darcy, to the Gardeners transaction with Darcy during the chase for Lydia, proving Darcy's love for Elizabeth. Jane is a sweet character and Bingly is her perfect match. Darcy and Elizabeth as well are the epitome of romance. Elizabeth cannot marry anyone she cannot love, and to her, love is someone who she can connect with on all levels. When she and Darcy fight, it should only be taken as a sign of their compatibility because she is not afraid to answer him and he enjoys it. Lydia and Mrs. Bennet are incredibly irritating, however they do add to the satirical style of the novel, as Mrs. bennet's sole desire in life has to do with marriage, her own and her daughters. She and Mr Bennet do not share a true love because he married her for her beauty, and now must learn to live with her stupidity. Lydia as well makes a mistake in who she marries. She is too naive to understand that Wickham had no desire to marry her in the first place. She considers the whole ordeal a game, not realizing the gravity of the situation she has put her family in, ruin and disgrace. Bingly's sisters take on the &quot;wicked step sister&quot; act in trying to keep Bingly from Jane and Elizabeth from Darcy. Charlotte Lucas is an extraordinary character simply because her theories on love are profound and true for the time period. Good book, I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"After reading many excellent, yet somewhat depressing novels, Austen&#8217;s Pride and Prejudice, came as refreshing and uplifting treat. More of a powerful weapon than the extraordinary novel that it is, Austen uses the book to fiercely criticize nineteenth century society and the essence of human nature while still managing to create an extraordinary and captivating plot.Beginning at the novel&#8217;s outset, the reader becomes a puppet at the mercy of Austen&#8217;s ability to evoke any emotions she desires within her readers.By creating a diction and syntax unique to each character Austen holds the reader within her grasp. All of the characters are very different from each other in many aspects; this creates grounds for conflict and essentially propels the plot.Also, each of the characters is somewhat of an extremity of a certain characteristic that most people possess. Mrs. Bennet is the spoiled side of our personalities, Mr. Darcy the proud side, Lydia the irresponsible side, Jane the quiet side, Mary the feminist side, and so on.The novel encompasses main elements from many different genres of books such as romance, humor, adventure, suspense, and tragedy, which make for a very entertaining read. Read it when you are feeling down or worn out, you&#8217;ll find yourself believing that fairytales do come true."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"After reading many excellent, yet somewhat depressing novels, Austen's Pride and Prejudice, came as refreshing and uplifting treat.

Read it when you are feeling down or worn out, you'll find yourself believing that fairytales do come true."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen masterfully weaves an endearing love story, with cosmic irony, and a keen awareness for social distinctions, which took us through a colorful journey of mind, body, and soul. Her humor shines through the biting sarcasm of Mr. Bennet's expected, yet amusing remarks about Mrs. Bennet's &quot;nerves,&quot; and his daughter's suitors, namely Mr. Collins. This unctuous character also provided us with a few laughs by quietly portraying the absurdity of society's emphasis on &quot;connections&quot; with the upper class.Another part of the novel, which we greatly enjoyed, was the blooming romance between Darcy and Elizabeth. Though their union was much anticipated, we were kept on our toes by the many twist and turns it took throughout the novel. At one point, we were greatly disappointed with Darcy's overbearing arrogance when he made it explicitly clear to Elizabeth that it was against his own will to love her. But then we were heart warmed by his kindness to her and the Gardiners at the Pemberley estate, exemplifying his true character.Aside from its humor and romance, this novel also prides itself in its vivid illustrations of class structures of early 19th century England. Austen clearly depicts the importance and influence of the social classes on every aspect of life, predominantly marriage, wealth, education, and values. One scene, which we believed to be a great example of Austen's comprehensive knowledge of the social classes, is when Lady Catherine rudely confronts Elizabeth on Darcy's proposal to marry her, all the while mocking her estate, her family, and her life. Yet, Elizabeth once again proves her superior attitude and strength as an independent woman, and takes Lady Catherine's comments with wisdom and maturity.Truly a classic, Pride and Prejudice exemplifies a sincere love that breaks social boundaries. Throughout its 150 years of publication Pride and Prejudice has remained a cornerstone of the literary world, and we recommend it to everyone. And beware; this book ends with a bang, in more ways than one."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"i absolutely adore this book. i have read it 4 times and i would recommend it to anyone. it has interesting characters, a very complex and engaging plot, and you learn alot about english society during austin's time. jane austin is a very gifted writer. i have also read sense and sensibility and presuasion, both very good books, but pride and prejudice will always be my favorite."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"When i read this book for the first time, i just thought that it was just same as the other love story.But after i read twice and three times, i found that it's obviously different from any other romantic books.It's the only one book for reflect of women's life in society.and i really want to be a character like lizzy:)I think that it's the only book to express feminism."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I loved the book!

I'm not especially surprised, and to the males, don't blame yourselves if you can't penetrate Jane Austen (it is undoubtedly more appealing to the female mind), although I must vouch for P&amp;P and pity those who pass over this excellent novel. The whole charm of the story lies in the high vocabulary which Elizabeth, Jane, Darcy and the rest employ, and the wonderful language creates a rapid succession of wit, romance, and observation on human absurdity, in style. ~~~~ It's hard to understand how people can find this book dull, for the very first chapter rolls out a lively discussion between Mr. and Mrs. Bennet. In my opinion, Pride and Prejudice only gets better as you go on; I admit to once finishing the novel and promptly rereading it one day later. Also to smiling for one week straight, for Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. ~~~~ Please don't come to Jane Austen only to criticize her subject matter-- every author has a style and a realm of experience which make their books unique. If you think the young ladies' endless pursuits of wealthy marriages to be old-fashioned and petty, they are! But Jane Austen crafts the novel with a skill and wit that lets the novel at once both expose how ludicrous that English society was and yet create lively and very human characters you have to love; and therein lies its charm. Pride and Prejudice is a lovely combination of sly humor, exasperation, and romance that make it one of my favorites. I hope it will be one of yours too-- don't give up on Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy before you even know them! And understand Jane Austen for the talented authoress she is, whether you think her settings and period portrayals deplorably dull, pathetically petty, or (I hope!) cleverly charming. ~~~~ I think that most people, when they read P&amp;P, either love it or hate it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is an excellent book!

I found myself in complete suspense to find out if darcy and elizabeth got together. Jane Austen combines 19th century wit with romance to create a book that you just can't put down. Elizabeth Bennet is a heroine that cannot be forgotten; her wit and sense are apparent throughout the whole story. Darcy is a mysteriously romantic character who, despite his cutting remarks, remains irrestistable. The reading itself can be a little uneventful sometimes, but Jane Austen saves it with a sarcastic comment from Mr. Bennet, or a witty remark from Elizabeth.

As the story unfolds, there are twists and turns in the plot as the reader keeps wanting Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy to give up their own pride and prejudices about each other.A wonderful portrait of nineteenth century English society as well as an entertaining satire on Jane Austen's England. A must read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Women in Regency England had few options in life except to marry well. They usually received little, if any, formal education, and their aim was to become \\"accomplished,\\" proficient in the social graces like music, needlework, sketching, whist and &quot;acceptable&quot; literature. Considerable pressure was placed on women to marry in order to obtain financial security, not just for themselves, but also for their immediate family. Love matches were rare. Ms. Austin writes, &quot;It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.\\" So there you have it. The men and women of the Regency period, nobility and emerging middle class alike, were very focused on the business of marriage.Our story opens in the small community of Longbourn, Hertfordshire. Word is out that the empty Netherfield Estate has been leased to a new occupant - a wealthy bachelor. Mothers and daughters suddenly upset their daily routine, and shatter the local tranquility - buying dress material, sewing, embroidering, planning and fantasizing about balls and marriage. Nowhere is there more excitement than at the Bennett home, where five very marriageable daughters anticipate news of their neighbor. The Bennett's have a particular reason for wishing their girls settled. The Bennett estate, Longbourn, is entailed. It can only be inherited by a male successor. Since the Bennett's have no son, their entire estate will go to Mr. Bennett's cousin. The girls must be married well, so they will have a secure home when their father dies. If their mother should outlive her spouse, they will have to provide for her also.There is a ball in honor of John Bingley, the new resident at Netherfield, and for the friends who accompany him. Bingley is very taken with Jane Bennett, the eldest daughter, and a lovely young woman with a sweet disposition. The feelings are reciprocated and the two form an attachment. It is at this ball that Elizabeth Bennett, the family's second daughter, meets Bingley's friend, the aristocratic Fitzwilliam Darcy. Darcy, is much richer than Bingley. He is a handsome, intelligent man, and the Lord of Pemberly, a large, sumptuous estate in Derbyshire. Darcy, however, is the epitome of haughtiness when he arrives on the scene, and looks down his nose at the local yokels. Elizabeth Bennett, is quite different from most young women of the Regency Period. She had been encouraged to use and develop her strong intellect since childhood, and she has become quite literate, and enjoys fine books and literary conversation. She is bright, with a sharp wit, much more independent than her sisters, and very pretty. Darcy is attracted to her immediately, but snubs her unknowingly. She responds in kind, thinking him to be boorish and far too proud. Thus she is prejudiced against him from their first meeting.The novel is filled with Ms. Austin's humor and delightful characters, including: George Wickham, a handsome military officer who further prejudices Elizabeth against Darcy with tales from their mutual past; William Collins, a pompous clergyman, cousin to the Bennets, and probable heir to the family holdings; Charlotte Lucas, a young neighbor and dear friend to Elizabeth and Jane; and Lady Catherine De Bourgh, the quintessential aristocrat. Jane Austen weaves her plots and sub-plots with elegant prose and wit. Her clever use of irony, reveals her characters' charms and flaws. At one point, Mr. Darcy actually insists that Elizabeth is the proud one. It is pure pleasure to read her narrative and dialogue. And the characters are so believable that is difficult to remain disinterested in their lives and foibles.Mr Darcy learns more about Elizabeth with each chapter. He discovers her wit, intelligence and charm. She almost always spurns his awkward attempts to woo her. When she finally admits to herself how much she admires Darcy, he puts his foot in his mouth. He tries to tell Elizabeth of his deep feelings for her. However, he explains that his strong emotions go against his social background. He is prepared to marry someone of lower status, prepared to suffer hostility from his relations, and society in general, in order to be with her. All of this, sounds condescending to Elizabeth, and he infuriates her. It is as if Darcy is doing her a favor by loving her. He also tells her, honestly, that he has sabotaged the relationship between her sister Jane and his friend Bingley, because he fears Jane wants to marry Bungley for his money. So, once again, Elizabeth rejects him because of his pride.If the young couple would be able to understand and let go of their shallow pride and prejudice, a wonderful love and friendship could form and flourish. Elizabeth also exhibits her prejudice against her close friend, Charlotte, when she marries for convenience instead of love.Ms. Austin paints a vivid picture of various relationships, and the marriage mores of Regency England. She portrays the relationships of the senior Bennett's, of Charlotte and her new husband, and of young, frivolous Lydia Bennett who marries at fifteen. Ms. Austin stresses the necessity of compatibility in a marriage, since divorce is almost impossible. She demonstrates the various forms compatibility takes in her characters' relationships.This much beloved Jane Austin novel is one of my favorites. It reads like a dream and is difficult to put down. I can't recommend it highly enough. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"A novel I have read and re-read, and will continue to do so with great gusto - every time, falling hopefulessly in love with the characters all over again. It is by far, my favorite.Published in 1813 and premiered under the title First Impressions, Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" stands as one of the most universally loved and admired novels of English literature. Not only is it a tale of rural romance, but also a witty and shrewdly observed satire of English country life.The story takes place in a remote Hertfordshire village, in George III's England. Mr. Bennett, a country squire of no great means, endeavors to marry off his five vivacious daughters. At the heart of all this all-consuming enterprise are his headstrong second daughter, Elizabeth Bennett and her aristocratic suitor Fitzwilliam Darcy - two lovers whose pride must be humbled and prejudices dissolved before the novel can come to it's splendid conclusion."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Someone once said that a classic work of literature is one which everyone loves to be able to acknowledge having read but which no one actually enjoys reading. To be fair, there is some justification in this sentiment, as many classic novels are not readily accessable to readers not versed in various literary devices, symbolism, and so on. Fortunately, Pride and Prejudice does NOT fall into that category. It is a novel which has an interesting, captivating story that is easily accessible and humorous yet intelligent, insightful and extremely witty--in short, it's a novel which is a joy to read and re-read. It is also my favourite Austen novel.Briefly, for those unfamiliar with the novel, the story concerns Miss Elizabeth Bennet, a spirited, quick-witted and intelligent (not to mention beautiful) young woman from a family of modest means, and the wealthy Mr. Darcy, a handsome but very reserved and indeed proud young man. Darcy falls in love with Elizabeth albeit against his will (for he deems her to be socially inferior and cannot abide her silly mother and sisters). Elizabeth (who displays a quickness to judge others based on appearances and \\"first impressions\\"), however, does not care for the arrogant, proud, ill-mannered Mr. Darcy. It is the tension between these two main characters that comprises the central story and gives it its spark. I won't say any more, for I don't wish to give the story away. Suffice it to say that although it takes place some 200 years ago, it is every bit as relevant today as it was then, for human nature is no different now than it ever was.Now to address the merits of this particular edition. (As reviews unfortunately are posted next to all editions, regardless of the one to which they may apply, the edition to which I refer is the hardcover Modern Library edition with the picture of Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle on the cover). Generally, when one is looking to purchase a hardcover of one of the classics it is because one is looking for an edition that will be a more permanent addition to his or her library--one that looks nice and that can, perhaps, be passed on to future generations. Personally, my first choice for hardcovers of the classics are those published by the Folio Society. Having said that, this edition has a lot to recommend it. Most importantly, it is printed on acid-free paper, so it will last without the pages turning brown (unlike those nice-looking but disappointingly cheap-quality bargain hardcovers one usually finds on the sale table in one's local bookstore).Secondly, the print is beautifully crisp and clear. The print is not as large as one might hope for in a hardcover, but it is a vast improvement over the cheap \\"mass market\\" type paperbacks. Actually, I was surprised to find that it's only minimally smaller than my Easton Press edition, although the lines are further apart in the latter edition (which does make a bit of a difference).As if that's not enough to recommend this edition, it has the added benefit of being housed in a very attractive dust jacket which looks beautiful alongside the BBC/A&E; video collection--the definitive dramatisation of the novel and definitely a must-see. (This edition was initially released as a companion to the video collection).In conclusion, I give 5 stars for the story, and I have no hesitation in giving 5 stars for the Modern Library edition of the novel--it's a lovely edition. Considering the quality, it is very well priced--definitely good value for one's money. And for those who've steered clear of the classics for fear that they must necessarily be dull and incomprehensible, give this novel a try--I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen is a literary genius. Her writing is full of delightful irony and witty dialogue. There are so many things that I love about this book that it is hard to know where to start. You have to love the characters of Elizabeth and Mr. Bennet they both have such a great sense of humor that they keep me laughing the whole way through. Elizabeth is such a feisty and intelligent character, and she is so full of energy and love of life that you cannot help but fall in love with her--I can definitely understand why Mr. Darcy falls in love with her despite her poor connections. I also surprisingly love the character of Mr. William Collins, who is so absurd and stupid that I cannot help but laugh myself silly over the things he does and says. His marriage proposal to Elizabeth is one of my most favorite events in the book. Another classic scene is Lady Catherine deBourgh's confrontation with Elizabeth over Mr. Darcy. She is another rather absurd character, and it is really great that Elizabeth has the tenacity to stand up for herself to that woman. There is only one thing in this book that really depresses me--the fate of Charlotte Lucas. As much as I love to laugh at Mr. Collins I would absolutely hate being married to him. I really feel sorry for Charlotte Lucas despite of the fact that she is able to arrange things so that she spends as little time in his company as possible. Also having to put up with Lady Catherine's constant lecturing and prying must also be hard. Despite this one semi-depressing aspect, this book really is as close to perfection as one can get. Another really good aspect of this book is the fact that in many ways it is a very accurate portrayal of what a woman's life was like in the early nineteenth century."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I particularly love the opening sentence of this novel -- \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\\"Indeed this opening sentence has been claimed as the greatest in English literature. It certainly sums up the central concerns of the main female characters and the tensions of the novel in extremely short order.I wish the same could be said of the closing chapters of the novel, as they are in my opinion one of its major flaws, they tend to drag. The other that always strikes me when I reread this novel is how superior and full of pride seems the novels heroine, Elizabeth Bennet. For indeed the novel is well titled, it is full of characters who display both pride and prejudice.When we first see Darcy, our hero, he is described as a \\"fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien.\\" We also hear he has \\"ten thousand a year\\" -- more than enough to raise the avarice of those that might wish to marry for money. Not enough, however, for Elizabeth who clashes with Darcy who answers his snobbish indifference to her with angry pride.From this point we have a novel that unfolds as Elizabeth and Darcy go through far reaching assessments of themselves and thier social pride and prejudices. Through this they also gain different views of each other, dragging the reader along.Elizabeth Bennet was Austen's favourite of her own heroine's, it is not hard to see why. She is sharp witted, intelligent, reasonable and a thoroughly modern woman. Her attitude to Mr Collins is a perfect example, while he praises her \\"modesty\\" and \\"economy\\" she denies these and at the same time spurns the then middle class ideal of a woman as submissive and domestic. When she tells Lady Catherine that she could certainly marry Darcy as \\"he is a gentleman, and I am a gentleman's daughter\\" she is rejecting her attitude of class through social and family connections.The novel has all of Austen's typical strengths, good characterization, compelling plot, a sharp wit and a wonderful eye for the detail of the life of English rural gentry. This novel and \\"Emma\\" compete as the favourite among readers (I'm an \\"Emma\\" fan myself) while it competes with \\"Mansfield Park:\\" among critics as her best work.When you're deciding which edition to buy I would recommend the &quot;Penguin Classics&quot; edition for Vivien Jones' excellent introduction (which should be read after the novel unless you already know the entire plot from a previous read or a movie.)"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"THIS IS A WONDERFUL LOVE STORY THAT HAS EVER BEEN WRITTEN. JANE AUSTEN SUCCESSFULLY DESCRIBED EACH PERSON'S HUMANITY. THE FIVE SISTERS OF BENNET REALLY PULL OUT A LOT OF INTERESTING SCENES IN THIS BOOK. AFTER READING THIS, I FEEL LOVE CAN REALLY PULL TOGETHER THE DISTANCE BETWEEN EACH PERSON, AND AS LONG AS WE HAVE LOVE IN OUR MIND, THERE IS NO PROBLEM THAT IS UNSOLVABLE. WE SHOULD GO BACK AND READ THIS BOOK EVERY COUPLE YEARS, BECAUSE EACH TIME WE READ, WE WILL HAVE DIFFERENT FEELING. AND THE MORE WE READ, WE WILL DISCOVER MORE NEW MEANINGS FROM THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The book gets 5 stars of course. But the printing of this particular version is TERRIBLE. It's apparently a \\"print on demand\\" book from Tribeca Books. Instead of using real quotation marks and apostrophes, they use inch marks and foot marks. It looks terrible. The margins are tiny and the text is packed onto every page, making the book only 253 long, hard to read pages (when properly set it should be at least 350 pages). Yes to Jane Austen, no to Tribeca Books, who basically are just ripping off a public domain book and typesetting it horribly. I had to walk into a bookstore and buy a different publisher's version of this book it was so annoying. The one I got was only $5 and much easier to read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I remember liking Sense and Sensibility in college, but I struggled through this one a bit. It took me about half the book just to get used to the language, but once I did, it was mildly enjoyable. The Bennet family drove me a little crazy, especially Mrs. Bennet and Lydia. But I loved the evolution of Lizzy's feelings for Darcy and the conclusion of the \\"happily ever after\\" marriages. I don't think I'm up for the challenge of Jane Austen again any time soon, but I'm glad I read this classic."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I've been a fan of Miss Austen from day one; and I firmly believe that she has a bright future ahead of her as a novelist.Don't buy all the \\"critics\\" commentary and praise regarding \\"Persuasion\\" and some of her other works as being superior to P&P.; That's pure contrary-ism at its worst.If you only read two of her books, then read this one twice. And then resolve to read more than two and check out her other novels, because they are great as well.The A&E; miniseries for P&P; is outstanding and comes highly recommended.No, I don't own stock in A&E; but I am over the age of 13... in a few weeks."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (originally titled \\"First Impressions\\") is a witty, smart, sharp, and insightful comedy/romance of the 18th century. The plot, centering around the playful, but sensible, Elizabeth Bennet and the grave, haughty Mr. Darcy is dellightful, as they both learn to overcome their pride, artificial sensibilites, prejudice against eachother, and the economic and social differences of the time. The language is not hard to understand, unless you are completely unnacustomed to good, well-written fiction. The dignified and often unwilling chemistry between the two protaganists is spellbinding, and the humour sharp and astute. The lesser characters provide much of the humour, from sheer stupidity, sarcasm, and blatant ignorance of what is sensible or dignified. This book is for any age (I read it at 12 years old and enjoyed it) and the enjoyment in it increases after several readings. I hightly recommend it as one of the most well-developed, well-written, and amusing books I have ever read.Also, if you like the book, I suggest buying or renting the A&B; mini-series, Pride and Pejudice starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. If you read the book, watch the movie, and read the book again, it is even more enjoyable in my opinion than reading it without having watched the series."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is a wonderful and timeless classic. But be forewarned that it is not a light read. Because it was written in another era, the dialogue takes some getting used to and I found myself re-reading sections to make sure that I fully understood the conversation. In any event, readers will fall in love with the characters, especially Lizzy and Jane, and delight in the many entertaining scenarios."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"What can I say about Pride and Prejudice that hasn't already been said? I read this when I was in junior high and didn't really like it. What was I thinking? It's been my all-time favorite novel for the past ten years or so. Its themes are the basis for hundreds of novels, movies and plays. Just think of how many stories you've read or seen that have the two main characters disliking each other, bickering and finally realizing that they love each other. If you just can't get enough of Pride and Prejudice, I suggest reading Pamela Aidan's series which tells the same story from Darcy's point of view."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The main plot of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" by Jane Austen is about the relationships of people and the misperceptions we sometimes make on them. The main character is Elizabeth Bennet, an outspoken and somewhat modern girl for her time. She resides in the country with her family; her obsessive mother, quiet spoken father, and her four other sisters, her elder and loving Jane, sentimental Mary, and the two flirtatious Kitty and Lydia. When a prosperous man named Mr. Bingley arrives near the Bennets, Mrs. Bennet's first idea is that Jane shall marry Mr. Bingley. At the ball which he first makes his appearance, he brings along his friend Mr. Darcy, a man who is even richer than Mr. Bingley. It is soon discovered that Mr. Darcy has somewhat of a prideful air about him, and after saying an offensive statement about Elizabeth, she is prejudiced against him. The book goes on to show how Elizabeth and Darcy grow closer to each other, from her finding out about his past to him helping her family out when Lydia elopes with an officer in the military. The ending is probably no surprise to anyone, but the way the book progresses is so fascinating that you want to keep reading it to find out how everything will turn out.My personal thoughts on the book are thus; the characters are very involving, as is the plot. The choice of words and dialogue are a bit hard to comprehend, but that's how people spoke in the 18th century. The book is more enjoyable than the movie adaptations I've seen, although the A&E; version was great in my opinion. I think the way Jane Austen was able to capture each character's feelings and actions as she did in the book is so fascinating; mainly because she did that by observing all the people in the countryside she resided in. Personally, my favorite characters so far are Darcy and Elizabeth, the latter being a close second. I just feel I relate to both of them well in the way that I speak my mind and am misunderstood at times. I believe people interested in the behaviours and relationships of people during a certain time period would best like this book. Compared to books written today, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is totally different. It has small humour, an interesting plot with many sub-plots, and great characters where there is a type assured for anyone."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have read this famous Jane Austen's classic when I was a kid. I remembered I loved it so much and it remained as my favorite for a long time. This second time is even better! Can't say enough how I enjoyed reading it. The conversations between characters are so vivid, and the stoy flows so smoothly on. It was such a pleasant journey and I can't stop reading until I finished."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I must say I am not overly taken to reading romantic novels but I made an exception in this case.It was singularly refreshing to read about a female heroine, especially one as well developed as Elizabeth, written at a time when women were seen as nothing more than a means to wealth or progeny through the institution of marriage.We see in this novel the undercurrents of societal bias and the expectations put on women to marry in light of their limited role in society at the time. The novel comments on a wide variety of marital arrangements ranging from those of pure convenience to those based on love each with amusing consequences.In reading this one is rewarded with a wide variety of well developed characters written by an author who has an eerie command of the english language.I was so impressed with the attention to detail and psychological commentary ( hence the title pride and prejudice ) that I have resolved to read the other 5 novels written by Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"When I opened up my copy of Pride and Prejudice, I didn't know what to expect. I had heard from my friend that it was good, but I really didn't trust her taste. I am forever thankful to her.Elizabeth Bennet, a young woman in a middle class society, and her sisters must marry in order to be guaranteed a comfortable life. When Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy (two upper class men) come into town, Mrs. Bennet is determined to make the men fall in love with her daughters. This leads to conflict, etc (sorry I don't want to give away too much!)I think the main reason why I love this book is that it is difficult to put down. Austen's witty characters bring to Merrytown, never knowing what is going to happen next. This book was, \\"Impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know\\"(59)."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The Bennet family has five unmarried daughters and when Charles Bingley, a rich bachelor, arrives at nearby Netherfield, Mrs. Bennet sets her sights on him as a prize catch. At a ball at Meryton everyone agrees they like the openhearted Mr. Bingley, who has developed an affection for the Bennet's oldest daughter, Jane, but they find his friend Fitzwilliam Darcy to be an arrogant and disdainful fellow. For their part, Mr. Darcy and Bingley's sisters are repelled by the Bennet's lower status and the embarrassing Mrs. Bennet. At the ball, Elizabeth Bennet, the second oldest daughter, overhears Darcy the man say she is not handsome enough to prove a temptation to him. However, when Jane becomes ill on a visit to Netherfield, Lizzy arrives to nurse her sister. Mr. Darcy is impressed with her lively mind, but cannot see himself falling in love with someone from a poorer family.The Bennet's estate at Longbourn is entailed to Mr. Collins, a clergyman who is Mr. Bennet's nearest male relative. In search of a bride, Collins arrives to consider the Bennet daughters while prattling on about his patron, Lady Catherine de Bourgh. Meanwhile, Elizabeth becomes infatuated with George Wickham, a handsome and charming militia officer, who has apparently suffered great personal wrong at the hands of Mr. Darcy. Elizabeth now considers Darcy to be not only proud, but cruel, and she is only to happy to have her own prejudice against him confirmed by Wickham. Bingley is removed to London, where his sisters and Darcy can keep him away from a heartbroken Jane and when Elizabeth refuses Mr. Collins's proposal of marriage, he is accepted by Charlotte Lucas, Elizabeth's best friend, who sees it as a calculated move of social advancement. Even more shocking, Elizabeth receives a second proposal from Mr. Darcy, who speaks disdainfully of her family and ruefully admits he has been unable to conquer his imprudent affection for her. Of course, Elizabeth rejects this insulting proposal as well. But then she begins to learns things that call Wickham's character into serious question, and have her rethinking her low opinion of Mr. Darcy.&quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is probably the most popular of Jane Austen's novels, with its emphasis on character and her comic look at the human condition where considerations of class are ultimately no match for true love and a temperant meeting of similar minds. Certainly we can point to more important novels in the history of Western Literature, but we would be hard pressed to find as important a novelist as Jane Austen, with her rejection of the tenets of Romanticism. Whereas the romantics celebrated the power of emotions, Austen's work embodies a strong belief in rational thinking, which finds no better embodiment than in the character of Elizabeth Bennet. The selection of this as the one Jane Austen novel to read if for some silly reason you decide only to read one in your entire life would be justified on that character more than the plot line."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This will certainly be a classic forever. In this book, she proves how well she can manage a story almost entirely on pure dialogue, for she isnt that very descriptive about her characters or the places they inhabit- she sticks to the basics- but wonderfully constructs all the dialogues throughout the story. Not only are the dialogues very well elaborated and the ones that keep you reading, but in them she very subtly gives a critique about society - reflecting, most probably, her own opinions about her own time and the way society worked. A good critique of her own era.And what to mention of the story itself!!! The dislike between Darcy and Elizabeth , Jane's impossible love for Bingley, Bingley's horrid sisters... she keeps you turning page after page!In any angle that you analyse it, you'll find it to be an excellent book!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is the first novel of Jane Austen that I've read, and I began here because it is such an often quoted novel....and I wasn't disappointed. Granted, I am forty years old....most begin reading JA when they are girls, but I am happy to say that my advanced age did not spoil my enjoyment of the novel.Jane Austen is a superb storyteller with a wonderful sense of humor and insight into the social conventions of her era and the timeless and often humorous relations between men and women.By the time I finished the last page and saw Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy happily married, I sighed and then immediately picked up another Jane Austen novel to read....and intend to continue doing so until I've read all of her novels and hopefully the biography by Carol Shields.Other reviewers will tell you more about the plot....I want to convey the enjoyment you will recieve by reading Jane Austen. Yes there are happy endings....but there is also a lively social satire, conveyed through dialogue and narration, and writing that is beautifully crafted into plots that keep you turning the pages. So start with Pride and Prejudice....and begin a life-long love affair with a great author."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is my favorite Jane Austen novel and I have read it many times. The main flaw in this reading is that it was too hurried. There was barely a pause between chapters and the quick speech did not do justice to all of the characters. I found the reader's voice to be as little high pitched and a little mannered, even for Austen. Flaws aside, I still got enjoyment from this reading. The speed became less distracting as I became used to it and there were some fine readings of exchanges between Elizabeth and Darcy. Bottom line: not up to the standard that Pride and Prejudice deserves."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I won't presume to review Austen, so this review covers the quality of the Penguin release. Many of us have discovered that the \\"free\\" ebooks on Gutenburg and other sites frequently have such poor formatting that they are irritating to read. One can either re-edit the book to fix the problems, or just live with them and have an inferior and annoying reading experience.Penguin's P&P; is the closest ebook equivalent to the joy of reading a quality physical book--the text is perfectly formatted for the Kindle, it's been proofed, and the supplemental material is almost overwhelming. Detailed intros, useful hyperlinking and a wealth of information on Austen's times, including fashion, furniture, and food and drink, are included. It's truly an immersive experience.I believe this book will be seen as a turning point for ebooks: the point at which editorial and publishing quality became a significant purchase criterion. Early ebook adopters (myself included) were willing to spend hours cleaning up Gutenburg editions and formatting them for the device du jour. No longer. The ebook is moving past the early adopter stage and is making inroads into a market that expects quality editing, publishing, and supplemental materials. I'll definitely pay a reasonable amount for an ebook that I can just start reading, instead of tinkering with, and that provides a comfortable feeling of having gotten one's money's worth.Penguin has set the bar for ebook quality with this release. I urge anyone with a Kindle to get a copy--*this* is the ebook experience we've been wanting."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This particular book is delightfully illustrated. I have three P&P books and this is the most treasured of all. Not only the novel itself is wonderful to read, but also the illustrations are beautiful to look at.

You will agree when you open this book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I first watched the movie, never took any eager interest in british literature or period movies before. This movie just inspired me and I just had to buy Pride and Prejudice in this cover because I fell in love with Matthew Macfadyen as Mr.Darcy and Keira Knightley as Miss Elizabeth Bennett. The book like any other publisher of Pride and Prejudice, they have the same contents although this book have some explanations at the back for words like \\"chaise and four\\" and etc. for people that never read books like this before. I love it so much so now I'm hunting for all Jane Austens' books and movies!!!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Okay, I admit it: I read Pride and Prejudice in high school and didn't like it. However, age and the wisdom that comes with it helped me to realize that my dislike of the book probably had more to do with my dislike of my then-teacher, who had the ability to make even the greatest literary masterpiece seem dry and dull. In recent years, I've read most of Jane Austen's other novels and have enjoyed them immensely, and so I have finally worked my way back to Pride and Prejudice.The story is familiar to most: it centers around the five young Bennett sisters, who range in age from their mid-teens to early twenties, making them quite ripe for marriage (at least according to their mother). And then there are the men, for as the novel's opening line notes: \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\\" Such a man, Mr. Bingley, buys a house close to the Bennett family, and initially, he seems fated to marry the oldest, loveliest Bennett girl, Jane. Bingley is accompanied by his haughty friend, Mr. Darcy, who, while possessing an even greater fortune, quickly earns the dislike of all those he meets, particularly Elizabeth, the strong-minded second Bennett daughter. And from the pride held by each of the four principle characters described above (but namely Darcy and Elizabeth), Austen derives her prejudice.In many ways, Pride and Prejudice reads like a modern-day romantic comedy, complete with misunderstandings and mishaps. Similarly, the embarrassment which Jane and Elizabeth suffer at the hands of their mother and younger sisters would make them perfect candidates for today's reality TV. But of course, Austen's writing contains a level of wit and subtlety rarely found in any contemporary form of entertainment, making this novel is a true classic-a rare gem that still shines brightly to this day."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason. While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\\").It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love. An absolute must-read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I had to read \\"Emma\\" for my high school sophomore English class and was pretty much the only one who enjoyed it at all. Recently, free this summer from required reading, I decided to try \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". The first few chapters are slow and a bit dry, but the action soon picks up pace (as action and Austen go). Austen's characters are brilliantly drawn and her observations in situations are astute. The reader has the advantage of being the most nearly omniscient observer and knows throughout the book what the ending will be but still agonizes over the process of it happening. Some readers like me may be slightly annoyed that (like \\"Emma\\") the happiness of the characters hinges on love and marriage and nothing else, but in the end you'll be so swept up in the story that nothing else matters but the happy ending."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Wow! What else do you say after you read such an incredible book? Jane Austen's timeless characters like Elizabeth Bennett, Mr. Darcy, Miss Bingley(oh, don't you just love to hate her), Jane, etc. all add to this intricately woven plot. Elizabeth Bennett is arguably one of the most complex characters ever written (well, Lucy Snowe of Villette wins the prize). This novel is an excellent example of Austen's literary power. Her heroines are to be admired for they all dared to marry for love and not for social status which so often happened to women in their predicament back then. You will laugh, you will cry, you will be angry, and above all, you will fall in love with Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. However, don't stop after Pride and Prejudice; read Sense and Sensibility, read Emma, read them all. (It won't take long; she only wrote six- I was disappointed that there weren't more) Jane Austen's work is incredible; the only fault I find is that she has so many characters, it is difficult to keep up with them all. Pride and Prejudice has to be read at least twice to catch everything and everybody. But it won't be a chore to read it again, more like opening a treasure chest."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"No need to review the book itself. What I want to address are the hyper linked notes and footnotes.One of the big criticisms of other books on the Kindle is that it was very hard to access notes and footnotes. It was so much trouble, that most people did not even bother.Penguin has figured it out! They have hyperlinked the notes and the footnotes, so that you can get right to them with your Kindle scroll wheel, and not lose your place in the book.More publishers need to do the same!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I feel sorry for the young person who thought this book was boring. What a shame that you can't relax and stop thinking about yourself long enough to take the time to revel in one of the greatest works in English literature.The plot is timeless, and I can guarantee that many of the characters will resemble people you know. Yes, the dialogue may be difficult to follow at first but, after a while, &quot;listening&quot; to it becomes almost second nature.I first read this book when I was 11 or 12, and have read it at least 10 or 15 times since, including at least twice for school. In fact, I chose to read it again just so I could write a paper on it.Buy this book, sit down and lose yourself in Jane Austen's world. Then try Persuasion, Emma or Sense &amp; Sensibility (I'm afraid I can't recommend Mansfield Park very highly). If you have any trace of imagination, you will be hooked.Please, do yourselves a favor and read the book before seeing any of the adaptations. Each has its advantages, but the recent BBC/A&amp;E version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle is a sight to behold. The Garvie/Rintoul version is also good, but not quite as beautiful to watch. It pains me to say this, but the Greer Garson/Laurence Olivier version is far and away the weakest."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I enjoy Jane Austen as an author and I have always favored Pride and Prejudice. The digital version on Kindle has a lot of capitalized words that were not written that way and, with today's technology, it does appear to be shouting. Some of the words are missing half of the letters and one can only guess at what the word should be. The overall story remains one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is my favorite book of all time. When I read Pride and Prejudice (at least once a year) it takes me to a time that I wish I could visit. The rich characters seem like true friends, and nothing would give me greater pleasure than to spend an evening with The Darcy's."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Nothing short of excellent. This book appears on most top 100 books of all times lists. It can be found on the internet in several eBook formats for free (including on the Adobe Digital Library format). A compelling story and a must read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This was a Christmas gift for my oldest granddaughter. I was very pleased with the item and the shipping. She was delighted to receive the book. I will shop for anything I am wanting to purchase first at Amazon."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I needed a version of Pride and Prejudice for school -- ample margin room for notes, sturdy binding, just-right size, cheap price. This was it. If you want to buy a new version of this classic book, I'd highly recommend this."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice, Jane's most well known work and for good reason. This book is a must read classic. It is a light hearted humorous novel that tells the story of how two people, Mr. Darcy, a conceited man of a much wealth, and Elizabeth Bennet whose family has no wealth to brag of and insignificant connections, fall in love once they each cast their prejudices and pride. This book overall was very much enjoyable from my standpoint."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I'm so glad I finally took the time to read this classic. I thought the language and different spellings (staid instead of stayed, for example) would be a hindrance at first, but I soon became so accustomed to the rhythm of it that it became a part of the story's charm. I thought the slower pace would be a turn-off, but I was surprised at how much I enjoyed discovering the nuances of the relationships even more this way. I'm looking forward to reading more of Austen's gems, as well as other classics."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is my first experience reading one of Jane Austen's stories. I am only 1/3 of the way through, but am a huge fan already. Cannot wait to get back to the story. I have viewed dramatized versions of the author's stories on PBS and always loved them. I feel like I found a treasure chest full of gold! Thank you Amazon for the free Kindle downloads."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Each time my daughter and I read this novel, we discover more evidence of what an exquisite blend of entertainment and precision it is. Austen simultaneously captivates the casual reader with a page-turner, while amazing the serious reader with her knack for meticulously echoing earlier details when elaboorating on them in later pages."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is a lovely story. All of Mrs. Austen's books are great classics. I didn't find anything wrong with the format or TOC. Easy to follow."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I don't know how it came about that - after avoiding it in high school and watching two movie versions of it - I found myself reading PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. I didn't think that the book would be able to much surprise me. But, my goodness, this book is one of the most delightful, compellingly readable pieces of fiction I have ever found. And, oddly enough, knowing the story through the movies made the surprises that the book has to offer all the more valuable.The language Austen uses is fantastic. The book is charming and very funny. The characters are all fully developed and funny, from the annoying Mrs. Bennet to the startling, judgmental Mr. Collins. And the romance is wonderful.Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy are great characters, and I'm glad to finally be acquainted with them in their original form."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I read the adapted version of this novel for children as a kid and I loved it. However, reading the original novel was difficult since I was used to the simple words for the children's one. I even avoided reading it for quite a while until I picked it up again a few days ago. Now I can't seem to put it down. I'm also planning to read Jane Austen's other novels as well."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I admit that when I first heard this story, I was confused by the fast pace. I watch the old movie before reading the book, so I knew what was going to happen. I heard it over again and enjoyed it a lot. Since then I've listened to it many many times. Though the reader is fast paced, I like her different voices for each character.This book is about a 20-year-old woman named Eliza. She lives with her 1 older sister and 3 younger sisters and mother and father in a small village. A new arrival comes to the town. A man named Bingley. He brings his friend Mr. Darcy and his sisters Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley. Eliza's older sister Jane admires Mr. Bingley. But Eliza finds Mr. Darcy a very proud and rude man. She meets another man who catches her fancy.I recommend not reading this book once or twice, but a lot. Then you can really get the feel for what Jane Austen was writing. For me it was a lot more interesting in a fast pace listening then a slow read of the book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's novels have a recurring theme of love and marriage and forever invoke the absurdly beautiful art of humour and irony to fabricate a mesh of interwoven ideas tied by that central idea. Detractors of this late 17th. century and early 18th. century novelist have repeatedly pointed at her unimaginative superficiality and her meek satisfaction to restrain her works on the fringes of the social chaos. Indeed austen never ventures deep into the society's demeanours but it's this contraint of her to resolve to poke fun at the society and the people who live in it by employing the canny and subtle instrument of satire sharpened by sly humour that makes Austen such a popular and hugely succesful novelist as she is. Nowhere is this attribute so vehemently explicit as in \\"Pride and Prejudice\\",regarded by many as the most accomplished work in English literature for its fairy-tale gratifications as well as for its replete involvement of humour.Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" revolves around,as the title itself sugests,the pride of a person and the prejudice of another,both so bizzarely related and paradoxically driving these two persons away from each other. But the \\"first impressions\\" that the general reader gets is only a figment of the authoress's array of ideas conjugated into a rare commodity of literature that both thrills and provokes broodings,and beyond it everything must remain a surprise. Elizabeth Bennet and Mr.Fitzwilliam Darcy are the principle characters of the novel and it's the pride of the latter that actually raiss the prejudice of the former that lents the story an excuse to stretch on as long as it does. \\"Pride and PRejudice\\" is the tale of the gradual stripping down of the prejudice simulataneous with the quiescent passing away of the pride in a quid pro quo style.The Bennets are a family of seven unique members living in the Hertfordshire village of Longbourn and from the very inception it's clear that the book is going to be a light read and a hilarious one at that. Mrs.Bennet,\\"a woman of mean understandind,little information,and uncertain temper\\" whose \\"buisness of life was to get her daughters married\\" is a constant source of laughter in the book,her husband Mr.Bennet,\\"so odd a mixture of quick parts,sarcastic humour,reserve,and caprice\\",is a man deliberately detached from the fetters of responsibility that marriage and fatherhood unfailingly brings and their five daughters are all so invariably different. The eldest,Jane,is a beautiful,placid,unassuming,innocent and believe-good-in-everything girl,Elizabeth is beautiful too and with a certain charm of intelligence and elegance of wit,Lydia and Catherine both are consumed in their false notions of love and marriage and Mary is a book-worm possessing the slightest touch of a philosopher. The story begins when a rich bachelor,a wanteed catch in the authoress's era,Mr.Charles Bingley rents a house near Longbourn. Mrs.bennet is despearate to get one of her daughters married to him and part of her wish does come true indeed when Jane and Mr.Bingley fall in love with each other. But the fairy-tale symphony stops abruptly here and under the influence of his sisters and friend Mr.Darcy---a man who likes to maintain an air of pride and aristrocracy about him and draws a line between him and others---Mr.Bingley returns to London. Of course there's the whisper of a tagedy in this sequence which is easily subdued in the vociferous humourous actions of Mr.Collins,to whom the Bennets's Longbourn estate is entailed. It's his arrival which brings forth the nature of most of the characters. Mrs.Bennet gets a scope to exhibit her want of intelligence,Mr.Bennet is openly satiric and mocking,Elizabeth is cynical though not without reason and Jane is at her inocent best. Mr.Collins proposes Elizabeth,gets rejected and goes on to marry Charlotte Lucas,doughter of the Bennets's neighbour Sir William Lucas. This is one marriage that occurs without even an iota of harmony or intelligence but has all elements of illusory marriage done in haste and without forbrooding.There's a furthur twist in the tale as Darcy conveys Elizabeth his love for her much against his \\"better judgement\\" and gets rejected. Inevitably. And from this conjuction onwards,the principle theme of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" gets its proper shape and dimension. One by one the pieces of rags of prejudice war off Elizabeth and she realises the true character of Wickham who elopes with Lydia and comprehends the man of noble character in Darcy undrneath the layer of abstract ego. Simulataneously Darcy rejects the scepticism his gentryclass has cursed him with and emerges from being \\"the most disagreeable man in the world\\" to a man with \\"no improper pride\\". The metamorphoses in both Elizabeth and Darcy are not sudden or abrupt but gradual yet stunning and reveal the genius of the script-writer to compose a novel of characters in an overtone of irony and delicate humour.In all there're four marriages accomplished in the book and all are vastly different. So a happy-ever-after ending? Yes,but at the same time not without patches of apprehension. In a fine symmetrical plot lacking a concrete stucture and a specific ambition with no specific slots of a 'hero' as such,Jane Austen has managed to portary a variety of characters segmented into different natures. The opening sentence of te novel(\\"It is a truth univerally acknowledge,that a single man in possession of a good fortune,must be in want of a wife\\".) is an ironical statement---perhaps the sharpest in the book---that has descended down the ages to be renowned as one of the better opening lines of any novel. This irony is come to realised in the first chapter itself as we discern that it's not the man who runs after the woman but just the opposite. \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is scattered wit several other ironies that provide food for the subsistence of the plot. Jane Austen also hints at the grotesque pride and egomania sustained by the gentry folk and at the same instant doesn't leave the intellectually deprived petty mentality and confined ambitions of the commonfolk out of her domain of satire. In a world of two differebt parts,Elizabeth and Darcy are the sole strings that hold them together. The regal coupling of narration and dialogue exalt the quality of the novel even higher,though being marked mainly from the perspective of Elizabeth in spite of invoking an omniscient narrator the storyline does lose some gloss. But even so,in a world of imperfection and preposterous false ideas and beliefs,Jane Austen's this remarkable work of literature hints at the chimera of a fairytale translating itself into reality,or be it a hollow reality. All the characters are superbly drawn and in them as wel as in the sequence of all those marvellous events,the reader would decipher his own self and actions from his own life and surroundings. And for that he must be grateful to a writer of excellent wit and humour."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"You will find Jane Austen in high school classrooms, as inspiration for contemporary movies and fiction (Clueless, Bridget Jones' Diary), and at a book club or two. Otherwise, she is not part of us: Her laser-eyes, scathing commentary about society, and merciless fun at the expense of over-the-top piety are missing. In our current Press-Release era, where ads blanket our cities, and celebrities alter their image every other week, Jane would have a field day-- her observations would have been invaluable, her sharp humor liberating.\\"Pride and Prejudice\\"-- the story of independent-minded Elizabeth Bennet's journey to a happy marriage and her rousing rebellion against the stultifying and stale social system of 19th-Century England-- is an adrenaline-rush of a book.As Elizabeth battles the defenders of society (her marriage-obsessed mother, a condescending suitor, and several members of the \\"upper-class\\" trying to stem her promising relationship with the affluent and handsome Mr. Darcy) we sample a world where family, money, and class dictate your friends and suitors.When Elizabeth and Darcy move to his stunning home, they leave the hostility of an uncaring society behind. Through rebellion and stubbornness, they have found Eden."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"For anyone who has ever thought, &quot;I really should read the classics,&quot; 'Pride and Prejudice' is a wonderful place to begin. Why? First, the work is very readable, even though it was written well over a hundred years ago. Second, it's not too long and the chapters are very short. (I hope I'm beginning to convince you...) Third, maybe you'll see yourself in the book or someone you know. Fourth, Austen takes a humorous, entertaining, and throught-provoking look at human nature, which has not changed and probably never will.Austen's heroine, Elizabeth Bennett, is a bright, intelligent young lady who is delighted to see her older sister Jane meet and fall for an English gentleman. At the same time that her sister meets someone, Elizabeth meets a brash, arrogant man named Darcy. Darcy's manner quickly irritates and disgusts Elizabeth beyond belief. There's no way this couple could ever get together, right? :)Austen does a masterful job of telling an intelligent story that works as social commentary, a study of human nature, class distinctions, and so much more. So many subtle shades of human pride, prejudice, arrogance, condescension, and forgiveness are present in the book as they are in real life."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is my favourite book in the world!! This is a story that is full of humour, class conflict, family expectations, dancing, irony and of course, romance.I have read &quot;Pride and Prejuduce&quot; several times and it is still thrilling, waiting to see proud Darcy snub and then fall for the prejudice Lizzy, who is far from willing to give him a chance. However, they both must realise that things are not always as they appear to be.Lizzy's father, Mr Bennett, is absolutely hilarious and is so full of sarcasm and irony that he is one of the funniest characters of Austen's books. Mrs Bennett is also very funny as a hypochondriac whose husband spends most of his time in his library to get away from her! Lizzy herself has a great sense of humour and sometimes uses it to tease Darcy. I have to agree with Jane Austen, as her favourite character of her books is Miss Elizabeth Bennett.This is a book that can be read time and time again. Once you get used to the language, it becomes easier to read and hard to put down. If you ever get a chance to watch the BBC TV series box set, allow yourself lots of time as you will not be able to stop watching it... and it's 6 hours long!!This is the best story that Jane Austen wrote in her lifetime and is still fantastic after 200 years."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Every once in a while, read something which you would normally not read. Pick up something in a genre you rarely explore. Sometimes, you will be absolutely delighted.Recently, I did just that. I picked up a copy of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; -- and thoroughly enjoyed it! (Far more than I thought that I would!) Until this point, my only real exposure to Jane Austen was with the movie &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;.While (as the reader could probably assume) this form of English literature does not represent a genre I typically frequent, I'm certainly not sorry I spent the time. Austen's writing is laced with dry and subtle humor, applied with the spirit of a very generous nature. She also had the gift of being able to very perceptively observe the people around her, and those with whom she came into contact.I highly recommend this tale of young love and happy endings to any and all who need a break from the stress and fuss of the 21st century."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Humphrey Bogart's line to his secretary in &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; could as easily have been addressed to Jane Austen. Long before the woman's movement of the 60s and women's studies courses of the 70s, perceptive and discriminating readers were in agreement about Jane Austen as the supreme master of her craft. In her characterizations, plotting, and language she is the model of exactness and efficiency. There simply is no gratuitous business, no room for sentiment, no place for self-indulgence or personal fantasy. Elizabeth's world is a microcosm of the complex society we habit, each of us making daily compromises, negotiations, and decisions that allow us the maximum degree of self-expression within the limitations of our social communities and of the human condition itself. The rewards of identifying with Austen's heroines are as accessible and satisfying to male as to female readers. Above all, Austens' novels are tributes to the power of language--to create plausible worlds, to capture the meanings of the heart, and to construct the rhetoric of the &quot;self.&quot; Where lesser writers require battles and orgies to get a rise out of readers, Austen can elicit profound emotions from the most stoic readers through the description of a raised eyebrow."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Being the literary classic that it is, you can purchase Pride &amp; Prejudice in a variety of shapes, sizes, and prices. No matter which one you chose it's still the perfect love story of Elizabeth Bennet (who every woman wants to be) and Mr. Darcy (easily the sexiest literary character of all time), witty and entertaining as well as significant in its portrayal of femininity and other issues of the period in which it was written. It may be just as good a story in the cheapest edition as in the most expensive, but shelling out a couple extra dollars may get you more for your money.If you're reading for a class or for independent study, you can't go wrong (for this book or any other) with the Norton Critical Edition. Includes not only the original text and info about the author, but critical articles studying the novel from several different perspectives. This edition could easily save you a trip to the library to find those secondary sources you'll need for your research paper.If you're just reading for pleasure or think the Norton Critical Edition is a little pricey, your best bet is Penguin Classics. It's a well-edited version that's appropriate for scholarly study, but it also offers those little extras that make pleasure reading all the more pleasurable: endnotes that will help you differentiate a post-chaise from a barouche and an well-written and interesting introduction that looks at both influences on Austen's writing and Pride and Prejudice as a classic romance (scholarly enough to get you thinking, but not so much that it's boring or difficult to understand). In my opinion the Penguin Classics edition is definitely the best bet for your money."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I sent my niece this book as a primer for the Jane Austen world. It is easy to read and understand, with a great type face. I recommened it for readers eager to immerse themselves in a simpler yet more complex time."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I've read Pride and Prejudice nearly every year for a decade and I have to say the Penguin Classics new clothbound edition is the best read I've had yet! The look and feel of the book is beautiful. It's an extremely gratifying read, a delight for the senses, and the appendix is a wonderful essay by Tony Tanner, the original Penguin Classics edition's introduction. While it is lengthy, it actually doesn't get tedious at all and is highly informative and insightful. The new introduction, while I haven't read it fully yet, I believe will prove to be equally revealing. The notes are well-balanced, neither vague nor overwhelming- I've looked at annotated versions of Pride and Prejudice that sucked all the joy out of the story with notes that covered half of each page! Anyway, this edition is absolutely delightful, and I can't wait to purchase Wuthering Heights and Sense and Sensibility in the same edition, and possibly more."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"A treasure of a read. I certainly had some negative precognitions regarding this book but slowly these were eroded as were Elizabeth's sentiments and towards the end I was happy with the characters."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I re-read this book, at least once a year! i just love how Jane Austin gave true strength and a mind to women in an era where we believed to only be good to have children, she made us so much more. I truly enjoy Elizabeth and Mr.Darcy go in circles about each other, as well as the the girls mother uncanny view on life. A great classic to read over and over."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Really enjoyed reading P&P by Jane Austen. The dialogue was relatively easy to follow except for the occasional English coloquialisms and the characters were superbly fleshed out. Her social commentary regarding gender roles was definitely ahead of its time. Did find some text discrepancies/typos(they could have occured during the download, I'm not really sure?)but most enjoyable reading nevertheless. Am planning to read more of the classics."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I didn't remember reading this in school so I thought I'd give a try.

Definitely a great addition to the bookshelf :)"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Anyone who has read Jane Austen before knows that she's a fantastic author. She makes the words \\"good book\\" into flesh and blood. This is prime Jane Austen, complete with dry humor and convoluted relationships. The book itself is ok. I bought it from Amazon because I was close to the $25 free shipping rate. But a used Pride and Prejudice anywhere would be fine, as the gems are inside the book, and reading them is the whole point."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have read Pride and Prejudice several times. I think that this is most definitely one of the best novels written in the English language. Jane Austen explores the relationships between different sets of people. At the age of 16, I was never really into the \\"Classic novels\\", but when a friend recommended the book, and I saw the movie (which does not do the novel justice), I decided to try. I instantly fell in love with the characters and Jane Austen's works. Elizabeth Bennet is truly an inspiring character as the story is told through her, and her interaction with other characters clearly shows Jane Austen's view on all kinds of love.

It is a brilliant novel from the pen of Jane Austen, and therefore should be read be every intelligent person. I already had a copy or two of the book, as well as countless film versions, but I needed a large print edition since I'm now old. And it's nice to be able to read the book without my glasses again.

When I was younger I found her books to be too sugary for my taste but now I find her work to be very enjoyable. Perhaps it comes with age :-). It's a great love story to read on a stormy night in front of the fire. Wonderful character development. If one prefers more angst I'd recommend something like Rememberance of Things Past :-)."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"All of Jane Austen's writings are exceptional but Pride and Prejudice has always been my favorite.

Now one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I read this book in high school and enjoyed is somewhat. Recently I read it again and was far more impressed. It gives a great description of the period (19th century) and Austen's character development is wonderful. There are many lines often quoted today and many miss out because they never read the book. Her humor is subtle but witty. It's doesn't have the action of many books today but it is relaxing reading.The Kindle version of the book is good. It is clear and easy to read with good navigation (for a Kindle)."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Such a great read. The book and movie are both amazing. I would recommend for anyone to read this book. Jane Austen was an amazing writer."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is a classic, a favorite among my family and peers and a story that never gets old. In a time when being proper was taught, and social standing was what you were born into somehow true love sometimes prevails. Jane Austen, although never married, can write with the soul of a true romantic. She uses wit and twists on what was considered &#34;normal&#34; in her time period and made a masterpiece that lives on through the ages.This is a love story about a girl named Elizabeth Bennet, who lives in a less than grand social stature with her sisters, her father, and her outspoken mother. She is witty, lovable and in a word headstrong. Although she does not realize it, the love of her life, Mr. Darcy is fighting with his own sense of propriety and moral guidelines to put a halt to the love he feels for this young woman.Engaging, with characters you love and in some cases cannot help but love to hate bring together a truly remarkable novel that will be hard to put down,"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"who doesn't love this book?

An history to put in your heart and in your life. Fantastic."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This was my third or fourth reading of P&P--every; five or six years I have to go back to it to become reacquainted with Darcy, Lizzie, Lady Catherine and of course Mr. Collins and Mrs. Bennett. They all hold up beautifully: gloriously pompous, spectacularly arrogant, continually conniving and of course proud and prejudiced. There is so much to enjoy: language, wit, style and plot all converge to create, to my way of thinking, the best novel of the 19th century.Academicians all seem to prefer Emma, some folks like Sense and Sensibility more. But for me, P&P; is a cut above. Call it what you will--a comic novel, a novel of manners--there is such energy and joy in Austen's humor and wit. Never censorious, even the most pompous and disagreeable have a reason for being--not really harmful, they just move the plot along to its terrific denouement.If it has been awhile since you have read it, give it another read. Not only will you not be disappointed--I think you will be continually amazed that two hundred years later, Pride and Prejudice still works its magic."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I absolutely loved this book!! Personally I am very picky about books. And in order to get on my favorites list it has to be exeptional. And trust me this book definatly was!! The story is told from the point of Elizabeth, who is the second oldest daughter of the Bennet family. She shows awsome analytical skills, but as the story continues you realize that there has been a prejudice made in the story. And you also realize how you, yourself got outsmarted &amp; realize you made a huge prejudice too. This story is happening in a setting of old England. Whith balls, &amp; horse drawn carriges &amp; the ladies only wear dresses. It is a wonderful story of romance &amp; life in general. But always very entertaining. I recommend this book to everyone!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"And the Penguin editions are always the nicest!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice takes place in a small village called Hertfordshire, around the late 18th century. The story is based on the Bennet family, which consists of a mother, a father, and five daughters. Mr. Bennet is a country squire who is not very wealthy. Mrs. Bennet is a house wife and her goal throughout the book is to marry her daughters off to wealthy gentlemen. The main plot of the story is molded around Jane Bennet and Elizabeth Bennet finding their husbands, through both 'trials and tribulations.' Jane marries the wealthy Mr. Bingley, and Elizabeth marries the handsome and wealthy Mr. Darcy.Jane Austin did a wonderful job of writing Pride and Prejudice. She wrote so that you could feel the love that Jane was feeling, and you could feel the hate that Elizabeth felt. She also wrote descriptively so you could imagine the storm that Jane went through, and you could see the gorgeous house that Mr. Bingley lived in. Whenever I read this book I wished I had admirers like Mr. Bingley. I must admit that while the book had a happy ending, it made me sad because I wanted to be in Jane and Elizabeth's shoes.When I think of classic books, I think of stuffy old libraries where stuffy old people go to read books that were written back when the dinosaurs roamed the earth. Reading this book made me realize that these old stuffy books are called classics for a reason.This book was not a boring read! I am the sort of person who loves to watch and read teen stories. You know, the stories where the guy and the girl meet each other and fall in love. Jane Austin did a great job of keeping my attention. Reading the book mixed up the same emotions as Freddie Prinze Jr. and Rachel Leigh Cook did in \\"She's All That.\\"Pride and Prejudice is a classic love story that everyone that believes in love should read. I believe that people of all ages could find it as emotional as many of the best love stories. Jane Austin wrote a real winner that every school, bookstore, and library should have a copy of."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"In the whole history of fiction, at least as known to me, there has never been an opening sentence that more fully encapsulated the entire novel than Austen's in this stunning work. And the succeeding paragraph adds the seasoning, the zest, introducing the setting, the key players, the theme more fully than most novels do in their hundreds of pages. I suggest that no civilized person can read these without a smile and a committment to finish the piece."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Of all of Austen's works, this is her most polished and important accomplishment. Pride and Prejudice masterfully blends excellent humor with a very strong social critique of many of the follies and vices of her times. Within its pages, the reader will find characters that are loveable, and characters that he will love to hate. The ending, while typical of a romance, is brought to its conclusion through the effects of a very tightly spun plot. This novel surpasses the high bar set by Fanny Burney's Evelina, and is a must read for any fan of Victorian literature, of any of fan of literature in general."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is about the Bennett family.

It is a definite must read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I had to read this book as part of my summer reading for senior AP English. It is a very funny, interesting story and any reader has to give Jane Austen credit for satirical view of the world around her. But, come on. Great Literature? It is a fluff book that leads the reader to no great revelations about their life or enviroment. To me, a novel is only as great as the thoughts it provoked. My &quot;great thoughts&quot; coming out of the novel were only &quot;I'm glad Darcy and Elizabeth fell in love&quot; and &quot;Gee, I hate Lydia&quot;. Don't misunderstand me.

The novel centers around Mrs. Bennet's feverish efforts to marry off her five daughters to the wealthiest and most well-suited men as possible. Elizabeth Bennet, the protagonist of the story and the second eldest Bennet daughter is a truly genuine, captivating, and refreshing character. In the novel Elizabeth encounters the most horrible creature of a man named Mr. Darcy. His haughtiness is outweighed only by his pride. On the flipside, however, Darcy is extremely attractive and wealthy to boot. The odds are definitely against these two throughout the book-especially because of disapproving family members and some ill-timed, hurtful comments. The reader's biggest question throughout is, will it work out for these star-crossed lovers? Sharp, well-developed characters and a beautifully woven plot coincide resulting in nothing but greatness. The 19th century-clad and somewhat frilly language could be considered tedious to some readers, but I believe it completes the effect of the novel. Subtle, witty dialogue constantly adds intrigue and humor. This novel guides the reader through the ups and downs of a love story with wonderful class and style. To say Pride and Prejudice is a masterpiece and a great work of art would be an understatement."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.\\"When first hearing the title Pride and Prejudice written by Jane Austen one might think that it would be another dull romantic book written ages ago. When in reality, Pride and Prejudice is a book that I could say I have actually enjoyed so much that I have read it myself several times. Pride and Prejudice is the type of book that draws the reader in deeper with each chapter, giving you new characters and personalities to make the book so compelling.The book starts off with a family known as the Bennets who have five daughters all with intentions of marrying to a young man with good fortune, except for one. That one is Elizabeth Bennet who wants to marry for love or to retire an old maid. It causes a great stir when a young man of great fortune, Mr. Bingly, has just bought a large estate in Loungbourn. This brings high hopes for Mrs. Bennet who has intentions of one of her daughters to catch his eye and to marry him. With surprise and great excitement Mrs. Bennet later finds out through gossip that Mr. Bingly has a friend whom makes twice as much as Bingly, Mr. Darcy. Mr. Bingly very quickly notices the eldest daughter of the Bennets, Jane. Mr. Darcy on the contrary refuses to dance with Elizabeth at their first meeting. In return this shocks Elizabeth of how someone could be that proud and that sets her opinion of him very low. Elizabeth reassures herself that this opinion of him could never change, but what if she is mistaken?Throughout the book Jane Austen never lightens up or falls short of her humor. Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy have many amusing conversations about how she believes he is proud and how he believes she is prejudice. This classic book will always remain one of my favorite books with the distinctive way Jane Austen writes."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I read this book to meet page requirements for my sophomore English class. And in the months since have re-read it several times. This book tells the story of Elizabeth Bennet, or rather Elizabeth's mother's detemination to have all of her girls sutibly married off. At first I was a bit put off by this stereotypical image that the only place for women in the early ninteenth century was married and in the home, but the story was very sweet, and beautifuly written [if a bit wordy] with a perfect happy ending."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Like most of Austen's novels, P&amp;P immerses you in early 19th Century England with its peculiar (to us) practices, traditions and attitudes. It's richly drawn characters, totally credible and intensely likeable or hateable, are the anchor point of this wondrous story which leads the reader on a journey of discovery, mystery and uproarious humour (yes honestly). One can learn a great deal about oneself by reading this book as it examines the complexities of human relationships and emotions still valid today, almost 200 years after it was written. Other priceless titles by Austen that rate a '10' are Emma and Mansfield Park. Don't miss them, you'll kick yourself if you do"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice isn't Jane Austen's most popular novel for nothing. The story, which is set in pre-Victorian rural England, is full of elegant wit and humor fit for all ages. Though its romantic themes are directed more towards women, men too can enjoy this tale of first impressions and first loves. Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is a classic love story that will hold you in its grip from the first page to the last.The story begins when a handsome bachelor named Charles Bingley and his friends move into the neighborhood where the main character, Elizabeth Bennet, lives with her four sisters. Elizabeth's older sister, Jane, and Mr. Bingley fall in love at first sight. What makes this novel so captivating is that Jane and Mr. Bingley are persuaded by others to bury their feelings for each other. Throughout the novel, the reader is kept guessing as to whether or not they will end up together.Elizabeth, meanwhile, attracts the attentions of Mr. Bingley's best friend, Mr. Darcy. However, her first impression of his arrogant demeanor forms a prejudice within her that prevents her from returning his admiration. Likewise, Mr. Darcy's pride makes it hard for him to reveal his feelings to her. As Amazon.com's editorial review on Pride and Prejudice claims, \\"The point is, you spend the whole book absolutely fixated on the critical question: will Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy hook up?\\" Although the plot is built to answer that question, it contains more than just 18th century romance to keep you interested.Conversation keeps the pages of this novel flying by. Whether you're listening to Mrs. Bennet grind on her daughters, or you're in the room at Netherfield hearing Caroline Bingley talk trash about Elizabeth, you will beg for more. You'll be somewhat satisfied to witness Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy duke it out, but you will not be able to stop until you find out what happens next.Pride and Prejudice is an essential classic for teen and adult readers alike. It explores the world of love, the dangers of preconceived notions, and the negative affects that self-gratification can have on relationships. Tyler C. Powell, who posted his review on Amazon.com, stated that through Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen \\"has lived up to the hype surrounding her name.\\" I concur completely, and recommend reading this novel and others by the same author."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It's a legendary and outstanding claasic but let's discuss not the novel itself but the book and it's quality. The cover is very nice, but the pages inside are of very poor quality.... If I had known it would be that kind of, I would definitely buy a better edition.... Though observing it's low prince, I should have had more or less clue about the quality of the book... Once again I confirm that nobody argues about the novel which is really remarkable piece of work..."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"She must have watched it close to 10 times since I got this for her. Something about that Mr Darcy. Anyway, I've never seen it but if you want to make your girlfriend/wife happy, get them this movie."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I admit I have heard of this book but never thought it would be interesting since the language was not easy. In general all classic novels are not easy. However, ever since I saw the movie, I couldn't help wonder what screenwriter has omitted from the original book. I decide to buy the book. To my surprise, I kept reading on. Usually when I read a book, I read a couple of pages then something came up. I never went back to finish the book. This book is different. The desire to know more about Elizabeth Bennet who was played by Kiera Knightly and Mr Darcy kept me going. During my lunch time at work, I read. At home, I would read until 3 or 4 am. Once I reached the end of the book, I wished Jane Austen had written the sequel. It's the most enduring romantic novels. Wished I was Elizabeth being admired by a rich noble guy like Mr Darcy."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The best story I have every read! And I have read it several times. And it never gets dull. This should be a mandatory read for everyone! It makes you wish you could have lived in that time period. For me personally, this was the best of Jane Austin's novels. Although, I believe they are all 5 stars, this one is my favorite. Oh, if only I could be Mrs. Fitzwilliam Darcy......"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"For those who are able to set aside their modern-day literature expectations and experiences, reading Pride and Prejudice is a wonderful, even riveting experience. I admit that if I had been assigned this novel in high school or college, reading it would have been an ordeal and I would have cursed the teacher or professor all the way through. Maybe it's my relatively advanced age or the fact that I just saw the movie that caused my mind to open and made Pride and Prejudice difficult to put down and exhilarating to read. Besides the seemingly stilted language of the period, Austen leaves much, including emotions and dialogue, to the imagination. The former lessens more and more as the pages go by and the latter actually makes the story more sensual and exciting. I found myself rereading chapters for the sheer enjoyment of trying to get in the minds of Mr. Darcy, Lizzy, Jane, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Collins and all the others. The characters are unforgetable and I will revisit them from time to time during the rest of my life. Today Pride and Prejudice definitely makes my top ten list of novels to take to a desert island."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is one of my favorite books. It will bring out the hopeful romantic in anyone."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I just finished reading pride and Prejudice and I loved it! I wasn't sure what to expect when I started reading it, but before long I was completely transported into the world of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy. The language is so beautiful throughout the book, and although I found it a bit awkward to read at first I quickly adjusted to it. I can easily see why this book is considered a classic and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is a great example of life in late 18th century England that depicts the struggles of women competing in a society dominated by men. Her main character, Elizabeth Bennet, portrays an independent, headstrong women acting out against her duty as a woman to get married in a time where men are the dominant sex. Her eventual love with Mr. Darcy creates a novel that is both humerous and romantic. I highly reccomend reading this classic novel by Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is a very romantic story about Elizabeth Bennet and Darcy and the pride and prejudices of the various characters in the novel.My favorite chapter is nineteen of volume three because everyone is happy. Elizabeth is married to Darcy and Jane is married to Mr. Bingley. Mrs. Bennet is happy because three of her daughters are married.Pride and Prejudice is appropriate for people 15 years and older because it is interesting and romantic. I would really recommend them to read the novel because they would really like the novel.One literary device that I appreciate was how Jane Austen uses the letters in the novel to advance the plot in the story. For example the letter from Darcy to Elizabeth told the reader that they might get married because now Elizabeth would know that Wickham was a liar. The way that she did that was when Darcy wrote to Elizabeth to tell her that Wickham was not saying the truth about him and that Wickham was a liar . Another example would be when Jane wrote to Elizabeth to tell her that Lydia had run away with Wickham. Lydia has to marry Wichham so that it wouldn't be a disgrace for the family.I like the novel because it makes us think about pride and prejudice against others, and about knowing people before we judge them. This novel is also very romantic for people who like romantic novels. I would recommend everyone to read it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possesion of a good fortune must be in want of a wife,\\" or so begins PRIDE AND PREJUDICE by Jane Austen. PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is one of the most highly regarded classical novels of English literature. More than likely, throughout high school and college, you will read this book. PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is relatively short for a classic, only around 350 pages. It is a medium-difficulty reading though, as the dialouge is a bit hard to keep up with and the language can be a bit \\"sophisticated.\\"PRIDE AND PREJUDICE tells a tale of a tangled love story. The book centers around Elizabeth Bennent, the second oldest daughter of the Bennent family. Her eldest sister Jane falls for Bingley, a rich and polite gentlemen. Elizabeth meets Bingley's friend, Darcy, who is even richer but has horrible manners. When Bingley departs suddenly, Elizabeth finds out it was Darcy's doing. Elizabeth finds herself falling in love and hating Darcy at the same time. The novel concludes the love tales in a brilliant conclusion that makes everyone satisfied.PRIDE AND PREJUDICE isn't the most exciting novel, and it might be questioned why it is better than today's novels made by King, Grisham, or Sparks. It is because it is a classic, and that there is a multitude of messages in the novel. PRIDE AND PREJUDICE criticizes the social class system, as Austen also criticizes the marriage process which can be a non consensual process. The book is an excellent example of a satire. The book has lively characters, and about 70 percent of the book is the well thought dialouge.The book falls short of other classics though, i.e. A TALE OF TWO CITIES, OLIVER TWIST, CALL OF THE WILD, and a few others, but altogether a brilliant work."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I am ashamed to admit it, but, yes, I have been reading for over 25 years and this is the very first time that I have ever read Jane Austen. None of her novels were required in high school, no literature class that I took in college used any as a text, and I had never thought to pursue her for sheer entertainment. It is quite sad, actually, for I find Austen much more accessible than some of the classic that I did have to wade through, including Wuthering Heights and The Scarlet Letter. Austen has recently seen a resurgence in popularity, likely due to the recent BBC and Hollywood adaptations of her books, including the Emma Thompson vehicle Sense and Sensibility.Pride and Prejudice was Austen's second novel, following the success of Sense and Sensibility. Its original title was--and I'm not making this up a la Dave Barry--First Impressions. To my taste, this would have been a much more apt title, but it had been used by another author before Austen could get this book in print. The story is about the five Bennet sisters, who, while not orphaned or penniless, have few choices as to husbands because their father's estate is entailed on a male heir, and they have no brother. The father seems to have resigned them to their fate, but their mother wastes no opportunity to arrange a good match for her daughters. The two oldest--Jane and Elizabeth--are level-headed and quite understand the position that they are in, but the youngest three are flirtatious and giddy, a bad combination in winning society's eye. Disasters ensue when eligible bachelors Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy come to town, as well as the officers of the ---shire regiment.The reason First Impressions would have been a better title is that each character--not just the main two, Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy--is constantly assuming things about other characters based on their initial reception of them. Mr. Darcy, in the country, is too proud to dance with any of the young women because of his mistaken impression that they are all declasse; Elizabeth forms her prejudices about Mr. Darcy because of her first meeting with him and this dance snub. The townsfolk think the best of Mr. Wickham because his first impression on everyone is quite favorable. And on and on and on.Very interesting, but it goes on forever, as the characters can never be quite direct given the mores of the time. That does not mean that they can not be insulting, as a particularly vicious exchange between Lady Catherine and Elizabeth shows. I'm glad that I have now broken my Austen fast, but I think that I can wait awhile before digesting any more."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The Bennet girls are having a problem with primogeniture. They feel that it isnt fair that the first male in the family gets to inherit the estate after Mr.Bennet has passed away. Since there are five girls and no men there cousin Mr.Collin's gets to inherit the estate. Mrs.Bennet takes it apon herself to find gossip on all the men in the town that are making a reasonable amout of money and hook them up with one of her daughters. This continues on thoughout the movie. Mrs.Bennet and all of the Bennet daughters get tangled up with all of the gossip and mishap,and this complicates everyones lives.Towards the middle of the movie one of the Bennet daughters(Jane) gets introduced to one of the wealthies men in the town, his name is Mr.Charles Bingley. Mr. Bingley has his eye set on her and they begin to like each other. Mr.Bingley's best friend Mr.Fitzwilliam Darcy also takes a liking for one on the Bennet daughters(lizzy). Mr.Darcy is hard headed and does not show his liking for lizzy at first. He is rude and does not show much respect for her, in lizzy's eyes. Mr.Darcy is jelous of something and tries to break Mr.Bingly and Jane up. This creates lizzy to have more dislike for Mr.Darcy.The actors that were chosen to play in this movie were very perfect. They understood and comprehended what they had to do and did the job quite perfectly. I really admired how well the plot and characters where chosen. The scene designers and director chose the perfect places to shot the movie. I liked how the two wealthies men's estates in Pemberly and Netherfield Park were placed. This made it seem very realistic. I would defintley recommend this movie to others. It kept you wondering thoughtout the whole movie whether or not Mr.Darcy and lizzy , and Mr.Bingly and jane were going to get together. I feel it was more a chick flick,but would also suggest it to males as well. It might teach them a thing or two on how to approace a woman, and make them feel wanted and loved dispite what others say.Throughout this movie &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; was a really wonderful message. I feel the message was not to give up hope and try to persue your dreams. If something was ment to be it will always work out at the end."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"My sister's been raving about this book for years. It's not until months ago did I have the guts to pick it up. It's been sitting in my mini-library since I got it too... Then my sister once again kept asking &quot;Have you read 'it' yet?&quot; So, to stop this question from coming up in every turn, I decided to read it. I honestly expected this book to bore me to death considering the author is from the late 17th century. What fun could a writer be of that time, huh? Oh not to mention, the author was unmarried. What does she know about romance, right? Well, I was mistaken. I enjoyed this book sooo much, I ordered the DVD movie of it. There was some &quot;slow&quot; moments in this book however, I think it's the over-description of everything. But once you got through that, the book flows with lots of humor and intensity. I liked Elizabeth from the start. Mr. Darcy was kindda hard to like in the beginning but as soon as the book progress, you would love him and would want him for your own :-) The Dialogue in this book was my favorite of all. Uppity, Humorous, Lyrical, Heart warmer and truly of its time.I have read more than 80 historical romance novels in this year alone and I honestly think most of the ideas and formulas (marriage mart) were derived from this book (did i dare say that?). I couldn't believe this book was actually written at that time period. Amazing!

There weren't a lot of Jane Austen book clubs for high school boys back then and white-bread suburbia did not lend itself to those types of disclosures. However, reading it and EMMA and JANE EYRE and Dickens spoiled me forever for good storytelling. To this day, I am drawn to novels of eternal themes: love, sex, family and friends. I don't mean to trivialize Jane Austen with my pithy Candace Bushnell nod, but Pride and Prejudice has all of the intrigue and sex and love of Sex and the City--we just can't see it.

I can't imagine I understood most of that as a fourth grader, but anyway a few weeks ago I found it along with a few other adbandoned books from my elementary years. Now, as a 7th grader and a hopeless romantic devoloped through the years, I figured I could give it a shot, though my expectations weren't high. Well. This book was very good. I have to say I oly got up to page 110, I think, but what I have read was fantasticly (sp?) written. However, I'm more of a sci-fci, fantasy, adventure kind of reader, preferring classics like Black Beauty (did I mention horse nut?) and Watership Down, though I don't kow if that's considered a classic... Anyway, I also don't think I understood it as well as I could have and I seriously did not want to blemish my idea of this book, so I ould strt fresh in maybe another year or two. Who knows, maybe I'll even give it another go before 7th grade ends! But I'd like to say, if you're an older reader who can understand this sort of thing well, you can put up with a slow start, and enjoy classic works then this is the book for you! Thanks for reading!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Excellent classic novel. I loved how there are a variety of story lines going at once. It takes a few chapters to get past some of the old English language, but once you get a few chapters into it you can't put it down. It's a good novel about relationships - from family to romantic - in a setting of the early 1800's in England."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"pride and prejudice seems boring if you merely scan it, but if you read every detail then you'll find that it is a very witty, interesting, funny book. many things happen in this novel and you'll learn.this book may be confusing if you don't understand these old english expressions. i luckily knew some of them and learned the rest.pride and prejudice takes you into the world of the aristocracy in Enlgland in the early nineteenth century. You'll learn about matchmaking schemes and what was most important for a woman (marriage, of course) and how people treated their own family. I'm not talking cruelty or anything, but about pride. For ex. Mr. Darcy likes Elizabeth, but doesn't want to, since she's below his class. When Elizabeth's siter Lydia runs off with a guy their father almost disowns her in his anger. It may seem like a cruel and heartless thing to do, but when you read it, it almost seems like a perfectly sensible thing to do. women married for money and position, rarely for love. daughters were expected to obey their parents' wishes. Pride and Prejudice shows you all of this.this story takes place in England in around the early nineteenth century. here, in the upper-middle/lower first class is Mr. Bennet, a sarcastic, quiet man, his rather foolish wife, and their five daughters. Jane, the eldest, is the most kindest and prettiest. She's a goody-goody but you like her anyway, since she's also sensible. Elizabeth is the second eldest; the main character and also the wittiest and cleverest of her sisters. Mary is the quietest and most accomplished; she spends her time studying and you hear least of her in this story except when she's making some clever observation on pride or virtues from her studies.. Catherine, also called Kitty, is next, and then Lydia. They're both foolish, flirtatious, empty-headed girls who spend most of their time going to town so they can flirt with officers in the militia.enter Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy. They're best friends, both rich young men, both really handsome, both bachelors. only difference is that people hate Mr. darcy, as he's a proud, indifferent man who hates to dance and critizizes things. Mr. Bingley on the other hand is charming and amiable, loves to dance and admires Jane a lot. of course Mrs. Bennet starts scheming. She hates Mr. Darcy though, since at the beginning of the book, Mr. Darcy is heard telling Mr. Bingley at a ball that Elizabeth is not handsome enough for him to go off and dance with. Elizabeth is actually very pretty, as Jane Austen puts it, but nevertheless Mr. Darcy is a picky person. Elizabeth doesn't like Mr. Darcy's personality too much herself. they seem to be destined to scorn and be critical of each other only unfortunately for Elizabeth Mr. Darcy starts to fall head over heels for her after being stunned by Elizabeth's playfully bold, unique personality.of course they don't get married at once, otherwise this would be a very short novel. neither do jane and mr. bingley. The happy endings are delayed as a result from pride and prejudice. After all, Mrs. bennet isn't the only one who schemes. everybody does, from Mr. Darcy to Elizabeth's best friend Charlotte to Mr. Bingley's sister.this was a fabulous book and i definitely reccomend it. it depends on the reader's reading level, though."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is the book that I chose for my amazon.com report. I liked the book a lot more then I expected myself to. I think that it is a book that should be required to be read in one point or another in the sixth grade. Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen, New American Library, 1989. I gave the book a five star rating because it teaches you what love is and what it was like for the people back then. For them to fall in love with one another and have all the regulations and rules. It was probably hard for them. Everywhere in this book is love. Whether it is from mother to father or from daughter to mother or father.In this book a family of seven welcomes Mr. Darcy. He is a very rich and hasome man. Mr. Bennet and Mrs. Bennet try constantly to get one of his five daughters to marry Mr. Darcy, but Elizabeth has other plans. For she is in love with Mr. Wickham. It turns out that Mr.Wickham is in love with Elizabeth. They begin dating and cannot stand a single day without each other, so they decide that they should get married and soon they become engaged. But then Elizabeth realizes that she does not love him anymore. She soon comes to a conclusion of why. She loves Mr. Collins.I am not going to give away a good ending because it is so exciting, but they all live happily ever after. Meanwhile Mr. Darcy is having trouble choosing who to marry. I will not spill the beans on who he decides to marry because I would write too much and then it might give all of it away. The other three girls do find their true love and Mr. and Mrs. Bennet are happy because their daughters are happy.My opinion of this book is wonderful and outrageous. I think that this book is just like Jane Austen said, \\" it is like your own darling child.\\" Her version of this book has made me want to read more of her books because I think that they will be somewhat like Pride and Prejudice but I would never know till I read another one of her books. I also agree with the old saying, \\"don't judge a book by it's cover\\" because I picked up this book and said, \\"This does not look like something I would want to read.\\" I read it and said, \\"WOW! This was a really excellent book.\\"I think that the theme is a very important thing when you are trying to rate a book because basically it is what the book taught you about life. So the theme for Pride and Prejudice was that no matter how much you love someone you can't possibly be satisfied unless they love you back, and that love has no boundries. You can love someone and they can love you but you will still love that person no matter what happens. Even if that person leaves or passes away you will still love but you won't know it because it is just from the bottom of your heart."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"One can easily be mistaken by pride and prejudice, which can later lead to foolish misunderstanding. Throughout this novel the reader can observe how a marriage can secure social status and economic security. Mrs. Bennet would do anything to guarantee both for her daughters. Pride and Prejudice is a story of love, drama and life at England during the 19-century. The author of this classic of literature is Jane Austen. Jane Austen is the seventh daughter of eight children. Being daughter of Rev. George Austen and Cassandra, Austen was born in December 16th, 1775 at Steventon, Hampshire, England. Austen died on 18 of July 1817 at the age of 41 in Winchester, Hampshire, England. Jane died unmarried as well as her sister Cassandra Elizabeth who was 2 years older than Jane. Jane wrote several books before her death including Pride and Prejudice who's initial title would be First Impressions.The arrival of Mr. Charles Bingley to Nederfield Park, caused quite a scandal. Mr. Bingley was a young single man with a huge fortune, and the perfect candidate for husband for one of Mrs. Bennet's daughters. Mr. Bingley's sister and closest friend, Miss Bingley and Mr. Darcy had arrived with him. Mr. Bennet paid unwillingly a visit to Mr. Bingley under order of her wife with the purpose of causing a good impression. Mr. Bingley encountered the Bennet's at a ball and was allured by the oldest Miss Bennet, Jane. Not only once did Mr. Bingley ask her to a dance with him, but twice. Miss Bingley became an acquaintance of Jane and became very fond of her.Throughout the novel we are able to observe how society was back in the 19th century. A woman's priority was to get a wealthy and high ranking husband who would be able to provide a good social status to her and their children. The fact that Mr. Collins would inherit the Bennet's property after Mr. Bennet passed away allows us to see further into women's rights. Women were not oppressed as they used to be but they still didn't had the same amount of privileges we do in the present. Mr. Bennet could not leave their daughters any inheritance because they were all women and the property was entailed, meaning that only males could inherit it. The book is so well written with so much detail that it turns one from an outsider into an insider.One is able to observe what a typical day would be in the old days, especially for women, how would they travel and how long their visits would last. I found it quite peculiar how in the past people used to be guests for months and in the present it is less likely, one usually is more busy and just stops for a while and moves on. In the novel Elizabeth spends four weeks at Hunsford with Mrs. Collins and she is still begged by Lady Catherine to remain. Jane also spends around three months in London in her aunt's residence. We can see and advance in the way Mr. Darcy thinks. Many would have believed that Elizabeth's imprudence would be considered of bad taste and rude, but Mr. Darcy admired her for all the reasons someone else may dislike her. Elizabeth didn't accepted Mr. Collins proposal and she still declined Mr. Darcy's proposal not afraid of remaining unmarried. In contrast Miss Lydia Bennet was so desperate in getting a husband. On her way home Lidya commented to her sisters the following,\\"Let us hear what has happened to you all since went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare. She is almost three-and-twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should of not married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Philips wants you to get husbands, you can't think. She says Lizzy should had better have taken Mr. Collins;but I do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord! How I should like to be married before any of you! And then I would chaperon you about to all the balls.\\"I found this book intriguing since it shows how us humans may be blinded by prejudices and pride. Sometimes we may judge too fast or too harshly and that no matter how bad something seems it may not be the absolutely true. Elizabeth judged Mr. Darcy too quickly, being blinded by prejudice, she believed completely what Mr. Wickham had said and didn't confirm it with Mr. Darcy. Mr. Darcy was sometimes too proud that he acted foolishly, he didn't show any signs of his feelings towards Elizabeth till the last minute, he didn't tell the absolute truth about Mr. Wickham in order to avoid judging and to conserve his pride. Even though Jane Austen is not here to see the impact her stories has had, this piece of art specifically will always be remembered as one of the classics of literature."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Gave this seller a poor review for slow shipping and a book in poor condition. Happy to report that they quickly responded to my complaint email and issued me a refund."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen is known to be one of the greatest classic female novelists. Her stories contain strong heroines, who rebel against societal norms in order to achieve their full potential as women. Pride and Prejudice, Austen's most well-known work, does not fail to contain this familiar element of Austen's writings.The novel follows the story of the Bennet sisters, primarily the two eldest, Jane and Elizabeth, and their misadventures in love. Jane is the sweet-tempered, docile, and beautiful daughter, making her Mrs. Bennet's favorite. On the other hand, Elizabeth is independent, hot-headed and sarcastic, making her Mr. Bennet's favorite. Mrs. Bennet's main focus in life is to have her five daughters married to wealthy men so Mrs. Bennet can live a life in comfort.When wealthy Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy move in to Netherfield, the estate next to that of Mr. Bennet, Mrs. Bennet is elated at the possibility of at least one of her daughters marrying one of the men. Mr. Bingley is almost instantly taken with the innocent Jane, while Mr. Darcy manages to insult Elizabeth within moments of meeting her. This starts the rocky relationship between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. Blinded by pride and prejudice, both parties must face hurt and heartbreak before finally receiving their happily ever after.Despite strong characterization, especially of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, Pride and Prejudice does not make my list of favorite books. The story is flat, with no interesting plot elements outside of the occasional use of verbal irony for some humor. As it is a romantic comedy, it is predictable and lacks the depth of most great classic novelists such as Dumas, Dickens, and Leroux.Pride and Prejudice is a light-hearted easy-read. However, if looking for a book that is engaging, it might be best to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Appropriate for children, this book has excitement, history, and christian thinking in the ways of social behavior.

But I've always wondered about the \\"songs\\" (Chapter 6) that Lizzy performs before giving way to her dull sister Mary. Was she really singing? I guess not, since the subsequent refs are to the instrument. During the time of P&P's writing and for a few years thereafter the English Scarlatti cult was in full swing, so the CD \\"Scarlatti as chosen by Clementi\\" is worth while listening for hardcore JA authenticity fans. Clementi was associated with the Broadwood piano manufacturers and the album contains pieces chosen from Clementi's influential English edition of 1791. Emilia Fadini plays these pieces on an English c. 1800 repro piano with some fire--I can easily imagine Elizabeth wowing Darcy and the crowd with K 381 (track #3).

She Has a great writing style and knows what it takes to make a good book. The clashes between Darcy and Elizabeth are pricless and add zing to the book.I wish she had written a sequel though. Looking forward to reading her other books!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice was originally written by Jane Austen in 1797, but it was not published until 16 years later. Jane Austen was born in 1775 in southwest England. She was born to a middle-class family, and her background greatly influenced her writing, which is evident in Pride and Prejudice.Pride and Prejudice is the story of Elizabeth Bennet and her family. Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth's mother, wants nothing more than for her five daughters to be married off to wealthy men as soon as possible. Lydia and Kitty, the two youngest daughters, like to flirt with the officers that are stationed in a nearby town. Mary is content to sit at home and read books. Jane, the oldest daughter, grows attached to Mr. Bingley, a wealthy, single man who recently moved to town. Elizabeth is a lively girl who always speaks what she feels. She begins to have a relationship with Mr. Darcy, Mr. Bingley's extremely wealthy friend. She denies a marriage proposal twice in the book, much to her mother's dismay.The title Pride and Prejudice is an example of some of the issues Jane Austen talks about throughout the novel. Most of the characters in this book show signs of pride and prejudice in their behavior. Characters in all classes have prejudices against each other. Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth are prime examples of the pride and prejudice that occurs during the novel. They both have a tendency to judge harshly, even against each other. Their pride keeps them from expressing their true feelings.This was an excellent book, and I recommend it to anyone looking to read a great classic. At first it seemed a little slow, but the book became more interesting as it went along and I truly enjoyed reading it. Though I don't normally enjoy such flowery language, it seemed to fit this story and the characters very well. Once I got used to the language of the book, I really got into it and it was fun to read. This book had interesting characters and a happy ending. I would definitely choose Pride and Prejudice as my favorite classic book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I just started reading Jane Austen, and already I'm a life time fan. At times it can be a bit difficult to understand, only because of the old english used in that time. Besides that it is a wonderful story. It has it all, characters you will love and love to hate. I could not put it down, and when I was finished it was bitter sweet. I felt as if I knew these characters personally, and in me ending this book was like ending our friendship. That may sound silly but ask anyone who loves Jane Austen and they would agree... All of her books are beautiful and if you are serious about reading you will love it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"If you haven't read the book Pride and Prejudice, it is one I would quickly recommend. I am at the moment reading classics and currently in the middle of reading most of Jane Austen's books. All her stories are delightful, but I can honestly say that this one is my favorite so far. It has a good and interesting storyline, as well as some very likable and some unlikable characters. You will quickly grow to like Elizabeth and her sister Jane, while their mother and younger sisters may annoy you to no end. All in all though it is a good book.For those of you who are not familiar with the story, it is the tale of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy, who at the beginning of the book seem to be polar opposites, with the only thing in common being their great dislike for each other. The story also involves Elizabeth s sister Jane and Mr. Darcy s best friend Mr. Bingley, though Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy are by far the main characters. Besides having quite a bit of witty dialogue, it has a few surprising turn of events that seem to make the book even more interesting. At first like Elizabeth, you too may greatly dislike Mr. Darcy, but as the book goes on he tends to grow on you, and by the end of the book, you'll be firmly in love with both of them.A good lesson can be pulled from the book as well. Elizabeth jumped to conclusions and let some people prejudice her against Mr. Darcy, while at the beginning of the book Mr. Darcy was as proud and arrogant as could be. Which can teach that we need to be careful on judging other people, because the way they act and what we may hear about them may be entirely false. It s also a good illustration on how pride can really mess up your relationships with others.If you're interested in reading this book then go for it, and don't let the fact that it s quite a long book deter you. Take the book in strides. I know I usually read very fast, but at first I read it rather slowly and I honestly didn't really enjoy it until I got to section two of the book. So even if at first you don't like it, try to keep reading, it gets better as you go on. It really does! Don t let the fact that it's a classic, written in the early 1800s bother you either, broaden your horizons a bit and learn to appreciate classic literature- it's truly a delight. After all, they had to become famous classics for a reason! So enjoy your turn at Pride and Prejudice, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Austen is undeniably important in the history of british culture and the central themes of this book fully justify her position, particularly the idea of female emancipation. That said great themes do not make interesting reads (e.g anything by Hegel). What makes this book is the writing, the prose is light and fast and you can't deny she has a sense of humour. Great book, makes it's points without bludgeoning you on the head."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"If you want to understand \\"relationships\\" better ( I would like to think we all do) and you have limited time, that you can use to read, say, \\"Pscychology Today\\" and watch Oprah and Dr. Phill -- or read Jane Austen's great work -- I say go with Jane. You will learn more and enjoy a classical reading experience in the process."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is my mom's favorite book, which I have finally read this year after long years of her trying to get me to read it. Since I had to read Sense and Sensibility for my college course, I went on to reading all of Austen's novels. I am currently on my last one; Persuasions. Pride and Prejudice is the most popular of Austen's novel, I think, and for good reason. The characters are funny and interesting, the plot is original, and the social satire of England in Austen's time is hugely enjoyable. Elizabeth Bennet, Austen's own favorite character, is a headstrong, affectionate girl who represents the \`prejudice' of the title. And Fitzwilliam Darcy (aka Mr. Darcy, but I like his name O_O) is the \`pride' and is filthy rich, arrogant and rude. It goes without saying that I fell in love with him at first sight (or first mention of him in the story). Mr. Darcy, Mr. Knightly and that hero from Northanger Abbey are the cutest heroes of all Austen's novels!!! (=^-^=) &lt;Purrrrr)Anyhoo, enough drooling. (Mentally slaps face-get your act together--!!)The characters of the novel, though the most colorful and animated, are also the least believable. They are larger than life, great for the story, but I don't see them as flesh and blood people. Mrs.Bennet, with her obsession for marrying her daughters is perfectly understandable, but her happiness even when one girl elopes with a good-for-nothing, and the way she won't understand her husband's complete disapproval is just mind-boggling. The stupid characters are soooo stupid, Elizabeth's father- even though he is very likeable- is actually a pretty bad father concerning his duties towards his daughters and fear for their welfare, though all that changes near the end.In any case, I loved the book, it was funny and highly enjoyable. I'm glad I read it. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in reading a classic, and even those who are not. If you don't mind quaint-sounding passages and writing that is sometimes a bit confusing, try out Jane Austen. Once you get the hang of the language you can really enjoy this great book!! Buy it now!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"i am fourteen years old. i am an avid reader. i read pride and prejudice when i was in 8th grade. i have now read it atleast 4 times. my friend had let me borrow her book telling me it was good. i just started reading for the heck of it. i finished it in a week, which is hard considering how much work i usually have. but, anyways, the book is excellent. elizabeth is the perfect heroine for any novel. she is witty, intellingent, kind, and pretty. she is the perfect female. mr. darcy is a man. proud yet sweet in his own way. they are perfect. mrs. bennet is a character of her own. lydia is amusing. the whole book is great. it has humor, romance, wit, and a great plot, all in one book. it isn't overly lengthy like many other jane austen novels. it is has more brevity than other novels. it is certainly sweet. it allows you to relate to characters in your own way. maybe it could be the siblings, suitors, parents, loves, or anything. but it definitely worth it. if you haven't read it you must. if you have read it and don't own it, you have to buy it. i have already read it 4 times, and i can't get tired of it. it is just a satisfying read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Though I have heard much praise of Jane Austen, this is the first time I've actually sat down and read one of her books. I was impressed. Though the plot would seem shallow now (it centers around marriages); then that was central to most women's hopes and desires. Besides the plot, the characters are amusing and Elizabeth is finely drawn. She is very self-confidant and will not allow others to look down on her for her ill upbringing. I don't believe men would enjoy this book, because the male figure is not drawn very realistically. I seriously doubt that all men thought or talked about were marriage and love. Walter Raleigh phrased it correctly by saying that &quot;Austen's men wouldn't be allowed in any club in England!&quot;. I didn't find it to be at all boring, rather, a page-turner to see how everything was going to turn out (though in the end it became predictable). The formal language is confusing at times, but provides a bit more color with it's detail. Though many parts of the book are obviously contrived, and I feel as if Austen is trying a little too hard to invoke emotion within me, in many ways the book is ahead of it's time, and for that, it is commendable to be certain."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"PNP was a delight to read. I'm not a fan of Jane Austen. I was in fact, dismissive of her work as being too boring and feminist (though I insist that the two are not necessarily related!) which led me to pick up this novel to see for myself. For a story so well told, it's surprisingly well paced with little attention to insignificant details and events. I would have though Jane Austen novels spent page after page describing beautiful English scenery but it's feelings and relationships that are the focus of PNP. I can now understand why it's hugely popular with women; it reads like a very sophisticated soap opera. There are handsome young men and ladies, a dodgy character or two to make things interesting, and romantic entanglements aplenty. I quite enjoyed following the relationship of Elizabeth Bennet and the enigmatic Darcy. Things change a lot in 200 years, but not when it comes to love. The language could be hard for many to grasp, but that is my only reservation. Pride And Prejudice is a fine book and one I recommend to anyone."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"In trying to get books imported to my newly-purchased Kindle, this one made it to the Kindle but was not really a title I wanted."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I read this book and got bored with it after page 35 it was confusing overall I didn't like it"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Overall, this novel was a good read.

I could not have cared less about any of the characters or the outcome of the \\"plot.\\" The one character with any potential of interest was Darcy, and he turned out to be a very dull boy.

Egerton, Whitehall, and is a classic tale of love, hate, and heartbreak. Its realistic fiction genre makes this 360 (or so) page story able to relate to today. You can imagine some of the emotions throughout and although there are no illustrations, you can use your own mind to picture the story. The tale takes us on turns and elaborates on the drama in the lives of Elizabeth Bennet, Jane Bennet, and their romances with the men in the book. Jane Austin, who is a widely recognized author today, was not recognized much during her lifetime. She was born in 1775 and unfortunately passed away 1817 because of an illness. In that time she wrote many books, one being Pride and Prejudice. Her family was compassionate of her writings and took it into their own hands to try to get them published. Only a few managed to get published, however. During the 20th century Pride and Prejudice, and many of Austin's other works, finally became recognized and were seen as great novels by many readers. They were published and became best sellers among many companies. Pride and Prejudice is one of the most read books today by adolescents and adults of many ages. Many people enjoy this roller coaster tale and it's occasionally comical characters.The characters in Pride and Prejudice have very distinct personalities, which contribute to the ups and downs of the story. However, to truly understand the customs of the four main characters in this book, you must put yourself in the beginning of 1800's, during the Napoleonic Wars (1797-1815), in the town of Hertfordshire. The setting explains the way in which the characters act. The characters personalities make for many moods; including love, hate, passion, loss, and urgency. The main character is Elizabeth Bennet and she is also the narrator of the story. She is the second eldest of the Bennet daughters and her smart, quick wit sometimes makes her perceive people too quickly. Elizabeth occasionally fails to dig deep into a person's true story and she keeps her guard up at first impressions. Jane Bennet is the eldest of the Bennet daughters and is known to be the most beautiful. She is pressured throughout the story to marry soon because of her age and her relationship with Mr. Bingley shapes the book. Mr. Charles Bingley is a young man of wealth and looks, who comes to Hertfordshire. He owns the Netherfield estate and when he meets Jane he falls in love with her. The last main character is Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy. He owns the Pemberly estate and is seen throughout the story as a proud, judgmental man. Towards the end of the book these portrayals change and we find out Mr. Darcy's true character. Some other side characters include: Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, the other Bennet daughters, Mr. Darcy's sister, Mr. Bingley's sister, Mrs. De Bourgh, and Mr. Wickham. All the characters have elements that are special to their part in the book. They are all unique.The beginning of this love story starts out with the arrival of Mr. Charles Bingley, in the town of Longbourn. He moves into the Netherfield estate accompanied by his sister, Miss Caroline Bingley, and his friend, Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy. The Bennets, another family of Longbourn, hear this news and they set their hopes high that Mr. Charles Bingley will marry one of their daughters. Throughout the first few chapters, we see how attached Mr. Bingley becomes to Jane, who is the eldest of the Bennet daughters, and that Mr. Darcy, too, shows a strange attitude towards Elizabeth, the second eldest of the Bennet daughters. In the middle, the conflicts arise that shape the ending of the book. The Bingley residence surprisingly moves away to London and Jane is heartbroken. Elizabeth goes to visit her friend there, that summer, and although she does not see Mr. Bingley, she does have a few interactions with Mr. Darcy. Darcy's stubborn, selfish behavior unfolds at these points and we learn that he is actually in love with Elizabeth. Elizabeth does not feel equal love towards him because of her own stubbornness and failure to look at a person's true identity. Towards the end of the book, Elizabeth realizes how blind she had been about Mr. Darcy and begins to love him back, realizing that they are actually very similar in character. Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bingley come back to Longbourn and Mr. Bingley confesses that he still loves Jane. Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth reunite confessing their love as well. The rise and fall of the different emotions in the plot make for many exciting climaxes.Sometimes the difference between what your heart feels and what your brain thinks can make things confusing. That is what happens in Pride and Prejudice. A good theme for the book would be that you shouldn't judge a person or come to assumptions about them until you know their real story. Poor Elizabeth feels a roller coaster of emotions towards Mr. Darcy throughout the book, from love to hate, then back to love. She just doesn't understand why he acts the way he does. He's confusing to her. He acts as though he is very proud of himself in the beginning and he is not very kind to people who he doesn't know. Later he warms up to Elizabeth; however it may be a little late for him, since she has already established her feelings towards him. The turning point of the story, when we really see how the theme fits, is when Elizabeth goes to Pemberly while the thinks Mr. Darcy is away. She realizes that her feelings have changed because she knows his real story. She read Mr. Darcy's letter, which explained a lot, and she knows then why he acts the way he does. It begins to make sense to her. What Elizabeth originally thought about Mr. Darcy was all different now. She just needed to know the real him. The theme really makes for an exciting realization at the turning point of Pride and Prejudice.Have you ever been on a kiddie roller coaster, that had its ups and downs but those hills were really not exciting? That's how I felt about this book. It was slow moving at times and it never had an enormous climax. Rather, it had a few small ones, which were very predictable. While reading the book, I discovered that I felt as though Pride and Prejudice had a little too much description and narration, instead of dialogue. The lack of dialogue made it difficult to truly feel the characters emotions. I had a hard time putting myself in the characters shoes. The love story was not portrayed as very romantic because the characters never really connected on that level. Overall, I did not care for the book Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austin."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austin, who was born on December 16, 1775, is a classic novel that is loved by many because of its heroine, Elizabeth Bennet. The book was published in 1813, but Miss Austin actually intended it to be published in 1797, but sadly, it was rejected. Jane Austin has also published Sense and Sensibility, a story about two sisters with a meager amount of money, Mansfield Park, and many others. Although Miss Austin produced many great works, she had to leave the world sometime. She died in 1817 by a sudden illness. Even though Jane Austin died many years ago, her books are regarded as some of the best books ever written.In a town called Longbourn, sometime in the 19th century, Miss Elizabeth Bennet lives with her family, Mrs. Bennet, a foolish woman who only cares if her daughters marry, Mr. Bennet, a sensible man who runs the house, but is in an unhappy marriage, Mary, Caroline, Lydia, a snooty girl who only cares about herself, and her favorite sister, Jane, who is madly in love with Mr. Charles Bingley, a wealthy man who purchases Netherfield, his estate that is close to the Bennet's house. Elizabeth is a sensible young lady in her mid-twenties, but sometimes let her pride makes her think in prejudice ways because she likes to ponder on the character of others. Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy is one such person that Elizabeth believes has a bad character, although she doesn't know him very well. With so many characters about, sometimes it's hard to remember who is who, but after a while you get quite used to it.The main conflict in Pride and Prejudice is the feelings that Elizabeth has for Mr. Darcy. In the beginning of the story, she utterly hates him, but near the middle, she starts doubting her way she views character. Because of the interchanging turmoil in Elizabeth's heart, she isn't sure what to feel about Mr. Darcy. Another conflict is Mr. Bingley's feelings for Jane, who isn't even sure of his feelings for her. The plot pretty much centers around those two main conflicts. Although, there are many other mini conflicts that the plot focuses on also. One example would be Mr. Collin's conflict with Elizabeth. He wishes her to marry him, because he is supposed to take over the estate when Mr. Bennet dies. Mr. Bennet, a cautious and humorous man, is not so happy that his cousin is going to take over the estate. Even though this is how I perceived the book, I'm sure it's very close to what the critics say.When Mr. Darcy proposes to Elizabeth, the whole book starts getting more thought provoking. Will Elizabeth say yes? Or will she say no? Either way, there is more than just her answer. Why did she say what she said? Well, I guess you'll have to read to find out. While you are wrapping that around your head, let me tell you about the theme of the story. There are several themes in Pride and Prejudice but a main one is reputation. Reputation really matters in this book. Mrs. Bennet, with her obnoxious manners and comments, disgraced the family several times throughout the story. And when a certain someone runs away, the family is in danger of being condemned forever in disgrace. And while the Elizabeth endured all of this, the family hardly noted that any of this was occurring, maybe because they only care about getting their daughters married, since that would bring them money. Either way, reputation really matters in this book.All in all, I really didn't like this book because it was really boring. I know the book is a classic, but it made me go to sleep. The book is written beautifully, don't get me wrong. But it didn't keep my attention very well. Yes, I did finish it, and let's just say I could see the finish a mile away. While the beginning was slightly compelling, it just wasn't something I was willing to read. I had to forcefully work my way through this book. Elizabeth, who was an interesting person, made too many prejudices that it got on my nerve after a while. I will say though, that maybe if I tried harder, I could've eased into this book much better if I wasn't rushing to read it. On my scale of buy, borrow, or skip, I would say borrow, but only if you are really into classics."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It took my third try to finally get through Pride and Prejudice. I'll start with the good: the writing is fantastic. I can't argue with that...I love the language. You can pretty much diss someone or compliment someone in so many different ways that I wish our language wasn't so abbreviated. In a few years we'll all be talking in acronyms at the rate we're going, but anyway, back to the story. I understand that women during that time really didn't have a place in society except to stay home and make babies...but what I couldn't stand from the book was that it was a bunch of people sitting around just talking or singing around a piano. It's a love story between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett, but I really couldn't see the love. It was more infatuation or a little crush so the fact that they \\"SPOILER ALERT\\" got together in the end seemed so forced. I didn't even like Elizabeth because she had this holier than thou sort of attitude, but I guess that's just her pride and prejudice. I guess a book about a bunch of women trying to find husbands doesn't interest me."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I haven't read the book yet but what I wanna say is the book is too new and they were in a hurry of making or cutting this book which is result unsqare or imperfect cut.The letters don't look straight and lean to the right then left when you turn to the next page. It's quite funny and make me a little unhappy about it.Anyhow, I'm sure the story is as sweet as it has been. But next time, check your book shape!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This review was written by my class's literature circle group:Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen, was a humorous tale of love and drama. It all starts when Mr. Bingley, a rich man moved to town. His friend, Mr. Darcy, moves in with him. When they attended a ball they meet Elizabeth Bennet, a very prejudice woman, and the story changed drastically. Will they ever set aside there differences? Will they ever fall in love...?In this book the characters vary a great deal in their personalities. Elizabeth Bennet is the very prejudice character. She often will voice her opinion but she normally won't show her true feelings when she likes someone. Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy is very proud; partly because he is rich and partly because he is very argumentative. He, like Elizabeth, doesn't show his true feelings toward someone. Jane Bennet is the character that is always in a good mood and tries to see the silver lining of any problem. Mr. Bingley is a rich man who is good natured and is a very welcoming person. He has very good manners and is very gentleman like. All of theses characters make this a very unique, well thought-out book. The author, Jane Austen, makes this story believable because things that happen in this story are just like real life.The plot of this story was definitely the love and drama of life. It shows the tough spots you can have in life. An example of the main theme was when Mr. Darcy tells Elizabeth he loves her and his affection is denied by the young girl. This book shows how life isn't perfect. There is definitely going to be rough patches along the way. That is why this book is so great, is because it isn't a fairy tale where every thing is perfect. That is why we believe this book is such a wonderful classic.The main style of Pride and Prejudice is old English. The author,Jane Austen, made this very clear early on. Some of the things that happen during this book, because of the style, leaves great pictures in your head. Jane keeps you interested in this book by making believable when she uses real life situations. That is what makes this book a one of a kind story.We rated the book Pride and Prejudice around 4 stars. The old English language in this book is harder to understand and must be fully understood. The many humorous parts in this book help make it a classic. Jane Austen helps you connect to the women's point of view in the 1800's. The author did very well on this book by showing how to love and be loved. We would recommend this book to anyone who can understand the style of Pride and Prejudice. This book is not only for the women, but wonderful for men, because in our book circle we have four boys and they each enjoyed this book as much as the girls did. This book is truly a timeless classic that can be enjoyed by all."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"One of the only reason why I have read this book is because I had to pick a British Author to read about and then write a paper on. At first I didn't pick Jane Austin, I was unaware that she was British, then when my teacher passed out a list of authors I saw her name and automatically thought 'Pride and Prejudice' and I wanted to research Jane Austen. I first saw the movie when I was younger and I didn't understand it. Ever since then I have had an interest in it. When the newer movie came out with Keira Knightly came out, I wanted to go see it but ended up not going. I took this oppertunity to read the book. As I began to read this book, I had trouble understanding it. I am not good at the old English and by the end of the book, I still didn't fully understand it but I managed to get the full story. I did use Cliff Notes to help me understand each chapter because it didn't always make sense to me but after I read the summeries of each chapter I was able to understand the story.I found the story very romantic. I thought it unusual how Mr. Darcy acts in the beginning, by ignoring Elizabeth and saying rude comments about her then when she stays at the house for a couple of days because her sister is sick, he starts to like her. It is charming to read about a guy who like this girl so much that he'll do anything to get her. In my opinion that is one sign of true love. Elizabeth isn't too fond of Mr. Darcy because of what he said about her, but he goes on in the book to prove his love for her and in the end win her over. Mr. Darcy has to go throuhg Elizabeth liking Wickham, Mr. Collins proposing to her, being turned down by Elizabeth with his first marriage proposal, and the critism from other older women about not marrying Elizabeth. The book shows how much one guy can love a girl and make everything happen."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"One never gets tired of reading Pride and Prejudice. I cannot remember how many times I have read it, but each time I do I enjoy it more and more. Jane Austen's Books never cease to take you back to a time when people cared about good manners, and people were expected to behave politely. Of course, the emphasis placed on marrying based almost exclusively on material things shows us what a long way we have come in some respects, but how little we have changed in others. Ultimately, this story is one about the triumph of true love despite obstacles, and is timeless in that sense."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austin was a fascinating author! Pride And Prejudice is by far one of her best novels. Her characters are so enduring and spontaneous. Every reader will not be able to help him or herself from falling in love with Elizabeth and her down to earth behavior. This is a romantic comedy as I see it for I found myself laughing at the humor and humiliation through out the whole novel. You don't have to love romantic novels to want to read this book. Pride And Prejudice is filled with the \\"Battle of Sexes\\" and the \\"Battles of the Richer and the Poorer!\\" You can be 13 or you can be 35 and you will still love the novel ever more. It is a story that has stood proudly against the tests of time and will continue to astonish its readers for years to come!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Written in the early XVIII Century, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is Jane Austen's most popular and loved novel - but not really her best. One of the first works she wrote, the novel is sometimes a little undercooked compared to her most complex works, like \\"Emma\\" and \\"Persuasion\\", however, it is still a joy to read. In this book, she created her most famous romantic hero in Mr Darcy, an unforgettable stubborn who makes a perfect match to Lizzie Bennet. They were meant for each other.The only problem is that they haven't figured it our. On the other hand, any reader can realize it from the first moment the couple meet. In other words, we do know how the book ends, so why do so many people keep reading, and rereading this novel? One reason is that Austen has created some very believable characters - and also very endearing. That's because they are very human. Lizzie and Mr Darcy have very wrong first impressions of each other when they met and that's why it takes so long for accepting their mutual love.In this sense, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a story about overcoming our prides and our prejudices acquire in the first impression, and changing one's mind. Both Lizzie and Mr Darcy realize before the end of the story they were made for each other - but the problem is that their wrong impressions lead them to make choices that become barriers to their love. The path they will have to follow in order to find the fully accomplishment of their mutual feelings is the strongest plot in the novel.At the same time, the reader is fed with details about class and courtship from the time the book was written. In Jane Austen's work, her characters are sometimes like small figurines that represent the whole world - or at least England. And the writer does it with charm and style. Her books are a document of a time, tackling its fashions, moral and behavior.Peguin Classics is probably the best edition, since it has many notes and an extensive introduction, dealing not only with Austen's works in general, but also with an detailed essay on this book. \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is one of those books that will be read forever, and should be read from people in different time of their lives. We find different approaches, and understanding as we grow older."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I love this book. I first read it when I was 16 and thought it was fantastic. Now, ten years later, it still remains my favorite book. I also love Austen's other novels."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"My wife is a Jane Austin fan so I gave this book to her for Christmas. We were teasing each other one night and as I lark I told her I would read it instead of the Star Wars and fantasy books that I usually read. So I actually did read it..... and strangely enough I loved it. This book is definitely geared towards women but there is more than enough substance that any man with any character would enjoy it as well.While you can tell that it was written nearly 200 years ago it's still easy to comprehend what's going on just like any modern day book. The characters are so rich and the twists and turns are so amazing that I just couldn't put it down. I really loved Elizabeth and her responses to people, especially to Lady Catherine near the end. It's amazing that Jane Austin was able to come up with all that witty dialogue. The conclusion for Elizabeth and Darcy and all the characters for that matter was just perfect. It's no wonder it's been a classic all these years.... it will be around for a long time still to come."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I am not one of Jane Austen's fans, not really. I love all kinds of books, but hers tend to bore me, with a glowing exception: \\"Pride and prejudice\\".I read \\"Pride and prejudice\\" (1813) more than 15 years ago, and I loved it immediately. I didn't have to read it for school, I just happened to buy it based on a whim. I didn't know who Jane Austen was, but I risked disappointment and tried a \\"new\\" author. Thankfully, I found a book that was well-written, but also thoroughly entertaining, engaging enough to catch the attention of a 12-year-old and keep it without difficulty.The plot is not overly complicated, and it tackles wonderfully themes such as relationships, love, class distinctions, and of course pride and prejudice, all from the point of view of what happened in 18th century England.The story begins in the small town where the Bennets live. Mrs. Bennet has five daughters, and her mission in life is marrying them off. Mr. Bennet is an intellectual, who often escapes to his library in search of silence and to avoid Mrs. Bennet's nonsense. The two more important daughters, from the point of view of the story, are probably the eldest, Jane (extremely beautiful and amiable) and the second, Elizabeth (witty but perhaps too proud).The dynamics of the town are changed when \\"a single man of large fortune\\", Mr. Bingley, arrives to Netherfield Park, an estate not far from town. Mr. Bingley comes with a friend, Mr. Darcy, and the Bennets meet both at a ball. While Mr. Bingley immediately caughts Jane's eye, and is considered nice by Elizabeth, Mr. Darcy has not such luck. By sheer chance, Elizabeth overhears him making a negative comment on her, something that hurts her pride and spurs her to consider him a hateful man. But will that change? And if so, how will that happen, given that Mr. Darcy is extremely conscious of his high social standing?Truth to be told, I liked the story, and the way in which Austen fleshed out the different characters through dialogues, instead of long winded descriptions. I also liked Elizabeth, and even though she was prone to mistakes, I preferred her to Jane, her extremely nice but too perfect sister. Moreover, I enjoyed reading about what sometimes happens to \\"hate at first sight\\" when time passes by, and how the main couple dealt with that, despite the fact that pride and prejudice made it difficult for them to really understand each other.Finally, I would like to highlight that I reread \\"Pride and prejudice\\" from time to time, and each time I am astonished by the amount of social criticism Jane Austen managed to include in what a first sight might have seemed an innocuous book. The author, who wrote \\"Pride and prejudice\\" in 1813, weaves in the story many themes that were relevant in 19th century England. Considerations of class are present throughout the book, and I think that the fact that Austen depicts so well their importance makes it easier for the modern reader to comprehend how constrictive they were. Austen also makes the attentive reader realize that the idea of marrying for love was a luxury very few women had then, as most had no other choice than to marry the first man that proposed. Elizabeth, who wanted to marry for love, was an exception rather than the rule.In my opinion, \\"Pride and prejudice\\" is the kind of book that never loses its charm, notwithstanding the age of the reader. All in all, I highly recommend this book as one that you will enjoy reading not only once, but many times. So, go for it :)Belen Alcat"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"When I first started reading Pride and Prejduice, I was 13 years old, and didn't understand it much.

The witty dialogue and the entertaining characters make this book quick and so much fun to read.Jane Austen does a brilliant job of portraying the 19th centuty woman's plight in Pride and Prejudice through Elizabeth and Jane Bennet. It was a time where women were only expected to do one thing in their life: marry and marry well. An outspoken and intelligent woman was looked down upon. A woman was not supposed to think, only to please the men in her life.Jane Austen was many years ahead of her time in portraying the unjust social restraints that women had to endure. Her books were the medium that she chose to express her feelings about the social situation of women.

Five daughters later, his estate is still slated to pass to a distant cousin, an obnoxious clergyman, because it can pass only to a man. Had there been a son, something could have been done, but as it is, the daughters' only hope of avoiding eventual poverty is marrying well, for themselves and for their mother.Our focus is on the second daughter, Elizabeth. More thoughtful than her sisters, she is her father's favorite. We are not the only ones to like Elizabeth, the prideful and immensely wealthy Mr. Darcy also finds himself falling for her. She rejects him because of the prejudice she has formed from his foster brother, the untrustworthy Mr. Wickham. The rest of the novel allows us to watch as these characters manoever to finally get into a position where they can accept each other.Absolutely stuffed with memorable characters and scenes. I rate it as her best, slightly better than Emma, but reasonable minds can differ about this one."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen certainly seems to have done a great job earning her name in the literary world. I can only imagine how difficult it was for her to have been able to earn such a status in the very much male dominated era that she belonged to. This book illustrates two major themes of that period - the somewhat male dominated society, and the class structure in the early 19th century England.At the beginning of the book Elizabeth Bennet the heroine of the novel seems doomed in every sense. She is both female, and does not have an inheritance that will earn her a respectable marriage. However, what she does possess are things that cannot be bought with money - she is by far the smartest woman in the book, and has an incredible sense of humor. It is in fact these two traits that the aristocratic Mr.Darcey finally finds irresistable, and leads to him proposing marriage not once, but twice. It is only at the very end of the book that Elizabeth gives in, and agrees to the marriage - much to the surprise of both her parents and her older sister. This marriage is significant in that it brakes steadfast barriers. It seems almost as though it is the beginning of the end for the English class structure.Jane Austen is a brilliant writer and you will find her work easy to follow. I can assure you that you won't regret reading it - I haven't, and I have read it many, many times. It is almost addictive."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"And that says a lot! Elizabeth Bennet is the second of five daughters in the Bennet household. She is a lively and good-humored young woman of high understanding and an open mind. However, she has one defect, she is too quick to judge. Especially so when Mr. Darcy comes to her neighborhood. Darcy appears to be of a reserved, haughty and proud disposition owing to his large fortune and noble birth. Lizzy adopts an immediate dislike of him. Mr. Wickham, whom Lizzy judges to be an amiable man, gives her further evidence of Darcy's unworthiness, and she is prepared to accept and believe it (She is prejudiced!). Darcy notices all the defects of her rather embarrassing family, low-connections and inferior wealth in comparison with his own (He is proud!). Just when you think it's a dead end, however, the barriers begin to crumble away as more and more of Darcy's real character is revealed. Through more dependable sources, she learns that he is in fact a good-hearted, charitable, just man, and the most surprising and unexpected revelation, that he has more than a strong regard for her.My favorite thing about this book is Austen's portrayal of society through her characters: the greedy and self-interested (Mr. Collins), the rich and snobbish (Lady Catherine de Bourgh), the small-minded and ridiculous (Mrs. Bennet and Lydia), the decietful and immoral (Mr. Wickham), and the kind-hearted and easily victimized (Bingley and Jane). The novel is one of the funniest I have ever read, and so entertaining. Mrs. Bennet seldom speaks of her 'nerves' or complains without making you laugh. It is not a slow read either, despite the popularity of the novel there are plenty of unexpected turns to keep you going. Beneath the entertaining quality of the novel there are lessons to be learned. Lizzy misjudges Darcy, Darcy misjudges Lizzy, she misjudges Wickam, Mr Bennet misjudges Mrs. Bennet when he married her, and Jane (Lizzy's older sister) misjudges Miss Bingley. It is perphaps eight months since the beginning of Lizzy's acquaintance with Darcy that she learns his true character, and every moment proves more and more how good a man he is. I liked Sense and Sensibility, but I love Pride and Prejudice. Lizzy and Darcy are positively the most adorable couple I have read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I thought this book was magnificent. It gave me wonderful insight into old England and early authors. But what makes me give this book 5 stars is the fact that it was truly enjoyable.

It has a timeless plot involving the survival of love when experienced by two different people, each in a very different social status. The utilization of wit and sophisticated humor along with an intricate plot kept me fascinated with the subject matter the entire time.

Despite its difficult language and rather lengthy descriptions and dialog, which tended to confuse me and cause me to lose interest at several points throughout the novel, the plot and events of this book left me in uplifted spirits and with the positive feeling that love truely can overcome any obstacle put in its way. The romance between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, as well as the relationship between Jane and Mr. Bingley, left me guessing throughout the entire novel, and motivated me to trudge through the somewhat uneventful chapters inbetween exciting events.

I have read it many times, four to be exact. Jane Austen is so witty and does a great job at telling this love story. As you read you begin to really know the characters.

Among the versions I recommend strongly are the version read by Irene Sutcliffe (Audio Partners/ Cover to Cover, or Chivers in the UK), and that by Kate Reading (Books on Tape, available from them).I found the Reading version very good overall, and outstanding for the portrayal of Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Mrs Bennet. The best scene, in my opinion, was that of Lady Catherine confronting Elizabeth in the garden at Longbourn. However, I found Elizabeth less easy to distinguish in certain other scenes from her sister Jane, and the men done not as well as I would have hoped. Mr Darcy was a disappointment, in that Kate Reading read his dialogue in a less stately manner than I had expected. However, the reading of the novel was overall very good as I have said. I noticed many little details and phrases that I had overlooked in many readings of this novel, and that I had also ignored in my stay at the Republic of Pemberley (a website dedicated to Austen).I have not yet had the pleasure of listening to the Irene Sutcliffe version, but I plan to buy it very soon. ...If you are rushed for time, or spend a lot of time in your car (or listening to tapes), or if you want to experience Austen in a different light, do try either reading."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This was my second Austen novel, my first being Sense and Sensibility. I liked the first, but was blown away by this one. I adored all the characters, and although I knew (like everyone else) the whole time what would happen in the end, I was still overjoyed when the novel was resolved. However, I was dissappointed. I didn't want it to ever end! That's the mark of a good book. When you're done with it, you wish you had never read it just so you could read it for the fist time again. That's exactly how I felt with this novel. I could read it forever. I would reccomend it to anyone who remotely enjoys reading."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Loved it. Gave me bags under my eyes, staying up late to read just one more chapter. I would highly recommend it to anyone that wants to feel gitty about a book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This timeless classic's appeal remains undiminished through the ages. Drawing on the universal topic of love and marraige, Jane Austen's most \\"sparkling\\" work addresses the role in society of women, social/class differences, and well...pride and prejudice...with scintillating wit. Producing two of literature's most loved protagonists, the witty Elizabeth Bennet and haughty Mr. Darcy, Pride and Prejudice remains a joy to read. Having inspired books and movies such as Bridget Jones' Diary, P&P is one of the must-reads of English literature!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"A beautiful novel. You can not find better writing than in this book. The words flow together so beautifully. While the romance is barely tangiable throughout the book, it still feels overwhelmingly strong. Proof that less can be more. I am thoroughly impressed with Jane Austen's writing style and only wish we would all speak in such a poetic tone.I have stated the obvious about such a wonderful classic, but this, by far, is my favorite novel."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"One of the best novels I have ever read. Jane Austen speaks out in mild but effective comical terms on the stupidity of tradition throughout the eighteenth century. Her main themes address the problems of true love, money and the importance of family life. She does this through the narrative of her highly regarded heroine Elizabeth Bennett. Through the love and devotion to her eldest sister we see Elizabeth at her best fighting for the interests of her family and connections. A wonderful novel of two sisters and their struggle for true love in a society with pecuniary worries and stations."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is certainly a great love story and will survive for generations.I would like to point out something. Perhaps some British peope or people familiar with British society will be able to give me a satisfactory answer. While Mr Darcy abhored people who are ill-bred, unsophisticated and mediocre it is diffcult to see how he could put up with people like Lady Catherine, Caroline Bingley and Louisa Hurst who are just as bad as Mrs Bennet, Kitty Bennet and Lydia Bennet. The latter group had less money and social status. Is this the reason ?"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Why is Jane Austen's work so popular even today? Because she was just the best! This is on my personal top ten list. I've read it at least ten times and probably will read it several times again. It's funny, it's smart, it's romantic, and Elizabeth Bennett is my all-time favorite fictional heroine. You can read this book when you're 16 and every ten years after that. All of Jane Austen's books are good, but this is her best - and a classic that should be part of every woman's education and every woman's personal library. It's also proof that a book can have sizzle without any explicit sex."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is one of my favorite books of all time. Jane Austen writes with impeccable wit and creates characters who are likeable, laughable, and very real. Pride and Prejudice is an absolute delight, Jane Austen at her best. Read it. If you are anything like me, you will be in heaven."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have read this novel several times, peeling away the layers looking for new meaning. As someone else stated earlier, P&amp;P is not Austen's deepest work; however, it still contains many levels of meaning. Superficially, there is the charming and *credible* romance. As one digs deeper, one can find lessons on how to read properly (as Elizabeth learns) as well as the layout of a new meritocracy based not on rank, but taste and intelligence. This is not a bland love story, but a quiet, faintly smiling attack on pride, tastelessness, vanity, prejudice and obliviousness. The portrayals of Mrs. Bennet, Caroline Bingley and Lady Catherine de Bourgh are masterpieces of sweet viciousness.Overall, Austen's late 18th century (*not* Victorian) work is a lovely balance of comedy and commentary, romance and drama. Fun, witty, but not swoony or saccharine, Pride &amp; Prejudice should please all but the most proud &amp; prejudiced reader (or the utterly unintelligent), for it is a charming novel, near to perfection."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I HAVE READ THIS BOOK AT LEAST THREE TIMES BY NOW AND EVERY TIME I NOTICE SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND GET MORE OUT OF IT. I WAS COMPELLED INTO READING IT BY MY MUM ABOUT A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AND REALLY ENJOYED IT. FROM READING THE BACK OF THE BOOK IT SOUNDS AS THOUGH IT IS ONLY SERIOUS AND A ROMANCE TOLD BY THE HEROIN OF THE STORY , ELIZABETH,ABOUT CURTSHIP AND SCANDEL, BUT I SURPRISED MYSELF BY LAUGHING AT THE COMMENTS MADE BY THE AUTHOR THROUGHOUT THE BOOK. JANE AUSTEN WAS OBVIOUSLY NOW AND AGAIN PICKING FUN AT THE IDEAS OF FASHIONABLE SOCIETY OF THAT TIME, ESPECIALLY ON COURTSHIP AND MARRIDGE AND MANY TIMES AT THE CHARACTERS SHE INVENTS. SHE ALSO MAKES MANY OF HER CHARACTERS REALISTIC AND WRITES HER BOOK COMPASSIONATELY SHOWING AN UNDERSTANDING OF PEOPLES EMOTIONS AND THEIR OWN OPINIONS. I WOULD RECCOMEND READING THIS BOOK EVEN IF ITS VERY DIFFERENT TO YOUR USUAL TYPE OF GENRES AS I UNEXPECTANTLY ENJOYED IT ALTHOUGH I USUALLY STICK TO THRILLERS AND HORROR. THIS WAS A GOOD AND AMUSING CHANGE."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"because nobody does it like Miss Austen. Even the minor characters are immortal -- Mr. Collins, Mr. Bennett, Lady Catherine in particular -- these are characters without which our imaginations would be the poorer, would they not?As to Elizabeth, one can only lament that she is fictional, and not a real woman one could fall madly in love with...New readers of Austen, please note: although she writes about a period when women were in certain ways subordinate, she makes it clear that at least some women considered themselves to be essentially free and equal, and succeeded in holding their own, or more than their own, in their relations with the other sex. If I may venture to say so, her best women are both quite feminine and quite strong &amp; spirited. Her best men respect those qualities. So my recommendation is to read her with an open mind, and not let the social customs -- so different from our own -- prevent you from seeing the real human virtues (and vices) of her characters."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I absolutely love this book. It is easy to see why so many of today's love stories are based on Jane Austen's work. It is the perfect mix of humor and sincerity.

I would definitely recommend this edition to anyone."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This was the book I had been looking for - it is one of six in a series of Jane Austens'work. It is my favorite - the love story of Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy. I would recommend this book to every woman to read - it transports you to a time of so much traditions, social manners and Miss Austen does an excellent job of explaining the ways of the English gentry at that time. It is a wonderful love story and I am so happy that I found all six of the novels by Miss Austen in this series."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen, how can you go wrong?!

Anyway, this was to replace an old crumbling version of the book so I contacted the publisher (haven't heard back) and won't read anymore- too disappointing. I love books and cherish this one - so maybe it won't bug you as much. But to me it is absolutely unacceptable to copy a book incorrectly. Who knows how many other errors there are. Since the publisher hasn't responded I'm writing this review here to warn others to pick another version.EDIT - January 6, 2010 - The publisher just got back to me and they were phenomenal - they took the time to show me the proofs used from the original version, etc and they will be revising this in June, coming out with a corrected edition. They clearly love and care for books as much as I would hope - so do not hesitate to buy from this publisher."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"From time to time I read a critical opinion on Pride and Prejudice that, while acknowledging its excellence, wonders why Jane Austen could not in her genius provide some more gravitas. It's rather more observant and intelligent than your run-of-the-mill romance, to be sure, but a romance it is at bottom. No political savvy, no real attempt to face the role of women in Regency England, just a cute love story with an enjoyably satirical bent. Miss Jane herself seemed to agree with that assessment - she once called it \\"a little bit, two inches wide, of ivory\\". Decorative, but hardly important.Would someone please tell me what these people were reading? It certainly isn't the same book that I read. Or the one that thousands of people have fallen in love with and has produced at least four separate movie and television versions (which is a detail that allows me to give away certain plot points below, confident that most people already know them).It is indeed a very romantic love story, if by romance we mean the attempt of people to open themselves up and accept each other with their good and bad qualities - not only accept each other, but admire each other and want to be together just as they are. That process is difficult enough in this day and age, with the whole lot of us positively encouraged to be as frank as possible. Back in Miss Jane's day it seems to have been a good deal harder, what with the restrictions placed on people in the way of acceptable behavior and the disastrous consequences for breaking the social rules.If, however, we understand \\"romance\\" to mean the story of a woman who doesn't know her own mind, who has been so hurt that she can't stand the thought of love, who is too headstrong to allow anyone to tame her, and/or who eventually finds her way into the arms of a muscular hero type and melts on the spot (which is, after all, exactly what happens in plenty of perfectly good romance novels), that's not precisely what we have here. To be sure, the heroine of Pride and Prejudice does indeed begin the story entirely too headstrong to submit to marriage for its own sake, and she certainly finds her way into the arms of a man she previously despised (offstage, of course), but she doesn't exactly melt. It would be more accurate to say that she learns to think for herself. Whereas before she rejected her society's more foolish standards by reflex, she gradually comes to accept or reject what she's told by thinking it over first. And people think that Jane Austen didn't consider the place of women in her world? That there's no understanding of the big picture in Pride and Prejudice? Baloney.Now, Pride and Prejudice doesn't mention the big picture very often, although it's always present. The Bennett sisters get into trouble largely because a company of militia moves into a nearby village, and you and I both know that they're there to drill and train because at some point they will probably have to go fight against Napoleon Bonaparte, even though no one ever mentions his name. The sisters also have problems because they have no brothers, and know that a distant male relative will therefore inherit their house when their father dies. Rather than complain about these various disasters, though, the author shows us what their effects are upon the family in its daily life - the temptation to a group of young woman of handsome men in uniform hanging around, the scramble for advantageous marriages, and of course the question of whether one ought to seek a man one loves or a man with money if one can't have both. Great authors know, especially when it comes to two-inch pieces of ivory, that it's much more powerful to show the impact of great historical events than to talk about them. Jane Austen was a very great author.If she simply showed the workings of her society, though, she would have been simply a very good essayist, not a great author. Fortunately for us, she was also an extraordinary stylist, and she had an enormous gift for irony, very much on display in Pride and Prejudice right from the famous first sentence. That same twinkle remains in Miss Jane's eye right through the first sentence of the last chapter - \\"Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennett got rid of her two most deserving daughters.\\" Few authors would dare spend hundreds of pages setting up two weddings and then dismiss them both like that. It's positively delicious. With that kind of language, that sly inclusion of social criticism and such intriguing characters as Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy, you can call Pride and Prejudice a cute little romance if you want, but I'm warning you - it has hidden depths.Don't let that scare you, though. I told you, it's delicious.

Wonderful book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Absolutely incredible. This creative love story shows the trials and triumphs or a man and a woman destined to be together."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Forget the rest of her novels. Due to Austen's limited society the themes remain startingly similiar and the characters repeat. Elizabeth Bennet and Darcy however, deserve your undivided attention."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I had never read this book as a young person and am really enjoying the author. The version of writing is slow to read and comprehend, but the story is captivating."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is one of those books I pushed myself to get halfway through, thinking it would get interesting, only to force myself to finish it since I already read half of it. While there may be no accounting for taste or I'm just missing something, I'm not sure how anyone can enjoy reading this. It ultimately boils down to some sisters trying to marry (up, for the most part) in the world. I guess, if I try real hard, I can see some people imagining themselves in the scenes and enjoying the idea of living in the same town, wearing the same clothes, going to the same events, etc., but nothing really ever happens. It just goes on and on and on, only to lead this sister ending up with that guy, this sister ending up with that guy, etc."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I am so disappointed. Being a fan of classic literature I was looking forward to reading Pride & Prejudice. But what I got was moderately-well written chick lit. Think of Pride and Prejudice as the Bridgit Jones of the 18th Century.The story-line is predictable - you know how the whole novel is going to play out after the first couple of pages. The only thing that kept me going was the hope that there would be some little twist. Maybe Jane would end up with Darcy, or something a little more interesting. Unfortunately not.I honestly think Austen was writing a parody of women. The only concern of every female character in the book is to get married to a rich, well-to-do gentleman. Of course, some will argue that Elizabeth is different, but as she states herself, her interest in Darcy is only aroused when she sees what a wonderful estate he owns and considers that she may be the lady of it. Each of the female characters are shallow, self-centred (Jane excepted) and vacuous.On the positive side, some of the characters are interesting - Mr. Bennet is amusing, and Darcy started out being intriguing before turning into a school girl-like idiot.Perhaps, if you're a fan of straight-down-the-line, predictable romantic (semi comedic at times) novels then you might enjoy this. But don't expect to find a masterful tale, expertly told. Unfortunately that is what I was expecting (it being a \\"classic\\" and all) and I was totally disappointed. I really think this is one of the worst books I have ever read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Most people will probably hate me for writing this review about a classic, but I found Pride and Prejudice a terrible bore. Everyone knows what it's about, so I won't use up my time telling you. But the book is really sort of a nightmare that never ends. It is not romantic or charming in the least bit. The main character comes through as arrogant and at times even stupid. It is a completely forgetable book, and I have no clue as to why so many people find it romantic. The writing is good, it has it's moments, but it in no way makes up for this book's lack of everything else. Wuthering Heights and Little Women, other classics that are just about in the same genre, are by far superior. I was so disappointed I have not read another book by Austen, and I'm not planning on it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"god forbid i be so bold as to trash a classic. and yes, maybe because of all the raving reviews from my friends and from the book's great reputation, i entered it with high expectations. - which the book however did not satisfy. yes, it is a good comedic parody of the upper class of the time, a lampoon of the courtship ritual, and of course oh so witty, blah blah blah, but it just wasn't my cup of tea. the main character was likeable, but that aside, i found it completely insufferable to read through, and absolutely painfully boring. every subsequent event from the very beginning could be predicted, let alone the ending. not that anything really ever happens - the entire book could be summed up with, \\"then they walked and talked and had tea and walked and talked and had tea, walked and talked and had more tea, then got married and lived happily ever after.\\" the entire novel was a headache of girly gossip and mental drama. it would save more time just to watch a chick flick. so if you're interested in the relationship fiascos of fictious characters, witnessing the agony over who's going to marry who (even though the reader could already predict the happily-ever-after match-making light-years in advance), then this is the book for you!! if not, then i suggest picking up some dan brown."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I am new to kindle books and found this book for free. Boy, make sure you go in and READ about the book before you even download it. I can read a book in a day this book took me over a week to read. I COULD NOT stay with this book. I made myself finish it but was driving myself nuts doing so. I didn't even want to give this book one start. I am so glad I did not have to purchase this I would of wanted my money back."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have wanted to read this novel for a long time because of all the great reviews. Finally I had the chance to read it and personally I am disgusted. I tried really hard to see what people love about the book. I cannot see it. There is no true love in the book, the characters are shallow and there is absolutely no story. It talks through the entire book of these five sisters marrying. I think that they are al pompous and rather annoying. I do have to say that Elizabeth is my favorite character as she doesn't seem to be as sucked in to the society nearly as much, but I do not see what there is in this book that has given it all the wonderful reviews. Though I do encourage all to reaad it and see for themselves what it is like. From the reviews people either LOVE it or HATE it there are no in-betweens. Good-luck to all I hope you see more than I did."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It appears that the odds are against me since most people love this...I don't even know what to call it. And that is perfectly fine we are not all a like and have a right to our own views and opinions. Nevertheless, I must speak out and let my opinon be heard even though most of you who can't say enough about this book wouldn't want to hear.I am forced to read this book for my lit class and I find this book repulsive. I have never read such a novel that is completly incompetant, complete nonsence, the smallest talks of all the small talks in the world, it is about nothingness, and how several nothings trying and wanting to get married to other nothings for all the wrong reasons in the world. It is about people pretending to be inteligent and pretending to be civilized. It is a book where they compliment women as being handsome and men as being well...also handsome. It is quite contageous I might add because I find myself helplessly imatitating the language that it was written in. I am offended by every paragraph that I read. I have never felt such contemt for any work that I read. I pasionately despise this novel and I could write an entire paper on why. The 17th century English aristocracy and the way the people cary and behave themselves and think so highly of themselves and so low of anybody who is different, is offensive and without merit. You may think &quot;that I simply don't understand this work&quot; well I don't and I am not going pretend that I understand this &quot;classic&quot; Perhaps I am incapable of comprehending this novel. I do know however that there are a lot finer book writen in the 17th centuries and earlier and after, which are better, more meaningful then this book and are also classic but some of them are notoverated enough as much as this book is."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is a classic. I decided to order it to add to my library. When I received the book, I realized it was unabridged meaning everything is a literal translation.

I search Fiction, it's there - okay, it's droll, but it's an okay novel, and it fits the genre.

I don't have a drawing room, Amazon, so you're not doing me any favors. Time to sort out the categories."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is without question the worst book I've ever read in my entire life. The style is clumsy though the author strives to impress with an aristocratic pompousness so typical of social climbers of her day. The characters are cold, their development dull and boring and Austen's every attempt to portray the most basic of human relationships falls well short, getting completely tangled in ridiculously elite language that was in its day and remains still completely outdated. Commoners did not speak like that then, nor do they now. I would rather endure a daily root canal than read this book again. It was almost as inspirational as witnessing a mountain top removal to mine coal. It doesn't surprise me that her original manuscript was rejected as it should have been and now I wonder to what extent politics played a role in her eventual success? Perhaps zero of five stars would be more accurate..."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It might be a classic, and &#34;old&#34; book, but really interesting to learn about past times and a very particular society.beautifully narrated by Jane Austin, in my opinion on of her best books.

Thanks"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Marvelous classic love story, a really great read. I would recommend it to anyone, Jane Austen's writing is entertaining and extremely amusing"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have to agree -- Pride and Prejudice is a wee bit, well -- BORING.I don't know what it is. Maybe I just didn't get it -- but that's not like me at all. I don't find classic in general very hard to understand. I've read plenty of classics and both loved and understood them.No, it's not that I didn't understand, it's just that the story takes so long to kick off. It begins with our shero Elizabeth and her pathetic clan of sisters who struggle to appease society by appearing either beautiful, accomplished, well-connected or all three.As most main characters do, Elizabeth stands out from her sisters. She doesn't attempt to be pretty or accomplished and could care less about impressing any man. Her main concerns are caring for her family and remaining witty, independent, and free. She further scandalizes the neighborhood with this rebellious nature by -- gasp! -- walking a few miles in the rain and mud to care for her sick sister! The nerve!And meanwhile, the famous Mr. Darcy seems if anything cold, distant, and rude. He has a slight interest in Elizabeth, but that seems to be all. For this reason I was slightly shocked when I saw the commercials for the movie version of this book -- why, Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth were kissing!I must have read more than half the novel and they didn't so much as shake hands! I finally gave up and moved on to more interesting works of fiction -- but, hey, if you like and understand this novel, then good for you! Meanwhile, the rest of us would like to get back to the more admirable Miss Jane Eyre."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have read this book a number of times, and tried to like it; but; the characters lack depth. Lizzy, and to an extent Charlotte are the only two who are 3D. Jane Austen\`s ideas of poverty are laughable, large house complete with servants is not poor. Mr.Darcy great on video but passionless in the text."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I wish that I can rate 0 star, not the novel itself but the book and it's quality. The cover is very nice, but the pages inside are of very very poor quality.... If I had known it would be that kind of, I would definitely buy a better edition."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This was indeed one of the most foolish novels I have ever read. I found the conflict boring and without point, and the theme horribly expressed (was there any at all). Such that I find it amazing that the behaviors of an aristocratic woman in the 19th century wound actually be of interest to ANYONE. The themes are indeed NOT universal, and if anything, it should be derived from simple everyday life - there is no need to write a book about it. The infamous character portrayals seem hugely worthless. Such a book is suited at best for the coffee table. Two stars because I never had the energy to finish the entire book, so I might have missed the so called \\"good parts\\" of it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"An Ok book for anyone who's into that sort of thing i suppose but come on, it isn't very believable in some places. Take for instance the supposed intelligence of one Elizabeth Bennet who is initially so incredibly blinded by her own prejudice that she cannot see Mr. Darcy for who he really is. Am i the only person who thinks that were Elizabeth so intelligent then she must be able to look at things from both sides of the coin as the saying goes. To be honest with you for it's time it is an excellent Romance novel but it's just the niggling little things like that that kinda make you think that had more thought gone into it it could have been so much better..."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The font is too small. I'm not sure what point the author is trying to get across with this tiny font, but it fell on deaf ears, mostly because I couldn't read the book. I tried using a magnifying glass, but because I like reading outside the pages caught on fire. The book's only redeeming quality is the picture of a pretty dress on the front."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"ok phan... what do you think of the proceedings?daedalus bs... what we list?Firestone"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"though boring at the start, if u are a lover u gotta love it at the end. u have to read it once in a life time!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I purchased and read Pride and Prejudice so that I would be able to understand Pride and Prejudice and Zombies before reading it. In other words, I wanted to read Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, but in order to prepare I first purchased and read Pride and Prejudice.Pride and Prejudice sucks. Basically, it is extremely boring, even for a character-driven story. I consider myself an open minded person and I have read and enjoyed some character driven stories such as Jane Eyre, Crime and Punishment, and The Great Gatsby. With all of those books I could tell why the books were classsic; they had well developed characters who interacted in a way that was either entertaining enough, or had sufficient underlying philosophical or social subtext, that a person could read these books with a sense of interest.The problem with Pride and Prejudice is that it essentially seems to amount to a story about a fictionalized idealized version of herself as an intelligent somewhat socially unacceptable woman in the context of English upper class society who is able to tell people off in socially acceptable ways, be smarter than her sisters, and meet a grumpy, intelligent socially unacceptable man to marry. It is boring because it basically doesn't have any social commentary or philosophical suspect besides for \\"smart chix roxxorz\\" or perhaps \\"nerds for t3h win\\" and it is basically a self-referential story which continues ad nauseum. I cannot understand for a moment why Pride and Prejudice is considered a classic and not the literary equivalent of trashy internet fan fiction with a Mary Sue lead character. Actually, I recall reading somewhere that Charlotte Bronte basically panned Pride and Prejudice in a review as being boring as hell.I would recommend reading Jane Eyre over Pride and Prejudice because even though Jane Eyre is essentially another self referential fantasy about being a slightly socially awkward smart woman in the context of English society there are actual physical events that happen in the story that can somewhat hold your interest and actual entertaining fleshed out characters besides for the main character, whereas I get the feeling that Pride and Prejudice is basically a gripe about how everyone else is so shallow. If you're going to do that at least be entertaining about it like in The Great Gatsby. Trying to finish off Pride and Prejudice just caused me a lot of stress and pain and I had to force myself to keep reading. And I've read a lot of things in my lifetime that would bore most people into depression and somnolence.Actually my real recommendation for if you want a good piece of classic literature with developed characters, but you don't want to deal with the anemic pale flabby social dissatisfaction of a book like Pride and Prejudice, you should instead read something by Alexandre Dumas like The Count of Monte Cristo or The Three Musketeers. Those books are written in a convoluted classical style (read it in French for extra points!), they have real characters, they have character interaction, but they're also event-driven rather than exclusively character-driven; actual physical events, rather than conversations at dinner parties, drive the story lines. The lead characters actually do things like engage in hand to hand combat, pilfer fine wines, and manipulate international politics, whereas the people in Pride and Prejudice just bad mouth each other at a dinner table. (Jane Austen doesn't even tell us what they're eating and drinking; at least Alexandre Dumas tells us how his heroes infiltrated no-man's-land and were taking fire but had brought a picnic basket with food and wine from a specific region and were having lunch and making fun of the enemy from behind cover.) And given how busy modern life is, do you really want to spend hours of your precious time reading about pale anemic English people bad mouthing each other over dinner over ridiculous inconsequential things, and not about musketeers taking fire while making snarky comments and knocking back wine? I mean, seriously."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I did not have a favorite chapter but the chapter that I found most interesting is chapter eight because in that chapter Elizabeth and Darcy meet again at the Bingley's house and Darcy feels dumb because Elizabeth had rejected him, and they had not seen each other since that had happened.I feel that this book is for the age group of 20-40 and I think that it's more for girls then guys. I'm not trying to sound sexist, but I don't think that guys would find the story interesting.One literary device that I appreciate is the conflict between Elizabeth and Darcy. Elizabeth does not like Darcy at first, and she rejects him when he proposed. But then she falls in love with him.I found the book all right; it was not that boring. However it was really long and I did not have enough time to read it and understand it well. I would not read this book again because it's not my type of book. I would rather read about action or something that relates to me, or that is interesting to me.BY Manuel Rosales"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have to admit I loved Sense and Sensibilty.

Very interesting as how women where suppose to behave. I'm glad we've as women have evolved."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a thread of ammunition in today's literary cannon. Being that it is, I felt I should read it. The plot in the book is very straight forward. Having been produced in the 19th century and entailing the reader with a striking and classic love scenario gives it historical leverage. What other 19th century novel can intertwine social class, love, and crazy parents?Austen's portrayal of social class played a responsibility in the novels greatness. Binding social class and love conveyed it to the current time. I especially enjoyed when the book started to occlude and Elizabeth was confronted by Lady Catherine regarding her love for Mr. Darcy. That moment was significant because it showed that social class does not dignify a person's love. Imagine you were teaching this tale to high school students: They could feed off of it in so many ways.I will admit that this work of fiction was complex at times, but the more I asked questions, the easier it was to understand. I watched the movie (2006 version) after I finished the book. Everything that I had envisioned the book to be about was correlated directly in the movie. The benefit of watching the movie was that it sufficed some of the minimal elements in Austen's book I was unsure of. I may read this book again, and if I do I would like to have a group to read it with. It always helps to talk out-loud distinguished novels like Pride and Prejudice so readers can pin-point missed segments and unlock blocked thoughts."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is a pleasant classic with a wonderful story. The book was at times difficult to understand; however, I especially enjoyed the mother character."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"After reading Northanger Abbey and enjoying it so much, I decided that I would take another stab about Jane Austen and I am very glad that I did. I chose Pride and Prejudice because it is one of her better known novels and has been turned into numerous movies as well as a recent adaptation titled Pride and Prejudice and Zombies. The story is about Elizabeth Bennet who is a strong willed and outspoken young woman as she tries to find her true love. The most interesting aspect of the story is not Elizabeth's hunt for love, but her relationship with her parents. Mrs. Bennet is a flighty woman whose main goal in life is to have her daughters wed to wealthy men. While, Mr. Bennet is a sarcastic and cynical man with no interest in martial affairs. Elizabeth's contrasting parental figures is detrimental to all of the daughters and even places them in danger.Most people identify this novel with the relationship between outspoken Elizabeth and cocky Darcy. However, there is much more to the story than their love.Still, I am looking forward to reading Linda Berdoll's sequel titled Darcy Takes a Wife."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"For the first time ever, I liked the movie (w/Colin Firth version) way better than the book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I'm not really qualified enough to give the comments for this wonderful classic book.

Throughout the book you are triggered into seeing if Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth are ever gonna get hooked up.

It's a tonic against stupidity. I also recommend the A&amp;E video production. So well cast &amp; produced you are able to focus on the story &amp; not be distracted by production issues (e.g. &quot;THAT's different from the book...&quot;). My ultimate test for the relevance of a story is how many lines I plagiarize from it to use in normal conversation, and this story has some classics. My favorite is &quot;I am most seriously displeased.&quot;My husband has a new cliche: &quot;what's better than one wedding at the end of a jane austen story?

It was on the requirements list for my literature course at school, but I found it so compelling that I finished reading it at home! I especially loved the ending-it's so romantic! I also congratulate Jane Austen's sense of humour and her ability to create such diverse characters that seem so realistic. I thought Mrs. Bennet's empty-headed, foolish character was the funniest &amp; so incredibly contrasting to that of the cool-headed one of Mr.Bennet.

Jane Austen has been my favorite of authors ever since. To date, I have read the book three times in less than three years. I have fallen in love with both Lizzy and Darcy each time, and consider them great friends. Mr. Collins never fails to make me laugh, nor does Mr. Bennet.

Although I have read it countless times now, I still discover something new every time. The more I find out about the wonderful Jane Austen, the richer my reading of this fabulous story becomes. 'Pride and Prejudice' is romantic, witty, sad and frustrating (those who have read it will know that I am talking about annoying little Lydia). Mr Collins is a hoot! Mr Bennett is the epitome of patience, (a characteristic obviously developed by years of coping with his wife's &quot;poor nerves&quot;.) And Lizzie and the arrogant Mr Darcy? What can I say about them that fellow readers don't already know? For those of you who are thinking; &quot;What does she mean?&quot;; go and buy the book and READ it!

It focuses on the demands of being married to well off men, the prejudices they have to face and the pride of the gentlemen who thought themselves more supperior. Jane, Elizabeth, and their other sisters have to face allot of discrimination towards their wealth and their family connections. Jane and Elizabeth are the oldest, the prettiest, the wisest, and the most favoured in the higher circles of society. Even so when Jane falls in love with Mr Bingley an \`Eligible' young bachelor, Mr Darcy and the Mr Bingley's sisters dissuade him from this \`most unsuitable match'. Her mother was vaulger, she had little fortune and her younger sisters would be a bad connection.

I loved the language, the romance, the characters, even the choice of adjectives... (tolerably well... , and so on) But the point is... Do these things happen, in the real world?

And considering that I am a reasonably good-looking, tolerably clever, 30 years old Italian man, who doesn't see many chances of finding a girlfriend beacuse of his ill attitude... well, let me confess you that I am starting to feel a bit perplexed (and worried) about my future...

I wanted to read this because everyone was saying that it was such a great book and that its timeless and yadda, yadda, yadda.So I was a little iffy on the first volume, but I could handle all the cliches, the social ranks, and the writing. Around the middle of voume two, i started screaming at the book (screaming at inanimate objects-never a good sign) because i was so fed up with it. I couldn't get myself to get really into it like my fellow peers. Maybe its because I'm 14, but I don't get it. The writing is boring, its too cliched, too old-fashioned, annoying and I know that the lovers are supposed to be in passionate love and all, but it feels cold-no love or passion, just boring. I found myself falling asleep in the middle of every chapter after chapter 16. Maybe its just me, I don't know, but I did not like this book, at all. I can understand why people of Jane Austen's time would adore this book, but i don't understand how people of OUR time can enjoy this. If you're looking for a good British classic romance, Wuthering Heights, not Pride and Prejudice."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Elizabeth is twenty years old, living in the Victorian ages in England. Life is a bit tricky for her. She lives with her overbearing mother, disinterested father, older sister Jane and three younger sisters, Mary, Catherine and Lydia. They are a reasonably well-to-do family for the moment, although once Elizabeth's father dies, their estate and any fortune he has left will go to a male relative, as he was unable to produce any sons. With the prospect of becoming destitute looming over her, Elizabeth's mother is desperate to get her five daughters, all in their late teens or early twenties, married off to wealthy men.The first man to come to her attention is Mr. Bingley, an eligible man who becomes their neighbor. Sure enough, he shortly becomes captivated by Jane, and everything seems on track for the two of them to become engaged. When there is interference from his sisters and his best friend, Mr. Darcy, Elizabeth's family is thrown into turmoil.Mr. Darcy is almost universally disliked. He doesn't dance at the neighborhood balls. He doesn't engage in polite conversation or otherwise make himself seem social. After overhearing an unkind comment about herself from him, he loses any favor he might have had with Elizabeth. She goes out of her way to describe his odious nature to all who will listen. Despite his earliest impression of her, though, Mr. Darcy soon comes to find Elizabeth quite enthralling. What measures will he go to in order to change her mind and win her admiration?I liked the intertwining of lives in this story and some of the descriptions of what life was like living in the countryside back in the day. However, the story is limited by the time and style in which it was written. The plot drags along and the narrator spends far too much time dwelling on unemotional descriptions of scenery. I'm not sure if it was the intention of this story, but my strongest impression after reading it was that the life of those living in the upper class in England at this time had the most excruciatingly boring lives I can imagine. The characters in this story seemed constantly looking for anything to break the monotony of their day-to-day lives, and that impression didn't add much excitement to the book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I understand that Pride and Prejudice is an honored classic. However, for me personally, I finally listened to myself and put the book away after reading about half of the story. The problem is that the characters are shallow and pretentious, and are simply not very likable or compelling. I think the novel, with all its gossipy nature, is the 1812 version of celebrity gossip television shows.I have read most of the English classics from the 1800s, including truly great romance novels such as Wuthering Heights or Tess of the D'UrberVilles, but sadly, found Pride and Prejudice to be boring and not worth my time. Full disclosure, as a middle-aged male, I may not actually be the target audience for the book. However, it should appeal to young women about the same age as the protagonists.Updated years later: Forced myself to finish reading the novel; I stick with my original \\"thumbs way down\\" assessment. The characters are all air-headed twits, shallow and stupid. A waste of my time, and I have no idea how it became a classic. Guys, this book is not for you - it is for young women."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a story on how one family of five girls try to fall in love all in one year. Drama starts when the young Elizabeth Bennett crosses upon a gentlemen by the name of Mr. Darcy who soon falls madly in love with her. While thats going on, Elizabeths older sister, Jane has fallen in love with Mr. Bingley, the \\"new neighbor\\" in their town. This book is full of love triangles, gossip and old fashion \\"love talk\\".I don't really like this book because, it was hard to follow because the wording was dated far back. There are also too many conversations going on in just one page! I would reccomend this book to adults and teenagers above the age of 15. If you don't like romance novels, don't even dare to pick up this book.I still think Jane Austen is a good author. She demonstrates a lot of personality in one person and sometimes it feels like you were almost in the book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book made me laugh, it makes fun of the 18 century society and mocks all their greatness. It is a must read, must have. Great way of telling the story and it is bitchin' how all falls into place at the end."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Although it started out very slow in the first few chapters, the rest of the book made it all worth reading. It captivates you and takes you on a ride of emotions."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"First, let me be clear: I love the story behind Pride and Prejudice. Yes, it has a simple \\"nothing much happens\\" plot, but so do some of the best stories ever written. The storyline of P&P; gets 5 stars from me.But the book...while I love and deeply appreciate Austen's vivid imagination and deep understanding of human nature, her writing style is just plain boring. I think of it as Dickens-esque, back in the day when writers were paid by the word. Descriptive detail in a book, when properly used, enhances the story. And details that give background information can generate major interest and hold a reader's attention, again, if done properly. But dry descriptions, needlessly strewn in and testing the limits of patience, detract from the plot and feel of the book. No doubt in the early 19th century, when this book was written, people were fascinated by every last little word on the page -- after all, their lives were filled with the same tedium that fills the book.The adulation for this book reminds me of a sycophantic love-fest. It is \\"known\\" that this book is a paragon of English lit, and if you disagree with that opinion, you just don't \\"get\\" quality literature, or you aren't sophisticated/educated enough to appreciate it. Well, I definitely \\"get\\" it, and I'm not afraid to say that it was dull, and say furthermore that the book could have been cut in half and suffered no major losses.P&P; stands out for me, because it is the almost the only instance where I prefer the movie ('95 mini-series, anyway) version to the book. That never happens for me, normally the book is indescribably more satisfying than the screen, but this book is the notable exception. The mini-series distills down the storyline (which, again, I think is one of the best in English literature) to its heart, and whittles away everything that is superfluous until all that is left is one of the greatest love stories of all time. Sadly, the book falls short of imparting that level of satisfaction."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"People who order this cassette should be wary!

I have to admit than Austen does have some pretty slow-moving novels, but this is not one of them. The characters are very lively and real. Austen really does a good job of creating a very charming and truly fairy tale-like situation. This is my favorite book to date."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"There are many audiobooks version of this time-honored classic, but I found that LA theatre's works's lively dramatized version pales other reading versions. For one thing, various actors play out the parts of the story. Granted, there are many ommision for this two hour audioplay, but essentially, it retains the very essence of the story."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen has created a very believable world in P&amp;P. Although the book's official theme is marriage, it is also a statement on human behavior. The problems suffered by the characters are the result of their own folly, and no one else. The love story woven into the book is also wonderful, as it shows the characters concerned getting to know each other's positives and negatives before committing, instead of simply jumping into bed as the characters of modern novels do. This book is smartly written, with much humor. It is lighthearted and easy to read, although it was written over 200 years ago (the first draft of the book was written in the late 1700s, but not published until after 1800). I highly recommmend it to a reader of any age. It is, as Elizabeth Bennet would say, a &quot;happy thought, indeed.&quot;"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It feels a little strange and even presumptuous to review Jane Austen online. I was prompted to do so when reading other reviews dismissing Pride and Prejudice as nothing more than a silly romance and a relic of a bygone era.It would be silly to suggest that the social mores and manners that Austen skewered are unchanged. Young women are no longer dependent on a husband simply for food and shelter, and I have no intention of spending my life in a drawing room trimming hats and sewing screens. But it would also be silly to suggest that Austen's tale offers nothing to the modern reader. Even in our enlightened age, young women in indelicate situations are pressured by their humiliated families into unfortunate marriages. Manifestations of social standing may differ, but money, education, and other modern expressions of social class still play more of a role in the choice of spouses than most of us would wish to admit. And to this day, young men and women alike are mortified by their families in public situations, justified or unjustified.To fully appreciate Austen's sense of humor takes a bit of effort on the reader's part, but once acclimated to the language the hilarity of the book becomes apparent. Pride and Prejudice proves that classics need not be dull; Austen had a lively and sharp wit. If you are truly put off by the language, and don't get the humor, it's actually worthwhile to find a good production on video and rent it. The BBC version produced in the 1990's is long, but a very faithful and extremely well-cast adaptation that does an excellent job of translating Austen's humor onto the screen."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I love this novel. It has everything you could possibly want in a book. Love, hate, comedy, and more. Every time Lizzy and Mr. Darcy are in the same room you can expect some kind of comedy. Lizzy's bizarre family (not counting Jane) would drive any man away.If Mr. &amp; Mrs. Bennet were real I wouldn't be able to understand how he could possibly stay married to this rude and ill-mannered woman. But since they're only characters in a book I would have to say that they are a perfectly matched couple. Each one posseses what the other does not.If you can get past the old English that Jane Austen wrote in, this is a great read and a wonderful romantic comedy."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I always love reading about romance in England. Especially in the 17th &amp; 18th century. This book was no exception. Jane Austen dwells deep into human nature. How Elizabeth's pride is damaged, when Darcy refuses to dance with her &amp; becomes prejudiced against him by Mr. Wickham. How Darcy slowly finds himself falling in love with Elizabeth. All this is potrayed marvellously by Jane Austen. I loved it so much that I've read it about 5 times till now!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"My mother has been trying to foist this book off on me for years, but I always resisted. I thought that the stodgy language, Victorian morality, and melodramatic romance would be tiresome and trite. I could not have been more wrong. I instantly fell in love with Elizabeth Bennett, the young heroine of this novel and the \\"prejudice\\" referred to in the book's title.Of course, the \\"pride\\" is the insufferable Mr. Darcy, who looks down upon Elizabeth, her four sisters and her ridiculously self-absorbed mother. However, what begins as outright animosity between Lizzie and Mr. Darcy blossoms into appreciation and finally true love. (I hope I didn't spoil the book for anyone, but if you didn't see the ending coming, you need to read more!)The language in this novel is terse, elegant and hilarious. Elizabeth can tell anyone off in such a way as to make the object of her wrath want to shrivel up and fall off the planet, all the while using beautiful language which contains not one bit of profanity. The characters in this story are also lovable and hilarious even with all their flaws: the narrow-minded and antagonistic Mrs. and Mr. Bennett, the cunning Mr. Wiccam, and my favorite of all characters--the youngest sister Lydia.The language contained in this novel is not an obstacle to reading it but is instead an absolute delight. If you have any sense of humor and romance whatsoever you will fall in love with these flawed characters and their absurd predicaments. Definitely a quick and enchanting read that made me laugh aloud!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austin, is a story of how a girl learns that the outward appearance can be deceiving. In this story many believe that a young man is quite awful. The two main characters, Elizabeth Bennet and Mr Darcy, end up effecting each others lives and changing their ways of seeing. Jane Austin's story truly tells a story with many turns in the road.With great surprises this book is not easy to put down. When things happen sometimes the least expected people are the ones who are helpful. I found this an enjoyable story with a few exceptions.Although I didn't really mind the style of writing it may be confusing to a reader. The reason is because of the style used when the book was written. In some parts it was easy to lose concentration, but it would grab my attention again.This was a wonderful story and perhaps one that would be best to read over and over. Not all people would enjoy this book. I found that it told a good story that gives the message to never judge a book by its cover.This book may be considered a love story. It truly told how being prejudice doesn't mean you are right about someone. The lesson learned in this book should be a lesson we all know about so maybe we can save ourselves from making the mistake of judging one another."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a classic love story. When I first decided to read it I had no idea that it would be such a good book. The love conflicts between the characters really make you think about how important getting to know someone is before you marry them. It also makes you realize how much your views on someone can change when you are forced to become close to them. After reading Jane Austin's Pride and Prejudice, I realize why it is considered to be a classic. You can imagine that you are Elizabeth, or you can imagine you are watching as Jane Bennet and Mr. Bingley fall in love. I recomend this book to people who would like to read a wonderful and emotionally stimulating novel."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is quite possibly the best book ever written. The plot is as real today as it was when it was written. The characters are strong and vivid. Its like stepping back in time to a place you've never been.

Also for a more modern take on the same premise, read Bridget Jone's Diary by Helen Fielding."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen knew what she was talking about, way before a time were women had many rights.

Her characters are well developed and the interaction between chacters are better then watching any movie, you are hooked from page one."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"You are going to read many a review of Austen's PRIDE & PREJUDICE [P&P;] wherein the author of said review will, with great superciliousness, state that this novel is NOT just a chick book, NOT just a piece of fluff, but instead a work of such great sociological importance that its message cannot be ignored. I'm here to tell you different. P&P; is most DEFINITELY a chick book, ...This isn't to say that P&P; has no value to its readers. Certainly it must or English instructors would stop putting \\"OPTIONAL: AUSTEN OR THUMBSCREWS' on their syllibi. But what IS its value? The great moral lessons it imparts? Its grave lessons in proper deportment? Of course not. P&P; retains its value simply in being a good read. This is perhaps the most finely crafted love story of all time. Without the aid of a tip sheet from Harlequin, Austen manages to hit all the high points of a typical romance [excepting the lamentable lack of a sex scene], & still provide enough social commentary & moral/ethical guidance that even the most unromantic among us cannot but be interested. It is in this manner that Austen has for years been able to fool Academia into believe that her work is anything but a sweet little love story, albeit a decidedly complex one.Novels are read for different reasons. Some novels are important, and they are knighted with the celebrated title of \\"literature\\", and though no one truly knows why, or what makes them good literature, there is the vague idea that such works much teach you something. That nebulous idea of imparting some great knowledge or insight into our existence is imperative-it's one of the 3 miracles needed for a work to achieve the saintly shroud of \\"literature.\\" Some novels are just ..., but are read by the masses on the sly, tucked into their laps as they ride public transportation; the half-dressed, windswept maiden & man or the bloody, dripping knife on the cover safely hidden from view. Austen's P&P; truly fits in neither of these categories, though its square peg can be stuffed into \\"literature's\\" round hole with little abrasion. It is simply an ESSENTIAL novel, a must read for every generation, owing to the fact that it is an excellent story. It doesn't have to teach us anything. It simply has to be entertaining, and PRIDE & PREJUDICE is, to the utmost degree."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a wonderful look at the customs of marriage, love, and financial and social status in Regency England. It's message, that love is more important than financial gain, and that first impressions aren't always the best to base attitudes on, still ring true centuries later."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have been hooked on this book since I was 15 and read it for the first time. I have read it at least once a year since then and just hope for my Darcy to find me as well.The movie first got me interested in reading the book, but I must admit that I much prefer to read the book to watching the movie (although Colin Firth does have a lot to offer). I am always in suspense to see if Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy will come together and I am always so glad when they do.Read this once and then read it again, and again, and again, and again..."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book was not on any of my school reading lists so I did not come across it until I was almost 30. I am now 50 and have probably read it 10 times and seen every version of it on film...twice. It is a becutiful story of women and human nature. I have never had a problem seeing the Bennetts as my contemporaries. Anyone who reads this book will immediately recognize these characters and their situations. Women may be more independent today, but there are still women who seek marriages simply to validate themselves or their lifestyles. Not only have I enjoyed this book, I have learned from it. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I love this book, it's funny in some spots and I can really relate to Elizibeth. I have always been closer to my dad, and very outspoken. She was for her time."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is Jane Austen's masterpiece and it deservedly bears this title. Pride and Prejudice is the perfect love story. It starts out with the Bennet family. Mr. Bennet has five daughters of marriagable age, and a wife who is in a hurry to marry them off. When rich Mr. Bingley moves to town, bringing his even-richer friend Mr. Darcy with him, Mrs. Bennet plans to have two of her daughters married within a matter of months. Things don't go quite as planned, though, when Elizabeth Bennet, the heroine of the story, meets the prideful Mr. Darcy. Elizabeth is unlike any other young woman of her time (except perhaps Jane Austen herself). Elizabeth is smart, sharp-tongued, and stubborn. When she meets Mr. Darcy she considers him to be the most disagreeable person she has ever met. But sometimes first impressions (which was fittingly the original title of the book) aren't always right, and the story unfolds from there.I was reluctant to read this book at first because I was afraid I wouldn't understand the language. It was a little difficult at first, but the more I read the more I got into the rhythm of the language and the more I understood. What inspired me to read the book was the new movie version starring Keira Knightley, which I loved. Watching the movie before I read the book made the book easier to understand. Not only did I love the story, but I loved the rich characters who brought life to musty, early 19th century England. Everyone in the story has more to their character than meets the eye, and that made all the characters more realistic. I also liked how the book was very decent. It was refreshing to read a book that didn't have any profanity or graphic scenes. For those who are easily bored, this may not be the book for you because it is rather lengthy and tends to drag in places. This book is probably more enjoyable for girls than for guys, but by no means does that make this novel a Harlequin Romance. All in all, I was very pleased with Pride and Prejudice, and I am glad I got over my own prejudice of old fashioned language enough to read this gem of a book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen has become of the most renown authors around the world for her witty and classic characters. It doesn't suprise me that she is able to write such a wonderful novel as Pride & Prejudice.It is a story of a young woman named Elizabeth Bennet ,a.k.a. Lizzy, who has a great dislike for a handsome and rich man called Mr. Darcy. The story takes Elizabeth through twists and turns and some how she ends up in love with Mr. Darcy."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I've watched the movie a few times and read the book twice, and I'm still as excited as the first time I read it! The characters are awesome, and I feel my heart all aflutter just like Elizabeth's when she finds herself in love with Mr. Darcy....*sigh*.A classic that can really never go out of style."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I think Jane Austen wrote a very good novel. I liked the characters in the novel and the plot. My favorite character in the novel was Elizabeth Bennet. I liked how she acted towards all the other characters with her quick wittedness and her cleverness. She was a very honest person who rose above her class bound society. She holds to what she thinks and believes in. For example in Chapter 3 she has a disliking toward the Bingley sister's, while Jane finds them &quot;charming&quot; Elizabeth still holds her feelings of dislike towards them.Another character I enjoys throughout the book was Mr. Bennet. Mr. Bennet was the only man in a house of six women. The women wore him out and all of them were very difficult to deal with. He would always give me a good laugh throughout the whole book by his sarcastic humor. I like him also because he reminded me of Elizabeth because of their quick-wittedness and also they were the two closest in the family since they were the two smartest. I thought the two of them were most close in Chapter 13.I enjoyed the novel's plot because of the girls and how they turned men down of proposals and the different down falls and happiness of all the girls' love lives. All the girls have disappointments and confusion with the men and people they love; yet not all of their situations work out the way some of the girls had hoped. Elizabeth holds strong and but she will not promise anything against her own happiness. Throughout all of the confusion, Jane and Elizabeth are happily married at the end."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I was forced to read &quot;pride and prejudice&quot; for a high school english class...but i immediately fell in love with it...it has everything from love, humor, stereotypes, and anything else bundles into one heartfelt, lovely story. If you like anything dealing with romance, this book is a must read. I recommend it to people of all ages, races, genders because it truly emits a universal message!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I loved Austen's Pride and Prejudice. I have read it so much that the cover is worn. The BBC movie version was almost as great at the book and very very close to the accuracy of the book. I have read Emma and Persuasion and loved them both, though not as well as Pride and Prejudice. You'll want to buy it so that you have it to read again and again!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I wanted to read Jane Austen's Pride and Predjudice after a friend told me the book was so good. I bought a copy, and I can't say I was disappointed; this is a masterpiece. Austen did a really nice job talking about issues that you and I have trouble with--love, relationships, reputation, pride and prejudice of course--just to name a few. She did well tying in the love story with Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy with all the other characters--even the most frivolous of characters had their part in the story.I really liked the fact that Austen developed the characters/story line between Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwililam Darcy well. It is evident that the two were made for each other, but Elizabeth, after first bad impressions concerning Darcy and stories by Wickham, never noticed the true character of Darcy because of her predjudice (blindness) towards him. Darcy was just too full of himself until rejection by Elizabeth brings him back to his senses--not so proud now, are we? The roads to the happy ending were often bumpy, but Elizabeth and Darcy (along w/Bingley and Jane) arrived safe and sound, concluding the novel with a sweet ending. At times, the passages are really long/tedious, but in the end, it's worth it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The chapter that I liked the best was chapter one because it talks about the Bennet family and describes how the mom (Mrs. Bennet) is really desperate for her daughters to marry a wealthy man. The reason that I liked chapter one is because it gives a brief opening about the book. It was important for the daughters to marry a wealthy man because they wanted to have a better economic status and be exposed to a better society.The literary device that I appreciated more was comedy. Comedy is a story that ends with a happy resolution of the conflicts faced by the main character. In many comedies the conflict is provided when a young couple who wish to marry are blocked by adults.I recommend this book for people that like to read books and are interested in how people were in the 19th century.I like the book because it tells us how families were in the 19th century. The reason that this is important to me is because we could see and compare cultures back then and how we are now."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a love story between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, an uptight man who has too much pride. Their first impressions gave a big start to this story that developed into the major conflicts and story line. My favorite chapter was the first one because it sets the tone for the story. It gives us the setting and the introduction to the characters. We really get to see Mrs. Bennett as an excruciatingly loud mother who lives only to search for husbands for her daughters. We can see Mrs. Bennett favors Jane as her first priority for finding a husband because she is the eldest and most beautiful one of all. One instance is when Mrs. Bennett found out Mr. Darcy was moving into a neighboring house. When she found out he was single, she automatically suggested/recommended Jane as a potential future wife. In contrast we start to see and understand Mr. Bennett's attitude towards his wife's plea and towards his defense of his daughters. He doesn't critique his daughters when it comes to men.I would recommend this book mostly to women/girls between the ages of 17-50 because this story deals with the trouble girls go through and it deals with five girls living in the household, to which we can relate. The daughters were not that old, yet they were mature for their age. Teens will enjoy it because we all go through these teen stages of boys, and women can relate because of the maturity level that is in this story.One literary device that was used in the story was analogy. It is used to describe two characters (Elizabeth and Darcy) that are alike by comparing them. We are able to see their differences, but along with it their common interests start to show. For example, they both come from a different social background and yet are both intelligent, and have a tendency to judge harshly.Overall I can say that I liked this book, Pride and Prejudice, because it was an interesting story. Nowadays we read about homicide detectives and mysteries happening with murder, but this story is nothing like this. It builds its own suspense through character's personalities. It's based on feeling rather than action so we can all relate to this story psychologically. It captivates us in an imaginary world in the early 19th century that reminds us of their rules and regulations that were used back then. For example women were just expected to marry wealth and make a family. They played no other role whatsoever, so since we don't live in that type of environment anymore, we can just picture how life was back then and see what they went through, and their approach through these situations."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Chapter 12 is my favorite chapter because it talks about what happens around the lives of the family, like when Elizabeth is alone with her sister, and her mother is in another place. The appropriate age for this book is 15 years up because it has words that are difficult to pronounce and comprehend.The literacy device, which l most appreciate, is characteristic because it is the way to know more about the character. This book l like because it is well written and lets you know about how entailing affected the family in those days, which means the women could not inherit property only the male or brother of them. As a consequence the daughters marry someone they don't like so their husbands could inherit the property."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I am trying to read more classics because I never really paid attention to them in high school. I started reading this one and at first I was having a hard time getting into it, it is a bit slow. But by the second half of the book I couldn't put it down. Terrific love story, literature at its finest."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"There aren't too many books that I absolutely never get tired of reading, but this is definitely one of them. Fabulous characters and the perfect romance. Even though it's become a bit cliche with all of the take-offs on the market right now, I will always love this book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have always wanted to read this book and I am sad to say that I was spurred into reading it because I wanted to read \\"Pride and Prejudice and Zombies\\" and decided that to be fair to the humorous version of this book I should read the original.This was a very enjoyable book. It starts out a bit slow as Austen has to set up all the family relations. It takes a bit to keep all of the names thrown at you sorted out; it also takes a bit to get used to the manner of speaking used. There are many times when a characters is trying to say \\"no\\" but they take a whole paragraph of finely crafted language to do so.Despite the above; the language is clever and the story (after page 80 or so) is very engaging. I was actually surprised by how much I enjoyed it. The plot has a lot of surprises and mis-direction and much attention is paid to characterization.It is not a quick read, you really have to pay attention to what you read. But for those who like victorian stories, this story should hit the mark. In fact this story seems to be what all the more recently written victorian fictions I have read are striving to be. Definitely a good read if these kind of humorous victorian romances are your thing; this is the original.Although I don't think I will be reading a ton more Jane Austen; I did find this to be an enteraining book. I am also looking forward to reading the spoof on it \\"Pride and Prejudice and Zombies.\\""},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Of course Pride and Prejudice is fabulous in any form, but I do like this edition. Barnes and Noble Classics are hardcover with a nice dustjacket. Pages were a nice thickness, and what I especially liked, had that cool binding effect that makes it look like an older edition book where all the pages are different widths at the side."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Prior to reading Pride and Prejudice, I had seen excerpts designed to paint Jane Austen's writing as stuffy, obtuse, and generally boring. One joke says that Ms. Austen's novels are like active mysteries that engage the reader in trying to find the hidden verb in each sentence. But these criticisms are not only unfair, they're entirely inaccurate: just a few pages into Pride and Prejudice, Austen's writing style ceased being an obstacle to my enjoyment and began being a central part thereof. The manner in which she builds sentences and paragraphs is pure a delight to the modern reader, even 200 years after the fact.Austen's true accomplishment here is that she makes a novel in which \\"so little\\" happens, by modern standards at least, so darn interesting! As one critic put it, this is a 367-page story in which the central events are a man changing his manners and a lady changing her mind. But oh how the web of intrigue is weaved! The subtleties of character development and plot construction are never forced and always as natural as they are glorious. This truly is a literary triumph, and the first great novel that places women and their happiness at the center; that focuses on dialog and feelings more than swordplay and seafaring. Its interlocking characters are so rich and well-defined, unlike anything in the preceding novels onThe Well-Educated Mind's reading list. And even though the story ends up exactly as you know it will from Page 1, it's still all so satisfying!Is the book pretentious? Elitist? Maybe. But consider it a study of a particular class of people during a particular point in history. That's what it is. The heroine, with whom I agree with the author when she described her to be \\"as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print,\\" is bucking social conventions, but she can only do so much. She can't emancipate Woman in one fell swoop, nor is that her motivation. But Elizabeth's actions and this novel in general were one small step for Woman, at least, and an incredibly enjoyable read if nothing else. Five stars all the way!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This has to be one of my absolute favorite books of all time. I love the characters who are all written exceptionally well. I love the language and Austen's style. I love the book.I've read it 4 times including the first, which was less than a year ago. Despite that, I still dislike reading certain scenes in public because they have me laughing or smiling like an idiot. At one point, I was reading, and I had to shut the book grinning like an idiot to walk around a lose some of my pent up energy.Elizabeth Bennet is an intelligent character. But she has her flaws. She thinks highly of herself and her wit, and she forgets that even she can make a mistake. Jane is the kindest character in the book, and more gentle-hearted than anyone I know. But it works with her and I have no problems relating to her. Darcy is a proud, shy man who dislikes social situations. But he is caring, just, and thoughtful. Bingly is his exact opposite.I should probably stop describing the characters. But they are what make this book a classic. Jane Austen is a master of characterization. I can relate to them centuries later despite living in a completely different country and culture. Elizabeth and Darcy leave me grinning like an idiot and distracted for days after I am done reading the book. Obviously, it's why I'm posting this review nearly a week after I finished reading it for the fourth time in full!This is a must read for anyone who enjoys a good romance, and even those who don't."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is considered a classic for a reason. Some books just stand the test of time, and this is one of them. Jane Austen has an impecable manner of getting to the core of human (and especially women's) emotions. The focal point of this novel would be not to judge a person at first glace. Their true character may surprise you."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I read quite a but, but this book is undeniably my favorite. I first picked it up my junior year of high school, and while the first couple chapters failed to capture my interest I decided to keep reading. I am SO glad I did, after a while I could not put it down.This book has just about everything- satire, reflections on women in society and family, wit, humor, romance, irony, constantly twisting and turning with surprises... the list goes on. Most of all, it just has this inexplicable quality that keeps you enraptured throughout the whole read.I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The author takes us through life in the 1800's and the lifestyles filled with chivalry and of course, pride and prejudice. It was initially difficult to comprehend due to the older style of English writing. However, once you sit with this book for a couple of chapters, it's easy to get the hang of it. It's a page turner. This is the ultimate original chick lit. Beautifully written, young, whimsical, and provocative. Will remain one of my all time favorites!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"After seeing a number of adaptations, I finally decided to read all ofAusten's novels. Northanger Abbey was not bad, and Sense and Sensibilityis excellent. However, this is the best so far. While there is a lot ofinsightful comment on the custom of English society of the time, anddiscussion of the character's motivation, the book just sparkles duringthe interchanges between them. While those between Elizabethand Mr. Darcy are justifiably famous, I would say that many of the othersare at the same level. My favorite are perhaps the interchanges betweenLady Catherine and Elizabeth. I am very much looking forward to readingthe remaining three completed novels."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"outstanding prodcut free...can't beat that can you?? haven't finished to book but so far it's outstandinghope you enjoy it as much as i am.....what's up??"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I absolutely love this book!I rate this book as follows:Love interest: 5Subcharacters: 5Writing: 5Romantic Plot: 5Overall: 5"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Love this book and have read it many times and will read it again.Ifirst read Pride and Predjest in the 40st when I was in High School.

It does differ from the movie in that Mr. Darcy really was haughty and prideful in the beginning instead of merely misunderstood, and Elizabeth Bennett was prejudiced, but both of course reconciled and became better people for each others' accusations. Also, there were a couple additional characters and some of the dialogue was switched between characters, which made more sense than even in the more recent version of the film. There was one notation at the closing of every (mailed) letter that I did not understand, but otherwise did not see many mistakes that would not have been in the original manuscript as other reviews reported. I thoroughly enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"Pride & Prejudice\\" is without doubt a masterpiece of English literature.

Reading on my new kindly was simply a delicious experience again. I can almost quote dialogue but still am totally absorbed by the plot/s each time. The selection of language used throughout the book is superb and sometimes makes me think I wish we still spoke that way. Shame so much swearing and slang has entered our english language, that maybe high school students should read it to learn a new selection of words, or to have it reinforced that there are thousands of delicious words out there that far create more meaning than slang! A classic and always will be."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is one of my most charished possessions and has been for a good many years.

There is no turning back now; LOVE MY KINDLE and LOVE that I purchased Pride and Prejudice for it! The writer, Jane Austin really knows her stuff and knows how to capture a reader! I would reccomend this book highly!!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is considered the Jane Austen masterpiece and is one of the most popular books of English literature and I can see why. Jane Austen paints a gorgeous picture of what life for a woman in 19th century England was like. Her characters are beautifully developed and the main character Elizabeth is how I would hope I would be if I lived in that era. Smart, a freethinker and not afraid to show little gumption.This is one book that I will read again and again throughout my lifetime. I can't recommend it enough."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I can understand why this is considered a classic of literature. I saw the movie first and then just read it. The story is more for women, I think, but I confess I got into the drama once Darcy and Elizabeth started interacting. I could have done without some (or all) of the sisters, but I guess they were an essential part of the novel to show what silly girls were like in those days."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Great read! I wish we still spoke in such eloquent terms. Would recommend to anyone looking for a great classic. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It was easy to download and read.

Differences of class and upbringing, coupled with societal exposure and expectation lead the plot through many twists and turns that keep you reading."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The book was written more than 50 years ago, but can still be like today.

It was as great as the movie and a must read/watch."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"In high school, my enjoyment of old European art was always hampered by my gratitude that I'm not any of these exasperating people or in any of their stifling situations. I felt so blessed and superior that I escaped sitting around mending bonnets all day, waiting to go on a walk- how boring and pathetic! Upon rereading this years later, I was able to let go of these old prejudices and more objectively view the characters in the situation they were in. That was when I realized Austen is a genius: I saw how much she understands and subtly, humorously conveys, and how little I'd understood before. Now I actually consider this to be a work of rationalist literature, in addition to a brilliant romantic comedy.In my previous reading, I thought that the only intelligent, reasonable character was Mr. Darcy, and that everyone else's problems was brought on by their own idiocy, of which their unjust hatred of the virtuous, blameless Mr. Darcy was only further evidence. This time around, I realized that he caused some of these problems himself. Mr. Darcy's arrogance caused problems he could've easily avoided by being slightly nicer. Instead, he prided himself in his bluntness and in his own virtuousness, thus causing people to resent him, because who likes someone who thinks he's better than you, even if he actually is? Similarly, Lizzy demonstrates all of our tendencies to like and be less questioning of information coming from someone who flatters us. This causes us to have errors in judgment and believe things we would otherwise be more critical of. Mr. Darcy shows an amazing ability to step outside personal biases and view things from other's perspectives- a rationalist romantic hero! Austen understood the female wish: a rich, moral, loyal man completely rational about all things, except for his irrational love for his weird woman."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Truly one of the best stories of all time.

I did not find the plot particularly interesting, nor the characters particularly engaging. Then why give it four stars?Because, dear readers, it is perfectly possible to not enjoy something and still hold a great deal of respect for it, and there are very few reviews that acknowledge this fact. Personally, I have never been particularly interested in domestic drama of the 19th century, but this is an important work, and should be read on that merit at least. Many readers seem to forget that at the time of writing, women did only have the choice to marry, and for an upper-class young lady, marrying a rich man was her only option. After all, she could not work, because there was a universal horror of being \\"in trade\\" (witness Mr. Darcy's extreme rudeness to Elizabeth having relatives who actually worked). Mrs. Bennett, shallow and stupid though she was, did have a legitimate reason to be worried, since the extremely sexist inheritance laws meant that she and her daughters were to be turned out of their home and onto the charity of relatives the moment her husband died. Small wonder that marrying each of them off was her only concern.Even if one can not enjoy the book, modern women can still look back with a thrill of horror over this idea of being birds in gilded cages - being essentially the property of their fathers and husbands, with nothing to do but stack up \\"accomplishments\\" (see Mary Bennett). Jane Austen recognized the whole thing as the barely disguised slave market it was and wrote biting criticisms, smuggled into stories about romance and marriage. And that is why, though I do not enjoy her subject matter or her writing style in particular, I hold the greatest regard for her as a writer and would recommend the book on technical merit and historical interest in the very least."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"What a wonderful book! This book was even better the 2nd time and now that I have brushed up on my P&P, I will hopefully be reading Mr. Darcy's Obsession next month. I love the book, \\"pride and prejudice\\" it's a wonderful story about a family in the 1700's and the classes of society. Reminds us how different things were. Has a Dramatic story with a beautiful classic love story intertwined. If I was to chose a modern day version of this book it would be Bridget Jones Diary, because she is in love with the man who is not who he seems to be, despises another man who she sees so wrong. Ends up falling in love with the man she thought of as a horrible man. What a great read. I also love my new book light! Target 9.99 was the best investment ever. I was surprised I was able to finish this book while we had company here, but with a few sleepless nights I breezed right through this book. I give this book 5 stars"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have to start off by saying that the book description here is awful. Will sister Jane marry Mr. Bingley? Will the arrogant Lady Catherine de Burgh's intrigues be foiled? WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO SISTER LYDIA?Who cares?!Unfortunately, that's actually not that unfair a representation of the book's contents. I read it well over a decade ago, maybe just out of high school, and that would about sum up what I thought of it then. I thought I should give it another chance, though---and to be fair, there is a bit more substance (and style!) to the novel than that. It did take me a while to get into, though---it is rather dry for stretches, and nearly every character is not just unsympathetic, but almost intolerable. But by the end, I was very interested in the fate of Elizabeth, who was the only almost wholly likable character.Thematically, I have mixed feelings...on the one hand, it's nice that Elizabeth wants to marry out of affection, and not just for reasons of family, connections, wealth, etc. This comes out especially in her conversation with Lady de Burgh toward the end when the latter comes to exact her promise not to marry Mr. Darcy (which was the best part of the book). However, you still have to kind of wonder whether Elizabeth would have fallen in love with Mr. Darcy and wanted to marry him if he weren't quite so wealthy...when one of her sisters asks her when she started falling in love with him, she replies, \\"When I first saw the grounds at Pemberley!\\" (Mr. Darcy's estate), or something to that effect. She is joking, of course...but maybe not entirely.Also, I found it depressing how almost every other female character in the book made connections based primarily on those reasons of connections and such, or worse...Elizabeth's friend Charlotte accepts the proposal of a man she clearly doesn't love (just two days after he had proposed to Elizabeth) and who is utterly obnoxious, just to gain a bit of security; her sister Lydia is basically forced at the age of fifteen to marry the biggest scoundrel in the book, whose own consent to marry the girl is bought off him for an exorbitant blackmail bribe by Mr. Darcy (who does this for love of Elizabeth---how is this supposed to be a romantic gesture again, exactly?). Of course, I realize Austen did these things as foils to contrast with Elizabeth's own case, but to me it was still rather unpleasant and somewhat undercut the romance of the story.But the main storyline involving Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy is nice, and there is a lot of genuinely amusing wit in Austen's writing (particularly in the character of Mr. Bennett, who you have to wonder why he married the incredibly annoying Mrs. Bennett in the first place---Austen pretty much just chalks it up to a youthful mistake on his part). On the whole, worth reading once, or maybe twice if you were too young to appreciate it the first time around, but I doubt I'll be revisiting it again...at least not for another couple of decades!Three and a half stars."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I doubt I'm saying anything here that someone somewhere hasn't already said... but, here it goes! In my own opinion...Perhaps one of the best books ever written, Austen takes us into 19th century rural England, where a woman's primary duty was to marry and marry well, since inheritance was out of the question. This novel tells the classic story of the rich, eligible bachelor, Fitzwilliam Darcy, who could have anyone he wanted, and young, but outspoken and bold Elizabeth Bennet, the second eldest of five girls who's family lives fairly well but ranks rather low on the social class spectrum. Hence, it's expected that she would marry should she be offered a reasonable and comfortable home, regardless of how she feels.Elizabeth Bennet may be one of literature's best heroines. Her complex and genuine character, her honesty and courage to remain true to herself regardless of the situation, makes her a lovable heroine, and one that can be related to regardless of time period. And let's admit, she is just downright witty. Darcy, while mistakenly perceived as proud and arrogant, turns out to be one the most gentlemanly and courteous men, a kind soul and romantic heart once he lets down his guard and exposes his true self. His qualities are ones women still crave to find in men today.The characters, realistic and well-rounded, the accurate portrayal of 19th century British social life and setting, and Austen's superb writing creates a masterpiece full of romance, pride, social status, family values, and prejudice. This timeless romantic tale is one of the best love stories of all time, a true classic! I absolutely adored this book!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is a classic I never read before, but the Kindle price was certainly right. I enjoyed it, but as much for the history of English law regarding estates as for character development and plot. I was struck by the similarities between Pride and Prejudice and PBS' series Downton Abbey--same issues regarding inheritance of a major estate when all the children are daughters, the role of a male relative, the ambiguous relationship between the male and female protagonists, etc."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I was in love with the movie and I am now equally in love with this book.

Give the gift of reading to all people you hold dear, it is a gift they will cherish forever!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason. While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\\").It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love. An absolute must-read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Kindle owners hopefully are aware of the wealth of free editions of the classics which are available through Feedbooks and other sources.I obtained a copy of P&P; from feedbooks originally and while it was easy to get and the price was right, the overall quality of the text is not great.

Also,I prefer the A & E adaptation of the book(Double DVD). The version with KEIRA KNIGHTLY is o.K, but the former adaptation has actors that are more creditable as their characters."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is probably the most well-read book written by Jane Austen.The story revolves around the Bennet family that has five daughters, and a mother seeking to get them married to rich men. Elizabeth Bennet, the energetic and charming second daughter, is the main focus and heroine in the novel. She meets rich and stuck-up (or so she thinks) Mr. Darcy at a ball, starting a very interesting, and tumultuous relationship. Upon their first meeting Elizabeth and Darcy lets prejudice cloud their impression of each other. And later on, both were too prideful to correct the other's wrong assumption. Hence, the title Pride and Prejudice.This novel can be aptly considered a classic since readers have always been fascinated with the in and outs of the relationship between Elizabeth and Darcy. But other than the captivating story line, Austen also writes wonderful descriptions depicting the 19th century life of people in England. Even though her description without dialogue may seem long, her subtle humor makes it lively and interesting to read. Seeing its success, it is hard to imagine that Pride and Prejudice was rejected by publishers initially.Armchair Interviews says: If you have not read this book, you are missing out on a great novel."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is Jane Austen's most popular novel and it is remarkable that it has sustained such a high popularity 200 years after it was originally published. The primary plot of the story follows Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy in a highly contentious courtship that begins with mutual contempt but evolves quite unexpectedly for both into very different feelings. Subplots involve her sister Jane and Mr. Bingley in a courtship of their own as well as the romantic entanglements of various other sisters and friends. The story is a bit of a roller coaster ride with soaring hopes and crushing disappointment in store as events unfold. I won't reveal the ending for the handful of people who haven't read it but suffice to say that the novel concludes in a way that leaves the vast majority of readers well satisfied.Darcy and Elizabeth are complex and multi-layered characters who both grow and change somewhat as the book progresses. They are the heart and soul of the book and about as well fleshed out as any characters you are likely to see. The supporting characters, however, are considerably less deep and are more caricatures than anything else. Some are good and kind like Jane and Mr. Bingley, and others are ridiculous and vain like Mrs. Bennet but none are remotely as substantial as Darcy and Elizabeth. So, does this ruin the book? Hardly. These secondary characters offer a wealth of material for the author as she plays them off of Darcy and Elizabeth.This novel is almost certainly the one where Austen best displays her sharp-edged wit both through Elizabeth's dialogue and in the narrative voice describing some of these characters and their actions. If some of them were less ridiculous, the potential for the satire would be weakened considerably. And make no mistake, Pride and Prejudice is as much a satire of the time it was written, as it is a romantic drama. Even today, the prose is quite funny and enjoyable. The Enriched Classics edition is also nice because it includes footnotes explaining some of the language and/or references that were well known at the time but confusing today's readers.In summary, this is a great novel. Admittedly, there were times where I thought a character's behavior was a bit over-the-top but the overall story is so riveting and the book so compelling that I just can't find serious fault with it. Pride and Prejudice is deserving of its reputation and I highly recommend it to Austen fans and newcomers alike."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I'm sure there are a multitude reviews on the actual story of P&P;, to which, I'm sure, I can add very little.

This is, without a doubt, one of the best novels ever written.I mostly wish to comment on this particular edition of the book (Robert Frederick Ltd.). I just bought it, today, at the local used book store. I already have another copy and decided that an illustrated edition would be a nice addition to my book collection.The hardback book is of fair quality. I'm not sure if this book originally came with a dust jacket or not, but this one doesn't have one. There is a picture of a man and woman, dressed in Regency period clothing, walking on a wooded path. I'm sure, if there is a dust jacket, the picture is probably the same.The spine is a bright pink color and the title on the cover is surrounded by a bright pink oval.Inside, the pages are made of good quality paper. There are black and white illustrations. They are well drawn. There is a picture placed above every chapter heading, either of a scene from the previous chapter or the forthcoming one. There are also pictures placed randomly throughout the book.I would say this book would make an excellent first copy for a young girl."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Such a great love story!

It is remarkable the way she brought off the mercenary and ignorance of the people-a common criticism of the 18th century.I can assure that those who have a taste for the classic and the romantic are going to have such a pleasant reading as I had.What I've found most interesting was the constant presence of an utterly charming, engaging and fast 'war of wits' among characters.It certainly has a great theme and we can still see its content applied in todays world. Pride and Prejudice was elegantly-written by Jane Austen and I can say that it was very worth it as well as inspiring to me reading this novel."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It doesn't get better than Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. Whether you're the hopeless romantic or you just love the classics, you're going to love this book. Though I am only sixteen, I consider myself to be moderately well-read. I love reading, and, when I am between books, my life feels desolate and empty. One day, while in the most barren pit of ennui, I picked up Pride and Prejudice at my mother's recommendation. I do not ordinarily like my mother's taste in reading; her favorite books tend to be very dull, but so deep was my boredom that I succumbed to her suggestion. I wasn't displeased with what I found. I fell in love with the book at the first sentence. I brought my beloved book to the dinner table, to my classes and late into the night. I love everything about it. I love the characters; especially Elizabeth Bennet! I love the Victorian vernavular which works so well for this particular novel. I love the scintillating plot and the suspense created by knowing that Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy should be together but their pride and prejudice (hence the title) are temporarily keeping them apart. The language that the novel is written in might be a little more difficult to read than contemporary literature, but once one gets accustomed to it, it makes the novel even more pleasurable. I cannot imagine Elizabeth or Darcy or Bingley or any of the other characters speaking any less eloquently; it would ruin the whole experience! The flowery language completes the whole effect of reading a Jane Austen novel. If a disgruntled female reader put down Pride and Prejudice, pick it back up! I strongly suggest it because it may prove to be tedious at first but if read again, it would probably read more easily. I can offer no suggestions to the male reader, however, because generally this book, in ever essence, is a female novel. I am not saying that men would definetly not enjoy it; I'm simply saying that I have yet to meet any male who has not addressed this book in a very vehement manner. I simply love this book in its entirety, and I know it won't be too long before I pick it up again. Jane Austen surely knew what she was doing when she wrote this one! Her Pride and Prejudice will always have an honored spot on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I purchased this edition of Pride and Prejudice based on the assurance that the hard returns in the edition had been fixed.

It's easy to read as the words are not too small but your eyes still have to adjust a little at first. It has a lovely pink pattern all over the book, which makes it gorgeous, simply gorgeous. It fits very nicely into any medium size hand-bag, which makes it perfect for \\"on the bus\\" reading. Even if your not a reader, and your styling your room in a classic style - place it on a vanity table!! If you love classics, you will love and appreciate reading a classic in this little pocket book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen did a wonderful job of keeping the reader interested (I read it in 5 days)and never lets the reader down at the end. The anticipation of seeing if Lizzy will end her 'prejudice' against Darcy will keep you glued to your Lazy Boy. Between the self absorbed Mrs. Bennett to the stupidity of Mary, and Lydia, Austen creates a fun chemistry A story where you can see your family in and want to give advice on every page. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It took some adjusting to get used to the 19th Century writing style - authors were much more subtle then (and there were different societal norms). Once I did, I was richly rewarded with this tale of mistaken intentions. For those of you on the edge, take the time to appreciate the style, you wont regret it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I hesitate to assign such titles but this is my favorite book of all time. Austen is so witty and subtle that each re-reading garners more laughs and more cringes as the Bennet family unconsciously embarasses themselves in polite society. Darcy is an ideal, a supremely satisfying hero for the headstrong, opinionated, and likeable Elizabeth. The A&E miniseries adaptation is also excellent (a nice excuse to curl up on the couch for several hours on a rainy day), as was, to my surprise, the later Keira Knightley version."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I often think Pride and Prejudice is mistaken as merely being a well written Mills and Boon romance novel-when in reality it is a penetrating social commentary on class, gender and human nature interspersed with Jane Austin's actualy quite cruel, barbed wit and humour. Every time you read this novel it renders a different interpretation and a myriad of observations. It is a bit sad that people sometimes dismiss this as chick lit and can't see past the frocks, ribbons and stately homes. However judging by the amount of reviews it is clearly well loved. Jane Austin is a genius of a writer her other novels are also very good, incorporating many issues of the time. Her humour, and wit is particularly stong in \\"Emma\\" and \\"Mansfield Park\\" studies many social issues of the time such as slavery, poverty and class."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I was supposed to read this in high school. Didn't happen.Then I was supposed to read it in college. Again, didn't happen.It's about a bunch of girls sitting around a drawing room, right? Probably noteworthy from a historical perspective, but what does it have to do with me, or with the 20th or 21st century?Everything, it turns out. And strangely enough, I should have seen that just from the title: this is about how pride and prejudice make us blind to the things under our noses. It is about how, in our closed mindedness, we sell others, and consequently ourselves, short. And it is about how we deny ourselves happiness in this asinine fashion.Notice that I don't say \\"this is about how Elizabeth, the heroine . . ..\\" Certainly Elizabeth is guilty of the sins that form the title of this book, but Austen cleverly allows us to make the same mistakes as Elizabeth does, and being human, we make them. Admittedly, we come around to the truth quicker than Elizabeth does, but I think that that only makes it more obvious what our mistakes have been. We sit, watching Elizabeth agonize over truth, wondering if this careful, intelligent, strong young woman will ever figure it out, and we reflect upon ourselves: where have we been proud? Where have we been prejudicial? Whom have we sold short, and what has been the result?So there is a moral, but equally important is that neither the story nor the author preaches to us. We are free to draw our own conclusions, though what those conclusions are is obvious, for most anyone with half of a brain.Of course, all of the good moral in the world is useless without a skeleton of prose, but how marvelous this prose is. I would say that the novel is worth reading for this prose alone, even without the moral, but the two are not even intertwined, they are the same: Austen's genius is to show us Elizabeth's life, and convince us that it is a mirror of our own life: 200 years later we're still making the same mistakes, celebrating the same victories, living the same lives, and it's always nice to read about ourselves.So yes, it's about a bunch of girls sitting around in a drawing room. And it has everything to do with the here and now.(A little aside, for those who wonder: how did I ever read this book? I read somewhere that Patrick O'Brian's (author of the Aubrey/Maturin books) favorite author was Jane Austen. Even more, I read that the comparison of his work that most pleased him was to Jane Austen's work, so I figured that there had to be something to this author, after all - and not just something from the point of view of high school literature class.)"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Elizabeth is by far my favorite character. Her temperament is all that I inspire to be."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is my favorite Jane Auten. I got tired of checking it out of the library year-after-year and when I saved enough, I bought it for my own."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Fair pricing, Fair delivery charges, quick shipping, accurate descriptions of products and good products delivered.Met all expectations.

This is my third reading and , will probably read a few more times :)."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is my fourth reading of this book and I become even more enamored of it with every single read!!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen created Elizabeth Bennett - every respectable man's ultimate woman - and Mr. Darcy - the role model for all gentlemen. She combined romance and wit with real characters and a story that has enchanted every generation since it was published. For some, the language is a barrier, but perseverance will reward any reader with possibly the best book ever written."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I went into this very guarded based off of what I heard. I was pleasantly surprised and would suggest anyone that might be a little weary about reading it to give it a try."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"My all-time favorite book.

I read this book 20 years ago and I'm reading it a second time. I love it even more. I plan to read it again in the near future. I just love the two main characters, Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. The details of their thoughts make you feel like you know them."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Loved it, loved it, loved it!!! Classic romance novel. Had wanted to read this for a long, long time. Moderate amount of 'flowery' writing, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Greatest love story of all time. Amazing story. Well written. A true work of art. Very amazing literature and captivating story"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I was hooked after the first two sentences. I am now surprised at myself that I had not read a single Jane Austen book at nearly 30. I fully intend on reading all of her works. I loved how dialogue based this novel is."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I read this for the umpteenth time on the PC Kindle, and the formatting seemed fine to me, so maybe it's been sorted by now. Either that or I was so bedazzled by the story that I simply didn't notice any problems.A librarian once remarked to me, upon my commenting how few people were in the library that particular day, that if people had to pay to gain access the line would be around the block. This seemed to me to display a wise understanding of human nature.Just because something is free does not mean it is worthless, any more than there being a guarantee that something costing a lot is bound to be valuable. The reason this book is always free on Kindle is that it is long out of copyright. This fact alone shows that it has stood the test of time, along with Jane Austen's other novels.Many people shy away from reading so-called classic novels. They feel that they will be full of long descriptions or such dated language that the narrative will be impossible to penetrate. To anyone reading this book for the first time, therefore, the writing will be a revelation. It is perceptive and witty in its social commentary, and full of interesting, sympathetic (and sometimes unsympathetic) characters who remain forever in the memory.The story itself is the great-great-great-grandmother of all romances, even predating Jane Eyre, which so many people liken to Mills & Boon or Silhouette romances. The heroine and her hero are real, flawed people rather than cardboard cutouts. When you consider that Jane Austen's settings and characters genuinely reflect her own time (the late 18th/early 19th century), rather than being researched in modern times, there is added interest from both cultural and historic perspectives.If you have never read this novel, regarded by many as the writer's best, please don't pass on it this time. Not only is it a wonderful experience in itself, but it may open for you literary doors to other fascinating worlds that you have kept firmly closed until now. If you have already read it once, of course, this review is preaching to the converted, for you have probably done so several times, with its charms only increasing with every reading."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It is the first book I happened to read on my Kindle. I was afraid the quality may be bad, for it was among the cheap or free classics. It is not the case, the format is very enjoyable. Concerning the book, its fame is sufficient to make clear how nicely written it is. That is definitely the kind of book that make me really enjoy the english language."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"this version of Pride and Prejudice is authentic and easy to read.The quality of the illustrations do not measure up to the lovely cover though.I use the third sized font and have no problem at all. Bev A Mosley"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":":)Good book!I love the book. She is an excellent writer. I love ALL her books. They are fun to read, and very addictive!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I had a mildly (and predictably) upsetting experience once as a substitute teacher in a 10th-grade English class. The topic at hand was Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, and the class was a noisy, disrespectful circus. It may be that this novel is essentially inaccessible now to all but a handful of young readers, and probably many older ones as well. A terrible shame!The book has much to teach us, after all, about the human condition, and the ways in which we handicap ourselves in the pursuit of happiness. Elizabeth's travails, and Mr. Darcy's, are as much self-inflicted as they are levied by the society in which they live. That said, Austen has an exceedingly generous and sympathetic touch with all of her characters, and the novel is one of the funnier pieces of the period. It goes without saying (or should) that her mastery of the English language is without peer."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Great read I loved the descriptions and I want to applaud the author.Be get the red fall but then"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have just finished reading Pride and Prejudice for the second time, and I liked it even more the second time around. (I daresay I might like it even more on a third or fourth reading.) Contrary to some of the reviews I've been reading, it's not just about five shallow young women trying to find husbands with the help of their annoying mother. Sure, some of the young women get married by the end, and the romance of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy is very diverting, but that's not the whole point of the story. For the most part, it deals with the observations of the author, as well as those of Elizabeth and, on a smaller scale, Mr. Bennet. There is social commentary on the ideas of class that many people of that era held so dearly, and the way some of them behaved to get the results they desired, regardless of whom they hurt. Pride and Prejudice also pokes fun at human frailty and absurdity, which, I believe, crosses the boundaries of time. I found myself laughing out loud at some points at the behavior of the minor characters and how some of the major characters reacted to it. Most importantly, there is a lesson to be learned: how a good person can overcome his or her first impressions, his or her pride and prejudice, and get to know the real heart and soul of the person. As some other reviewers have said, the enjoyment of this novel is in the journey, not the ultimate ending.I think those who called it boring more likely found the slightly antiquated and verbose language a bit too difficult to follow. I will admit I was a bit daunted by it at the beginning, but once I got into the flow of the novel, I realized it wasn't that hard. One thing that really helped me get into the novel (which I highly recommend) was watching the excellent 1995 A&amp;E/BBC adaptation before reading it. By doing that, I knew what was going to happen and could pay more attention to the inner workings of the novel, the commentary. As I read, I found myself really enjoying the language (rather than hoping for a translator to appear) and wishing I could argue as eloquently as Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy seemed to do.I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a sharp, acerbic commentary on the absurdity of human nature, and I wish those who gave it one or two stars would give it another try."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"_Pride and Prejudice_ is the story of Elizabeth Bennett, one of my favorite heroines(I think that every strong heroine since must be based on her in some way), and Mr. Darcy, one of my favorite heroes(I've been in love with him since I first read the book). There are misunderstandings and scandals and very irksome supporting characters that you just want to strangle, but it's a wonderful book that I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"My measure of a superb novel is the ability to read it many times and be able to find something new or to see characters and occurences from a different perspective. This novel never disapoints. With each reading, Mr. and Mrs. Elliot have become more complex, funnier, and also sadder. Jane has become more than just a sweet girl pining for a lost love. Her passivity and inability to express her emotions seem a subtle warning to those of us who may share Jane's foibles. Elizabeth seems more self-conscious, more aware of her times, a woman's place, and the class system within which she must operate. Against this background she appears braver and wittier, her observations more trenchant. It would be hard to find a character as pompous and awful as Mr. Collins, yet he also elicits one's sympathy. And Mr. Darcy is wonderful in his rudeness and his smoldering desire. His haughty proposal to Elizabeth and her stinging reply are still hurtful. His subsequent letter is the opening gambit to the breaking down of Darcy's pride and Elizabeth's prejudice. These characters are so real and their emotions so true that the 150-plus years that separate us quickly disappear."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I thought this book was great. Not only is Elizabeth a strong main character, but the supporting characters make the book very enjoyable. They are so funny; especially the mother. I couldn't put it down. I loved it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I must confess up front that I am a sucker of love stories. As such, Pride and Prejudice had me hook, line, and sinker from the beginning, turning page after page to find out if Elizabeth, the heroine, would find happiness in the end.A female friend of mine recommended the book to me (as did my girlfriend) with the caveat that most guys she knew complained that &quot;nothing happened&quot; in it. Needless to say, if you're looking for action and intrigue, look elsewhere. There is some little intrigue in Pride and Prejudice, but the heroine(s) play a strictly passive role. All the excitement in the novel stems from the suspense of the Bennet sisters' romances.Another minor caveat: I was initially slightly distracted by Austen's style of writing, which sometimes seems a bit distant from the action of the narrative (at least to someone more accustomed to more modern works).However, I feel that this hardly detracts from what recommends Pride and Prejudice the most (and what all love stories require): interesting characters to whom the reader can become emotionally attached and believable obstacles to their deserved happiness."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is a true English masterpiece. Not only is it magical,funny and sensitive. Austen also manages to entice you into her world. She creates the most perfect hero in Mr Darcy, a man willing to do anything to be with the woman he loves, even if it means having to stand Mrs Bennet as his mother-in-law. With Elizabeth, Austen manages to create a heroine who could easily be envied in both the nineteeth and twentieth just for her wit, intelligence and her honesty. Do not judge this book before reading it as a girly, old and an out dated piece that your English teacher rambles on about. It really does make you realise that there was life so long ago, and people have not really changed that much."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is one of the greatest classics I have ever read. The story of five young daughter's lovelives, along with their impertinent mother and lovable but sarcastic father, it is definitely a good read. The plot picks up as the book progresses, leaving the reader striving to know one thing: will Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy realize their profound love for one another and finally get together? I definitly reccomend reading this book. Try it, you will love it!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I must be honest and say that I had a prejudice against the book. I never thought that I would ever enjoy such a novel. To my surprise I could not put it down. The characters had charisma and charm and the tale holds a universal theme that can be understood despite the decades. I throughly enjoyed this book. A classic, timeless, and amazing piece of literature, I have the utmost regards for this novel. It was a spectacular piece of work that I cannot say enough about. Wonderful!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This novel took me completely by surprise. I had seen the movies &quot;Emma&quot; and &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;, and I decided to give this one a chance. It is by far, one of the best romance novels I've ever read. It is old-style romance, and yet the language and the feelings of Elizabeth Bennet truly capture every essence of what a woman feels when encountered with different situations. Although we see everything mostly through the eyes of Lizzy, a person cannot help to admire Jane Austen's ability to let your imagination be transported, momentarily, to a world where human beings are not so evil after all, and love is worth more than what is portrayed today in the media. Although the movie is very accurate, I would strongly encourage everyone to read this novel. If it is, indeed, Jane Austen's best work, it is absolutely worth every penny. Let yourself be absorbed into this magnificent story of all-time, and don't be surprised if by the end of it you feel like reading it all over again."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Anyone who has ever abandoned a first impression of another for quite an opposite assessment of the person... or had a disingenuous &quot;friend&quot;... or been mortified by a parent's behavior in front of someone whose opinion mattered... or had a wanton and unrepentant sibling... or been able to lay bear to an object of affection the true meaning of all of the crossed signals and misunderstandings that occurred up until that point... To any such persons (and several more), Austen's novel, though nearly two hundred years old, will surely ring true. As in most any romantic comedy, there is not much question of the couple(s!) getting together in the end, but it's the getting there--and, of course, the revelation of it all in the end--that is the fun."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is my all-time favorite book, so I felt like it was time to replace my old, torn paperback. This hardback copy feels like it is a book to be both treasured and enjoyed. The cover is gorgeous, and the book comes with a built-in ribbon to mark your place (no more turning down corners!). I love this version of the book, and it is a must-have for anyone whose favorite novel is part of this series."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I won't bother to review the novel \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", just this particular edition.

The story is a mixture of intrigue and passion with an appropriate ending. The goog guy should always triumph!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I admit I'm one of those bibliophiles who collects the different editions of favorite titles, and I could not resist this cover by artist Ruben Toledo. The book itself is a classic, and timeless in its appeal. Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a well-written satire on the hypocrisies of Regency society as exposed through her various well-delineated characters. Mrs. Bennet is eager to marry off her five daughters - the beautiful and quiet Jane, the strong-willed Elizabeth, Mary, Kitty and flighty Lydia. So when a young man of means moves into neighboring Netherfield Park, Mrs. Bennet is determined that one of her daughters should snag the gentleman in question, Mr. Bingley. Mrs. Bennet's character is truly a caricature and an almost scathing portrayal of the society of the time - mothers desperate to see their daughters married off, especially given the Bennets' predicament - with no male heir, the family home and fortune would be entailed away from the Bennets' in the event of Mr. Bennet's death.It is also a harsh criticism of the hypocrisy and pride of the ruling classes as well-embodied in the character of Fitzwilliam Darcy, whose pride makes him look down upon the Bennets and the rest of society not equal to his own station, though of course he doesn't count upon his own traitorous feelings when he falls for Elizabeth Bennet (whose prejudice against Darcy almost blinds her to the flaws in another). The lively and almost fiery exchanges between Elizabeth and Darcy are one of the most interesting and captivating aspects of the novel. There are a host of other characters that make this novel an engrossing read - the haughty Lady Catherine de Bourgh who is hell-bent on marrying off her sickly daughter to Darcy, the comical and 'greasy' Mr. Collins who reveals his own mercenary tendencies despite being a man of the cloth, the morally bankrupt Mr. Wickham, and many others. It is a delightful tale of the battle between the social classes, and a wonderful character study. Though the language takes some getting used to (it can appear quite stilted to those unused to reading this style of writing - the flowery, stuffy sort), the story itself is compelling enough to make it a worthwhile read. In fact, having fallen in love with the novel about two decades ago, I've since re-read it countless times!As for this particular cover by Ruben Toledo, I have to say it makes for a fun interpretation of the dynamics between Elizabeth and Darcy, the novel's two main characters. Illustrated in black and white with the characters presented in silhoutte, this is a fun and inspired take on the classic which will extend this novel's appeal to a younger generation of readers. This is a novel to be savored time and again - highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"There are literally thousands of review of Austen's seminal classic Pride And Prejudice out there already. This is a review of the Dover facsimile edition based on the 1894 copy.From the beautiful Hugh Thomson illustrations, to the embossed floral end pages, this edition is top notch.

I believe, eventhough the story was written in the 1800's, mostly anybody that have been in love could relate with the complexity of feelings portrated in this story. As well as to relate, not only with the main caracters but also the surportive; the embarrazing relatives, the adoring aunt, the beloved sister, the lost love, etc...What ever I could say will not do justice to this master piece."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Just finished my second time through on this beloved novel, but first time on the printed page with this cool cover that I won online! Just as fun as I remember. Darcy and Elizabeth are destined for one another, but they both have to overcome their pride and prejudices in order to see the reasons why they should be together and fall in love. I know there is a lot that I'm missing since I'm not an Austen expert on her subtleties and innuendos on society, but that's what makes it a timeless classic...it still speaks to everyone even without knowing everything that she was intimating in her social commentary. My husband even enjoys watching Pride and Prejudice with me! He's a sucker for the romance! So give it a try!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"O.K. I would call myself a well-versed reader in popular books. I would also call Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen quite possibly the most well-written book in the past 300 years.As soon as you pick up this book, your mind is forming hypothoses about the rest of the book. The weird thing is that ABSOLUTLY NONE of them happen. Yet, at the end, you are not only as happy with the conclusion as you would have been with your own ideas, but happier. That kind of literary psycological euphoria cannot be and has not been acheived by any other author that I have ever read.This book leaves you with a feeling of absolute feclicity. I cried with joy the first time I read it, and had to reread the ending twice. In other words, it has a very happy ending! That has certainly been attempted by every tale from Cinderella to the Harry Potter books, yet Austen's ending is unique as her ending is perfectly real. It not only seems realistic, but, in hindsight, any other resolution to her book seems ludicrous.Her characters are vivid. They are complex yet you see them as if they could be you own mother, sister, father, brother, friend, foe, or aquaintance. You not only warm to her heroes and heroines, but Austen leads you to feel a fiery hatred of her vilains and vilainesses.Her writing is intricate. You are left feeling not only perfectly satisfied with this book, but want more. She is not only an excalent writer but a perfect one. Thius book is her masterpiece. It has comedy, tradjedy, richness, irony, love, and loss. It many complex facets gleam like diamonds. I am in awe of this book. I beseach you: READ PRIDE AND PREJUDICE AT ALL COSTS!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"In college, Iw as supposed to read this book. But I never did because I just assumed it would be boring. Three years later, I tried it again... and I kicked myself for not having tried it sooner.I think my vision of reading Jane Austen always has me curled up in a chair while it's snowing outside, but in truth, the real memory of reading this book was sitting in the waiting room of a car mechanic while my car was being worked on. That day stands out because as usual, the mechanics only had the usual things to read: &quot;Guns and Ammo&quot; and &quot;Field and Stream&quot;. Add the requisite gumball machine in the corner with stale gumballs and you have the idea. I brought the book with me to read, but didn't really think I would get all that much reading of it done. True, I was reading it for fun, but it was Jane Austen after all, and I wasn't sure if I could really concentrate on her. Well, 200 pages later, bringing that novel with me was the best decision I ever made. 4 years later, I still rememebr how into this book I got. (I even had to take a walk around the block before I read the last chapter just to prolong finishing the story.) Once the story did end, I felt like I was saying goodbye to my friends.This book is riveting, it's fun, it's hysterical (wait for the rewarding confrontation between Lady Catherine deBourgh and Elizabeth...it's not only a battle of tongues, but a great clash of the &quot;refined&quot; yet uneducated upper classes, and the middle classes of Regentry England. This is by far my favorite Austen novel of the bunch (with Emma coming in a close second). So, this winter, wait for a snowy day (heck, choose any day, you can't have a bad Austen day) and get ready to be taken away. And no.. this book is not solely the domain of high school etachers and academians.. you'll be surprised how much you may enjoy it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"&quot;~Though only sixteen, I consider myself to be moderately well-read. I love reading, and, when I am between books, my life feels desolate and empty. One day, while in the most barren pit of ennui, I picked up Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice at my mother's recommendation. I do not ordinarily like my mother's taste in reading; her favorite books tend to be very dull, but so deep was my boredom that I succumbed to her suggestion.&quot;~ table, class and late into the night, I read my beloved Pride and Prejudice. I love everything about it. I love the characters; especially Elizabeth Bennet! I love the Victorian vernacular which works so well for this particular novel. I love the scintillating plot and the suspense created by knowing that Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy should be together but their pride and prejudice (hence the title) are (temporarily) keeping them apart.&quot;~ contemporary literature, but once one gets accustomed to it, it makes the novel even more pleasurable. I cannot imagine Elizabeth or Darcy or Bingley or Jane speaking any less eloquently; it would completly ruin the novel! The flowery language completes the whole effect of reading a Jane Austen novel.&quot;~ to read. I can offer no suggestions to the male reader, however, because generally this book, in every essence, is a female novel. I am not saying that men would definetly not enjoy it; I'm simply saying that I have yet to meet any male who has not addressed this book in a very vehement manner. and I know it won't be too long before I pick it up again. Jane Austen surely knew what she was doing when she wrote this one! Her Pride and Prejudice will always have an honored spot on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and prejudice is a beautifully written love story, full of humor and life-like imagery. The characters Elizabeth and Mr Darcy are both carved out nicely, with Austen's acute sense about how both men and women think and perceive beauty, love, society. The novel is a compelling read, and for diehard romantics like me, it is irresistable to the end. While Sense and Sensibility moves more slowly, and likewise also dwells on stories of two sisters, there the love stories are presented with maze of other matter. Here the hero must overcome his pride, the heroine must fight a battle with her prejudices, and both then discover not only love in each other but their real selves. Additional stories and people appear perfectly developed in their own roles of lovers, parents, friends, envious relations, grumpy grandmothers, lively teenagers, etc. The drama of a great movie or a soap opera is all here, with Austen's simple and elegant story telling.Many sequences and sentences are purely delightful or extermely hilarious, making the novel one of those reads where you are caught laughing aloud or smiling with twinkle your eyes alone, as you are relishing the new turn of events. While the story is set in Victorian era, the characters, emotions and humor is timeless. The novel is an easy read, fit for travel reading as well as for fun, and trust me, the romantic in you will be raving about it for a long time! In fact, two movies compelled me to reread the novel recently: Gurinder Chadda's Bride and Prejudice that reinvents the classic in a Bollywood flavor and Tom Hanks- Meg Ryan Starrer You've got mail. In You've Got Mail there are repeated references to the novel, and to the extent the opposites attract, and essential elements of novel are concerned, the movie is like a reincarnated version of the novel.Citation from You've Got MailConfession: I have read Pride and Prejudice about 200 times. I get lost in the language-words like thither, mischance, felicity. I'm always in agony over whether Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy are really going to get together. Read it - I know you'll love it.Meg Ryan's character, to her anonymous email friend, Tom Hanks in You've Got Mail.(the reference to the movie is for those who have seen and like the movie, else the novel is intrinsically enjoyable, and even for those who have seen this movie or the movie based on the novel, worth spending a fun-filled reading time with.)"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen, follows society's elite through the trials and tribulations of love, pride, money, and marriage negotiations. This novel takes place in 19th century England and revolves around the slow development of love found between two characters. The first of these characters is Elizabeth Bennet, a clever, beautiful, and spirited young woman. Pride and Prejudice begins, when Mrs. Bennet asks Mr. Bennet to call on their new neighbor, Mr. Bingley. Mr. Bingley has an income of 5 thousand pounds a year and is not married, so Mrs. Bennet hopes to marry one of her 5 daughters to him. Jane, the eldest daughter, and Mr. Bingley begin to like each other during a ball. Elizabeth, the second oldest, meets Mr. Darcy at the same ball. Darcy initially does not care for Elizabeth, and refuses to even dance with her.However, as Elizabeth grows to dislike Darcy, Darcy starts to become very fond of her. She and Darcy meet again when she stays with Mr. Bingley, because her sister, Jane, has taken ill at their house. Ms. Bingley, the sister of Mr. Bingley, herself hopes to wed Darcy, and seeks to make Elizabeth less appealing to Darcy. After Jane's recovery she and Elizabeth return home. There they welcomed to their home by their cousin Mr. Collins, who, because of the inheritance customs of the times (the Bennet girls had no brothers), was the heir to the Bennet family home. Together, Elizabeth and her family travel to town, where they met Mr. Wickham. Mr. Wickham notices Elizabeth, who he found charming, and describes to her a terrible deed he alleges Darcy had committed against him. Wickham claimed that Darcy owed him money and had denied him of a promised avocation. This new information causes Elizabeth to despise Darcy even more.Soon Mr. Collins, the rather odd clergyman, proposes to Elizabeth. To her mother's dismay, she refuses him. Instead, her friend Charlotte Lucas marries Mr. Collins, and Elizabeth goes to visit them and their neighbor the great Lady Catherine De Bourgh. During her stay Elizabeth sees Darcy again, and he proposes. Elizabeth refuses, reciting all the terrible things he had done, including the mistreatment of Wickham. In response, Darcy writes Elizabeth explaining how Wickham had tried to elope with his sister because of her money. Elizabeth is forced to rethink, her opinions relating to Darcy and Wickham.That summer Elizabeth traveled to Pemberly on holiday with her aunt and uncle, and while there her aunt and uncle wanted to see the beautiful Darcy estate. While visiting, Darcy showed up. Darcy and his sister heartily welcomed Elizabeth and her aunt and uncle, and invited them to dinner. Elizabeth began to grow fonder of Darcy. Dreadful news arrived during Elizabeth's stay at Pemberly. Her frivolous younger sister Lydia had run off with Wickham. Upon learning of the circumstances, Darcy sought out and found Wickham and Lydia, forcing them to marry. Elizabeth and her aunt and uncle returned to the Bennet home.Bingley and Darcy together visited the Bennet household to call upon Jane and Elizbeth. Jane became engaged to Bingley, and when Darcy proposed to Elizabeth, her heart had changed, so she said yes. Elizabeth had fallen in love Darcy. They had both seen past their pride and past the prejudices that they had learned from society. Elizabeth and Darcy were happy in marriage, and remained forever grateful to Elisabeth's aunt and uncle for uniting them.I would recommend the book Pride and Prejudice. It forces each of us to think about our roles in life. The novel also makes us think about our own pride and our own prejudices against others, and the need for us to learn more about people before we judge them. This book is also one of the greatest Romances of all time, bringing to life the love that a man and a woman held for each other from another era. It provides meaningful messages that all of us should learn. The characters are also interesting. This book is good for people who understand the use of language in the 19th century. Pride and Prejudice is a classic novel that I love, and believe everyone would enjoy."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I bought the set of audiotapes with no particular expectations, and I am pleasantly surprised. Ms Sharon Williams's reading is amazingly smooth, natural, and she depicts the personalities of each character with the intonations of her voice so perfectly that it always sound like there's more than one person reading, even though she doesn't alter her voice. I am particularly amazed by her rendition of Mrs Bennet. I can almost see the woman when I hear the talk!As an American, I am not fond of British accents, and I am happy to hear that Ms Williams read with some British influence, but it is overall pleasant and easy for me to understand. (In contrast, I dislike the accents on the Harry Potter movies.)I highly recommend this product.(If you haven't read Pride and Prejudice yet and is wondering if you should, the answer is yes! The classics are usually a drag to read, but not Pride and Prejudice. It moves fast, it is witty, insightful, and the language is easy to understand. I think it is the best book among the classics.)"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is viewed as one of the finest novels ever written, and rightfully so. Despite being only 22 years old when the original manuscript was finished, Austen displays an astonishing mastery of the English language that has rarely been equalled. The prose is so expertly constructed that the book maintains a brisk pace throughout and never becomes dull. Being so heavily dialogue-based, it's critical that the conversations in this book keep the reader interested. Fortunately, the snappy dialogue is what makes this book really shine. The characterization is nothing short of brilliant, from the silly Mrs. Bennett to the intolerable Mr. Collins. Despite the fact that nothing truly exciting ever happens, you'll find yourself desperate to turn the next page. I could not possibly recommend this book more."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This classic Jane Austen novel is one of my all-time favorites and I loved the novel on my Kindle as well. The imagery from the novel book version is just as good in the Kindle version. I recommend this to anyone who hasn't read it before and has a Kindle too."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I am a big fan on Jane Austen, so when this book was put out I had to get it. The book its self is written just like the classic; however, it has humorous and interesting side notes through out the book. I find the side notes very fun and interesting to read. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes the classic version."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I use an audio copy of P&P when teaching it in class - we read through important passages together without the loss of my voice. I previously owned a tape version - horrible because you had to FF to whatever parts you wanted. In fact my player ended up eating 2 of the tapes. This CD version is much better and I would highly recommend it, except... Normal audio CDs have tracks that correspond with the chapters. Not this one. The tracks were in random places (in the middle of a paragraph, even in the middle of sentences!) so trying to find the right chapter to start on required some detective work. If you're just planning to listen from start to finish, however, this is an excellent version- the reader is splendid."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Read this, and then re-read this. You will see elements to most every romance novel, play and movie produced since this work was published. If you're a bit obsessive, you may even become an Austenite, seeking P&P rewrites, continuations, movies derived from it, etc. My faves of these are Bridget Jones's Diary (the first book and movie), The Bar Sinister (book continuation), and Lost in Austen (movie). There are TONS of these types of adaptations and explorations of the original novel, and for good reason: it is excellent."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Believe it or not, I had never actually read Pride and Prejudice, though I have been an English and Drama teacher for over a decade. This book not only gave me the full text, but the little \\"insights\\" in the margin were interesting and often inspired my interest even more into the works of Austen. I think this would be a great book for everyone - those who have never read it and those who are on their hundredth reading. Kudos to the author."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I would have liked to have met Jane Austen, and I think she would find it entertaining that her books have lasted as long as they did.I won't review the book itself, but rather, the Kindle version of it. The book was free (amazing) and works splendidly across my non-Kindle devices, my iPod touch and my Blackberry. That way, I can sneak 10-15 mins worth of reading in on the train or bus without worrying about people making judgements about a man reading Austen.The test of a classic novel is whether or not you want to keep it handy and refer to it when you need inspiration, a solid read or just to get lost in a different world. Thanks to the Kindle edition of Pride and Prejudice, I can pretend I'm in the world of Mr. Darcy."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason. While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\\").It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love. An absolute must-read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Before I read this book I saw the 2005 film starring Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen. I loved the movie and I was inspired instantly to read Jane Austen's classic novel. Despite the fact that I had already seen the movie and knew the general progression of events I was still captivated by the novel. Jane Austen writes with an incredible literary style that is lacking in the works of most contemporary authors. She has an eloquence of words that is complex and yet far easier to read than most people seem to think. Though I am usually not a fan of novels that are based in reality without any hint of the supernatural I was enthralled by Austen's timeless love story which will leave every female reader pining for the dark and brooding Mr. Darcy."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen is an incredibly talented author and although I do love her other books, I do believe that Pride and Prejudice is her best work. I am one of those individuals who thoroughly enjoys reading great literature from around the world but to be completely honest, I had never read this book until after the new movie was released a couple years ago. After falling in love with the film, I went out immediately to purchase the novel and upon completion, Jane Austen \\"bewitched me body and soul\\" (as Mr. Darcy would say).Elizabeth Bennett remains to be one of the most complex, interesting, and relatable characters I have ever read. She encompasses all the alluring qualities a respectable lady was supposed to possess from that time era but additionally, many rebellious attributes that links her personality and inner battle with personal feelings vs. societal conventions, to modern day. She knows the place of women in the community- how they should talk, interact in society, her social standing, especially in relation to men, however, she also struggles with ideologies of romance and being her own individual- speaking her mind, voicing her opinions- no matter if it is Lady Catherine or her best friend Charlotte, as well as denying reputable marriage proposals for the hope of finding true love.Pride and Prejudice is not just an enrapturing love story but really transports you into a time period that is much different from today's world. It gives you insight into a completely different lifestyle, exposes the flaws and obsessions of a culture, and most importantly, it is all done so from a revolutionary point of view- the perspective of a woman who doesn't necessarily agree with the rules of societal acceptability.It is a great book and I whole-heartedly recommend reading it. And it only gets better each time you read it. I guarantee you too will fall in love with all the characters of Pride and Prejudice. If Lizzy or Mr. Darcy don't satisfy your need for a personal connection, I'm sure you can identify with the many other colorful characters- the deceiving, selfish, yet undeniably charming Mr. Wickham, the benevolent and kind spirited Jane Bennett, the frivolous Lydia Bennett, or even the middle child Mary Bennett, who even though is most accomplish, often goes unnoticed and under appreciated. There is something for everyone is this amazing story!Pride and Prejudice"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I wanted a cheap book at a great price, and this product delivered.

The ribbon bookmark is pretty and useful, and the print, surprisingly, is large enough to be read easily. The only fault I could find with this edition were a few minor typos; nothing of importance, and easily forgotten while caught up in the completely perfect story."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Not someone properly suited for such a task, I can tell you that. What I can do, however, is give an honest and heartfelt account of what I thought of Jane Austen's 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE'. I have always wanted to read some of the classics but have never up until now dug up the courage to actually do so. I thought if I was going to start reading a classic novel Jane Austen would probably be a good author to start with and what better choice was there than her stand out 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' ? I was pleased to find out that I was absolutely right. 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' has to be one of the most romantic novels that I have ever read. The romance between Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy literally made me swoon quite often (and I don't swoon!). Romance mixed with a little bit of drama and Austen's most descriptive prose made it impossible for me to put this book down. Now I see why 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' is on so many people's favorites list because now it is most certainly on mine."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I can imagine that Elizabeth Bennet (Lizzy) is Jane Austen herself, couldn't you?Jane Austen is a wonderful writer. She deserves much praise. With extraordinary insight into feelings and actions of characters. She does a good job of making each character distinct and well defined. The Bantam Classic edition of all of the classics is much better then the Barnes and Noble version.You must read this book even if it's but only for once (even thought there may be a possibility of you may not liking it) to give credit to what I consider a historic acknowledgement to a female writer.

Furthermore, she did a great job persuading the reader to switch back and forth to Wickham and Darcy's different sides.P and P is a book to not be overlooked! Everyone can get something out of it, whether that be knowledge, or just another wonderful and fun read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\\"With that incredible sentence Jane Austen draws the reader into her story. Is she serious we ask? 'A truth universally acknowledged' is the language of mathematics, of science, of logic; it is like saying: \\"we are dealing with self-evident truths--axioms.\\"How does this statement apply to society? to families? to manners?Although I have read many articles and reviews on Pride and Prejudice, its perennial enchantment has eluded me until now. What makes this novel a favorite of so many readers after so many years?The title to begin with, is provocative. Both terms pride and prejudice are applicable to Elizabeth Bennet and Darcy. But prejudice is directed more towards Darcy than Elizabeth. I would have like Jane Austen to use the word 'Prejudgement' as opposed to prejudice because the former word is laden with situational biases such as when Darcy prejudges Elizabeth: \\"She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt me.\\"Ah, the title is also alliterative; and it would have also worked with prejudgment.Not wanting to walk along the trodden path I want to propose a few personal impressions. First, it is a syntactically flawless--British English at its best-- narrative which is never boring; perhaps due to Austen's adroit handling of the Indirect Free Speech. Second, the characters are diverse: some attractive (Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy, Jane and Bingley) and others picturesque (Charlotte Lucas and Mr. Collins, Mrs. Bennet, and Lady Catherine de Bourgh). Third, that it is a moral work in which not only good manners and judicious decisions are privileged, but also virtue.When Plato cast poets and artists out of his Utopian Republic, little did he realize that one can learn virtue from literature as well as from philosophy. And that is a 'truth universally acknowledged.'[...]"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"i thank god for ms austen. amazing writing, i just don't have the words.

Once it did, however, I was completely enchanted. Our 21st century need for speed and immediate gratification takes a backseat as we move with Jane Austen through the every day lives and loves of her characters. The slow but steady pace of the novel allows the time to actually get to know and connect with the characters. Austen brings you fully into her world of 19th century England: with no difficulty you can feel the joys and sorrows, happiness and tribulations of the Bennet sisters and especially Elizabeth and Jane.Classic themes: scheming mothers, class distinctions, vanity, pride,false assumptions and misunderstandings abound...until by the novel's conclusion I could not help but find myself rooting for Elizabeth and Darcy.I thoroughly recommend this to anyone who loves classics and doesn't mind the slow pace that generally characterizes them."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"&quot;It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife&quot;. That's how my favourite book of all time begins, and it just keeps getting better.This novel deals with the pride and prejudices of the main characters Miss Elizabeth Bennett, and Mr. Darcy, as they try to find true love in pre-Victorian England. Elizabeth is a gentleman's daughter and Mr. Darcy is a gentleman, but Elizabeth, along with the rest of her sisters, are not good catches because, their inheritance is being entailed away to their cousin Mr. Collins, leaving them with very miserable looking dowries. Along with poor family connections, they stand little chance of marrying well or at all; they only have their charms to help them.That is until Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood along with his sisters, and accompanying them his close friend Mr. Darcy. Mr. Bingley becomes captivated with Jane Bennett, Elizabeth's eldest sister, and Mr. Darcy has an eye for Elizabeth herself, but can he see past her poor conditions, and can she see past his pride in order for them to get together? That's the question that keeps the audience captivated right up to the end.I try and find time to read this book at least once a year, and I've been doing that for a few years, and yet, it's always fresh when a get around to reading it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I was 12 years old and had the rare privilege of going shopping alone with my Mum. (With 2 sisters and a brother, this event was EXTREMELY rare.) I asked if we could browse in the book store. Half an hour later, we emerged. I was carrying a paperbag in which was enclosed my first copy of 'Pride and Prejudice'. As soon as we got in the car I started reading. I finished the book that night and I started it again the next morning. Even at 12 years old, I knew I was experiencing a masterpiece. In the 15 years since that day I have revisited the story of Elizabeth and Darcy numerous times. It just keeps getting better and better. Elizabeth was my idol. Darcy replaced Prince Philip, (from Disney's 'Sleeping Beauty'), as the man of my dreams. Mrs Bennett's nerves began to irk me as much as they did the long-suffering Mr Bennett. I love this book and I can't even begin to praise it, and the wonderful Jane Austen, enough. If you haven't read it - WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? If you have read it, I think its time to get it off your shelf, or get down to the library and relive the magic of 'Pride and Prejudice' all over again."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed Pride &amp; Prejudice. Although it has to be called a romance, I personally feel that the fascination is much more about the rules of behavior and courtship in Victorian society. The same story set in the modern day would not be nearly so interesting because you no longer have the rules to navigate that are present in the time in which it is set. It is the compliance with these rules and the reaction when they are not followed properly that makes the social structure of the time (as it is presented here) more like a chess game than a simple romance story. This given with characters and settings that have a feel to them that reminds me of Little Women made this book a great deal of fun to read. It was fast paced with plenty of intrigues.The back of my book puts the entire plot into one short paragraph. I was at first concerned that this would take the fun out of the reading since who marries who in the end was spelled out right there. However, in reading it I realized that it is not WHAT happens in this book as much as it is HOW it happens and in this Austen is a true master. Essentially the story is of the five daughters of the Bennett family. The addle-brained mother has no other concern than to marry her daughters off and the detached father generally just makes fun of the whole situation. Jane and Elizabeth are the two eldest daughters and Jane forms an attachment early on to Bingley, a gentleman who has leased a house/estate nearby. When a pompous Mr. Darcy interferes in Jane's attachment to Bingley, Elizabeth is turned vehemently against him - a sentiment further deepened by aspersions made by Mr. Wickham, Mr. Darcy's father's godchild. As fate would have it, Mr. Darcy develops an attachment to Elizabeth and has to redeem himself in her eyes, despite his feelings of social superiority and her many resentments.I don't know if the title is to reflect the pride of Mr. Darcy and the prejudice of Elizabeth against him. At one point she says the following: \\" Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.\\" I see her really exploring this in the character of Mr. Darcy and his relations and feel that the title may have more to do with the exploration of this sentiment than in any of the individual characters."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"For the typical male, the only thing worse than reading a romance novel is reading a two-hundred-year-old romance novel. So why'd I bother? Because I'm a firm believer that serious readers should occasionally expand their horizons and sample books from other genres, especially those they'd normally pooh-pooh. Because that's when we get pleasantly surprised.Pride and Prejudice fell into this category for me. I wanted a break from the mystery/suspense genre and had heard good things about Jane Austen. As I dug in, my expectations were met early on: plodding, expository chunks of Old English describing landscapes and feelings. Ugh. But then she got me.Like peeling an onion, Austen uncovers characters and a story that are simply genius. Like Shakespeare, she proves again that time and technology have no impact on basic human impulses and the complexities of love. This book will be just as popular in another two hundred years. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"My 13 year old daughter and I just finished reading this book and LOVED it! As we read the book, we kept noticing that many of the characters remind us of people we know! It was funny, and really says a lot for Jane Austen's insight on human nature. Her characters are very realistic in my opinion.We learned from the book that in Jane Austen's time in England, it was very important to say and do the right things and to be excruciatingly polite. P&amp;P can be tedious to read until you get used to the way they talk, but once you do it really makes it even more amusing to read.I tried to read P&amp;P once before a few years ago, but I only got about a third of the way through the book. I just couldn't understand it well enough. I would recommend to anyone who was put off by the book to give it another chance. See one of the excellent videos first if you don't understand it, and then come back and literally FEAST on the book, which is so much better! I know that reading it has expanded my ability to appreciate good literature, and I know I will read all of Jane Austen's novels now."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"In case you are wondering, the novel it tied with is Dostoevsky's THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV.I have read this three times in three sittings. In case that is not clear, I mean to say that I have sat down to read PRIDE AND PREJUDICE on three separate occasions, and did not get up until I had finished it. I once stayed up all night long to finish it.Actually, I read it a fourth time, aloud to my then 8-year-old daughter Elizabeth (who was delighted to find an Elizabeth in the book). She liked it so much that she in turn read it twice. Just one of the great, irrestible book in the English language."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is one of the most-beloved novels by Jane Austen. Words cannot do it justice, but I'll try anyway, since I love it so much. The story of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy is absolutely timeless. From the opening line, which is my all-time favorite opening line- \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a large portion must be in want of a wife,\\" we are drawn into this superb love affair, one which it is difficult to pull ourselves away from. I've read this book numerous times now and I always wonder what's going to happen.Here Jane Austen uses a sufficient amount of wit to satirize the social graces and foibles of the middle and upper classes in Regency England. From the modest Bennet family, with its five daughters, to Caroline Bingley and Mrs. Hurst, to whom social class is everything, we are given a superb picture of life as Austen saw it.There's also an undercurrent theme in which not everything is what it seems to be. Darcy is not the proud, cold gentleman he seems, nor is Elizabeth as feisty as she appears to others. And, while Elizabeth certainly understands the intents of others, she does not necessarily understand the workings of her own heart."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Not bad overall, but missing punctuation and some half sentences serve to pull the reader out of the story. Unfortunate, as this is one story in which the reader hopes to get perfectly lost."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The first time I read this book was at the age of 13. My mother had an old, worn, 1950s copy of the book on our bookshelf, and one day I just decided to give it a try. I think the first 50 pages were a bit of a mystery to me. I remember struggling with the language at the beginning, and having to look up several words in the dictionary. After 100 pages, I had finally \\"learnt the language,\\" and managed to at last translate it into my native tongue. I enjoyed it, and over the years I returned to it again and again. Now, at the age of 35, I practically have numerous passages memorized, and reading the book is no longer a culture shock. Every word of this novel is an old friend, and I wouldn't remove a single one from the text. This is the book I turn to when I'm in the mood to read, but not in the mood to read something new.Every time I read it, I am struck by its relevance. I don't mean the morals or the need to marry well in order to win approval from society (although I think we still see a little of that to this day). I refer to the characters. Their personalities and basic code of principals are timeless. I can identify with every single character in this novel. When Lizzy and Mr. Darcy fell in love, their courtship could have taken place anywhere and at any point in time. That is why her novels are so well adapted into modern films.You cannot possibly do wrong by reading this novel."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Let me tell you about my first impression of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. At the age of thirteen, it was one of the most amazing love stories I had ever read. Five years later, it became one of the most wittily crafted stories I had ever read. By the time I was twenty-one, it was the finest work of literature I had ever experienced.Elizabeth Bennet is a byproduct of genteel poverty. The second daughter of five, she possesses the most sense, tact, poise, and sound judgement of the family in general. On the other hand, she is also irreverent, daring, and judgemental. She stretches the envelope of what might be construed as &quot;polite&quot; society. She also acknowledges the limitations of her gender even as she subtly tries to defy them.As a part of the landed gentry, Mr. Darcy is the embodiment of all that is dignified and honored. He is a gentleman who was born to privilege and money. His kind make up the &quot;polite society&quot; Elizabeth dares to flout. His pride, his disdain, and his arrogance make him unappealing to the people of Longbourn, as well as the community surrounding it. It is his interference with the relationship between his friend and her beloved sister, however, which is a personal affront to Elizabeth.It is fortuitous that Austen retitled her book because First Impressions does not begin to touch upon the complexities that Pride and Prejudice, as a title, connotes. In Darcy and Elizabeth, Austen has drawn two very complex characters who, on the one hand, seem simply drawn and characterized, but on the other, are so much more than they seem. It would be easy to say that Darcy is arrogant and Elizabeth is willful. The truth is, looking beyond my own first impression, as a reader, Austen has deceptively crafted two characters whose thoughts and actions make it clear that they aptly straddle both of the title characteristics."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I cannot even hope to do justice to how well written this book is. For the reasons already stated here by others and many more I love this book! I have read it a good 10 times and I never seem to tire of it. Through a stroke of genius that is purely her, Jane Austen has created timeless characters that manage to capture your heart. The witty banter between Darcy and Elizabeth is always engaging and never fails to bring a smile to my face. Read this book. It is a must for everyone."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen, in her novel Pride and Prejudice, contrasts characters through a battle of social conflict. Elizabeth Bennet, a young woman of lively character, strives against an equal adversary, Fitzwilliam Darcy, a man well endowed by fortune. As the two haughtily battle wits, Mr. Darcy falls in love with Elizabeth, further complicating the story's intricate plot; while Elizabeth's sister, Jane, falls for Mr. Bingley, Mr. Darcy's best friend. Mr. Darcy's pride against Elizabeth's social standings and Elizabeth's unfounded prejudice against Mr. Darcy's seemingly snobbish habits form a classic tale of romance and humor.The intricate twists of fate intertwine the lovers in their conquests, defeats, and humbling of character. Mix-ups in the tale create a humorous love story with a relish for varied characters undoubtedly human in their emotions and actions. Austen vividly illustrates contrast in social class during the Regency era while exposing human flaws. Characters such as Mrs. Bennet, Lydia and Mr. Wickham warn the reader of the mishaps caused by characters unscrupulous in their wayward actions. Yet as the story unfolds, one cannot help but fall in love with this tale of a man and a woman beset by emotions they fall victim to."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Although I picked up the book for a 12th grade English class, Jane Austen captivated me with her polished dialogues and intricate descriptions. Pride and Prejudice is more than just a love story between Darcy and Elizabeth, and Bingley and Jane. It is a satire of a society in which money is the driving force behind love and social status means everything. The story is set in England and focuses on the four Bennet daughters, primarily with Elizabeth Bennet, who is the second oldest daughter. She meets Mr. Darcy at a ball and detests his pride. Although he is very rich and quite handsome, she is certain that Darcy thinks he is above his company, and that disgusts her. But although she is drawn to him by hate, the hate turns into love through a series of events and dialogue. Austen uses rich dialogues to form her comedy, and in the end a reader will not only learn that love can conquer all pride and prejudices, but he will also laugh at a society full of arranged marriages and love based on what a spouse could bring to a marriage. This book is a &quot;classic&quot; for good reason. Austen's diction is exquisite, somewhat challenging, but after a few chapters, she has the reader hooked. Although picked up for a 12th grade English class, I know I will pick up it up again and will pick up some of Austen's other books. I would recommend this book to other high schoolers that need to read a classic for school, but also to people of any age looking for an excellent piece of writing."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I like when that what I read is realy interesting. I must say that Jane Austin wrote about life in England in the begining of 19th century. Lots of my friends think that it is'n actual at the moment, but I think it is nesesery to now how live people 200 years ago. I like her books."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is a wonderful book with a wonderful theme that is a good lesson for everyone to learn. I loved all of the characters and even if I didn't love their actions, I loved the artful description of them. Though in the beginning I really did not like Mr. Darcy, by the end he was one of my favorite characters along with Elizabeth. The ending was great and I was very satisfied with it. It had a great plot and kept me looking forward to the next part. Another great thing about, while it was described wonderfully, it was not confusing and I was able to follow the story the whole way through the book. I also thought that the whole time period back then, though it had many bad aspects like a great rift between the very rich and others, was still a great time period with manners and etiquette that we in this time are lacking. Overall I really loved the book and am looking forward to reading other Jane Austen books."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It is almost 200 years since \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" was first published. It ought to be the equivalent in literature of those faded, dried flowers that used to be found pressed between the pages of the old family bible. Instead it is redolent of freshly cut flowers still carrying a sprinkling of morning dew.The freshness and the perfection of form are certainly astonishing. Jane Austin is as good as story teller as ever picked up a pen, knowing exactly how to construct plots, and what incidents and dialogues to detail in full and what to briefly summarize. Her \\"world\\" is small but intricately constructed. Every characteristic, quality and idea has a precise and fixed value, all being ranked strictly and sternly according to decorum, logic and morality.Despite its architectural perfection, however, a recent re-reading reveals one or two construction features that are questionable. How could it be, for example that Fitzwilliam Darcy could have such a dragon for an aunt? I also wonder about the friendship between Darcy and Bingley. How did it begin? It is obviously important to each, but we are given nothing of its history.Jane Austen lived long enough to see this book published and enjoyed amongst her own family and a small readership. Her mother entertained family members with it, reading it, in Jane Austen's estimation, a little too quickly. Distinguished British actress Lindsay Duncan reads it with perfect timing and inflexion in this highly recommended audio tape format, which presents the novel in an unabridged version of just over twelve hours."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"You may have heard that literature is an example of the time and place during which it was written. Pride and Predjudice is such a book. While many think of it as a serious book, it is actually quite humerous. Austen's portrayal of love and marriage is a perfect example of how it should be. From marraige-obsessesed Mrs. Bennett, to the intelligent Lizzy to attractive Fitzwilliam Darcy, the book is a masterpiece! This is one book that I could (and have!) read over and over again. I challenge someone to tire of it! If you are looking for a classic, witty and all around fun book, this is it!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have read this book only very recently. It is truly an excellent piece of literature. It is a story of appearance and reality. The author, Jane Austen, uses extensive and challenging vocabulary. The words flow off the pages. Sometimes, I read the same passage three or four times to fully understand what it was trying to convey. The main character, Mr. Darcy, is extremely proud. He is selfish and rude, until he meets Miss Elizabeth Bennet. But, Miss Bennet is far below his social standing. It is interesting to see how the characters change in the book over time. If you want a challenge, have some time, and love good literature, this book is for you!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have read this book only very recently.

Without a doubt, one of the best books I have ever read.Jane Austen proves that brevity is not the soul of wit. Here razor-sharp pen peels back the outward polish and fine veneer of a host of stuffed shirts. Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy live and breath, and I am addicted to their story even though I know the outcome. Plot is not the reason to read &quot;Pride and Prejudice,&quot; rather it is just to take pleasure in good writing and cheer.After this book, I am diving headfirst into the world of Jane Austen. Amazing that it took me this long to discover her."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice was a good book, I really like it. Pride and Prejudice basically was about marriages. In old England, a man who has good fortune must need a good manner and charming wife, and a grown girl who has good education, high manner, a litter beauty must in want of a husband. That is why the whole story happen. In the author Miss Austen's book, she used very decent and nice words, and she described the emotion of the characters truely and let people feel the characters really existed."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a classic, no doubt about it, but why should anyone read it now? Austen's humor and satire are a bit understated in today's world, but for the reader who pays attention to the details and to whitty dialog, should get a kick out of numerous scenes throughout the novel. Another gift that Austen has is being able to portray intense emotions without having to spell those emotions out. I first read this book as a freshman in high school and I didn't finish it until the second attempt. After that I forgot most of what I read and then had to reread it about four years later and now read it every year just to remind myself what a classic book is really like."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I've just finished reading this book again for probably the 20th time. The first time I read it was in my early 20s. I was amazed that Elizabeth, the main character, a young woman in her 20s from early 19th century England,was so likeable and full of life. I definitely related to her.Seeing the famous BBC/A&amp;E production in the mid 1990s only increased my joy of this book.Austen was an incredible observer of the manners and mores of her time. This book lets her playfulness and human spirit shine through.This is one title I will never tire of reading."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is filled with memorable characters and beautifully written prose that deserve applause. I instantly liked it from the first paragraph. Certainly literature that demands a second reading."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is surely the most delicious of Jane Austen's novels. Austen writes with superb insight of the era she was living in!The characters are wonderful - the spirited and rebellious Lizzie Bennett, proud and handsome Darcy, the gloriously silly Mrs Bennett and the ogre that is Lady Catherine de Burgh. If you only ever read one classic novel, then this is the one to read. Follow it with the BBC video version (1995), a glass of wine, a large box of chocs. and curl up on the sofa. Enjoy !!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I was forced to read Jane Austen's &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; as an assignment in my British Literature class. Though it was not a voluntary thing at first, it soon became one. I could kiss my english teacher for making me read this! I read it in three days, hardly stopped to put it down, it was so engrossing. After reading it I promptly went out and watched the 5 hour A&amp;E movie (Colin Firth is to die for, and it stays truer to the book than any other movie I've seen thus far).Austen's writing style is brilliant and has such a nice, familiar tone that even though she is poking fun at much of society, she was probably quite fond of her characters. Elizabeth Bennet, the heroine, was a wonderful character and is by far one of the most real fictional people I have ever had the pleasure of reading about. I love how her relationship with Mr. Darcy changes gradually and his true character is revealed. My only wish is that sequels were in style then and Austen had thought to right one or simply make the book longer.I had to read this book because it is a classic. However, I would recommend this book to everyone, not because it is a classic, but because it is such a beautiful story with 3-dimensional characters who will pull you into a world you will not want to leave."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is an amazing, amazing critique and representation of nineteenth century society. All I have to say is wow. This edition, however, is very small print, and definitely not easy on the eye. I am reviewing this one because it was the version that recieved from school. It is so enticing, once i reached about halfway through the book, I couldn't put it down at all. I was delighted with the complexity of the characters and the way in which Jane Austen opens up the thought process of the main character, Elizabeth. This is one of the few classics that deserves the word &quot;classic&quot; to be applied to it. Pride and Prejudice is a must read for anyone, but requires a substantial amount of thought and maturity. I loved it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I must admit that when I finally finished reading Pride and Prejudice I wish I hadn't finished. This is by far the best story i have ever read in my short life. This woman is one of the best writers I have ever encountered and this novel got me hooked. I was so detirmined to finish it that i stayed up all night long reading. I could not wait to see what was ever to become of Elizabeth and Darcy. I started reading it as an assignment for my 9th grade honors english class one week ago and was kicking myself at the end of the book for not reading it on my own. I have now started Sense and Sensibility but I am sure that nothing could be as good as Pride and Prejudice. If anyone hasnt read this you are missing out on a great story. I have yet to see the mini series but i plan on borrowing it from my teacher. I urge everyone to experience Pride and Prejudice."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The book was recommened to me and I did not think that I would enjoy it, but I started reading it anyway. The book drew me in adn I could not put it down. The characters are all so charming. Elizabeth Bennet is by far my favorite character. She is very admirable, witty, smart, well informed and always polite. She was always more concerned with her sister's love life then with her own. This brings us to another character, Jane Bennet. Jane is the prettiest in the Bennet family and her mother's favorite child. Her relationship with Mr. Bingley, the new neighbor, is the talk of the town. Their relationship is referred to a lot in the book, but the novel focused mostly on Elizabeth and her relationship with Mr. Darcy. This is waht kept me interested in the book. The story line is romatnic and kept me guessing as to what was going to happen next. The question throughout the novel is if anything will happen between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys romantic story lines."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I had expected this book to be so dry and boringly romantic that I almost loathed the idea of starting it. Once I got into it, however, I had to admit that not only was this book really well written, but it was far more captivating than I ever imagined it would be. The book is true to its title, using the plot of Elizabeth and her sisters and family to illustrate thoroughly the concepts of pride and prejudice as they related to 19th century England society. This book and its sister novel, &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; are both not only better written than most contemporary novels, but also share appropriately the attributes of being timeless novels. Though much lighter in spirit than many other &quot;timeless&quot; works of that and other early eras, particularly Joyce or Wilde, the novels nonetheless convey well an important intellectual body of work and culture."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"How a spinster who was living in relative isolation in the English countryside during the earliest years of the 19th century was able to write the ultimate romance novel is a question that nobody now alive can answer.Yet in PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, this is exactly what author Jane Austen has accomplished.Written at a moment in time when it clearly was too early to have been inspired by the writings of other authors, P-and-P has every component that the greatest love stories require. The lovers meet, there is tension, there is conflict, there is separation and, finally, with the reader's pulse quickened, there is the acknowledgment of their feelings for one another.Lizzie Bennett and her hero, the conveniently rich Fitzwilliam Darcy, are two of the most significant lovers to be found in literature. And, in creating them, Jane Austen laid the groundwork for the elements that would need to be present in the modern romance novel.All of Miss Austen's books are worth reading, but PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is unique among them in being great."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"My favorite chapter in the novel Pride and Prejudice is chapter 16 of volume III (or chapter 58) because Elizabeth finally accepts Darcy's marriage proposal. It amazed me how she was still able to say yes after she was insulted in every way possible especially after disliking him so much in the beginning of the novel.This book is appropriate for anyone who is able to appreciate well-written literature. Anyone would enjoy reading this book, from teenagers to adults.One literary device I appreciated was epigram, which is a brief, clever, and usually memorable statement. An example of this would be \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in wants of a wife\\" which is found on the first page of the novel. The entire novel was based on this quote. Mrs. Bennet wanted to get all five of her daughters married before her husband died.I liked the novel. I found Elizabeth's romance with Darcy intriguing. It was interesting how in the beginning she rejected his proposal and disliked him, and at the end she marries him."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"My favorite chapter in the novel Pride and Prejudice is chapter 16 of volume III (or chapter 58) because Elizabeth finally accepts Darcy's marriage proposal.

It's very detailed and it's a very easy to comprehend and read. When you read this book you will have a better vision of the women in the 19th century had to live. It also talked about entailment, which means that after the father dies , the next male heir takes over the property and females are not able to inherit.The novel is not your usual love story because in the beginning of this story the two characters who treat each other as if they were the devil end up falling for each other; although, in the beginning of the story you get a sense of who the characters are going to end up with, except one or two couples. My favorite chapter in this novel is the first chapter because it deals with pride and prejudice, exactly the title of the novel. In the first chapter you see that Darcy has a lot of pride and Elizabeth's prejudice towards Darcy.I like Jane Austen's use of dramatic irony because we as the readers know what's going to happen before the characters, like as the story goes on we know that Darcy will ended up with Elizabeth by the way they treat each other. I would recommend people of 16 and up to read this book because this novel does not make you want to go to sleep. It makes you want to keep reading."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice was such a delight to read. Anybody who enjoys reading will love the book. Its tales of love and money will grab and hold your attention. The author's use of conflict between her characters is marvelously done. Conflict was a literary device I appreciated from the book. It brings interest, excitement and wonder to the story.A favorite chapter of mine would have to be chapter nineteen. Austen's portrait of Mr. Collin is solidified in this chapter. The manner in which he proposed to Elizabeth was a prime example of his pompous nature.Pride and Prejudice is a light-hearted and romantic book. I would recommend the book to any teenager or adult. Its topics are very relatable to both age groups."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a classic novel from the 19th century. It is by far one of the best books I have ever read.The conflict that Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy go through is what makes this book such an exciting love story. I would say that the best chapter of this story is chapter 7 volume 1, where Jane goes to Mr. Bingley's on the horse and gets a cold. This is the part of the story were things start to change. One example of this would be the interest that Mr. Darcy starts to show for Elizabeth. This happens because Jane catches a cold on her way to the Bingley's house and Elizabeth goes to the Bingley's house to take care of her sister. As Darcy spends time with Elizabeth, he starts to show interest in Liz.Another important thing about this book is that Jane Austen uses imagery very well to make us get into the book. I must say that there were times when I was caught up in reading since everything was well described. An example of Austen using imagery is when she describes what kind of people the Bennet's mom and dad are. For example, at the beginning of the story, the writer talks about Mr. Bennet and Mrs. Bennet and how different the two people are. In chapter 1 the author describes Mrs. Bennet as a foolish person and a fussy gossiper. Mr. Bennet is quiet and kept to himself. In chapter 4 we have a very good description of personalities in two different important characters, Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bingley. Mr. Bingley is cheerful and sociable while Mr. Darcy is clever but less tactful, and unlike Mr. Bingley he finds the people dull; in other words, he criticizes people way too much.I would recommend this book for high school students because it opens your mind to new and real things. It teaches you, mostly girls, to value the liberties that are given to you. I say this because back then women didn't have many choices or liberties to do what they wanted. Back then women had to do what their husband wanted and now women have many liberties."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"My favorite chapter in \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is chapter thirty four because this chapter presented the plot's climax. The author has carefully built the plot so that Darcy's proposal comes at the height of Elizabeth's anger toward him. This chapter presents a new obstacle in the plot, Darcy's proposal to Elizabeth, who promptly turns him down. If Darcy had worded his proposal in a romantic way, Elizabeth would have reacted differently, but Darcy's pride makes him act in a superior way. When he proposes, he indicates that he makes the offer in spite of her minor social position and her ignorant family. Elizabeth's previously established prejudice against Darcy is intensified and she does not even consider marrying such an arrogant man. Darcy accuses Elizabeth of being too proud, while Elizabeth accuses him of being prejudiced, but the truth is that both characters are guilty of pride and prejudice.The ages for which this book would be appropriate are ages thirteen and up because it gives a good lesson on what life was like in the early nineteenth century. For example, women can't inherit their own estate; only men can.One literary device that I appreciate is Satire. The author satirizes the manners of all classes, exposing people who have excessive pride as rude and often foolish, regardless of wealth.I like this book because in many ways it is a very accurate portrayal of what a woman's life was like in the early nineteenth century. Its message is that love is more important than financial gain."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is a one-of-a-kind book. When your start to read this intriguing book, you will see its magnificent plot. The main focus of the novel is the Bennet family. The family worried because their estate is entailed and Mr. and Mrs. Bennet only have daughters. When an estate is entailed, only a male can inherit the estate. Mrs. Bennet wants to help her daughter find a wealthy husband so she could be financially well off, but that wasn't her only reason. She also wanted to see her daughters get married and become mothers. That's where the entire novel becomes interesting.Well I don't really have a favorite chapter because it had many chapters that caught my attention and made me see things in another way. But if I would have to choose a chapter I would choose chapter one because that's where you see what the novel will be about. This novel would be perfect for teenagers and up to read.One literary device that I appreciated from the novel was imagery because I could picture big events in the novel in my head. For example, one big event that I could picture in my head was when Charles Bingley, a wealthy man, rented the manor known as Netherfield Park and that causes a great stir in the neighboring village of Longbourn. What specifically creates an image for me is that Jane Austen is very descriptive in her writing and she has a way of showing things to the readers. To be descriptive in her writing she uses powerful words to set the mood for what's taking place. For example, in chapter 22 and 23, news arrives that Mr. Collins has proposed marriage to Charlotte Lucas and she has accepted. Elizabeth is shocked but Mrs. Bennet, of course, is furious with her daughter Elizabeth for allowing a husband to escape her. Before that had happened, Mr. Collins had proposed marriage to Elizabeth, but she had refused. The mood went from pleasant to drastic in such a short moment. I really like this awesome novel because it opened up a new world for me; it showed me that in the old days things were different from what they are now."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is an illustrious and fascinating book to read because of its twisted plot that attracts readers. What really made me crave the book was the love-hate relationship Elizabeth and Darcy maintained. My favorite chapter of the book was chapter two in volume III where Austen gives an optimistic overview on Elizabeth and Darcy's relationship as well as Jane and Bingley. She expresses Elizabeth's strong feelings towards Darcy and foreshadows a second proposal.I enjoyed reading the book because of the setting and the era in which it was written. It's quite interesting to read their proper English and try to understand their rare humor. I believe that the right type of age group would be senior students, around the age of seventeen to eighteen and above because of the mature language the author uses. I strongly recommend this book especially to women who like &quot;fairy tale&quot; type of endings in a novel.The literary device that I appreciated was dramatic irony because I found it appealing to see how Elizabeth and Darcy's relationship was going to end up. It was exhilarating to see that Darcy was going to propose to Elizabeth for the second time and she not know about it while she was thinking she had lost him forever. That to me was good enough to want to read the book all over again."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is an excellent novel written in the 19th century about the hardships of love, pride, and prejudices.My favorite chapter in Pride and Prejudice is Chapter 8, Volume 1. In this chapter, Elizabeth goes to visit her sick sister, Jane, at the Bingley's estate and during her stay at Netherfield, Caroline continues to insult her. ELizabeth, being the head-strong, outspoken person she is, became fed up with Caroline's constant insultsand began to reciprocate in the same manner and made Caroline feel foolish.Pride and PRejudice is a great, romantic classic that most people would enjoy. In my opinion, this particular novel is directed towards a more mature audience. Because of the sophisticated language and the constant event change, I also think that this novel should be read at a high school level or higher, depending on the person's own reading level and his/her understanding of the use of language in the 19th century.One literary device that I appreciate is the external conflict between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. At first Elizabeth &quot;could hardly stand to be in the same room as him,&quot; but as the plot progresses, she and Mr. Darcy become infatuated with each other and will not speak of their hidden feelings.I enjoyed this novel because it challenged my mind. It made me wonder what role women play in today's society: it has indeed changed dramatically, but the process has been slow. The novel forced me to think about my past predilections and the disorder they caused in my life."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have to say that I like this book so far.I have never actually read Pride and Prejudice before but i have seen the movie many times.
