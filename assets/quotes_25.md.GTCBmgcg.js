The description of the &quot;snake museum&quot; was perfect - we read it out loud to the group as we stood in the park. Much of the information provided to us by our hosts from Nairobi matched what we already had learned from our reading. When we prepare for our next trip anywhere, we'll look first for a Rough Guide!"},{"Title":"The Rough Guide to Kenya","review":"I was looking for information on the Tsavo National Parks in Kenya, and having a very difficult time finding specific information about the area, where to stay, how difficult to drive (esp. across the Tanzanian border). No other guides gave as much information about Tsavo as the Rough Guide did. These two parks have had \\"up and down\\" popularity, but are located in an area that has intrigued me for some time. So, having a guide book that goes into some detail about them and offers fairly up to date frank opinions about places to go and stay was refreshing. I checked on some other less traveled areas and found that this book also had some nice detail. None of the books mention the horrors of Mombasa Highway (too many huge trucks, Lorries and buses expressing diesel smoke) but that is I suppose to be expected. The long and short is, don't waste your time on the other guide books if you are looking for Tsavo East and West unless you find a book that is devoted to these interesting parks. (I have been unable to find one) Read the reviews before you buy and then enjoy. I have always loved guide books and have traveled extensively around the world. With a husband who is always working, I, as the widow, must make my way on my own to find the most interesting places, and then places that we can return to together for his short breaks. Guide books are my salvation or my curse. I live nearly half my time in Tanzania, and am no longer easily fooled."},{"Title":"The Rough Guide to Kenya","review":"After looking at a lot of different options, we purchased this guidebook before moving to Kenya. It does a great job of giving lots of pertinent information on the reasons to visit different places and how to do so - more useful information than the other big name travel books. If anything, however, it's a little too rough for us mid-thirties family people. For example, we are much more likely to drive ourselves, rather than make the whole family suffer through matatu travel, but the Rough Guide doesn't give info relevant to drivers. It's even more incongruous when taken together with the $500 per person per night tented safaris described -- with directions on how to hitchhike there instead of landmarks for driving. Other than that, the information is great and we have found everything to be updated and accurate."},{"Title":"The Rough Guide to Kenya","review":"This is a very comprehensive guidebook and it's been a good resource, but...every introduction to each section seems to include some unrealistic and paternalistic desire for Kenya to return to its Out of Africa roots.

It's a bit much, but if you are looking for something informative that covers more than the Masai Mara and other luxury destinations, this is it."},{"Title":"The Rough Guide to Kenya","review":"A helpful feature of Rough Guides is a listing of other reading for the Kenyan traveler.

Also, gave good advice on the best rooms in a hotel (e.g. not over the bar). This is true at least for hotels in the very cheapest level, as I was budget travelling and never stayed or ate in places above level 2 price range.Additionally, directions on how to get to out-of-the-way places via local transport was really helpful."},{"Title":"The Rough Guide to Kenya","review":"Rough Guide definitely looks smarter today than it used to. Typeface and design overhauled, and even their hideous logo (which STILL looks like a fire exit sign) has been jazzed up into a more agreeable fuzzy pharmaceutical-looking symbol. There are more photos, and better ones. Information, from what I could see, is accurate, and there good practical tips, as usual.The problem is their writing. They say in their preface that Kenya is a hugely rewarding country to visit - but there is no evidence of the authors having a good time. The text is dry, uninspired, shallow; again, it reminds you of tax return guidance notes.It does not FEEL like they liked the country; and, while it is evident that a lot of effort has been put in, it does feel like a 'contractual obligation product' rather than an inspired writing from someone who is genuinely connected with Kenya.While I found hotel descriptions helpful, dining advice is the most disappointing aspect. People who know Kenya better than I do confirmed to me, with bewilderment, that restaurants appear to have been picked at random or, worse, still, their names have been copied from leaflets lying around in upmarket hotels. It is a real shame in a country where you can have the best Ethiopian meal outside Addis.The section on getting to Kenya is hardly helpful - essentially lots of hot air on theoretically available airline options, prices which were out of date before the guide was even printed and a stubborn refusal to admit that these days, if anyone is too thick to check the price on the net, perhaps that person would be better off staying at home.It is commendable that the guide is more open to all kinds of readers and does not presume that everyone only has twenty dollars a day to spend, but its value is diminished by the lacklustre writing. An informative and accurate guide does not need to be this boring."},{"Title":"The Rough Guide to Kenya","review":"My friend and I were in Kenya for a month on business/pleasure.

The book is organized by regions- has great explanations for what to anticipate- the prices were a bit off, which can be expected- but the cultural insights and attractions were very accurate. It allowed a dialogue with local tour agencies and the hotel we stayed in to negotiate our excursions & transportation- the hotel & travel agencies had a tendency to push certain things and not recommend others that the book suggested. We hired a driver to take us from Nairobi to other places in Kenya that were, at the most, 3 hrs away. Having a written reference allowed for a ready resource throughout the trip."},{"Title":"The Rough Guide to Kenya","review":"I just got back from a driving trip through Kenya and this guide was fantastic! The city maps were excellent. The hotels were what I expected after reading the reviews and most of the recommended restaurants were as good as described. I've used many travel guides over the years and this was one of the best. The only thing I would add is info on the mileage between towns and perhaps some info on parking security at hotels for those of us who are driving. Anyway, kudos to the author and my thanks for making our trip a pleasure. A good travel guide really makes a difference as I realized to my dismay when I had to switch to another guide for Uganda which was deficient in so many of the above respects."},{"Title":"The Rough Guide to Kenya","review":"Best map I've seen of Kenya.

I picked it up at a local library because I saw the name Mowat and thought, &quot;Funny, Isn't he a Canadian naturalist? What's he doing in the History section?&quot; What followed was a fascinating voyage of war,adventure,hilarity and,ultimately,tragedy and pain. Walking into the experience of WWII with a completely innocent demeanor, anxious to get into a fight, this brilliant writer has many funny and almost fatal false starts. When the fighting gets serious, the glib descriptions of his units treacherous challenges are positively riveting. I COULD NOT PUT THIS BOOK DOWN. If you like your war personal, exciting and honest, get this book to a comfortable chair and be prepared to not move for a night and a day. A brilliant book by a Canadian national treasure."},{"Title":"And No Birds Sang","review":"This is a much overlooked classic now days. Mr. Mowat has given us a vivid first hand account of his expierences during WWII and this book ranks at the top of such works. Not only do we get a first hand view of the actual fighting (found in many/most accounts), but we also see the other side of the war. The horrible loneliness and boredom. Mr. Mowat is an acute observer of human nature, something he uses with a cutting edge in this book. For this amature historian of this period, and those just passingly interested, this is a good read and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"And No Birds Sang","review":"Mowat developed into a fine writer, and you can see that he was destined to record his generation's fight with the Germans. He's that classic \\"writer guy\\" immortalized in so many books and movies.Unlike most of those, he is utterly real, and thus, believable. The result is that the non-battle portions of the book are just as gripping as the battle scenes, and there are plenty of fine examples of both.When his unit is sent to scale the cliffs behind the Germans, it is fabulous reading. I had never heard of the assault on Assoro, so following Mowat as he leads the men climbing up the cliff, I had no idea how it would come out.It's better than fiction - as it should be. I'm now going on to read more Mowat!"},{"Title":"And No Birds Sang","review":"In late 1943, the western allies attack the so-called &quot;soft-underbelly of Europe&quot; and worked their way up from Sicily through the boot of Italy. Horrendous battles ensued with names writ large in history, Salerno, Cassino, Anzio are a few that are evoked.On the extreme right hand side of the Allied Line, at a coastal village called Ortona, a personal contest of wills was under way between the German Parachute Regiment of battle-hardened soldiers who has seen tours of duty on the Russian Front, against Canadians from dispirate backgrounds with little combat experience.In the month-long battle that followed nearly 2000 Canadian soldiers were killed to capture a small village. Farley Mowat was a young officer in one of the Canadian regiments, the Hastings Prince Edward Regiment &quot;Hastie-Pees.&quot; After a landing at Sicily and fighting their way up this far in Italy what to come at Ortona made all that came before pale in comparison.Mowat, a writer known for his wit shows that even during the dark, wet, winter months he was able to find things that give him joy in the charnel house of Ortona. He describes the pressure on an officer just before and attack goes in, the corssing of the Moro River, and, in one of the most amazing tales of battlefield desperation, describes his charge against a German tank with fixed bayonets.As the battle drew on streets in the town changed sides frequently with the focus of the battle being a particular house in a particular street. Ortona earned the name of &quot;little Stalingrad&quot; for those who faught there and Mowat describes the drama day by day as the battle winds on and the Germans are forced out leaving the legacy of 1600 Canadian corpses buried in the British Commonwealth Moro River Cemetary.It is a changing experience for Mowat and one wonders how he retained his wit and verve to produce the wonderful naturalist novels that he later became famous for.This is lyrical poetic auto-biography of an intelligent, well-educated young man coming to terms with the horrors of war. As such Mowat is very much like Robert Graves in &quot;Goodbye to all That&quot; --- smart enough to be troubled by the nature of war yet too young to come to terms with all that it entails. Perhaps that is why Mowat waited over 40 years before he wrote the book in the first place."},{"Title":"And No Birds Sang","review":"Undeniably the best war memoir written by a Canadian who served in the Second World War. The book chronicles Mowat's experiences in 1943 as a participant in the invasion of Sicily and Italy, and in classic Mowat style captures both the stark reality and lighter side of his experiences. Mowat also wrote a history of his unit--one of the first books he published, and which was later revised (and is somewhat difficult to find at the moment)--entitled The Regiment."},{"Title":"And No Birds Sang","review":"Thrilling book. I was &quot;Forced&quot; to read a book by Farley Mowat for my OAC Can. Lit. course, and I was quite impressed. In a world of pro-american war stories, books and movies, this is an excellent relief and view into the Canadian side of the war, on a front that we don't often read about or see in the media. The Italian front, and the battle for Rome.A groupd of Canadian troops, a platoon of Intelligence personell led by Mowat's character, land in Italy, expecting harsh, bloody battles, to find a walk through, the only troops they encounter is a platoon of British Commandoes. The Long, hot walk to Sicily is met with no resistance, and no food, water and new clothes. As our hero watches birds from an APC, they ride into a mild German Ambush.This book combines humour, when our hero and an associate ride on a motorbike through Italian antitank defences into an Italian base, to inspect &quot;resistance&quot;, the Italians provide trucks and a limo for the tired Canadians, as well as horrific battle scenes, whole platoons lost under artillery. The visual words and imagery make this as much a movie as a book, a definate read for vets, baby boomers and rebelious teens alike."},{"Title":"And No Birds Sang","review":"This book, written about the author's personal war experiences as an infantryman fighting in Sicily and the mountains of Italy, exposed the brutalities of war and also the kinship of the common foot soldier. Mowat's usual humor is present but the savagery of the battles in combination with the cold, rainy weather of the Appenine mountains in winter, threaten to break both his spirit and his sanity. I highly recommend this book for anyone who is interested in the hardships that an infantryman experiences in combat and also anyone with an interest in the Italian campaign of World War II. I was completely engrossed in this book and was sad to see it end."},{"Title":"And No Birds Sang","review":"Farley Mowat has entertained many readers like me for many years with lots of books. His story of his life as a soldier during WW 2 comes as no surprise. Now it is fashionable in America to talk of post traumatic stress disorder but the same conditions have existed on every battlefield from the beginning of time. Mowat vividly brings them to life as many writers of wartime do. This is an intensly personal and moving story and should be required reading for every 17 year old itching to go into the army. The title is especially evocative since Mowat is a naturalist and everywhere he goes, he looks for local birds. In spite of being in an exotic place, he would collect no new species there"},{"Title":"And No Birds Sang","review":"We should all know what these men went through in order to give us the freedom we take so much for granted today. World War II was a terrible time in the world's history, and the vast majority of people don't realize how close we came to being defeated.

Instead, we would have all been either killed or made into slaves!"},{"Title":"And No Birds Sang","review":"Outstanding and emotionally wrenching memoir of the Sicilian and early part of the Italian campaigns. The book start off with hijinks and comedy, but progressively descends into despair and terror. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"And No Birds Sang","review":"I bought this book almost in a state of doubt. I had seen the name Farley Mowat and automatically assumed it was a good piece of writing as is most if not all of his other pieces of work. He is perhaps one if not the best Canadian writer ever to pick up a pen and paper. And after reading this book, i quickly realized why.I had been searching for a book that could possibly inform and educate me on a Canadian's standpoint of the second world war. I quickly realized that I had picked out a good book. It puts you in the mind of a young man reaching adulthood and as had every other young man at the time, had his mind set in joining his fellow Canadians and Allies in the battle. This mindframe had been to be fairly excited and actually happy to go to the frontlines. As it had obviously not been programmed to the unfortunate reality of the war itself. Farley Mowat tells a great and wonderful story of his life before and during the timeline of the Canadian military's part in the war itself. Whether it was the obvious anxiety of waiting to be shipped overseas to the frontlines, or the brutal and graphic reality of the battle itself, Mowat unveils a true and dramtically emotional story of World War II.Myself I was seaching for a book such as this one. It retold the historically correct graphic and terrifying nature of war, more specifically that of the Second World War. I know that one such as myself will never know and hopefully never experience the reality of war but, I can honestly say that I have infinite gratitude and thanks for those who fought for our freedom. All in all, a WONDERFUL book and I highly recommend it to any Farley Mowat fans or anyone who likes great historical literature. I just cannot seem to express how great of a book this really was. Hope you like it too!"},{"Title":"And No Birds Sang","review":"This book is an excellent personal account of WW2. Any Canadian that has friends or family that were a part of WW2 will find this book quite powerful. This is a perfect book for conveying to young people the sacrifice that Canadian soldiers made in WW2."},{"Title":"And No Birds Sang","review":"I've read uncountable number of war books as war has always fascinated me. This was one of the best in that it gives a very real sense of the terror and panic that one must feel in combat. I was disappointed only because the book did not continue through to the end of his wartime service, hence the four stars."},{"Title":"And No Birds Sang","review":"Having expected another of his nature or people stories (which I like), I was so pleased at this offering of his time in Italy and Sicily and impact of way; having spent time in Iraq, I appreciated his experiences and the read was so good. Well done and thank you."},{"Title":"And No Birds Sang","review":"It took Farley Mowat 35 years to get up the nerve to write this book. He takes us back to his youth and then slowly intoduces us to the horrors of war. Most war veterans are unable to express any of it. They suffer from PTSD and suffer quietly. Farley speaks out....shows his unabashed heroism and also the worm of fear. Every human being needs to read this book. Maybe it would help to eliminate war."},{"Title":"And No Birds Sang","review":"I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to know more about Canadian troops in WWII. I have found very little written about their part in the war and here Farley Mowat tells us his personal story. This book should be read along with his book The Regiment which gives details of the Italian campaign. It is a sobering account."},{"Title":"And No Birds Sang","review":"Farley Mowat's book about the war in Italy is certainly one of the most moving accounts I have read. Mowat became a professional writer after leaving the army, completing many books about nature and history, so this memoir is constructed with a flair that is absent in many stories about the war. The introspective and often hilarious wit that sets the tone for the book gives it an originality that is all its' own, making it quite powerful.Mowat was part of the Hasting's and Prince Edward regiment of the 1st Canadian Infantry division, joining after his graduation from high school in 1940. Mowat was often the butt of many jokes due to his juvenile appearance while holding the rank of 2nd Lt. His superiors knew he was not yet mature enough in body and mind to take command of a combat unit, so he did not ship out to England until 1942. There are some hilarious anecdotes from his time in England, among them, the loss of his virginity in \\"the least romantic seduction of modern times\\" to a land army girl in London. Mowat's sense of humor seems to branch out into all aspects of his military life, as his wit at times comes across as wry and slightly subversive to his superior officers. He gains the reputation as somewhat of a smart-ass, but certainly has a serious introspective nature, that is witnessed as he explores the English countryside in search of various bird species. As 1943 dawns, the division engages in intensive training, conducting many amphibious landings on the icy beaches of Scotland. Many speculate they are headed for an attack upon Norway, but as they would find out in July, the division would join up with Montgomery's British 8th Army for an attack upon the island of Sicily. By this time, Mowat is the commander of 7th platoon in Able company of the Hasty P's, which has the reputation of being somewhat of a disciplinary outfit. The author still shows some youthful irreverence in his behavior, as he and a friend take a mine detector through the mess of hall of his transport the night before the invasion, zapping an officer's behind with it, asking him if he consumed anything explosive.The playfulness that defines much of Mowat's memory begins to fade as the division lands on the beaches near Syracuse on the morning of July 10th. Things are quite mixed up on the landing beaches, but the Italian units guarding the coast chose to surrender or retreat, leaving the Canadians to regroup and push inland. Mowat begins to mature rapidly as he sees his first combat in the villages of Grammichele, Valguanerra, and Mt. Assoro. He is quite descriptive of the fierce battles in the arid, rocky hills of Sicily, as the division is quite successful in their attacks up the German Panzer divisions along the Etna line south of Messina. The division is relieved after a month in the hot, dangerous hills of Sicily, and Mowat is transferred to battalion Intelligence, prior to the invasion of Italy on September 3rd. The author handles the surrender of Italians, works with partisans, and avoids German demolitions as the 8th Army works its' way towards Rome. As October ends, the advance grinds to a halt in the face of torrential rains and Germans fortified in the hills. AS the division engages in some of the bloodiest and futile assaults on the Italian mainland, the writing becomes quite poetic and visceral, as the author develops an ominous sense of dread. These are some of the most painfully beautiful passages (he shares a drink with a dying German), as Mowat captures the sheer terror that grips the front line soldier, which he calls \\"The Worm.\\" The book ends rather abruptly. Events seem to have shattered Mowat's sense of youthful innocence, creating a powerful and melancholic end to his war on the front lines. One of the first WWII memoirs (1980) to speak frankly of war's cruelty and bitterness."},{"Title":"And No Birds Sang","review":"I laughed through much of the first half of this book. The writing style is similar to that of the World War II classic \\"Brazen Chariots,\\" by Robert Crisp. Mowat and Crisp find ways to laugh in even dire circumstances.For instance, Mowat describes his first combat. Because he has no experience and it seems fitting at the time, he orders a bayonet charge. Afterward, commandos who had watched them say it was the only bayonet charge they had ever seen and that it reminded them of a war movie.General Montgomery's visit to the troops is humorous. Monty expertly handles a disrespectful comment from an anonymous soldier in a crowd.The book is no comedy, though. Mowat's humorous touch begins to fade somewhere in the second half of the book. For instance, he describes how a German sniper intentionally wounds a mule, which enrages Mowat and his men. Mowat hates the Germans at that moment. One of the most poignant scenes is where Mowat becomes drunk with a wounded German on a battlefield.Mowat has many close calls. One time he is shot in the back, but a can of meat in his backpack stops the bullet.This is an excellent, well-written book. However, I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because the ending is incomplete."},{"Title":"And No Birds Sang","review":"\\"An No Bird Sang is FARLEY MOWAT'S ACCOUNT OF COMING OF AGE DURING WW II.Eager and idealistic, Mowat volunteered for service in Canada.He was comissioned and as a young officer participated in the brutal Italian campaign.What he saw awakened in him an awareness, never forgotten, of man's potential for heroism, also of his black side and unlimited.....\\"[from the back cover of the audio cassette case]"},{"Title":"And No Birds Sang","review":"This is a great book.

Even more impressive is the fact he is still prolific and as sharp as ever. I thought I'd re-visit this book before starting one of his new ones. I enjoyed it as much as the first read, for so often I find things I missed. He has a journalistic style when he writes that isn't dried-out like some of the non-fiction I read. Farley has the talent to write about real events while retaining the entertainment flavor fiction readers love. I believe this is why so many readers who like a variety of genres say they turn to Mowat when they need to appease their appetites for great nonfiction story-telling. I highly recommend Farley Mowat's books.Chrissy K. McVay - author"},{"Title":"And No Birds Sang","review":"I remember reading this book way back in Grade 12. Its not so way back considering that it was probably two or three years ago. This book ranks among the best war books I have ever read. In some places, I laughed so hard I nearly dropped a lung.

However, I came away from it thinking it wasn't as good as \\"The Forgotten Soldier\\". The last chapter about the battle over the Moro river was just as good. However, the depth of the first three chapters I felt was diminished by the author's sense of humor and his tendency to exaggerate. For example, the dying of the inscrutable A K Long - taking out his pipe for a smoke and a book to read when he was so seriously wounded, calm in the midst of terror - struck me as unrealistic. In sum, this was a good book but I would say, not really memorable."},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"I have read many accounts of the Mafia way of life from different people over the years. I lived on the same block as many of them and knew their ways. It is amazing to me that Joe Pistone got as close to them as he did and that they didn't recognize the fact that he was so much more intelligent than they were and there was something wrong with this picture. The story is an amazing one (nothing like the movie at all). I didn't like the movie but decided to read the book anyway which I am extremely glad I did. It was an exciting account of the daily grind which is spent thinking of how to get, make or steal money (where most of it goes to the bosses anyway). Pistone wrote in such a way that made you think that he had accomplished so much and that he was incredibly brave (maybe he was,but I think he was incredibly stupid also). Why take your life in your hands everyday just to get more information for the &quot;goodguys&quot;? Now he has to live on the run. Was it really worth it (even since he has probably made a fortune off the book and movie). I don't think so."},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"Agent Pistone not only infiltrated the Mafia, but brought humiliation to The Bonnano Crime Family.This was definately a huge BLOW to the whole New York Crime Commission, not knowingly that Donnie Brasco was not real. He was a wiseguy with a badge and his mighty shield of justice, embossed in his heart.Agent Joseph D. Pistone acted all alone, to penetrate into a life in the mob, without being caught, and managed for years to keep his multiple masks on, playing a good father, a loving husband, a loyal federal agent, and of course, a goodfella.I like this book, better than the movie. The book brought out more pointers and more information about Agent Pistone personal life and an overdose of The Bonnano family, their associates, and there way of life, in the dark side.This is a MUST read. It is totally a thrilled ride from the beginning to the end."},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"Agent Pistone is a hero. His willingness to go deep undercover for years to clean house on organized crime is amazing. I wouldn't have done it and salute his willingness to put this mission ahead of his own life.Joe Pistone got and grew a unique assignment for the FBI. Starting with car theft rings, he was able to penetrate and become a made member of an organized crime family. As his association and the opportunity for deeper penetration grew, he had to live more and more of his life with the mob. This entailed no dinners at home, missed children's birthdays, weeks without seeing his family and the stress of always being in character for long, long periods of time.Through this book, the reader gets a day-to-day view of the mob. Often bored as only guys with too much time on their hands and nothing to talk about except cars and girls can be, his existence is enlivened by the sudden forays to steal and kill (he was able to avoid involvement in any murders, helped save many and avoided direct involvement in theft). Playing on the greed of Mafioso and the seeming ability of Donnie to connect them with money making scams in Florida, the mob lets Donnie in and eventually become an insider. Along the way, the reader gets to see mob guys at work, at play (particularly eating and spending money until they were broke), scheming against other made family members, and living the life with all the swagger and pride having \\"made\\" the mob gives these hoods.Pistone was incredibly successful. His wires and testimony lead to the arrest, conviction and deaths (through mob killing of some of those who had vouched him up the organization) of many mobsters. This is a fascinating story."},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"Many books have been written about and by law-enforcement officers who have gone undercover as bad guys, but DONNIE BRASCO deservedly sits at the top of the heap. The story is so engrossing, you might have to stop and remind yourself that it isn't fiction. Special Agent Pistone gives the reader great insight into the psychology of undercover work and the dangers--physical and emotional--a person in his position must endure. The movie version was entertaining, but this is the real thing."},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"THIS BOOK WAS AWESOME, AND GETS IN DEPTH WITH EVERYTHING THAT WENT ON UNDERCOVER, THERE IS A CONTINUATION BOOK THAT CAME OUT IN 2007 CALLED DONNIE BRASCO UNFINISHED BUSINESS AND SOME SAY TO JUST BUY THAT BOOK AND IT EXPLAINS WHAT IS IN BOTH BOOKS BUT I STRONGLY DISAGREE. YOU SHOULD READ THIS BOOK FIRST AND IN THE BACK OF YOUR MIND REMIND YOURSELF THAT SOME OF THE ANSWERS THAT WERE NOT IN THIS BOOK ARE GOING TO BE IN THE 2ND BOOK DUE TO WHEN THIS BOOK CAME OUT IN THE 1980S JOE PISTONE WAS STILL GOING TO COURT AND MANY THINGS HE COULD NOT PUT INTO PUBLISHING.I AM TELLING THEW TRUTH WHEN I SAY THAT I COULD NOT PUT THIS BOOK DOWN . IF YOU LIKED THE MOVIE THIS BOOK IS 10 TIMES BETTER. I ALSO JUST ORDERED THE JOE MASSINO BOOK AND AFTER YOU READ THIS BOOK YOU WILL KNOW WHY. BUT I WILL END IT HERE, I RED OVER 40 MAFIA BOOKS AND THIS WAS TOP 3. THANKS"},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"I'm sure most people who pick up this book now have seen the movie. Maybe seeing the movie poster cover enticed you to pick it up. But don't be fooled, the book is very different from the movie. What I noticed right away is that the movie takes all the bullet points of the book involving various mafia members and gives them all to Pacino's Lefty character. Though Left is a big part of the book, Pistone interacts with a huge number of mafia characters and the movie basically takes most of the interesting tales and gives them to Lefty. The book goes into a great more detail and expands Pistone's exploits that involved not only the 5 families of New York, but the families in Tampa, Milwaukee, Chicago and Philadelphia. It also covers some major events with his family that also was not in the movie. If you are a fan of the movie, this book will be a perfect supplement. The writing is solid and it didn't feel like a single word was wasted. Excellent book."},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"Gripping story of Joe Pistone posing undercover as Donnie Brasco for 6 years (!) to infiltrate the mob. As I read the story, I couldn't help but keep thinking how brave and street-smart this guy is. One slip and he's a dead man! Pistone thoroughly covered all his bases to maintain his fake identity. In the end, after the FBI agents announced to his mob ties that Donnie was actually an undercover agent all this time, they doubted it could be possible, and told the agents their was no way Donnnie was working undercover. That's how good this guy was!"},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"This book is valuable because it does not glorify those who engage in organized crime. Unlike the Godfather series and, to lesser extent, The Sopranos, Donnie Brasco paints these people for what they really are: criminals, hoods, bums, evil people. And, for the most part, dumber than a red brick.A great story, enjoyable tale, terrific reading. Just don't go out and whack anybody afterward!"},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"This superb mob narrative is gripping, readable...and true. Narrator and former FBI Agent Joseph Pistone describes going undercover as jewel thief \\"Donnie Brasco\\" in 1976. \\"Brasco\\" soon infiltrated the syndicate, and ended up spending five years as a connected member of New York's Bonnano crime family. Brasco assisted in dozens of minor crimes (theft, handling stolen merchandise) to maintain his bad-guy credibility, all the while acting surreptitiously to prevent major crimes from occurring. Readers see how his mafia crew engaged in crimes ranging from theft and burglary, to truck hijackings, robbery, witness intimidation and murder. Brasco also details his emotions, which included fear, loneliness, even guilt over having to deceive mob partners like Lefty \\"Guns\\" Ruggerio and \\"Sonny Black\\" (who was later murdered). Imagine working undercover knowing that some crook you'd arrested years ago in another state might suddenly appear and recognize you - in which case your mafia \\"friends\\" will kill you within minutes. Imagine having to keep your wife and daughters in the dark about your work, knowing that you'll all need to be relocated with new identities once the operation ends.\\"Operation Don Brasco,\\" led to scores of arrests and convictions, not to mention a $500,000 contract being placed on Pistone's head. This is one of the best mob narratives available, one made into a pretty good (if somewhat fictionalized) movie starring Johnny Depp and Al Pacino."},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"First off I loved the movie and have seen it numerous times. It ranks with one of my al time favorites. So naturally I figured I had to read the book to see how much was different. Well I was kind of shocked because the movie and the book are very far apart. The movie has all of the real figures in it that Donnie encountered but many of the stories are scewed to fit in Hollywood. Some events didn't even happen or they happened in a different context. but this didn't hurt my opnion any in fact it made me like the book more because it was fresh. The writing is good, a bit winded, but solid and Agent Pistone recounts numerous great tales of crime and danger. What is important about the book is that it shows that Agent Pistone was in no way in conflict with himself about where he and the mob stood as the film portrayed. Pistone worked hard with the FBI and his fellow undercover agents and it is important to know that if you really want the true facts to the whole story."},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"If you know Donnie Brasco only by the movie, that's really a shame. I'm not saying the movie is bad, but it come nowhere close to the suspense and masterful storytelling of this legendary FBI agent as this book. I am one of the people who saw the movie first, and like most I thought it was a really interesting story. Then my dad (who is a Mafia fanatic) said that I should read the book. MY GOD way he right. Not only do you learn more about Special Agent Pistone (Donnie) in his time with the mob and how it affected his family, you learn the reality of the life a mobster chooses to live. My biggest shock was the differences between the movie and books. For instance, in the films ending, Agent Pistone is awarded a medal and a check for a few hundred dollars by his superior who seems completely uniterested with what just happened to this man. In reality, Pistone was visited by the Director of the FBI and not only given a medal but received it in front of a crowded hall with a standing ovation and is remembered by Pistone as one of the happiest moments in his life. I understand a movie will take a few liberties with the truth, but after reading the book, it was a shock. People die in the movie who are in real life alive today. Even the real Pistone said that one of the things he didn't like in the movie was when Johnny Depp says he feels he is becoming like the mobsters he is supposed to bring to justice. In the book he states multiple times that he knew what his job was and never thought once that he shouldn't put these mobsters in prison. If you want to know the REAL story of this Legend of the Law, BUY THIS BOOK. I would buy hardcover since it comes with more photos than the paperback and doesn't have the movie poster cover. This is an easy 10/10"},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"I read this book when it first came out way before the movie and was mesmerized. I just read it again. There is not one wasted page in this book. It is far far more in depth than the movie. While the movie was good (michael madsen though miscast as sonny), the book is better and explains far more characters that were combined for the movie. There are some parts of this book that had me in fear as if I was there. It sits high on my list as one of the best non fiction books I ever read."},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"The story of Joseph Pistone is an un-matched undercover story of the mafia. Pistone goes by the name \\"Donnie Brasco\\" and infiltrates one of the most notorious mafia families in the 70's. The book begins to drag on and reads like an FBI report rather than a novel. The movie also had it's \\"Hollywood\\" version that I like to believe is the real story. Or maybe. Pistone could not admit that he helped dispose of a body. The movie version was better, maybe because Pacino and Depp are the main actors. The book is still entertaining if you enjoyed the movie."},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"I loved this book. I've never seen the movie but this book is great if you enjoy Mafia stories. I recommend it."},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"Received my order within the time the seller stated I would, the item was in great condition could not be happier"},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"This was an amazing book. It provided a great look into the life of one of the greatest FBI agents to ever live. I would highly recommend it for anyone who is interested in the field of federal law enforcement or if they just want to enjoy a suspense-filled book."},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"This is a highly riveting account of the only FBI agent in history, Joe Pistone, ever to be proposed for membership in the mob. For six years Pistone worked and lived with made guys - hardcore mobsters who do not tolerate mistakes, idiots or rats (informers). This hard-hitting, real-world account takes you deep inside the thoughts, lives and actions of these individuals. Some have reported that the language and descriptions within this book are too much. This ain't Disneyland, ya know. Pistone's writing style places you in the middle of the fire from the very first page and holds you there until the end. For his end, Pistone possesses nads of solid boron, one of the hardest metals known to mankind. Second by second, for six long years, Pistone was in effect a mobster. He stayed alive by his magnificent acting ability, fortitude and unadulterated guts. In spite of the hardships for himself and his family, who he rarely saw during this time, he stuck it out to the very end when the FBI had to end the operation because Pistone was scheduled to make a hit. The mob was caught off guard and there was indeed hell to pay. My only complaint about this book is that it was not long enough. I could have read on for days."},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"This was a great read. It gave me a good understanding of the mafia and how it works.I have seen the movie and after that I had to read the book. The pressures of an undercover agent really comes through. I must of read at least half way through before I noticed how much time had gone by.Donnie Brasco is a must read. Once you get started good luck trying to put this book down."},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"I am not really a reader but Donnie Brasco is a book that really caught my eyes from the first page. I was stuck to it like glue. 3 hours had gone by and I did not notice it because it was so in interesting, but one fault that it has is that it takes too long to get to the point and to the action. Being that it is based on a true story in the 70's is has a realistic view.The most interesting part to me in the beginning was the way he had to change his life from a standard F.B.I agent to Mafia man. He has to find a new place to live and take time off from his family. Also the way he has to set his mood and become someone else. He is no longer Joe Pistone (F.B.I agent) he is now Donnie Brasco (jewel thief) and he has to live of, and become, a Mafia man."},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I wanted to read this book because of the series Falcone on TV which was based on this book. It was loosely based upon it and the story of the mafia was quite interesting. The only part that I could have done without is all the obscence words. I think Agent Pistone is a modern day hero. The other part of the book I found interesting is that the area in Florida Pistone speaks of I know them. I am going to read Joe Pistone newest book he has written because of this one."},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"I had seen Donnie Brasco the movie several years ago, and I did not enjoy it at all. It depicted the bureau as an agency which does not care about it's own. This however is very untrue, and former Special Agent Joseph D. Pistone describes how much the FBI cares for it's own in Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia, very well. Pistone not only describes the bureau accurately, but goes on to describe the Italian Mafia just as well. This is a great book to read, and you won't regret reading it. If you have read this book and have enjoyed it, pick up Mobbed Up, by Pistone as well. This book IS Fictional, but it is a fun book to read.Another great book to have, that I have in the office myself, is the FBI: A comprehensive Reference Guide, by Theoharis, Poveda, Rosenfield, and Powers."},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"The Sopranos made mob life seem interesting and occasionally warm and fuzzy. This book spells out the reality. Pistone's extraordinary work in penetrating the mafia undercover (at great personal cost) shows mobsters at their predatory worst. Their lives are revealed as an obsessive prowl for the next score and/or victim. Pistone emphasizes the intellectual and moral poverty of their lives and the tedium of much of their days. Most current readers will come to the book after seeing the Johnny Depp movie. The film selects and condenses events and vividly portrays character. The first-person book fills in the spaces to give a complete picture. [The Kindle edition is well-edited.]"},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"I loved the movie enough to get the book. The book is great..so detailed. It don't think I would have enjoyed the movie if I had read the book first. It really is a great book full of Joe Pistone's every move. There is 10 times more in this book than in the movie...I highly recomment it to people who enjoyed the movie Donnie Brasco...highly"},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"Great book. Real life stuff and best of all, it was made into a movie. Very easy to read. Fast reader."},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"The movie is OK on it's own, but READ THE BOOK! It's so well written. It carries the narrative expertly while including tons of anecdotes that give a real insight into life inside one of the five families in NYC. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"If you like True Crime and the mystery/danger of undercover agents this is a must read!!! Get it, you will not be able to put it down!!"},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"This is perhaps one of the best insider accounts I've read of the mafia. Donnie Brasco is the real deal, a book that not only shows the life of a wiseguy but also of the life of an undercover FBI agent.Watching Pistone become Donnie was very insightful. Pistone took the time to explain the logic behind how he acted and the way he thought. Showing why you didn't question too much, or why you say something in a specific way shows a lot of how Pistone became Brasco. I enjoyed reading Pistone's thought process just as much the meat of his undercover operation.The wiseguys themselves are comically ignorant and uneducated, which adds to the flavor of the books. Seeing Sonny say he doesn't want to \\"catch no herpals\\", or Lefty not wanting to touch a newspaper because an \\"Indian\\" touched it and it had germs now. Comical, yet insightful on the lives of the feared gangsters of the mafia.I enjoyed reading Donnie Brasco a lot and would certainly recommend this book to anyone. If only to read how they were infiltrated and how Pistone became a wiseguy, but also because of the tremendous amount of convictions that came of his undercover work.5 stars."},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"This book made me understand what it must be like to be in the Mafia. Not the glamorous / action movies stuff, but how shallow, ruthless and as the author notes \\"mind-numbingly\\" boring it must be. To Quote; \\"all they talk about is 'what are we going to steal today, and how are we going to steal it'\\". The courage and self-sacrifice (regarding being away from his wife and child) of Agent Pistone was thrilling to me. This book is worth reading if only to compare it to the Paccino / Depp movie of the same name. Buy it for cheap, it is a rich-read."},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"I don't know which I liked better,\\"Making Jack Falcone\\" by Jack Garcia or Joseph Pistone's, \\"Donnie Brasco\\". They are both great stories,(Undercover FBI Agents infiltrate the Mafia and are proposed for membership) The only difference is that FBI Agent Garcia worked 5 other Undercover investigations at the same time that he was infiltrating the Gambinos. A truly amazing feat. Both Agent Pistone and Agent Garcia are true heroes and Patriots in the war against organize crime. I strongly recommend reading both books."},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"Absolutely incredible. This is the only way to describe what Special Agent Pistone was able to acomplish."},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"This book is full of suspense, which is heightened by the fact that it is real. Agent Pistone must have had a photographic memory to recount every word of the conversations that he overheard and took part in. He rarely wore a wire or tape recorder due to the great risk of being caught, so I really wonder how he could remember everything so vividly. It doesn't have much action, but, of course, you must remember that it is real, and in real life gun-battles and explosions aren't taking place every couple of minutes. The movie is pretty good, but it includes many things that did not really happen, and has a bit more action and suspense and such so that it is more interesting to the common viewer. Still, I would recommend that everyone check out both of them."},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"Donnie Brasco is my favorite movie.This book, however, is much more in-depth on the story. Pistone went deeper into the mob than any undercover ever has. Only a hit kept him from being a &quot;made&quot; man. Real stuff relating to his family(wife and kids) was good. But the story of Brasco and the mob was well put together and really interesting. Lefty, Sonny Black, and his other new friends had no idea who he was. If you liked the movie you'll love this because it's got more details."},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"Donnie Brasco is a fine book because Joe Pistone conveys what it's like to be the pioneer of something extremely dangerous and unknown in isolation. What is amazing is comparing the modern day FBI survellence techniques, with their tremendous technical and personnel support, and the stripped down solo flight of Joe Pistone. It would be like being an astronaut on the moon during the 1960's with a lunar module that was powered with a computer like your PC and the Space shuttle today. The book is accurate about how Joe Pistone never lost his personality and character even though he had to act like a mobster. In truth, Joe Pistone loved his family and was especially kind to endangered teenagers."},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"This book is fascinating in that Mr. Pistone portrays his real-life experience in the mofia as undercover FBI agent &quot;Donnie Brasco.&quot; It is incredible how he for 6 years had to juggle his real life with his undercover role, and how the cohesiveness of his family endured the requirements of this job. To read about how many times he escaped exposure and certain death is unbelievable. In his undercover role, he seems to say all the right things at the right times, and with impeccable timing and incredulous luck, he manages to survive. Now, Mr. Pistone and his family must live undercover forever as a result of this experience. Most of us could never imagine what it takes to do the job he did, and this book helped me to realize what a outstanding individual Joe Pistone really is. He is the true life James Bond, and this book is a must read."},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"Pistone's account of the time he spent infiltrating the Bonnano family was truly spellbinding. It was a good read, and differed substantially from the recent film. Although not quite as entertaining as books such as Wiseguy, it was nonetheless well worth reading."},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"Agent Pistone's six-year ordeal as an undercover agent in the Mafia is easily one of the most fascinating books I've read on the Mafia (since Pileggi's &quot;Wiseguy,&quot; I'd say) and Agent Pistone is truly an American hero. It was even sort of heartbreaking, at the end, when he talks of the what-if reunion between him and his mob companion. A fine book."},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Agent Pistone's story, from his gradual entrance into the mafia to his final departure, is layed out in captivating detail. I especially enjoyed his honesty about the close relationships he built in the mafia and how hard it was to maintain his cover. This man deserves the utmost respect for his life threatening undercover duties. He is a true American hero. I would reccomend this book to anyone who enjoys reading about the mafia, or the FBI."},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"Joe D. Pistone an FBI agent by the code name Donnie Brasco goes deep down in the mafia's inner circle. This is one of the best mafia books's written. Brasco goes so deep in the Bonnano family with his partner in crime Lefty Guns and how Brasco contributed to bringing down mafia members not only in New York but in Florida and Chicago as well. He also tells how his real family dealt with this. Know Bonnano living in hiding with his wife and childern under different names and a 500,000 dollar contract on his life."},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"A totally absorbing book about the day-to-day workings of the Mob. Also interesting information about the FBI and how undercover operations work."},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"For the first time, this book describes how a person can get into the mob that was not born into it. It also shows how they really operate instead of this glorified view of the mob like in the Godfather. I would recommend this book to those who are intersted in the day to day operations of the mob soldiers and capos"},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"I'd put money that you've already seen the movie. What you wanna know is if the book is any good/better/different, right? I'd say different. For example in the book \\"Donnie\\" is much older, perhaps over forty - his kids are in high school, whereas as I recall Jonny Depp's Donnie was late twenties/early thirties perhaps, with pre-school-ish kids....Maybe that's not a big deal. A bigger difference is much of the tension in the book comes from one of Donnie's early connections and sparring partners, Tony, who feuds with Lefty over \\"control\\" of Donnie - this is a very important strand in Donnie's rise in the Mafia, and as I recall wasn't in the movie at all. Bottom line is there is far more in the book than the bare bones story told in the film, and it's a well told tale. Forgettaboutit, just buy it...."},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"Before you run out and spend $3 bucks to rent the movie from Blockbuster or Hollywood Video, read this book. It starts off simple enough: an agent sent to infiltrate the Mafia in NY/NJ area in the late 70s. But \\"Donnie Brasco\\" is a much more complex novel than some man faking his identity. Joseph Pistone (Donnie Brasco) was forced to use his street wits, common sense, and just plain luck against ruthless killers, thieves, crooks, addicts, and other general degenerates. Pistone was forced to abandon his family (wife and children) for months on end, and be on assignment for the FBI. He made friendships and forged alliances, posing as jewel thief Donnie Brasco in order to ingratiate himself into the inner workings of the Mafia. Brasco became so close to many members of Bonnano families and their wiseguys, that when it came out that Brasco was an FBI agent posing as a wiseguy, many were in disbelief. One Bonnano affiliate in particular, Sonny Black, was fond of Brasco and thought of him as a son. He allegedly said that he had no ill feelings toward Brasco, because he was just doing his job. (Months later, Sonny Black was found murdered in a trunk. His hands had been cut off--a symbol that Mob security had been violated.) Pistone takes the time to explain in such a way without sounding boring or grating. He explains the slang, the situation, the characters as if you were there standing over his shoulder. This has to be one of the best Mafia books out there. Don't sleep on this one."},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"&quot;Donnie Brasco&quot; the movie, while compelling, contains numerous glaring inacuracies that will jump out at you while reading the book. Two of the most galling are that Pistone (Donnie) cared what happened to Lefty (Al Pacino's character), when in fact Pistone never lost sight of the fact that Lefty was a bad guy. Also, the movie makes it seem as though Pistone's superiors interfered with his operation and did not appreciate him. The book clearly dispells this distortion. Pistone's account of life in the mafia compares with Nicholas Pillegi's &quot;Wiseguy&quot; as compelling reading. And it will dispell any remaining notions that mob life is glamorous. Lefty's memorable movie scene in which he prepares to meet his death is at least one moment in which the movie keeps to the spirit of this great book."},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"The book was based on the true life events of agent Joseph D. Pistone, and is nothing short of perfection. It tells the story of the real mafia life, which is not often portrayed on paper. Agent Pistone's book takes the reader into the life of the capo's and the soldiers of the Bonanno family. Its is a very interesting book, and also a great fim starring Al Pacino and Michael Madsen. I work in a bookstore, and have read numerous mafia books, and this is one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"Yeah, I say that this book was better than the movie only because you learned a lot more details and Joseph D. Pistone tells the EXACT story. The movie starring Johnny Depp and Al Pacino was great but since reading the book you learned that it was twisted around a little. (Im not taking anything away from the movie because I loved it)Joseph D. Pistone went undercover for 6 years in the Mafia, and penetrated deeper than anyone has ever gone as an FBI agent. He is one of the main reasons for the Mafia's decline in todays world and this book does an excellent job of telling about the things that he came across while undercover.I highly recommend this book to anyone who watched the movie and enjoyed it, to anyone who is a Mafia fan, or to anyone who likes a good non-fiction book. Pick up this book, never a dull moment and filled with tons of interesting things."},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"Joe Pistone is a real American Hero. The former F.B.I agent spent six Years deep undercover as Donnie Brasco, a jewel thief, and infiltrated the Mafia, penetrating it's upper eschalon and bringing their power structure crashing down around their heads, resulting in over 100 convictions...Pistone, along with Richard Woodley, does a great job of bringing real-life Wiseguys like \\"Lefty Guns\\", \\"Sonny Black\\", and Tony Mirra to life on the printed page, and even though I know Pisone survived his ordeal (He obviously did- He wrote the book!), I was still constantly worried about him. Any fan of true-crime will love Donnie Brasco!"},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"Joseph Pistone is a true American hero in a society that worships the likes of John Gotti. As risky as it is to be a member of Cosa Nostra, Pistone illustrates how much riskier it was to be an FBI agent under deep cover in the mafia. I saw the movie first and immediately got the book. The movie takes a lot of liberties and stretches the truth...surprise, surprise. Hollywood not sticking to the real story? I'm shocked! This book is a milestone and in my top 10, right up there with Catch-22, Johnnie Got His Gun, and All Quiet on the Western Front. Pistone's courage remains unparalleled. The tragedy is that this amazing man now has to live the rest of his life under an assumed name. Hey, maybe Hollywood will come up with a new one where Joe Pistone and Sammy Gravano hook up, become pals and fight martians or something. You just gotta love Hollywood, huh?"},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"If you had half a clue, you would be twice as dangerous as you already are. You say the Bonnano's should have had him whacked. If they had half a clue, like in your case, he would have never made it as far as he did. Give it up, get a life, and get a clue. This book and movie are probably the best accounts of life in the mafia that money could buy. If you want to be glued to a book or television buy both."},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"Donnie Brasco must have ice water in his veins to pull off some- thing like this;he is a step away from becoming a &quot;made-man&quot;, but the only thing holding him back is his career, F.B.I. deepcover agent! He actually made certain members in the mob have bowel movements once they announced who he really is. What the movie fails to tell you is that although he and Lefty Two-Guns Ruggiero are friends, but after Carmine&quot;Lilo&quot;Galante gets whacked then they whack out Sonny Red Idelicato which puts the Bonanno crime family under Sonny Black Napalitano as the street boss while the real boss Philip Rastelli is in prison. He actually shares an apartment with this Sonny Black, that is how good this Pistone is I mean, he really started the Mafia decline, and the Bonanno's happened to be the first. Again, you learn more about each of the characters;Pacino's portrayal as Lefty, made me literally sick &amp; I don't know who happened to be the casting director of the film but if you read this book before you happened to see the movie, they should be fired, c'mon Pacino as a chump,washed up father of a junkie son, whose only respect he gets is from &quot;Don the Jewler&quot; . I know some people who rather see the movie first then read the book in order to get a more in depth, better understanding of the film, well in this case, you were probably more confused than at the begining! Again I say reading is much better than seeing a movie, in that order, this is my perfect example of my theory."},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"This book tells a great story of how the Mafia really lives. How they are a bunch of guys that don't deserve the respect the rest of the world gives them. How they live prosperously for only a couple weeks after they steal from the working class; how they are willing to kill at no cost even though they don't understand why. What got me the most about this book was the relationship between Sonny Black and Pistone. Pistone became close friends with Black (he thought Lefty as an ignorant man) and almost felt bad for him once he was killed. Sonny Black was a guy that wanted very little to do with the mob but knew he couldn't get out. The stories are great and it's very different from the movie."},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"this book documents the ordeal of the first FBI agent to go deep undercover to penetrate the Mafia, often at immediate risk of his life. He's a brave man doing brave things at the cost of family life, but not identity, as he always remained who he really was--demonstrating, incidently, that there are many more versions of ourselves in each of us than we may realize. Like any autobiography, Pistone's own character stands at the center of the narrative, and it's an interesting study: calculating, like a chess player; concerned for his dignity only within the parameters of the role he was playing; committed to his objective totally; able to make close moral distinctions; committed to family, but unwilling to compromise his assignment. Pistone isn't a Boy Scout, but he doesn't cross the line & become the monster that he's fighting. His work broke up several major crime families and, more importantly, broke the code of omerta forever, by forcing bad guys to break silence to save themselves. A textbook account of the risks, methods and rewards of undercoverwork, and the most direct account of how bad guys operate that we have. Like many agents of the law, he points out that most bad guys worked harder and made less than if they had gone straight. Well worth reading on a quiet day, if only because one realizes how much some have sacrificed so that we can have a quiet day."},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"I read this in about a five hour straight period...interesting.It's a lot better than the movie..movie puts too much false or half true stuff in it and doesn't potray the characters in it accruately. He starts out by working his way into the Colombo crime family and from there meets Bonnanno soldier Tony Mirra who would introduce him to lefty from there the story takes off. Donnie first tries to help another agent get into the vending machine market in Milwaukee..which was controlled by mob boss Frank Ballisteri..the other agent comes close to getting his car blown up..they thought he was a g..which he was .. but then is introduced by the Bonnano's to Balisteri...Donnie also gets offered a bookmaking job for balitsteri..ends up turning down..then the vending machine thing goes down the tubes. Then Donnie gets the Bonnano's to hook up with another agent in the King's court deal which becomes a success..All the while Carmine Galante gets whacked the power structure changes..eventually Tony Mirra comes back to lay a clain on King's court..lefty fight's against this..this and certain things lead to the hits put on 3 Bonnano captain's. Donnie's allies are victorous..Sonny Black, Lefty, and even current boss Joe Massino. Donnie gets contract on Sonny the reds son..then the FBI decides to take down the Kings Court deal. In the end Sonny Black and Tony Mirra get whacked. Lefty ends up in prison for 10 years(he died in 95 by the way)."},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"The story of Donnie Brasco is dramatic, courageous and at some points emotional. No one has ever done what he was able to do. He stayed in the Mafioso underworld for longer than any of his fellow agents, or \\"feds.\\"You might think you know the story simply by following the news or watching the movie (which was skewed significantly to Hollywood's liking,) but not until you read the behind-the-scenes book will you truly fathom his courage and heroism. You will read the many times his life was on the line, so much for his family being on the line.This is not a product of Hollywood imagination. This is the story of a real life con-man working on the good side yet posing as the bad guy. What a thriller. This book will also give you the inside, the structure and lifestyle of the mafia underworld. This is one of the most powerful books I came across. (A similar book that I would recommend is Serpico.)"},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"This is truly one of the most riveting books I have ever read. I have read &quot;The Godfather&quot; and &quot;The Last Don&quot; and found them to be excellent reading but they are strictly fiction and even make gangsters seem like legitimate businessmen. If you want the truth about the Mafia, read &quot;Donnie Brasco.&quot;I am certain that Joe Pistone never came close to fathoming how far he would infiltrate the Mafia when he began his undercover operation. It was as if he set out to climb a mountain just to get to the first summit, then realized he could get to the next and the next and so on. Before he knew it, he had won the confidence of those who considered him to be their peer and ultimately put most of them in the slammer. Had he remained undercover for another year he would have been the first FBI Agent in history to become a &quot;made&quot; member of the Mafia. Imagine what a psychological blow that would have been to the mob!What Pistone does is give a more in-depth view of the mindset involved with the Mafia. He gives an eyewitness description that shows individual members of the Mafia in their most graphic human forms from the volatile Tony Mirra to the loudmouth Lefty. He even showed a side of Sonny Black that nobody would have otherwise seen. Although I have very little sympathy for Black for &quot;getting whacked,&quot; Pistone did show that Black at least had a heart to contrast the notches on his gun.I also recommend that you not take the movie seriously. While the movie is interesting, I estimated it to be about 85 percent fiction. Pistone's description of his wife showed a very strong woman who would not have stayed with a man who hit her the way he was alleged to have done in the movie. Pistone was also never present when a hit went down, an associate named Nick did not get whacked, Santo Trafficante and Sonny Black were not present on the ABSCAM boat and there were numerous other liberties taken in the movie that left me very disappointed.It actually surprised me when a standard-length movie allegedly based on the book was made. &quot;Donnie Brasco&quot; was better suited to be a made-for-TV mini-series. The mini-series would have provided a better opportunity to reveal the truth. The movie version that we got instead must have left Pistone himself nauseated."},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"I read a lot of books, and while I enjoyed the mood and tone of this novel as well as its plot, I found myself frustrated on two counts.First, this true-life drama contains myriad characters all of whom have real names and nicknames or FBI names or undercover names... maybe a little glossary or something would have helped, as the sheer quantity of characters interfered with my ability to understand and therefore enjoy the story.Also, and this is a &quot;personal beef,&quot; I wish that Mr. Pistone would have added a little more about the responses and reactions of his family to his career obligations than he did -- although I do understand that he omitted more information about them because of safety issues and because the story really isn't about them. In fact, this guy allows practically NO personal responses whatsoever in his narrative... he hardly ever acknowledges to feeling fear, dispair, or frustration... only... anger.Other than those take-them or leave-them flaws, the story is utterly fascinating. It really is. Not since Wiseguy have I enjoyed a true-life mafia book this much."},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"Read this right after Wiseguy (N. Pileggi), and both books complement each other.Donnie Brasco is richer in detail, and seems more truthful - you never know when Henry Hill, in Wiseguy, is being completely faithful to facts.I had seen the movie a couple of times (definitely one of the best mob flicks ever), and it turns out that a lot was twisted or just simply made up in the screenplay. In my opinion, that made the book even more interesting, thanks to the surprise effect.A great read, thoroughly entertaining and informative, even for not so die-hard fans of Mafia movie and books."},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"I knew nothing about Donnie Brasco story before tee reading.

She must have been a real Christian woman, cause I just don't think I would have stuck by him through it. He was clearly obsessed with his job, and honestly, I think he enjoyed living like that. I truly believe he liked the excitement and the danger of the whole thing.

I love non-fiction, and this is a great true story of an FBI agent who successfully infiltrated the Mob for 6 years in the late 1970s to early 1980s. Joseph Pistone aka Donnie Brasco, took his time, and slowly but surely, got to know characters in organized crime and moved up in the hierarchy. He had some close calls along the way, and it amazes me that he never got whacked (mob term). Pistone even took the mobsters on a nice boat ride on a boat owned by the FBI - his partner Lefty later found out about the boat - and yet Pistone/Brasco was able to talk his way out of it! Amazing. This guy was so quick on his feet. Talk about guts - this guy was something else. But also, Lefty and Sonny Black, another mobster, really liked Donnie Brasco. Reading this book showed me that being well liked by at least two influential mobsters could go a long way to save you from being whacked.Even though I know what these guys were, thieves, liars, killers, I couldn't help but feel sorry for Sonny when he tells Donnie Brasco how much he trusts him - trust him more than anyone in his crew - how much he liked him. The reader knows Brasco is the last person Sonny can trust. Maybe I shouldn't care, but if you really trust and like someone, it hurts so much to be betrayed. And Sonny, who Pistone/Brasco really liked in spite of everything, doesn't have a pretty ending.As a woman, I couldn't help but notice that Pistone never talks about women he saw or dated. In reality, he was married with children, but he was pretending to be a swinging bachelor. Lefty even accused him of wanting to lie on a beach and be a playboy. Hello! Playboy - that's a red flag word if I ever heard it. From what I can see of him in pictures, he was not a bad looking man, but from his book, you would think the mobsters never saw him (except here and there at first) with another woman. He would just say he was going to New Jersey to see his girl. I can understand keeping anything about other women out of the book since he was/is a married man, and his wife read this book I'm sure. But do I think he went six years without getting involved with another woman - and Lefty calls him a playboy? Oh well, if he pretended to be a mobster, I guess he could just pretend to be a playboy."},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"Also, better than his new book. The author went deep undercover in the Mafia for 6 years. It is a fascinating book, in part, because deep undercover has to be such a perfect transformation to another person. In process, we learn what really goes on in a secret organization, that we could not learn about in any other way. Learning about reality is so much better than the overdramatic fiction of most movies."},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"This man deserves our prayers and thanks for his dedicated service to our country.

I am an avid reader of mob books and this one let me down a bit. If you have seen the movie, this book helps to clear up a lot of the &quot;hollywood&quot; errors. However, I found myself totally lost in the last few chapters. At some point in the book they regress into talking in the cryptic language of real mobsters. So they attempt to give you the actual feel of the conversation between Donnie and other mobsters by using the cryptic language and fragmented sentences and code words. Ordinarily I would be psyched by this because it is what really goes on but they did a bad job at it. They completely lost me. You lose track of who is speaking and what the hell they are talking about. It was a good book all in all but it was very poorly written."},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"In this gripping read, Joe Pistone's story reminds us that there are still true heroes in our society, and that he is one of them. In the past two and a half years, the FBI has come under unrelenting scrutiny, mostly concerning the 9/11 attacks (with everyone looking to blame solely the big bad FBI). While there is no doubt that there are some structural problems that need the be resolved, I feel that the Bureau has been unfairly portrayed as a completely corrupt and ineffectual organization. Donnie Brasco reminds us that these people are, for the most part, true heroes, who only took on this dangerous job having the best interests of the country at heart. Not to mention this is an amazingly entertaining and fasciniating read, a wonderful foray into the life of an undercover agent. It also effectively destroys any notion that the mob is glamorous, revealing the mob for what they really are: greedy, pathetic losers. I was constantly amazed by Mr. Pistone's wit, courage, and fast-thinking in the face of emergencies. A must-read for anyone and everyone interested in the Mafia, the world of undercover agents, or simply the story of a hero. 5 stars."},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"and let me tell you: It was pretty damn scary.

Some detail I like, but this was too long for me!"},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"This is the kind of story many would consider incredible hadn't these events actually taken place. Years ago a short-lived television series (two seasons, to be exact) called \\"Tightrope\\" aired in which a young actor named Michael Connors portrayed an undercover police officer known only as \\"Nick\\" who, week after week, successfully infiltrated various underworld gangs and operations. It was a fictional TV show, nothing more, designed solely for the entertainment of the viewing audience. In 1976 Special Agent Joseph D. Pistone of the FBI made that role a reality. Under the guise of jewel thief \\"Donnie Brasco,\\" Pistone entered the dangerous world of organized crime and eventually penetrated it at a level so deep that he was actually \\"proposed\\" for membership in La Cosa Nostra when the \\"books\\" were opened. Renting an apartment on Manhattan's upper East Side (a lot more affordable then), Pistone began to frequent a local restaurant where he got to know a few \\"connected\\" guys. This led to his broadening his circle of associates to include, first, a Colombo-affiliated crew in Brooklyn and, later, a Manhattan-based faction of the Bonanno family. The fact that he was accepted and gained the trust of these otherwise wary, street-smart \\"wiseguys\\" is a testament to how well Pistone played his role, knowing how far to push the envelope in tricky situations and when to step back. The operation, which lasted six years, came to an abrupt halt when Pistone was given a \\"contract\\" to \\"whack\\" a Bonanno rival. By that time, however, the Mob had been irreparably damaged. Within weeks of the startling revelation that \\"Brasco\\" was in fact an FBI agent, a $500,000 bounty was placed on his life and the Mob began to exact revenge on those who had originally \\"sponsored\\" him. One, Benjamin \\"Lefty Guns\\" Ruggiero, was picked up by FBI agents while on his way to almost certain doom after having been \\"sent for,\\" or summoned, to a Little Italy bar by his former pals. Two others weren't so lucky. In August, 1981, the badly decomposed body of one Dominick \\"Sonny Black\\" Napolitano, a capo who maintained a special fondness for Pistone even after learning he was an agent, turned up in a Staten Island creek, minus both hands. Seven months later, in March, 1982, Anthony Mirra, a psychopath who had been the first to introduce Pistone to the Bonanno crew, was found shot to death behind the wheel of his car in a downtown Manhattan garage. Co-written by Mr. Pistone himself and Richard Woodley, \\"Donnie Brasco\\" reveals the gritty, day-to-day workings of the Cosa Nostra lifestyle as it actually exists (or should I say existed?) and not the honorable, glamorized version of Don Vito Corleone's world as depicted in \\"The Godfather.\\""},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"like it much better that movie- so much more insight- get it if you are interested in this topic!"},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","review":"This is a great book that details Joseph Pistone's infiltration of the mob as Donnie Brasce.

Then I read the book and found it really good. There were two big differences between the movie and the book. First, the movie made a composite out of Lefty and Sonny as far as personality and relationship with Pistone went. Second, the movie was not able to show much of Pistone's thinking. If you can accept the movie as only being based on the story, then both are good. The book has greater depth. The movie has more texture (for example, the movie does a great job of showing the late 1970s). The first third of the book, where Pistone gives many rich examples of thinking his way through dangerous situations, is absolutely magnificent. The only weakness is toward the end where there are too many excerpts from taped conversations. These were obtained at considerable risk but still make for repetitive, and rather boring, reading. But all in all, this book does exactly what you want a book to do. It takes you into a whole other world. &quot;Say a prayer for Lefty too. He only did what he had to do.&quot; Actually, these guys did a lot of stuff that they didn't have to do.

This is the only book that gets as close to *our* points of view as possible - because, though being an agent, Joe Pistone is a normal, intelligent man. Not an incoherent simpleton like 99% of the gangsters. He's book isn't narrated from the position of a brainless crook like Henry Hill, hardened though honourable criminal like Gravano, or ultraegoistic ridiculous fool like Gotti.

There are fewer books still that examine in detail medical care within the Confederacy. H.H. Cunningham's \\"Doctors in Gray\\" first was published in 1958 and remains an excellent study of the Confederate medical service.The book begins with an examination of the specific medical problems the Confederacy faced in 1861 which intensified as the War continued: lack of medical personnel, lack of medical supplies lack of food, an ever-tightening blockade, among others. Cunningham then proceeds to examine the ways in which the Confederate government and military tried to bring sufficient medical care to its troops and to prisoners of war within its lines.Cunningham describes the organization of the Confederate medical service and the large general hospitals the Confederacy opted to establish for the care of its sick and wounded. The largest of these hospitals (and the largest Civil War hospital) was Chimbarozo in Richmond. The book then considers the field hospitals established in line of battle. Cunningham stresses the flexible, mobile nature of these hospitals and how they were constructed to move in a short time as required by the hazards of battle.There are discussions on the ways in which the Confederate Medical Service endeavored to procure supplies and of how the availablity of supplies changed with the South's military fortune. There are detailed discussions of the diseases which claimed the lives of many soldiers and sailors and their sources in the unhygenic conditions of camps and ships. The book discusses medical care at the time of the war -- the use of chloroform, the prevalence of amputation, and experiments with various remedies to cure prevalent diseases. Interestingly, the Confederate Medical Service was the first in wartime to establish a dental care unit for its troops. It was well ahead of the Union army in this respect.Cunningham discusses Confederate medical officers, their training and the difficulties under which they labored. He offers judicious and thougtful assessments of the successes and failures of the Confederate Medical Service. He concludes, reasonably enough, that it performed as well as could have been expected during that time under highly difficult circumstances.Cunningham's book is still in print and worth reading. I am pleased to see, from this site, that others are reading and learning from the book. I enjoyed reading the excellent and succinct review below."},{"Title":"Doctors in gray;: The Confederate medical service","review":"Cunningham has created here a comprehensive history of the medical services of the Confederate states in the Civil War era. Cunningham explains in great detail many afflictions and circumstances that befell Confederate soldiers that ultimately resulted in medical treatment by a Confederate doctor. Ironically, he finds that the majority of the 200,00 soldiers who died during the Civil War had died due to illness or battle wounds which is indicative of a burgeoning and developing medical system that moved from primitive to slightly better by the end of the war. Cunningham explains that while the Confederate doctors did they best they could with the resources and shortcomings they had, their care was still better than no care and there were some doctors who were exceptions to the popular belief that Confederacy personnel were largely untrained."},{"Title":"Doctors in gray;: The Confederate medical service","review":"The medical record of the Confederate Army was destroyed in the fires of Richmond. The research done for this book fills in the many gaps of how the Confederate Army treated its troops and prisoners and the diffifulties that they encountered just as the Union Army. The Confederate Medical suffered from blockades and yet they were able to provide the best care for what they were supplied with. Doc Ferguson"},{"Title":"Neorealism and Neoliberalism","review":"David A. Baldwin's edited work of Neorealism and Neoliberalism is composed of twelve chapters. Arthur Stein remarks that states take decisions independently in anarchic international system while institutions/regimes necessitate joint decision making in this process. Stein cited regimes as a solution to common cooperation problems in the prisoners' dilemma settings. He also argues that regimes create an environment, in which states find rational incentives for cooperation since rational self-interest would lead to joint decision making through regimes. It is also remarkable in Stein's chapter that he holds power as determinant of regime transformation, however, he also ties changes in knowledge and technology as important sources of regime change. Charles Lipson in \\"International Cooperation in Economic and Security Affairs\\" basically points out that international cooperation in economic areas is relatively more easier than in security issues since relative gains calculations are dominant in security-military realm while absolute gain assumptions are more likely to happen in economic affairs. On the other hand, Lipson also argues that neorealism generally ignores the role of interdependence in international cooperation. In fact, this tendency is one the fundamental differences between neorealists and neoliberals. While the former generally assumes that interdependency lead to conflict among states the latter sees it much more as facilitating factor for international cooperation. Robert Axelrod and Robert D. Keohane's \\"Achieving Cooperation under Anarchy: Strategies and Institutions\\" has important insights about the problem of cooperation. They mention three factors that directly influence the probability of cooperation among states. They are mutuality of interests (payoff structure), the shadow of future, and the number of players (sanction problem). These considerations, no doubt, are about game theory driven settings among states. In addition, they emphasize that states should not be considered under just one game setting; rather multilevel games in various issue areas take place among states. Duncan Snidal also emphasizes the difference between two-state and multi-state settings in the seventh chapter. Moreover, Axelrod and Keohane attribute significant importance to perceptions and misperceptions for international cooperation. In the following chapter, Joseph M. Grieco makes a critique of neoliberal institutionalism (NLI). He generally sees NLI as unsuccessful in their criticisms of realism. However, he separates sociological institutionalists and knowledge driven institutionalists from NLI as well competitors with realist approach of institutions and international cooperation in general.There are two important arguments that deserve attention in Helen Milner's chapter. First of them, the separation of domestic and international politics is not so useful in studying the problem of international cooperation since sharp distinctions are hardly possible. The second argument is that overemphasizing anarchy is dangerous, it serves much more to conflict not to cooperation among states. The distinguishing discussion in Robert Powell's chapter is that his argument on iterated/repeated games. He claims that iterated games do not ensure cooperation unlike to some optimistic neoliberal institutionalists argue. Michael Mastanduna in his part (ch.10) makes the same argument as Helen Milner does: the separation of domestic and international politics is hardly possible since domestic and international settings intermingle with each other. (p.263) The other important argument in this chapter is that the decreasing external security threats will lead to the rise in relative gain calculations among states.When one looks the emerging problems between the US and the EU and Japan in the aftermath of the Cold War this argument has been seemed to be relevant. R. Keohane and J. Grieco extend the debate of international cooperation in the last two chapters. Keohane as a neoliberal institutionalist puts institutions on the center for the problem of cooperation among states. He argues that institutions change conceptions of states' self-interest throughout \`bounded rationality'. States then find rational incentives for cooperation in serving their self-interests. He also reiterates the neoliberal institutionalists' central argument; relative gain assumptions make cooperation more difficult. On the other hand, Grieco from the realist side boldly argues that institutions do not mitigate anarchy's constraining effect. Both Keohane and Grieco, however, agrees that the future of the European Union will be a very good test case for neorealist and neoliberal institutionalist debates on international cooperation. Overall, Neorealism and Neoliberalism offers a good epistemology of neorealist-neoliberal debate, hence it should be a must reading in IR theory."},{"Title":"Drugs, Vitamins, Minerals in Pregnancy","review":"Over 400 pages of concise, encyclopedic information on vitamins, minerals, drugs, chemicals in food that could help benefit or harm pregnant mother and baby.

Plus, the act of doing intuitive &quot;readings&quot; before the &quot;laying-on&quot; of the stones was a refreshing way to interact in the healing process.

I do have a new appreciation for the items I have collected over the years (mine pales in comparison), but Mr. Wong's work has truly inspired me to be very discriminating about any future pieces.The photography is unmatched by any other collecting book (perhaps the subjects are far too superior) and the text was obviously written by someone who has a great grasp on the written word. Fantastic!!!"},{"Title":"Smithsonian Baseball: Inside the World's Finest Private Collections","review":"It is clear from the carefully composed prose on every page that Wong loves this game. As an Englishman introduced to baseball by sport channels, Ken Burns and books, I learned that the national pastime was and is America's true love: a game that grew with the country. Wong doesn't simply write about the memorabilia but makes the effort to explore the intimate relationship between Americans and the game. Articulate, thoughtful and passionate, the book is very engaging and yet I am left wondering why Wong didn't spend his time concentrating on the real thing: cricket."},{"Title":"Smithsonian Baseball: Inside the World's Finest Private Collections","review":"As an ardent baseball fan, and having played Little League and American Legion ball before \\"graduating\\" to pioneering slow pitch softball in Hong Kong, Stephen Wong's Smithsonian Baseball has captured my wildest dreams... particularly the fond memories of collecting BB cards in the 50's, only to have them misplaced when I moved overseas.This book touches a sensitive nerve for anyone who enjoys the game. The launching of the book last Monday was timely, with perhaps the most exciting climax to a fantastic baseball season. The book is a \\"real\\" collectors item which I definitely will not \\"misplace\\"!As an aside, it is a lovely storey of events that inspired Stephen Wong to write and document this approach to baseball. I have had the opportunity to meet Stephen several times through his parents after they moved to HK in 1980, and especially his father, Dr Andrew Wong, a dear, dear friend.Thanks Stephen, a truly marvelous book.Rick Kroos"},{"Title":"Smithsonian Baseball: Inside the World's Finest Private Collections","review":"Received the book as a gift a week ago and could not put it down since then. The front cover of the book highlighting the baseball signed by Lou Gehrig (my true hero in baseball) together with Babe Ruth gave me goose bumps!! I thought this book was an excellent way to learn about the history to the game through the eyes of each collector. In addition the photos were just amazing and were able to illuminate the already very colorful writing of Steven Wong. I can see just why each collector is so passionate about their pieces. I am truly surprised by the number of rare memorabilia and artifacts that the author managed to bring together so neatly in this book. Many pieces should be worthy of any historical musuem or even the hall of fame. The book itself should be placed as a permanent piece in the Smithsonian musuem!! Bravo. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Smithsonian Baseball: Inside the World's Finest Private Collections","review":"I received this book for Christmas as I have been a devotee of the game for over 30 years. I have never been so disappointed in any present I have ever received. This book serves as a reminder of everything that has gone wrong with the game. Baseball was once the game of the common man. A game of honesty integrity and spirit. Reading this book reminded me that the important legacy items of the game are now in the hands of the superwealthy and can only be accessed by the interviews of another super wealthy man - Wong. His sycophantic prose and painful rhetoric were difficult to stomach. Do yourself and your kids a favor. Save your money. Go outside and throw a ball around in your yard."},{"Title":"Smithsonian Baseball: Inside the World's Finest Private Collections","review":"Meticulously researched and passionately written, Smithsonian Baseball is above all a comprehensive examination of the collecting sphere, replete with engaging profiles, captivating photography, and lavish graphics. In the process, however, through the eyes of these collectibles, these collectors, and his own experiences, Stephen Wong weaves the entire history of baseball. The heritage of our National Pastime has been recounted countless times before, and yet reading about it here is like seeing the game again for the first time.Somehow, the work seems effortless, even though (or maybe because) Wong apparently poured his blood and sweat and soul into it. He is an insider in the collecting \\"hobby,\\" and the deep respect and affection his colleagues have for him glistens throughout this book. The 21 chapters highlight such stalwart hobbyists as Charlie Merkel, Bill Mastro, Dan Knoll, and Marshall Fogel, interspersed with seven \\"Tips\\" essays from the experts--Mastro, Knoll, Corey Shanus, Dave Bushing, and Kevin Struss, among others. By bringing these experienced voices together for a common cause, Wong makes clear that this is not a vainglorious project, but one, in the spirit of the Lawrence Ritters and Donald Honigs of the baseball canon, about advancing the game's history for its own good and for the benefit of all those who adore it.Wong's admiration for baseball, for its collectibles, and for his authorial forebears shines through immediately. This is a book that fits snugly with the classics like Ritter's The Glory of Their Times. What's more, the writing clicks. It's fresh and engaging. Smithsonian Baseball is both a coffee-table book and a reference work, and its popularity will no doubt increase as the years--and baseball--roll on."},{"Title":"Smithsonian Baseball: Inside the World's Finest Private Collections","review":"Thirty-seven years ago, when I was a kid, I used to go to bookstores and libraries to find books that featured pictures and information about baseball memorabilia. There have been many books published over the years that fall into this category, but none cover the ground as beautifully and in quite the same way as this volume. This is the kind of book I would have loved to have looked at a thousand times as a kid, if only it existed. This book will plant the seeds of interest and inspiration in future young collectors and historians who want to learn about the history of the game and the history of America. As someone who has been professionally involved with the auctioning of baseball memorabilia for decades, and as someone who has seen and read virtually every book ever produced relating to baseball cards and memorabilia, this book is a winner and would be a highlight in any library devoted to the field. In many ways this is a very ambitious project. Many of the great collections featured are really deserving of their own books, and with 21 collections featured, only so much can be covered about each, but that is the intention of the project, and the author does an admirable job of appealing to the non-collector, the most sophisticated collectors in the world, and everyone in between. It's hard to be all things to all people, but this book tries and succeeds, and the quality of its production has earned it a place as a must-have for every baseball library. This is a real coffee table book. You don't have to be a collector to appreciate it. The best section, of course, is the baseball pin chapter. That chapter and the picture of its handsome owner in the back of the book are each worth the price of the book alone. OK, OK, I'm in the book and that section features my collection. I've always wanted to share my collection in a book but never imagined that an opportunity would ever arise. When author Stephen Wong asked to take photos of my collection I was happy to cooperate but had no idea the project was going to result in such a magnificent and beautiful book. The fact that the book is priced so reasonably is also a big plus. This is a book that is obviously worth every penny of its list price, let alone its discounted price. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in collecting or the history of baseball. Just don't start collecting baseball pinbacks and giving me any competition. Thanks!Robert LifsonPresidentRobert Edward Auctions"},{"Title":"Smithsonian Baseball: Inside the World's Finest Private Collections","review":"This is a wonderful book - and unlike anything else out there (disclosure - I have an extensive collection of baseball books - historical, pictorial, analytical, nostalgic, etc.). This is not a coffee table book - though the number and quality of the photography in this book is amazing (bravo to Ms. Einstein)! This is a book where you will read and re-read the various essays - as they are full of wonderful allusions to the great players and great moments of baseball's history which are so well integrated with the 20 stunning personal collections reviewed in the book.Upon receiving the book, I started to peruse the book and found myself completely amazed at the quality of the writing, the genuine willingness of the collectors to share their passion for the hobby and their insights into how to collect various categories - I stayed up until 3am the first night greedily devouring one page after another.What is most amazing to learn is how much of the great, unique memorabilia of the game is outside of Cooperstown and in these private collections that are invisible to the outside world (until now) and only to a small circle of truly passionate collectors.This is not a book written by a historical writer - this is written with tremendous passion and love by one of these top collectors himself. The last chapter features the amazing collection of the author himself - who is no chop liver.What you have here is the unique product of a genuine aficionado, insider and practioner who seemed to have gained the trust of the leading baseball memorabilia collectors in existence and worked with them to enthusiastically share their collections and their passion as they would to their best friend.To see the authentic worn home jerseys of all the great retired Yankees from Ruth to Reggie Jackson in beautiful condition in one row on a rack is simply amazing. There is so much more from cards to bats to parlour games, etc. etc. Please read this gem."},{"Title":"Smithsonian Baseball: Inside the World's Finest Private Collections","review":"I purchased this as a gift and the recipient was thrilled with it.

Surprise here, I'm not even a big baseball fan! But everything about this book draws in the reader: the wonderful photography, the depth and breadth of artifacts, and most importantly (at least for me) the truly engaging writing.As a casual fan of the game I was initially attracted to the book by the photos. But it was the description of the items, the stories behind them and the color to the historical context of the collections that made this book so compelling. It really gave me a glimpse into the real impact baseball has had on the American cultural fabric and gave greater context into the significance of the game today beyond that of simple box scores and statistics. Just as an example, a section of the book that revolves around Jackie Robinson brings forth artifacts and stories about of Pee Wee Reese, Robinson's teammate and lifelong friend, and how Reese played an important supporting role in helping Robinson and baseball integration. Truly compelling stories.Excellent, excellent read. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Smithsonian Baseball: Inside the World's Finest Private Collections","review":"Great coffee table book.

Author Stephen Wong has partnered with the Smithsonian to publish the most stunning book on baseball on the market. It deserves to be on your coffee table not only because of its wonderful photographs but also due to the wonderfully rich way he presents the history of the game. Wong gained remarkable access to the sport's foremost collectors, combing through hundreds of images and memorabilia items. The payoff is tremendous for anyone with an interest in baseball or, for that matter, in American history and culture. Readers will learn the essential facts about the game, and the fascinating tidbits, such as the origins of the curve ball. They then get to see remarkable shots, some most unusual - from folk art statues to Don Larsen's enshrined shoes from his perfect game to the bricks of former stadiums. In fact, this book should be placed in the Hall of Fame!"},{"Title":"Smithsonian Baseball: Inside the World's Finest Private Collections","review":"This is a wonderful baseball book. It captures the entire sweep of our national pastime's history through the description and display of the best (and undoubtedly the most valuable!) private collections of baseball memorabilia. The collectors themselves are a varied lot, from a Wall Street exec to a famous Hollywood celebrity, and each has built up a remarkable collection of some of the rarest, most historically significant baseball memorabilia in existence. This book is a lot more than baseball cards and home run balls, although there is plenty of that. The various collections include amazing original photographs, and the bats, gloves, and uniforms of all the baseball greats, plus lots of unexpected gems like board games, old posters and advertisements, and even folk art fashioned from baseball odds and ends. The photos are accompanied by excellent captions that are very informative, sometimes funny and sometimes heartbreaking, like the game itself. In this book, done to the Smithsonian's usual high standards, the baseball greats of yesteryear seem to come alive and stride the basepaths once again. It almost seems like you can reach out and touch Ty Cobb's bat, or feel the texture of Ted Williams' uniform, or hear the roar of the crowds at The Polo Grounds. Anyone with an interest in baseball will thoroughly enjoy this book, and I heartily recommend it."},{"Title":"Smithsonian Baseball: Inside the World's Finest Private Collections","review":"Stephen Wong's Simthsonian Baseball: Inside the World's Finest Private Collections is that rare baseball book that, similar to titles like The Summer of 1949, Collision At Home Plate and The Boys of Summer, that reminds fans of the game why they became fans in the first place and has the ability to inspire a new generation of baseball devotees.The baseball fan will not be able to put this book down. The artifacts in the featured collections are immediately recognizable and the collections taken as a whole, are superior to what can be found in Cooperstown. The stunning photography and the collection-specific essays literally bring the pieces to life.The casual fan, and even the non-fan who opens this book will know the significance of names like, Ruth, Robinson and Aaron. The collections and their stories will do the rest.The collections are thematic -- celluloid buttons, advertizing, homerun balls, photos, teammates, etc -- which allows this book to be as much a story about the history and culture of America as about the game of baseball. Stephen Wong's narrative has the quality and tone of a conversation with an old friend about great games, great moments and great players: shared experiences that connect our lives.To be fair, most readers of this book will not have the resources to collect baseball memorabelia of this quality. Yes, these collections are private rather then on public display. Hopefully the Smithsonian can work with these and other collectors to arrange a more public presentation. The bottom line though, is that these collectors have chosen to accumulate artifacts of the game they love, becoming stewards of history in the process, rather than cars, boats, or whatever else people with similar means might choose to spend their money on.Buy this book. First, give it to anyone you know who really loves baseball. Then, sit down and flip through the pages with your kids. You'll end up talking as much about yourself, your childhood memories and heroes, and maybe a similar conversation you had with your grandfather, as you will about baseball. That's the magic of the game of baseball: the ability to connect generations through a child's eyes. And that's the magic of this book."},{"Title":"Smithsonian Baseball: Inside the World's Finest Private Collections","review":"Smithsonian Baseball is simply the very best baseball book ever produced! It captures like no other the soul of our national pastime, as passionately expressed in the introduction by it's author, Mr. Stephen Wong. It should be treasured as a museum piece itself with the same reverence as the collections it so perfectly captures.Baseball has been the cornerstone of my life literally each and everyday I could remember, truly a best friend. Like baseball, the book's spirit is a personification of my being.Tremendous thought and care went into every word and illustration of the book.

As a result of reading this book, I now have a greater appreciation for the art of baseball memorabilia. I would recommend this book to those who recall their childhood card collections with fondness as well as to fans of the game of baseball itself.The author has combined an insider's knowledge of baseball memorabilia with a reverence for the history of the game and an understanding of the game's place within American culture. It is clear from the book's essays that he knows how intertwined baseball and America really are. The book's pictures make these one-of-a-kind private collections appear like the works of art that many of them truly are.In addition to well-known baseball memorabilia (the Honus Wagner baseball card, Babe Ruth's bats), the author has an eye for unusual private collections. One of my favorites in the book was the person who focused his collection on Moe Berg, an Ivy League grad and backup catcher in the majors during the 1930s who spoke six languages and served in the Office of Strategic Services, the precursor of the CIA, during World War II. I also had no idea that Penny Marshall (director of \\"A League of Their Own\\"), who is featured in the book, is such an avid baseball memorabilia collector.A great gift for baseball fans of all ages."},{"Title":"Smithsonian Baseball: Inside the World's Finest Private Collections","review":"I have had the great privilege of being a baseball fan for over 50 years and my humble library includes over 1,000 books on our National Pastime. I do not claim to be an authority or a worhty critic of baseball literature. I am simply a lifelong devoted fan who, like many, have reveled in (time and time again) the rich prose from the game's most legendary scribes - Angell, Honig, Ritter, Kinsella, Kahn, Stanton, Thorn, Halberstam, et al. What has impressed me most about this book is that it exudes so much passion about baseball's history and its underlying emotions. I have never come across a baseball book that has captivated my attention on such a high level. Wong's text is extraordinarily rich with layers upon layers of historical context and plenty of time honored baseball anecdotes. The photographs are breathtaking. I can not imagine how much time Wong and his photographer must have spent on producing many of those unforgettable montage shots - positioning of the pieces, lighting, shadowing effect, etc. The artifacts simply jump off the pages. This is not one of those typical \\"formula-driven\\" baseball books that slaps together old photos with dry text in time for opening day sales. This is truly a work of art . . . so much time and effort went into the layout of every page. The positioning of the artifacts with the text in each chapter flow like a Mozart symphony. It really all comes together very well. I can only tip my hat to Mr. Wong. No corners were cut in this magnum opus. This is baseball history at its finest. Well done."},{"Title":"Smithsonian Baseball: Inside the World's Finest Private Collections","review":"Stephen Wong has created a drop-dead gorgeous look at some of the game's great artifacts, and many will be surprised to learn that they are not at the Baseball Hall of Fame nor even at the Smithsonian (despite the book's title). The game's artifacts extend way beyond the cards and gimcrack collectibles sold at the ballpark, and Wong has deftly toggled his focus from collectible to collector and back again, providing a memorable prose portrait of the lively game played off the field. I cannot recommend this brilliantly conceived book highly enough."},{"Title":"Smithsonian Baseball: Inside the World's Finest Private Collections","review":"I just got this today and spent several hours perusing this magnificent book.

A MUST HAVE!"},{"Title":"Smithsonian Baseball: Inside the World's Finest Private Collections","review":"Stephen Wong's one-of-a-kind, amazing book provides detailed and spectacular photos, descriptions and essays which outline the top collections in the baseball memorabilia hobby and the history of the game itself.It's amazing that first time author Wong took almost three years of his life and dedicated it to traveling the world seeking out these incredible treasures. Then, he didn't simply take pictures of the treasures, but wrote extensively about what these rarely seen artifacts mean in context to the era and just how important these rare items really are. Not important just to the featured collectors themselves, but to the game of baseball.This is a book that will be loved by those who enjoy collecting, like baseball or just love history. For Smithsonian Baseball takes us back to baseball's origins in the mid-1800's and gives us a history lesson complete with mind blowing color photography that is not to be missed."},{"Title":"Smithsonian Baseball: Inside the World's Finest Private Collections","review":"This book incorporates some of the most beautiful photography of baseball memorabilia and impeccably-detailed writing about baseball collecting in the world. As baseball is deeply imbued in American culture, the Smithsonian should be commended for reaching out and underwriting this worthy subject matter. A rare book indeed for this subject, professionally written and impressive in scope for people interested in starting a collection or any diehard fan of baseball.Enjoyable as a cover-to-cover read or by random chapter selection, each of the 21 collectors is presented in a unique and enthusiatic manner. The reader never feels that chapters follow an overly structured framework nor is it a biography of collectors; rather, it focuses on every unique collection and the journey through the history of each.I learned how every collector has a particular theme. Unique and in some cases esoteric, these themes reflect the individual collector's personal connection to the Game. For instance, a \\"Do Not Disturb\\" hotel door hangtag signed by Ty Cobb humorously symbolized Cobb's infamous grumpy attitude. An emotional state of inflection that drew collector Penny Marshall to purchase it.As the author presents these themes, the reader promptly appreciates the diversity and breadth of collecting which go far beyond simple baseball card items and a potential return on investment; because, we realize from this book our individuality (and our interests and dreams) transends the constraints of what is popular-culture, is the latest fad, and might be for financial gain. And in doing so, we are allowed to reflect upon not what might appeal to others, but what is of importance to us and what makes us who we are.For any reader seeking a personal journey into these reflections, this book will remain a timeless piece for your reference, inspiration for collecting, and aspiration for years to come."},{"Title":"The New York Giants Base Ball Club: The Growth of a Team and a Sport, 1870 to 1900","review":"A deadly dry Ph.D thesis which attempts to marry a dull account of an exciting team with various analogies to developments in 19th century American history.

Whille I understand better why it is such a tedious stinker, I am no more inclined to improve my opinion. The book is nothing more than a multitude of the mundane strung together as plot. Our narrator pops in and out of town on visits recording these banalities to what end? A few instances made me smile, a skirmish between fans of Dr. Johnson and Dickens had some charm but for the most part the characters and their lives left me bored.

I had to read this at school at 14 (so often enough to put anyone off anything) but it has remained an absolute favourite which hardly anyone else seemed to have read until recently.

I think that it is good to have both and to explore more of Gaskell's creations."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"Cranford is a delight and an idyll of calm in our clamorous twenty-first century world of clutter and clatter! The short novel was first serialized in Charles Dicken's edited periodical \\"Household Words\\" during 1853. Its author was Elizabeth Gaskell (1810-1865) of Manchester who was the wife of the Unitarian pastor William Gaskell. Despite a busy life of charity work, raising several children and a wide correspondence she managed to develop into a fine novelist. Gaskell was friendly with Florence Nightingale and became the biographer of her good friend Charlotte Bronte. This novel has become a popular miniseries on BBC TV and is being broadcast in the United States on the Masterpiece program on PBS.Cranford tells the story of Miss Debroah and Miss Matty Jenkyns late middle aged daughters of a Church of England clergyman. We visit their quiet world of sewing, morning visits to friends, afternoon teas and trips to church events. We learn that they are old fashioned disdaining the coming of the railroad. Miss Deborah engages in a very humorous argument with Captain Brown (significantly this character is killed by a train) over whether Dr. Samuel Johnson or Charles Dickens is the best writer. We learn that Miss Matty had been courted by the eccentric farmer Mr. Holbrook. We learn he has 26 cows or one for each letter of the alphabet. Holbrook dies as an old man after fulfilling his dream of visiting Paris. We discover the story of the siblings wandering brother Peter who leaves home after a quarrel with their stern father. Peter becomes a sailor. Several years later he returns from India to be reacquainted with his surviving sister Matty and his friends in Cranford.We meet such eccentric old maids as Miss Pole and learn of other residents of the tiny village. Cranford is based on Knustsford the village in which Mrs. Gaskell grew to womanhood. Knustford is located close to Manchester in the industrial north of Great Britain.One of the most heartwarming tales of Cranford is to see how the friends of Miss Matty rally around and support her when she loses all of her money in a bank which failed.Cranford is a gentle glance into a rural England which only exists on the printed page. It is a loving little story of ordinary men and women bound together by blood, love and common interests. Excellent!"},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"This book has been called Gaskell's greatest, something I just cannot agree with. ok, so it provides an sharp insight into the small town life of the time. But there isn't much of a plot. Far more worthy are Mary Barton, North and South or her others, I can't comment on Ruth as I haven't read it yet."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"Such a very pleasant read and gives a nice view into the lives of spinster/widow women of the 1850's in England. This particular Kindle version is very well formatted."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"This story is wonderful if you love to read about people, their quirks, their daily life. The story itself is not what the book is focused on but instead it's about this group of women in a small English town and their view of life and the odd inner workings of their minds. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I believe there is also a movie made but it might be hard to track down. So far my favourite Elizabeth Gaskell book is North and South."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"Just fun to read. Easy to become a part of the setting and to know the characters. Just plain enjoyable."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"It took a few pages and a bit of patience to appreciate the voice of the author- but once my modern mind slowed sufficiently to the pace of a small town, and the understated comedy of little quirks and eccentricities of character and custom, it was very enjoyable. Reads very much like a newsy letter from an old aunt whose daily life sees great drama in little things. I laughed out loud more than once- as the writing is both sincere and gently parodying itself at the same time. I finished the book with a smile and a few times was quite touched by the goings on in Cranford. Has many elements from the BBC mini-series but in many ways quite different."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"\\"Cranford\\" like the village to which it refers (only 30 miles by train from the larger town of Drumble in which narrator Mary Smith and her father now live) offers multum in parvo as Rector Jenkyns might have said: much in little.Woven together in chapters that build quietly but skillfully on each other are the stories of Miss Jenkyns and Miss Matilda Jenkyns, their friends Miss Pole, Mrs FitzAdams, Mrs Forrester, Captain Brown and his daughters Miss Brown and Miss Jessie, Lady Glenmire, the Honorable Mrs Jamieson, Signoir Brunoni and his wife, the requited and unrequited lovers, the servants Martha and Mr Mullinare and others sketched swiftly but memorable such as Mr ffoulkes who was so very choice and Mrs ffarington whom he married \\"...and all because of the ff's in her name\\" though being very genteel, pretty,and wealthy were no hinderance.Connected aned interdependent they are: had Signoir Brunoni not performed in Cranford, had he and his family not been sheltered during his illness by a kind innkeeper and his wife, had the ladies of Cranford not discovered his plight and come to the rescue, then Mary Smith would not have heard the story of the wife's journey through India to protect their daughter Pearl, of the kindness of a plantation owner,a Mr. Jenkyns....and she would not have written to him thinking he might be the Miss Jenkyn's long-lost brother, Peter, and more yet would not have ensued.We care about the little town whose portrait is drawn in \\"Cranford,\\" drawn in the watercolors of Beatrix Potter and with the same precision of observation. The much that we get in this book includes a compassionate study of life in a small English town in the early 1800s before Victoria, using as Austin does, the stratum of families (mostly single and widowed women) who saw themselves as genteel though needing to practice elegant economy as the viewpoint. We get writing where each word is exquisitely chosen yet unpretentious; we get a quiet but clear sense of the social stratification where servants were kindly treated but unpaid including the little workhouse maiden whose arms were too small to carry a tea-tray. We get laughter as in the story of Miss Betsy Barker's cow going to pasture in grey flannel after she lost her hair when she fell into the lime-pit.Most of all, we get love: the love between sisters, brothers, fathers and mothers; the love between men and women;lovingkindness to strangers; and the love between the lifelong friends who are the women of Cranford.My copy is over 100 years old, illustrated in pen and ink drawings that are as witty and compassionate as Mrs Gaskell's writing. Found it in an odd lot in a Maine shop years ago, and it has been a good companion since, timeless as good stories and beautifully written work is, from Gilgamesh on."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"There are rules and regulations at Cranford, and women, and a society of women. The town keeps early hours. The inhabitmts of the town exchange kind acts.Captain Brown is killed by a railroad as he removes a small child from the rails. There is a general absence of men in Cranford, but not of the kind of young men suitable for dating the servants. The central postion in the story is occupied by Mathilda Jenkyns, daughter of a clergyman, an unmarried woman.The author has amusing ways of describing the people in the village, their quirks, their eccentricities, their habits. One character prefers Mr. Boz, (Dickens), to Dr. Johnson. Miss Mathilda Jenkyns is persuaded by her friends to visit Mr. Holbrook, a former beau who was considered by a member of her family to be unsuitable. The guests wonder whether it is possible to eat peas with the utensils provided. Shortly after the visit Mr. Holbrook dies to the secret consternation of Miss Matty Jenkyns.From letters it is learned that her mother expected Matty Jenkyns to grow up to become a great beauty. Her brother Peter, after mischief-making and being whipped by her father, disappears. He is sighted in Liverpool and it is understood his employment takes him to India. He sends his mother a shawl and then the family ceases to hear anything about him.Mrs. Gaskell describes a milliners shop in Cranford and another establishment selling general goods. Expenditure of dress in Cranford is mainly a case of new caps. A hostess gives her dog cream with his tea and her guests, milk. In misfortune, a bank failure, kindness and love are bestowed by friends and associates for the victim's support and betterment. Harmony, reciprocity are the qualities clearly evidenced.The appendix contains an essay of Gaskell's,\\"The Last Generation in England,\\" which bears upon her knowledge of the sort of society portrayed in CRANFORD."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"This paperback version is the one that the recent tv series fan will want, because unlike some of the other paperback versions, it includes the three Gaskell novellas that were the basis for the Judi Dench-Eileen Atkins miniseries. The three books were\\"Cranford\\", \\"My Lady Ludlow\\" and \\"Mr Harrison's Confessions.\\"Mrs Gaskell stories are considered comedies, and this comes clear in the original texts. Some sadness of course in events, but mostly there is a clear comic, even sardonic voice in which we can fall in love with the characters and still laugh at their foibles, fashions, and foolishness which seem still so apropos today.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"Let me begin this review by saying that if you are thinking about reading this book only because of the BBC series, you will find it very disappointing. The makers of that series used the authors name, the title of the book and some of the characters but the remainder of their production is pure invention. I am enjoying watching the BBC program, but it is not this book.Ms Charlotte Mitchell provides an Introduction and Notes for this book. It is my belief that it is essesntial to read the Introduction in order to fully understand Cranford. Elizabeth Gaskell had written a series of stories which appeared at irregular intervals in a magazine edited by Charles Dickens titled Household Words. The stories first appeared together as a novel in 1853. Ms Mitchell uses the Introduction to explain the chronology for the publishing of this and other novels by Elizabeth Gaskell. She also takes this opportunity to explore the question of whether or not Cranford was ever meant to be taken seriously by readers of Ms Gaskell since her other novels are so very different in tone from this one.One of the things I really appreciate which Ms Mitchell did was to include the Notes section to explain words and phrases which appear in the book which were very well understood in the 1800's but which may be unfamiliar to readers today. I read a lot of historical romantic fiction and these Notes gave me concrete explanations for words and phrases I have been too lazy to research for myself. I thought I knew what they meant before, now I know for sure. Items such as:1. gigot - a sleeve style described as leg-of-mutton2. baby-house - a dolls house3. sarsenet - a soft thin silk material4. blind man's holiday - a proverbial term for night or twilightMs Mitchell states in the Introduction that Gaskell later came to regret the fact that she had caused Colonel Brown to be killed in the first story. If he had remained a character longer in the series, I think that Cranford might have gone in a very different direction. As it is, Cranford is the story of a certain class of women, either unmarried or widowed, who live in a small English villiage. The main character is Miss Matty Jenkyns who only comes into prominence after the death of her older sister, Miss Deborah. The women relish their lack of male inhabitants and see themselves as lucky in not having to deal with the ways of men, which they see as uncouth and almost barbaric (they will speak too loud!). There is a very strict social structure among these women, even as to what time of day they can visit each other and what kind of clothes they should be wearing when the visits take place. These rules are in place to keep everyone on an even keel, so that everyone understands the rules, and no one may change the rules without the approval of the most prestigious ranking member of their set.Cranford is a study in contrasts. The differences in the male approach to the world, with their freedoms, and the female approach to the world, with all the restrictions placed upon them. I can honestly say that I had fun reading this book. I grinned, smiled, chuckled and even laughed out loud. No episode was too tiny to cause a complete, unrealistic upheaval among the ladies of Cranford. One of my favorite parts of the story concerns how they all react when rumor and half-truths have them convinced that a gang of thieves and burglars are roaming the countryside. It is funny and heartwarming but also sad to see the lengths they go to in order to protect themselves and their households from these thieves who are, in reality, simply the result of gossip and overactive imaginations. Another part I am particularly fond of is when the main characters allow themselves to unbend to the extent of divulging to their friends what their worst fear is. Miss Matty revealed that she was afraid each night that a man was hiding under her bed. Her method of reassuring herself that no person was there was actually quite astute and surprising for this woman's character. But Cranford is not all warm feelings and quaint happenings. There are real tragedies which effect these women and move their lives into totally different directions.This book is told in the narrative style, something which I usually do not like. There is very little dialogue. The name of the narrator is not even mentioned until page 137. I had read the persons name in the Introduction but I was very surprised to see that this type of presentation did not detract from my enjoyment of the book at all. It is not the most exciting book I have ever read, it is not a very long book, and it does not require much stretching of the readers intellect but I enjoyed all of the time I spent reading it and will certainly read it over and over.Very highly recommended for any reader who enjoys historical fiction. It is not a romance, more a journal of the everyday lives of women who depend on themselves and their friends for comfort and companionship."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"This Viking edition includes \\"Mr. Harrison's Confession,\\" \\"Cranford,\\" and \\"My Lady Ludlow,\\" the three novellascombined to produce the Cranford BBC series. The works are quite different from each other, \\"My Lady Ludlow\\" differing the most in tone and style.\\"Mr. Harrison's Confession\\" is the droll account of a young doctor who comes to Dunscombe (a Cranford stand-in) to practice with the much older Mr. Morgan, an old friend of his father's. As young Harrison makes the transition from the lively streets of London to the quaint lanes of the little town to which he has moved, he is involved in many humorous misunderstandings--and especially troublesome are those caused by a prankster friend of his! There are poignant moments too, as Mr. Harrison and the townspeople learn to know each other, and the young doctor finds love.\\"Cranford\\" is the most fully fleshed out of the three novellas, and easily the most readily absorbed by the modern reader. To one who grew up in New England of swamp Yankee parentage, the mindset of the Cranford ladies is completely familiar. Why care about dress when everyone in your town knows what clothes you own, and why care when you are away where no one knows you at all? The various subplots of the story are very reminiscent Sarah Orne Jewett, who wrote a few decades later in the US--\\"The Country of the Pointed Firs,\\" for example. The novel comprises several interlocking stories centering on Miss Matilda Jenkyns, her family and her friends who inhabit the little town of Cransford--a town of Amazons. Very few men live in the village. Though many of the stories are humorous, there are those that touch the heart.\\"My Lady Ludlow\\" is the most old-fashioned of the three novellas--set decades before the others at the beginning of the nineteenth century, and full of sentiment. Lady Ludlow, herself in old age, must learn to change as the world around her does. The story, narrated by a young woman in frail health, from the vantage point of later years, contains a lengthy and melodramatic subplot reminiscent of \\"A Tale of Two Cities.\\"\\"Cranford\\" is a wonderful piece of work, and the other two novellas are very enjoyable. Especially if you liked the BBC series, you'll enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"\\"Cranford\\" is likely the best known novel of Victorian author Elizabeth Gaskell. The novel follows the day-to-day social lives of a group of upper-middle-class women in the small, fictional town of Cranford, England. Rather than having a strong narrative, the novel delivers a tableau of social goings on that illuminate the characters and their lives. These stories are told largely through the eyes of a younger lady (Miss Mary Smith) who often visits from a nearby town. The ladies of Cranford are not rich, but wealthy enough to belong to a certain social strata, and much of the comedy derives from their careful considerations of who to include and exclude at various social gatherings. Miss Matty is essentially the main protagonist, and she is a basically kind woman if a bit miserly, especially when it comes to candles. She and her friends typically look to the most prominent member of Cranford female society, Miss Jamieson, and then assiduously follow her lead. Unfortunately, Miss Jamieson is sometimes rather narrow-minded, unlike the other ladies, which creates certain socially awkward situations.This enjoyable novel may seem a bit meandering to some readers, given that there is not a main narrative thread. The novel was originally published in serialized form in \\"Household Words\\" (edited by Charles Dickens), which may partially help explain its lack of a strong plot. Indeed, the 2007 BBC mini-series versions of \\"Cranford\\" included stories from several of Gaskell's other novels. However, the stories here all add up to a devastatingly accurate picture of small town life and the sometimes vicious yet amusing ways in which people in them behave. Gaskell clearly understood human nature, and readers are likely to recognize many truths about human foibles in her stories. I found myself laughing and touched often.Note: This review is for the Kindle version. The text is well-arranged and does not contain any noticeable errors, although there are lots of spaces in between section and subsections (which actually makes reading easier). This version has no extras, such as a biography of Gaskell or an introduction to the text; however, such materials are so easily available on the internet now that this exclusion is not a major debit."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"To you scoffers who find this novel uneventful - I say read it again toward the close of your life. The stories of these genteel ladies with their 40 year old lost loves and their strong familial relationships are very moving. I also like the way the book is contructed in a series of vignettes. But most of all I am enchanted with the \\"feel\\" of the portrait of village life in the middle of the 19th century - such a contrast with the mores of today it's hard to believe we are the same species! If you like Mrs. Gaskell, be sure to read Barbara Pym for the 20th century version."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"I have just discovered this wonderful author after watching \\"Cranford\\" on Masterpiece Theatre. I ordered several of her titles and I am hooked. I will read everything she has written. As someone who always wished that Jane Austen had written just one more book (or two or five or forty!!!), Elizabeth Gaskell is a real find. Her works are more \\"worldly\\" than the mild Miss Austen, but her characters are just as compelling and I love her."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"I read this series of village sketches as an independent study and found that it is most commonly referred to as &quot;charming.&quot; This so called charm is achieved through the humourous realism with which Gaskell depicts the citizens of the small, rural town of Cranford. The women presented are 'old maids' and though genteel, their economic status is far from certain. Perhaps the tender concern Gaskell shows for their welfare, and the friendship demonstrated for a friend in need is most pivotal in creating the charm of the novel. This book has the feel of a 'chick flick': no grand action necessarily, but little episodes of social excitement followed by periods of daily activity. The book provides both comic scenes and tear-jerkers and the method of storytelling could be likened to that of movies such as &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot; or &quot;Fried Green Tomatoes&quot;."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"Delightful, surely one of the most charming novels ever written. Using the lightest of touches, Mrs. Gaskell pokes fun at the simple people who inhabit the provincial community of Cranford in rural England in the 1840s, a village we are told at the beginning that is curiously \\"in possession of the Amazons\\": its male inhabitants nowhere to be found. Told in the form of reports by a frequent visitor to the village (Mary Smith) from a more cosmopolitan place, we are made privy to the disappointments, hopes, fears, and affronts of a number of the female residents, particularly Miss Matty Jenkyns and Mrs. Jamieson. All are related humorously, some wildly so. My favorite scenes include Mrs. Jamieson's defense of Samuel Johnson over Captain Brown's preference for Dickens's Boz and the sad story of Peter Jenkyns who is insulted by his father and runs away to join the navy. But every chapter offers its delights, and it's easy to see, as Frank Swinnerton mentions in the introduction, how many people at one time knew the book by heart. Long a best seller in the Everyman's Library, it's sad to see the book not included in the recent reissue of 100 of that library's most popular books, a gross oversight for sure."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"Sherwood Anderson once described life as a \\"history of moments\\". Miss Gaskell has created in Cranford a glimpse into a dying culture of the more egalitiarian rural Bitish Yoemanry of the 18th century collapsing under the urbanization of the society and with a more repressive capitalism to claim the lives and souls of the youth leaving the village for better lives. Goldsmith's the \\"Deserted Village\\" comes to mind.The story is told from the lives of elderly mostly female, spinster as well as widowed community of genteel rural poverty- self imposed and otherwise. Quaint yet, but with vinegary pithiness of death, stoicism and social veneer, in other words real life. This is civilized 19th century social writing at its best, like a journalistic Austen. The narrator is a wise insightful character commenting on the eccentric and slightly mad village women who make up this world. The rivalry between Captain Brown and Miss Jenkyns based upon their literary preference of Dr. Johnson vs Charles Dickens is especially amusing considering that Cranford first appeared in Dicken's magazine, \\"Household Words\\". Endearing and haunting- much more than its surface appearance."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"Reading \\"Cranford\\" is a lot like spending an afternoon in the doily museum of a provincial city; you can't help but admire the skill of the embroidery but you have to wonder at your own sanity for being there. I stuffed the book in my carry-on, as a relief from the 20th C anguish in the novels I'd been reading recently, and found myself waiting out a snow delay with nothing to read but this staid portrayal of a circle of spinsters nourished chiefly by their own proprieties. Cranford is not a novel at all, but rather a series of nostalgic sketches of the old-fashioned manners and quaint habits of genteel but impoverished provincial ladies, gently satirical, a porcelain cup counterpart to Charles Dickens's \\"Pickwick Papers\\". Dickens is explicitly mentioned in several chapters of Cranford; Miss Dorothy Jenkyns, the most literary of the Cranford ladies, finds him vulgar and less eloquent in every way than Dr. Johnson.Elizabeth Gaskell and Charles Dickens were quite well acquainted with each other's work; in fact \\"Cranford\\" was first published in serial form in one of Dickens's magazines. There are many parallels, particularly between Dickens's \\"Hard Times\\" and Gaskell's \\"North and South\\". Both books focus on the dire conditions of labor in 19th C England; both can be considered liberal protest novels. I suppose Gaskell is never as knee-slapping funny as Dickens can be, but she has other virtues, closer to Trollope, in terms of cogent story-telling and sympathetic insight into characters of all classes and both genders.Gaskell was totally 'out of fashion' when I went to college. The luminaries of Victorian literature, as taught at Harvard in the 1960s, were Eliot, Austen, and the Brontes, with Dickens and Thackeray cast as their knaves and Trollope as their butler. But Gaskell has made a comeback. Aside from \\"North and South\\", her novels \\"Ruth\\", \\"Sylvia's Lovers\\", \\"Wives and Daughters,\\" and others are in print and well worth reading. As her titles suggest, her feminism was more overt than that of her peers, and her sympathies were clearly 'liberal' in the current American political sense. Above all, she could tell a good story.Cranford was immensely popular in its time, when perhaps most readers had their own maiden aunts to caricature. It's quite well done in its way, but if you've never read Gaskell before, I wouldn't suggest starting with it. You might find it challenging to sit quietly with the ladies as they crochet and dither over their bonnets."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"\\"Quaint\\" is the first word that comes to mind. I would almost describe it as one of Eliot's idyllic novels, if it had been written by Dickens. I would say that, if it weren't a disservice to all the authors involved. Jane Austen would be a more apt comparison, if Austen's works were more episodic. Mrs. Gaskell has a sweetness and a wit throughout the novel, with a tongue-in-cheek attitude towards the inhabitants of Cranford, that brings to mind both the works of Dickens and Austen--especially the characterizations, which are quite good. This is important, as with only a thin veil of a plot to tie to chapters together, the responsibility of drawing the reader in falls solely on the shoulders of her characters. Moving from incident to incident, as was not uncommon in Victorian novels, the novel begs us to pay attention simply because the characters are worth giving our attention. Obviously, a weak novel is one wants to study plot, but one could certainly choose a worth book to pick up to study the art of comedic characterization. With less on it's mind than some of Gaskell's other works--from what I've read--Cranford is an easy, enjoyable read, but far from life changing. It is simply a well-written, enjoyable read, and there's nothing wrong with that. Something to enjoy over afternoon tea."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"Last winter, I rented Cranford, the BBC miniseries (starring Judi Dench), from Netflix--and that got me interested in the book on which that's based. The book is a series of vignettes about the ladies of the town of Cranford, many of whom are elderly spinsters like Miss Matty Jenkyns and her sister Deborah, or Miss Pole (much as I tried not to, I kept seeing Judi Dench and Imelda Staunton in the roles of Miss Matty and Miss Pole).This short story differs significantly from the miniseries; the miniseries focuses a lot on the encroachment of the railways on the town of Cranford, and there's a romantic subplot going on there. The book is much more centered on the middle-aged and elderly ladies of the town, as seen through a semi-outsider, Miss Mary Smith, the daughter of a family friend of the Jenkynses.As another reviewer said on Librarything, reading about the ladies of Cranford is a lot like reading about the Golden Girls. This is a very lighthearted, funny book in many places, but still very touching. The ladies are very provincial, focused on the mundane details of their lives--but very loyal to one another, as seen when Matty looses her money and her friends conspire to help her out. It took a few pages for me to get into the story, but once I did, I was fully engaged in the lives of the characters in this book."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"I have always been a fan of 19th century novels and many of my favorite authors come from this time period. I have never read anything by Gaskill, and finally grabbed this book after seeing the BBC miniseries of the same name.It was a sentimental look at several spinsters in the town of Cranford, all of which are likable and good people. The overall tone of the book was very positive, with one of the main lessons showing that people love to help genuinely good people. It is a nice contrast to many novels that show the worst in people.Note that this does not match the BBC series in all aspects since the BBC series took all 3 Cranford books and condensed them into a miniseries, but many of the episodes from the book are included with modifications. I enjoyed the book and the TV show, even though they did not match exactly.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in this type of literature and who wants a refreshing glance as a time that was."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"...I came to the conclusion that this printing of Cranford has the CUTEST cover (i.e. a pretty teacup and a great font), therefore I bought it.My wife agreed.Mission accomplished hubbie. Mission accomplished.But seriously, if you or your wife are into Jane Austen(ish) stuff like my wife, Cranford is a MUST have. And of all the printed versions, this one is by far the cutest looking, which apparently is somewhat important to wives who like Jane Austen and her crowd of Victorian/Regency era authors. If you're a husband looking for a gift for your wife, this is a great one.And definitely buy her the DVD bundle of Cranfod and return to Cranford.And definitely buy her the DVD first few seasons of \\"Lark Rise to Candleford\\".Believe me...it's worth the money.She'll feel like you understand her a little bit...and she'll have some of her friends over for a \\"girl night\\" where they watch their DVDs and drink tea and dream about living in mid nineteenth century Britain, and you'll be able to work on the car/the yard/whatever without feeling like you're neglecting your wife because she'll be having way more fun than you.That's worth any price."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"Explore the 3 life perspectives of the folks in Cranford and surrounds and you'll settle in for a cup of tea at Miss Matty's in no time. These are the 3 character-filled and -driven collections that the PBS Cranford series and Return to Cranford series were adapted from, so I recommend Gaskell's set here for any and all who've enjoyed the film versions.And this particular offering from Amazon is priced so frugally even Cranford's own Miss Deborah would approve. So, settle into Cranford for the summertime and enjoy the rhythm of their lives."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"Inspired to grab a copy of the book after seeing the PBS series, I am very pleased with this version of Cranford by Elizabeth Gaskell. With several options to choose from, I am very happy with the aesthetics of this book. In particular I truly enjoy the \\"tea cup\\" cover and the simplistic and easy to read layout of the interior. And it's always good to have a nice book to look at on the shelf when you're done with reading it.After being impressed with this book I also checked out the other books tagged with cricket house and their other offerings are as equally impressive.This version of Cranford is definitely worth it's price."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"I was inspired to read Cranford by Elizabeth Gaskell after watching the PBS/BBC miniseries last year. The town of Cranford is dominated by women. There are relatively few men, at least in the social circle of the characters in this book. The main characters are all single, either spinsters or widows, and they fiercely guard their way of life.The book, originally published serially in 1853 in Charles Dickens' magazine Household Words, is a series of vignettes of the daily life of Miss Mathilda Jenkyns. This book is definitely character driven and starts off slow. Nothing truly exciting ever happens in Cranford and you have to get to know the characters before you understand how small disruptions can make huge waves in their lives. Gaskell manages to convey how important small events are to these characters. You get the sense that if anything big ever happened they'd die from the shock. The narrator, Mary Smith, a frequent (and slightly more worldly) visitor to the town tries to keep molehills from turning into mountains and for the most part is successful. But, sometimes even she gets sucked into the daily drama.Fans of the miniseries might be disappointed with the book. Many of the funniest storylines from the series are added. But, the loyalty and friendship the characters display towards each other should endear this book to all but the most jaded reader."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"When I finished the last sentence of Cranford, I was so sad. I was so sorry that it was over, that I would not be sharing more time with these wonderful people, especially the dear and familiar Miss Matty. I was moved to laugh and cry over the events of this book, and I will not forget the parts that touched me most. I found the most real and lovely part of the book was when the friends came together when Miss Matty needed them most, and they did this just as real friends do, without mentioning it. I have purchased the mini-series and look forward to watching that, but nothing compares to the days and nights I spent \\"walking\\" the streets of Cranford and sharing an inside knowledge of all that was going on."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"This novella has a good deal of charm and real feeling--I don't think you'll soon forget Miss Matty, who is the center of these little stories, even if her older sister was much more forceful in character. The efforts of the ladies of the village--and it is pretty much ladies--to cope with limited incomes, burglars, death, love, tea, cows, servants, and addressing the nobility are both funny and poignant. However much they bicker and contend with each other, when the chips are down, you'll find them (or their handmaidens) at the door with the 19th century equivalent of a casserole. (For one born in New England, these ladies are very reminiscent of much older relatives.)Heartily recommended."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"Cranford (Penguin Classics)I bought this book after having seen the Masterpiece production of it. The book is unique in that it is a novel set in the mid 1800s and comes complete with appendices explaining the words and references to people and events used throughout the book. It was very historically educational in addition to being a very interesting and well written novel. I very much recommend the book and I will be reading more by Patricia Gaskell"},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"This Penguin Classics edition of Cranford, with a cover design by Coralie Bickford-Smith, is a beautiful book, a pleasure to hold and read. I wish Penguin would release more books in such high quality editions.I'd never read any of Gaskell's work before, so Cranford was a pleasant surprise. It's a lively and warm-hearted novel which will appeal to fans of Garrison Keillor and Alexander McCall Smith.Another reviewer described Cranford as \\"not a novel at all, but rather a series of nostalgic sketches.\\" Certainly Cranford is nostalgic, perhaps even sentimental, but it's more than a series of sketches. I would go so far as to say that Cranford demonstrates a remarkable tightness of plot and character development, though Gaskell works with such a light touch (and elliptical style) that I can see how it would be easy to overlook the unity of the whole novel. If you read Cranford as a collection of anecdotes, I encourage you to ask yourself which parts could be removed without undermining the book."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"In the last few years or so, I've been noting a resurgence of a writer who was very popular in nineteenth century England. Not quite as famous as Charles Dickens or Anthony Trollope, Elizabeth Gaskell did find a niche writing about everyday people in the small towns and villages that dotted England's landscape.Cranford is a slim collection of vignettes. Each little story explores a person, a gathering, or an incident in the past or present. Some are humourous, others are very poignant, and some just look at the life and manners of the time. In specific, to one particular group in the village.For Cranford, as we are told in the opening sentence, is a place that is governed by Amazons. The Amazons are a group of elderly spinsters or widows who have fallen into genteel poverty, supported by meager savings left from legacies and inheritances. As a group, they inhabit nearly all of the homes of Cranford, deciding on questions of taste and morality, the correct behavior of servants, managing gardens, discretion in clothing and so forth. And where are the men, you might ask? Nearly all of them have fled, it seems -- to the military, to the navy, to the nearby city of Dumble (a stand-in for Manchester), frightened off, no doubt, by the formidable array of feminity before them.As the 'leaders,' there are the two daughters of the former vicar of the town. Miss Jenkyns and her younger sister Miss Matty, have risen to a level of respectability in the community, leading their little bevy of companion in acts of charity, mourning, welcoming (and shunning) strangers, and even to such details as what is to be considered suitable literature. When we first meet them, the town has been sent into turmoil by the arrival of a retired military man with two daughters -- and he has the temerity to actually suggest books to Miss Jenkyns. Horrors!But there is more to the story, and as the nameless narrator leads us through the various members of the village, there are stories that are humourous, such as when a string of burglaries occurs, or when a traveling magician arrives. Other stories are very poignant, such as Miss Matty and a collection of old letters, or when a bank in Dumble defaults and one person's savings are wiped out.What makes this collection stand out is the level of compassion between the various women as their little world is shaken up by the encroaching Industrial Age, and their somewhat stubborn intent on keeping their village just the way it is. And underneath some of the bristly exteriors, there are acts of selflessness and care that they extend to each other. This and the humour that the author brought to each story, was what made the book for me.I really don't want to reveal much more of the book as not to spoil it for anyone. The collection itself is rather slim, just sixteen stories of about twenty pages long. Along with the stories, there are extensive notes that have been added by Patricia Ingham, which really do help to understand the terms and usage of the language, and help to clear up some very unfamiliar terms.All in all, a very enjoyable read that is much lighter in tone than most Victorian fiction. Great fun to read, and to sigh over as well.Four stars. Recommended."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"This is a really good edition of the book. If you by classic literature you know that some editions are better than others, this is a very good version of the The Cranford Chronicles. This volume houses Mr. Harrison's Confessions(86 pages), Cranford (188 pages), My Lady Ludlow (203 pages).The type is not ridiculously small it's pretty average, this is a very readable version of the Cranford Chronicles. The story of the town of Cranford and it's inhabitants, the comings and goings, the slow and steady development of the women of Cranford and their coming together."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"Not a novel, not an anthology of short stories, Cranford is perhaps best described as a cohesive series of vignettes. Recounted by a young woman of about 30 from the city of Drumble [Manchester], these stories depict family, friendship, and love lost and found in a village dominated by poor but genteel spinsters and widows. \\". . . all the holders of houses, above a certain rent, are women.\\" Small, rural, and elitist in its way, Cranford is a place out of time, where faded fashions and proprieties still matter.Gaskell begins Cranford with a series of descriptive statements. Some are accurate, while others prove to be ironic. For example, \\"Although the ladies of Cranford know all each other's proceedings, they are exceedingly indifferent to each other's opinions.\\" While discovering Cranford and the Amazons who possess it, we also learn the dry perspective and voice of the narrator, who clearly loves the village while gently highlighting the foibles of its female inhabitants. \\"But I will answer for it, the last gigot, the last tight and scanty petticoat in wear in England, was seen in Cranford--and seen without a smile.\\"Like Gaskell's Wives and Daughters, Cranford is focused on gender roles and the different lives of women and men. The sexes share many characteristics; Captain Brown and Peter Jenkyns display the thoughtful, neighborly solicitude associated with women (with Peter going so far as to don a woman's dress), while Miss Jenkyns (the woman Peter impersonates) exhibits a manly will and resolution. It is the opportunities they have and the way in which they live that separates the sexes. Captain Brown, Peter, and Signor Brunoni have traveled and seen some of the world, and have even influenced it, while Miss Jenkyns, Miss Matty, Miss Price, the narrator, and their friends are constrained by their gender, gentility, and social code to hearth and home. Here, they perform their small household tasks, including ensuring that their maidservants are not disturbed or distracted by \\"followers,\\" or interested young men. The social code that prevents any of them from working in \\"trade\\" also determines the hours that can be spent outside the home. \\"Then there were rules and regulations for visiting and calls . . . 'from twelve to three are our calling-hours.'\\"In such a small, interconnected village, everything that happens is noteworthy, and every decision is important if the occasionally cruel social order is to be maintained. \\"The whole town knew and kindly regarded Miss Betty Barker's Alderney,\\" whose fall into a lime-pit warrants Captain Brown's advice, \\"Get her a flannel waistcoat and flannel drawers . . .,\\" so the narrator can ask the reader incredulously, \\"Do you ever seen cows dressed in grey flannel in London?\\" Miss Matty's decision not to marry against her family's wishes keeps the peace at great personal cost, and her wistful decision to allow Martha to have a follower recompenses her later when the outside world intrudes into her realm with its ugly realities--one of the many signs that Cranford must and will change. When Lady Glenmire renounces her title and takes the name of Mrs. Hoggins upon her remarriage, Cranford reels with shock and dismay, and it takes Peter Jenkyns, and his broader perspective from India, to reconcile the village and its de facto leader, Mrs. Jamieson, with the new ways.The narrator, who divides her time between her father in the progressive world of Drumble and the slowly and reluctantly changing Cranford, finds herself under the village's influence. As an observer, she describes the complex set of rules that governs Cranford society and the social slights they necessitate, not without a sense of regret. She is aware of the absurdity of Cranford society's beliefs and behavior combined with expediency, such as the occasion of Miss Betty Barker's party for the Cranford elite. \\"'Oh, gentility!' thought I, 'can you endure this last shock?'\\" when \\"all sorts of good things for supper\\" appear. \\". . . we thought it better to submit graciously, even at the cost of our gentility--which never ate suppers in general--but which, like most non-supper-eaters, was particularly hungry on all special occasions.\\" More seriously, she pities Miss Matty and her lost love and life, and like her other well-meaning friends determines that she shall be happy.With the arrival of Signor Brunoni and the ensuing panic over the perceived crime wave that seems to hit Cranford, the narrator loses some of her wryness and seems to become nearly as frightened by the rumors of strangers and robberies as her elderly friends. It is the new outsider, Lady Glenmire, who \\"never had heard of any actual robberies; except that two little boys had stolen some apples from Farmer Benson's orchard and that some eggs had been missed on a market-day off Widow Hayward's stall.\\" Even while caught up in the panic, however, \\"I could not help being amused at Jenny's position . . ..\\" When she speaks of Jenny's ghost, the narrator says, \\". . . for there was no knowing how near the ghostly head and ears might be . . ..\\"Through the narrator, who seems to represent Gaskell's own perspective, Cranford pokes gentle fun at a time and place that had already become a fairy tale-like setting, where goodness outdoes pettiness, justice prevails over setbacks and hardships, and even the prodigal son (or prince) can return to set things right. In Cranford, Gaskell reminds the reader of a recent past that is both amusing and moving, a time to look upon fondly but without regret for the changes that Peter and the marriage of Lady Glenmire/Mrs. Hoggins bring about. The one constant in life is change, and in Cranford change is at least as much for the better as for the worse."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"Elizabeth Gaskell's Wives & Daughters and North & South have recently become two of my favorite books, so it stood to reason that I should check out her other novels. When I read Cranford I already knew that it wouldn't have a coherent plot, so I wasn't disappointed about that. What I found was a short but slow read made charming because of Gaskell's humor and elegant style of writing.Plotwise, it reminded me of L.M. Montgomery's stories, because Montgomery usually features young girls being brought up by dominant spinsters in small towns. Cranford doesn't include children of any variety, but similar quirks of aging ladies and domestic life are depicted. Of course, Gaskell's writing is not quite as saccharine as Montgomery's.Men are so rare in this novel that they are great curiosities, to the main characters and to the reader. My only complaint is that the narrator (I think her name was Mary Smith) did not talk more about herself. Was she destined to grow old without love just like her friend Miss Mattie?This isn't a book I would read more than once or twice. I can't imagine that I would have enjoyed as much if I hadn't already been obsessed with the author."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"Not really a novel, but more of a series of stories of the narrators recalling of her time spent in the fictional Cranford. Quite funny in parts (\\"When it was ended, she turned to me, and said with mild dignity, 'Fetch me \\"Rasselas,\\" my dear , out of the book-room.\\" You know things are going to heat up when someone is going to go and get the Dr.). Once upon a time writers used to have love for their characters they created, which I believe is why so little of fiction from the last 50-100 years or more appeals to me.Unfortunately, the Introduction is a horror of modern criticism bugaboo gone wild. I'm remined of Kerouac's saying \\"I have the critics explaing me to me.\\" This is the sort of intro that trots out the writers (and what about the practise of putting the editor, the person who does the introduction, and the likes, NAME on the cover, inside and everywhere else, as large as the Authors? Its quite funny to look up a writer on Amazon and see someone elses name tagged along, as if Dante and Homer and the rest had a helper writer we didn't know about!) pet peeves and overly biased views: \\"In his healthy appetite for food ('the peas were going wholesale into his capacious mouth,' p. 33) we see an image of sexual appetite, unhampered by social shibboleths.\\" We do? Maybe you do, but I don't. It's amazing how many writers attribute their loony views to poor writers who, in all probability, meant no such thing (Freud, Fraud, Freud...). And they can't refute such nonsense and drivel, most being dead (and being dead being beyond refutation)."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"These little stories are about life and love in the mid-nineteenth century. This book was first printed as serials as so many books were at that time. By the time Mrs. Gaskell wrote Cranford, she was extremely popular with the English people. This book is essentially a comedy of manners. The people in Cranford live genteelly and they are very proud of that fact even if they don't have much money. The book is about four old ladies and the life they lead. Mrs. Gaskell's characterizations are wonderful. Their lives consist of tea, cards and gossip. This is a book about ladies. There are very few men in it, but we certainly get a good description of the male species from the ladies' observations. It's a wonderful world that Mrs. Gaskell has created for us. Come and meet the wonderful ladies of Cranford."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"This book wraps you 'round and carries you into into the humble, hilarious and understated society of the women who inhabit the small town of Cranford; it is a treasure that you will want to read again and again."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"Beautiful book. I love the fabric cover. There is also a ribbon book marker in each of these books in a coordinating color!"},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"Elizabeth Gaskell's 1853 novel \\"Cranford\\" is a subtle and often sly portrait of life in a fictional mid-19th century rural English village. At the center of the novel is a circle of spinster and widowed females who wrestle mightily with the challenges of lives of genteel poverty. On its surface, \\"Cranford\\" is a comedy of manners, but its episodes have surprising and often moving depth.\\"Cranford\\" was originally published as a series of short stories, all narrated by Miss Mary Smith, a frequent visitor to the village and the young friend of its leading spinster ladies Miss Deborah and Miss Matty Jenkyns. The chapters are therefore not quite chronological in the telling; characters overlap but plot lines appear, disappear, and sometimes reappear.The narrative works through the relationships of the circle of women, as they deal with births and deaths, marriages, questions of fashion and manners, and such mundane events as a traveling magic show and a bank failure. Men are suffered to live in Cranford, but it seems that it is the women who actually arrange everything important in the village. The reader cannot help but be drawn into their lives through Gaskell's authentic dialogue and superb sense of place.\\"Cranford\\" was the basis for a Masterpiece Theater mini-series in the Spring of 2008, and is well worth reading on its own for its sympathetic portrait of a lifestyle now a distant memory. This Penguin addition includes an informative introduction by Patricia Ingram, extensive notes on 19th century customs, and a final chapter on Cranford written by Gaskell years after the original series."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"Cranford the book isn't the same as Cranford the BBC series--after all, the BBC series was based on three novellas by Elizabeth Gaskell, not just this one--but for me the book fills in details and answers questions I wished the TV show had time to go into. Among the particulars that reading Cranford the book put my mind at ease about are why Miss Mattie's brother Peter never wrote or returned home and how Martha and her beau end up married and living with Miss Mattie. Also, after watching the TV series it was a treat to have a little more time to spend with the wonderful women of Cranford in their book forms."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"As with all of the other Gaskell books I've read, this was extremely well-written and a pleasure to get lost in the time and place. It did not truly grab my interest on an emotional level until the end because the story itself was not that strong, but how interesting could it be when it revolved around the lives of a bunch of spinsters? I did enjoy reading about the mindset of that group of women and as I had known already, their focus on the trivial. But wouldn't life be great if that was all that one had to worry about. And that's the feeling I had about Cranford itself.There was a good amount of humour and some human interest lessons that proved valuable and thought provoking. The spinster character type is often portrayed in a minor or negative way and it was nice to see them in a harmless, charming light."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"Cranford is one of the better-known novels of the 19th century English writer Elizabeth Gaskell. It was first published in 1851 as a serial in the magazine Household Words, which was edited by Charles Dickens. The fictional town of Cranford is closely modelled on Knutsford in Cheshire, which Mrs. Gaskell knew well. The book has little in the way of plot and is more a series of episodes in the lives of Mary Smith and her friends, Miss Matty and Miss Deborah, two spinster sisters.But what is it about Cranford and its deceptively simple tales of country life that makes the work so appealing? It has been aptly described as \`a piece of exquisite social painting' ... \`tender' and \`delicate.' Narrated by Mary Smith, a friend of Miss Matty and frequent visitor to Cranford, the lives, loves, tragedies, and triumphs of the inhabitants of Cranford are woven together seamlessly to create a tapestry portraying timeless emotions and choices.The petty social bickering, cold shouldering and jockeying for importance in the village's pecking order are outlined in a humorous yet pointed way--the author loves her characters, with all their faults, and is tolerant of their foibles while holding them up to gentle ridicule. In every community there is an arbiter of good taste, a setter of trends, a leader of public opinion, and all the other social whimsies that make up this colourful collection of characters. It is not easy to keep secrets in this closed environment, and as Mary Smith remarks, \\"It was impossible to live a month at Cranford, and not know the daily habits of each resident ....\\" Despite the squabbles and occasional \`no speaks,' the ladies of Cranford would rather die than see one of their own fall by the wayside. It is the community spirit that inspires Miss Matty's friends to decide to donate a portion of their annual income to sustain their beloved friend when an investment goes sour.As a different kind of history book and one that very possibly the author did not set out to write as such, Cranford is actually an analysis of an early Victorian country town. The inhabitants are shaken and disturbed by inevitable changes such as industrialization, the advent of the railway and other events that force an inescapable transition into an increasingly modern world.The appeal of Cranford cannot be better described than in the popularity of the BBC drama series. The teleplay by Heidi Thomas was adapted from three novellas by Elizabeth Gaskell published between 1849 and 1858: Cranford, My Lady Ludlow, and Mr. Harrison's Confessions. (The Last Generation in England was also used as a source.)A gentle, charming read, Cranford has much more to offer the discerning reader than a unassuming look at country life."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"This was a birthday gift for my younger granddaughter.

They have small private incomes (Matty has 127 pounds a year and a pound contained a third of an ounce of gold - a new silk dress costs five pounds) and observe lives constrained by etiquette and class distinction. It has been praised for its &quot;gentle&quot; humor (although I was chilled by the &quot;Irish beggarwoman&quot; saying her children were starving who gets the door shut in her face). I think you have to have a certain interest in how life was lived in 1850 to read it through. In this edition, with the explanatory note it is mine of information on domestic arrangements. The narrator often points out how old-fashioned these ladies are and what fasions are new and draws comparisons going back over fifty years. This adds an extra dimension. The train has arrived but sedan chairs are still used. Some of the explanatory notes are written in British English that needs more explanation to Americans. The introduction by Charlotte Mitchell says a lot more about the place of this book in feminist history. Basically it is something you'd read for historical interest rather than immediate entertainment.

Would be a very good 'beach read' - nothing too taxing."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"Having recently read both Gaskell's _Mary Barton_ and _Cranford_, I was pleasantly surpised by how humorous and pleasant I found the latter to be; gladly, _Cranford_ proves that not all Victorian fiction is populated with the unfeeling wealthy and the starving poor. A charming tale of leisurely--but never idle--life in the era, the author's cunning wit and ladylike charm adorn every page. In the oddly Amazonian town of Cranford, all the men have gone off to seek their fortunes in nearby indutry or simply never were born; the ladies of Cranford, then, occupy their time with ever-modest hostessing, challenging games of Preference, and demure speculation on the comings and goings of the penny-ante gentry that breeze through their midst. The copy I read offered a quote from Mrs. Gaskell, saying that she herself often read _Cranford_ when feeling ill or sad, as it was good for cheering her flagging spirits. Any modern reader would, no doubt, reap the same mirthful benefits."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"Orginally published in Charles Dickens' magazine Household Words, _Cranford_is in fact a collection of stories about the people (mostly women)'s lives in a city called Cranford in the 19th century. It is said to be Mrs. Gaskell's most popular book, and the only book that Mrs. Gaskell herself would want to re-read again. This book is indeed full of funny, ridiculous and heartwarming stories about some old-fashioned but really friendly and kind-hearted women (mostly old maids or widows) living in this little town called Cranford. I think Mrs. Gaskell did a good job in bring up themes like the confrontation of the old and new world, the comparsion between the life in an industrial city like Drumble (believed to be based on Manchester) and the little tranquil town Cranford.

Compared to the miniseries, as expected, the book expands into more details and can be savored in many more levels.Sometimes escapism may require an action page-turner. Other times the same effect can be achieved by a slow novel about middle-aged women and their daily troubles.Pettiness and kindness, age and genders, nobles and lowborn, progress and tradition, all come together and weave the tapestry of rural middle England of the 1840's.RECOMMENDED!"},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"I would like to begin by saying that this book is very little like the PBS production that is being aired on TV right now. There are many characters that make their way into the miniseries, but many that the producers seem to have borrowed from other Gaskell novels. However, though the producers do not stick to the plot of the book, I feel they have captured the spirit of Cranford.If anyone were to ask me what this book is about, I am not quite sure what to tell them. In essence, it is a book about nothing in particular and everything meaningful in general. The key characters are elderly ladies who, like prim Amazons in middle-aged caps, look after each other and those around them. The adventures in this story are so mild, yet taken so seriously by the characters, that I was myself as excited as they were to learn that a magician had come to Cranford, or that the new fashions had arrived, or that a Lady was to marry someone quite beneath her. The most moving part of the whole story is Miss Matti's past love, a love that she sacrificed for the sake of her family. Her stories brought many tears to my eyes.Overall, I am so impressed with how such a simple story could be so altogether moving, and, quite unexpectedly, very fast paced. I read it very quickly yet I feel as if the tale will live with me forever."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"It's true that the novel \\"Cranford\\" doesn't mirror the recent Masterpiece dramatization, however this is because the adaptation was based on a series of Mrs. Gaskell's works, of which \\"Cranford\\" is only one.

Taken together, all four give a complete -and more familiar- portrait of the delightful village we saw televised. I recommend each of them highly."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"Cranford by Elizabeth Gaskell, follows the lives of a group of women living in a small English town.I enjoyed this book very much. More of a collection of stories than a novel, it reminded me of The Pickwick Papers by Charles Dickens, to whom Mrs. Gaskell pays particular homage in more than one place in the book.Like most Victorian novels, the humor is droll and significant attention is played to social class. But it is also a quick, somewhat easy read, adjectives that don't usually come to mind when describing works of this era.This is a book about women, a point that Gaskell makes clear in the first line:\\"In the first place, Cranford is in possession of the Amazons; all the holders of houses above a certain rent are women.\\"And while the middle-aged spinsters of Cranford are a far cry from the women warriors who came to the assistance of the Greeks at Troy, the stereotypical rich, handsome man who comes to marry the woman in distress and therefore saves the day is absent from this story.Told through the eyes of Mary Smith, the two main characters of the novel, Miss Deborah Jenkyns and her sister Matty, put me very much in the mind of the Miss Brownings in Gaskell's final novel, Wives and Daughters. The foibles and misadventures of these two sisters and their circle of friends often had me laughing out loud.This is a delightful book. Written at a time when a woman's worth was often tied to how well she married, the gently humorous but dignified way in which Gaskell treats her characters in this novel is lovely."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"A delightful portrait of a somnolent English village in mid-nineteenth century Midlands, striving to shut out the noisy industrializing forces changing the world as they knew it. Vivid portraits of the largely single women--spinsters or widows--who dominate the social life of the town and their struggles to control who gets invited to tea parties etc and who doesn't, their criticisms of who doesn't observe the proprieties, and their underlying good-heartedness. In other words, Gaskell observes the manners and the people of this world with great insight and wit, not just looking at struggles to define etiquette but also at the last vestiges of a peaceful rural place and the changes being thrust upon its classes--working, middle, and nobility."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"A very quick review. A beautifully written book filled with the feminine niceties and social customs of provincial early 19th Century life.

Here is an idea for Dover Press: Rename the line Dover Classics, Dover Thrift makes it sound like a book you buy at a Goodwill for a quarter- have some class, some pride- after all you are publishing classics.Gaskell was a well known literary figure in her day- she wrote non-fiction as well as fiction, including a biography of her homie Charlotte Bronte. Even though this is a book putatively about small town genteel widows and matrons, the timely references to characters being enthralled by Dickens Pickwick Papers (one of the few men in the novel is hit by a train because he is standing on the platform, so enthralled by the latest installment of Pickwick that he is slow too alert a child stuck on the tracks.)Elizabeth Gaskell in fact chose to be known as \\"Mrs. Gaskell\\" to the point that contemporary editions of Cranford read \\"by Mrs. Gaskell.\\" Although Cranford is not exactly what you call \\"action intense,\\" it is well observed, and at 130 pages you can read through it in a couple hours. Gaskell's country matrons don't sparkle with the life of those of Stendahl's the Red and the Black, but she does an equal job of portraying a specific time and place (the 1830s) from a vantage point twenty years in the the future (published 1852.)In the end Gaskell's genteel spinsters come together to save the day in the manner of a book like \\"the Little Women,\\" it's a bit TOO pat of an ending but hey it's just a minor classic, nowhatimean?"},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"A lovely book about a lovely village of lovely people. The inspiration for BBC/Masterpiece Classic's Cranford and Return to Cranford. I read this book in only a few nights and enjoyed it thoroughly. The glossary/notes regarding material culture (clothing, terminology, expressions) are not always correct (based on my own research and experience as an historic interpreter), but most of the information was new to me and referred to books and events of which I was unaware. I'm glad I watched the tv series first, including \\"The Making of Cranford,\\" before reading the book; it made clear how and why the series was created as it was. That being said, the book is charming and should be read by all high school students, especially female students, to understand that they are not so very different after all."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"For those expecting the book and PBS Mini-series of the same name to mirror each other, your expectations will probably fall short. Although the book is very well written, it is definitely not light reading, and requires a great degree of concentration to understand the ins and outs of the plot - the characters are intertwined, but it is sometimes hard to remember how they relate to one another.Overall, this book is a good, classical tale, but not recommended for bedtime reading! Strong coffee and concentration is needed!"},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"i chose this book because i liked it on tv and wondered what the 'raw material' was like. The book is a series of vignettes, a little repetitive but humorous and i assume, nicely observed.

The show does not go strictly by the plot in the book but it is close. I liked it but not everyone would. It is English and interesting and the satire is sometimes not immediately apparent. It creeps up on you and you laugh later."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"I was disappointed with the quality of the book (not the story). I had expected a regular-size paperback (I failed to notice the dimensions when I ordered) and find this size unwieldy and floppy. It also apparently is a \\"print on demand\\" version and contains errors. I have not finished reading the book because of this and would not order this particular item again."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"Let me just say that I don't remember which cover is on my Cranford book so I don't know that this is the correct issue. I have read this work however and enjoyed it immensely. It is most amusing and I must say that some of Gaskell's works are deep compared to some classic novelists. I felt this had a little of everything. I'd suggest a read if you want to be ready for watching any TV adaptation."},{"Title":"Marriage and sexual harmony","review":"This quaint little booklet has much more to it than the amusingly retro title - it is one of the best writings I have come across on the subject of developing sexual harmony in a committed relationship. It was originally written in 1931 and has several minor limitations (modern birth control had not yet been invented), but that is also one of its strengths - there is much we can learn from the perspectives of that time. Yes, people had sex in 1931. Another limitation is a cultural bias - but he has valid insights onto relationships that can be taken separately from his cultural biases. This booklet (and, I imagine, the other works on the topic by the author) is extremely worthwhile for anyone in a committed sexual relationship, and for young people, as a great counterpoint to junk culture's ridiculous misportrayal of sexuality. Three cheers for Oliver Butterfield!"},{"Title":"Classic French Course in English: Chautauqua Course 1890-91 (The After-School Series)","review":"I have to admit that I got this book thinking that it is a book on how to learn French! This is a quite pedantic book on 'comparative literature on French language', although quite captivating even for me, not knowing the language. I learnt that although French is a very rich language - the poetry part of the language is comparatively weak. There are discussions on a variety of 'Classic French Authors', the operative word being 'Classic' which means authors from a much older period. The authors are listed in the beginning after a short introduction of the book. The introduction itself is very informative, and I gained a good knowledge of the origin of the language. Among the authors listed, it turned out, that I am familiar with some of them. So I read on with interest. The writing is very scholarly yet understandable and for a student in comparative literature the writing is very helpful and informative. Overall I had a positive experience with the book. Next time I will make sure that the book I am getting is about learning French!!Book-loverAmazon verified purchase"},{"Title":"Classic French Course in English: Chautauqua Course 1890-91 (The After-School Series)","review":"I purchased this thinking it was a course in learning how to speak French.

The photographs by Marshall and Kramer have been in print since the dawn of time, a big disappionment from those two photographers. Barry Fienstein was along for most of the 5/66 tour and his pictures are mostly brand new and very very exiting. I was a little disappionted by the lack of preformance pictures included, but that's a minor gripe. Overall an essential picture book for any Dylan fan, new or old.Note: Barry Feinstein's pictures graced the booklet that went with the CD &quot;Bob Dylan, Live 1966&quot;. He could have easily made a much, much more exiting book if all the &quot;standard&quot; pictures from Kramer and Marshall were replaced by more of Feinstein's unseen amazing photographs."},{"Title":"Early Dylan, Photographs and Introduction by Barry Feinstein, Daniel Kramer and Jim Marshall","review":"I agree with the other reviewer about this book. I've seen most of the work by Marshall &amp; Kramer. Not to take away from them but the work by Feinstein was primarally new to me(except for the Live 66 photography) and i only wish there was more of his work. All and all, though, a great book of photographs of a true artist."},{"Title":"Physical Chemistry (Books for Professionals)","review":"This book is great because it not only has slews of practical problems but great derivations too.

It covers a 2 semester course & has practice midterms and finals for both semesters."},{"Title":"Surrender","review":"This book challenged me to give God more - but in a new way. Before I read this book I was often giving God my time and money, letting Him rearrange my priorities and habits as if these acts of surrender were a painful sacrifice. I learned as I read through these pages that such surrender is no sacrifice, but rather my obvious response to Jesus who gave His all for me.As I understoond what it meant to be a &quot;bondservant&quot; of Christ, I realized that what I signed up for when I came to Christ was the &quot;school of surrender&quot;. It should come as no surprise when he asks for more and more of my heart. And as I yield happily, not under obligation, but out of love and by faith, even the earthly rewards are indescribable. I am so grateful that Miss De Moss wrote this book!"},{"Title":"Surrender","review":"I love it when God sends the right book at the right time, and that is exactly what happened with \\"Surrender\\". I think there are times in my life that I understood what surrendering to Christ meant, and I think I have given Him all. While reading \\"Surrender\\", I realized that surrendering is a journey. There are always deeper levels of selfishness to overcome. Surrender doesn't necessarily mean giving something up outwardly first, but it it starts with the bowing of the knee so to speak in our heart to Christ. I also realized that the more I try to hold onto and control even the smallest of things, that I ultimately come under bondage to it, and it becomes one more burden to carry. Christ wants to carry our burdens, and live in a life of peace. Surrender is the only answer.I will definitely recommend this book to my friends, and keep a copy for myself to look at in the future. It is truly a valuable book. I would also highly recommend \\"Surrender\\" for a small group, or a book club. DeMoss has a discussion guide at the back of the book for each chapter. It is a fairly easy read, that could be covered in eight weeks."},{"Title":"Surrender","review":"Addresses very specifically the needs of tramatized and inocent victims who are searching for emotional, spiritual, and practical answers about where they have been. It will bring spiritual wholeness into view without preaching down, judgement, or self-rightous indignation.

I loved her specific examples of behavior and then scripture applications for it, such as:\\"When your flesh wants to pass along a critical report about another believer, and the Spirit says, \\"Speak evil of no one\\" (Titus 3:2) bow your head and surrender to God.\\"or\\"When your flesh wants to lashout in anger, and the Spirit says, \\"Clothe [yourself] with compassion,kindness, humility, gentleness and patience. Bear with one another...\\" (Collosians #:12-13 NIV), bow your head and surrender to God.\\"Asking personal questions like: \\"Have you devoted to Christ \\"the whole of your life, \\" or are you merely giving Him your \\"spare evenings\\"?Or Have \\"you chose friendship with God over all human relationships, earthy attachments, and visible security\\"?She gives an excellant example of what surrender looks like by going through the song My Life by Frances Ridley Havergal, the one that starts with \\"take my life, and let it be consecrated, Lord, to thee...\\" This alone is worth reading the book for.It's great convicting stuff even for wonderful mature-in-the-Lord Christians (which I am not compared to the friend who gave me this to read). It's a book I'll read again and save for my daughter."},{"Title":"Surrender","review":"Excellent little book. Some of the concepts that challenged me was the excerpt written by a communist supporter and his commitment to his cause and how the author compared that to our commitment to our Gospel cause. It really made me examine my passion for Christ. The second was the contrast between being a slave for Jesus vs. being a servant. Take your time and absorb it in."},{"Title":"Surrender","review":"This is an excellent book. I haven't read it all yet, but if you have asked Jesus to be your Savior, you should understand that He also needs to be your Lord - and that's Lord over everything! This book gives great insights to some of the things we hold back from God which really need to be relinquished. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Surrender","review":"Wow! What an incredible eye opener of how to truly let go and let God!"},{"Title":"Surrender","review":"Jesus is both Savior and Lord. Contrary to one popular teaching, it is impossible to call Jesus Savior while denying His Lordship. Genuine salvation is marked by a profession of faith followed by a life lived in surrender to Christ's authority. If that does not describe your life, then there are only two dangerous possibilities: you are a rebellious child of God or you are not really a child of God. In Surrender: The Heart God Controls, Nancy Leigh DeMoss encourages women to examine their hearts and raise their white flags in glad surrender to God's authority.Paul writes in his letter to the church at Philippi that they are to continue in obedience and work out their own salvation with fear and trembling (2:12). He would write the same thing to us today because the same God is willing and working in us for His good pleasure. He is the ruler of all creation, and the sooner we surrender to His authority over our lives the more blessed we will be. \\"Surrender is the source and means of true freedom and fullness,\\" writes DeMoss. The points at which we refuse to surrender to Him, believing ourselves to be free, will also be the very points at which we are ruled, not by our Father, but by sin and misery.If we would be completely free from sin and living at peace with God, then we must end our battle with him and accept His terms of surrender. He requires nothing less than surrender that is lifelong and unconditional. DeMoss shares her unique testimony in this regard: she came to faith in Christ as a four-year-old child and slowly, but surely, grew in her awareness that her life belonged to God. \\"As my faith has matured,\\" she writes, \\"I have faced many situations that have required a fresh affirmation and expression of that initial surrender to the will of God. Most of those instances have been simply the daily choices to obey the Word of God and promptings of His Spirit.\\" The Lord is patient with His children as He guides us in the ongoing process of sanctification. The key is that we have that initial moment in which we declare unconditional surrender to God. DeMoss explains this as the signing of a blank contract. She references several well-known Christians who signed blank contracts with God to follow Him no matter what it cost them. John Wesley's \\"Covenant Prayer\\" may be familiar:I am no longer my own, but thine.Put me to what thou wilt, rank me with whom thou wilt.Put me to doing, put me to suffering.Let me be employed by thee or laid aside for thee,Exalted for thee or brought low by thee.Let me be full, let me be empty.Let me have all things, let me have nothing.I freely and heartily yield all things to thy pleasure and disposal.And now, O glorious and blessed God,Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,Thou art mine, and I am thine. So be it.And the covenant which I have made on earth,Let it be ratified in heaven. Amen.The Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments offer several word pictures that resemble this kind of commitment: the burnt offering, the bond slave, living sacrifices, and marriage. God does not impose a one-size-fits-all policy when it comes to surrender. The sacrifices he calls for will vary in size and degree, but all will be complete. Jesus is our example of perfect surrender and sacrifice; therefore, our own sacrifices are reasonable.That is not to say that we may not be fearful when we consider where God may lead, but, like Abraham, we overcome that fear with faith. DeMoss points out that the altar of surrender is a recurring symbol in the life of Abraham. Our journeys will not be very different. We will learn to revisit God's promises to us in His word, we will grow in our knowledge of Him and His character, and our faith will be strengthened as a result.In addition to sharing what the Bible teaches regarding surrender, DeMoss offers straightforward questions to help the reader inventory those areas of her life that may not be fully surrendered to God. DeMoss includes My Life, My Time, My Tongue, My Mind, and My Affections, to list a few. While no two Christians' lives are going to look exactly alike, there are a variety of areas that are common sticking points for believers when it comes to surrender, like spending habits, possessions, children, and addictive habits, loss of parents, personal opinions and personal comfort.The most important question to ask is, Am I seeking to know and follow the will of God in every area of my life? With the help of the Holy Spirit, DeMoss can help the reader discern how well she is following Paul's encouragement to work out her own salvation with fear and trembling. Though she presents a strong challenge, DeMoss writes with sympathy and grace. While reading, it feels as though she understands where I am, she understands that there are areas that I'd rather not surrender, yet she is not so soft that I can still feel comfortable with disobedience. She shares the stories of several Christian men and women, encouraging the reader to follow their example, but also making the book very interesting. In addition to the study guide, DeMoss includes questions and exercises for further reflection at the end of every chapter.I unreservedly recommend this book to Christian women. It is perfect for small groups. I'd also consider it for use in one-on-one discipleship with your mature 17-18 year old students."},{"Title":"Surrender","review":"concise, factual, opens the heart to Gods perfect will, makes it ok to be under control of God - we americans are tooooo independent, self possessed, conceited- wonderful book"},{"Title":"Surrender","review":"10 of us are doing a Bible study using this book and are enjoying it very much.

They uncover clues leading back to an 18th century bandit, and object of local folk legend named 'El Diablo'. The legend says El Diablo used the cave in Moaning Valley as his hideout, and disappeared into the cave 80 years ago... But suddenly there are stories that he's returned! The cave gives off an errie moan that terrifies anyone who hears it. The boys do a bit of scuba diving, and see an odd creature in the water on the western bank of the mountain where El Diablo's cave is located. The conclusion is both satisfying, and fun as they tie up all loose ends, and help the authorities solve a mystery at the same time. I re-read this story to my 6 year old son last month - still one of my favorites in the series."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock and the three investigators in The mystery of the moaning cave (Alfred Hitchcock mystery series)","review":"The Mystery of the Stolen DiamondsThat is the title that I think this book should be because there is another mystery going on at the same time that eventually involves the Three Investigators with the mystery of the moaning cave.

The story is very interesting, but marred by its alterations of history.The story would be appealing to a high school boy with an interest in the Middle Ages. Background books for advanced readers could be Costain's Magnificent Century, Runciman's Sicilian Vespers, and vol. 3 of Runciman's History of the Crusades"},{"Title":"The Right Kind of War","review":"As a personal friend of Jim Rosevelt, in later life, the book caught my attention. The book is well written. I wish it could have included some of the first hand stories, he spoke of, during some of our family get togethers. The book portrays the heavy loss of life that occurred during those years to take the pacific islands. I would reread it, and plan to do just that."},{"Title":"The Right Kind of War","review":"This book is basicly a memoir written as fiction of service with the Marine Raiders and later with the 4th Marines. The accounts of jungle patrols are very intense and the discription of the battle of Sugar Loaf Hill on Okinawa is a pure nightmare. The book gives a good account of WWII Raider training and operations. At times, while describing camp life, the humour seems a bit strained.If this book had come out twenty or thirty years earilar it would have been a classic, better than the exellent \\"Battle Cry.\\" This a great Marine book, and an inside look at Raider life."},{"Title":"The Right Kind of War","review":"This will be one you will want to add to your book shelf as it is a book that really deserves a couple of good readings. The author tells a compelling tale of battle, the Marines and the war in the Pacific. It is accounts like this one that enable us to increase our understanding of those times, those of us who were not actually there. I highly recommend this one."},{"Title":"The Right Kind of War","review":"This is an interesting book, one of those curiosities that get written now and then. It's only about 10 years old: the writer was a veteran of World War II who had a successful career teaching English in Universities, and then teaching people to write after retiring. As a very young man, McCormick served in the U.S. Marine Corps, and fought on various Pacific islands, from Emirau to Guam to Okinawa. He fights with first a Tommy gun and later a BAR, serving in a platoon as a simple Marine and later becomes a squad leader. The book is written as if the author's telling you a bunch of stories, which are sorted in chronological order.The author can write very well. The main character is a bit of a cipher, but the other characters in the story are especially well-done and amusing. Bill Werden, a Scout/Sniper, wanders in and out of the story, killing Japanese soldiers, fighting with other Marines, and on one occasion, rescuing an orphaned baby. The story isn't constructed as chapters; instead, it's almost as if the author were presenting them as short stories with similar characters and themes.I enjoyed this book a great deal, and would recommend it. I don't know if Mr. McCormick has a second book in him, but I'm glad he wrote this first one."},{"Title":"The Right Kind of War","review":"This book is by far one of the best books I have read in my life. It depicts one mans accounts of world war II, written in a way that the average person just wont hear from a vet. They have tendencies not to talk about their experiences, and this book allows someone who has never been in that situation, to be able to experience it through John's eyes. Awesome read, and I highly recommend."},{"Title":"The Right Kind of War","review":"I picked up this book for my father, but took time to read it before passing it on... Wow, great story that sucks you in immediately. I can't imagine being involved in a war like our soldiers in WWII were.

As a veteran (in peacetime), I really appreciate what those who serve in a time of war go through!"},{"Title":"Beautiful Engines: Treasures of the Internal Combustion Century","review":"I loved this book.

This book would be a great addition to your old iron library. Awesome!"},{"Title":"Star Wars Roleplaying Game (Second Edition, Revised and Expanded)","review":"Reviewer's note: There are actually TWO different versions of the second edition of this book, and book sellers VERY OFTEN confuse the two and list them in the wrong place (so it is best to always ask beforehand to be safe). For this reason, I have included this review under both the 1992 and 1996 versions of this book (so please excuse me if you see it more than once). However, since I didn't know where most buyers would start, I figured it was best to provide this information under all relevant locations to be safe. That said:This is the classic D6 version of the Star Wars Roleplaying game. If you are reading this, you likely already know of have heard that the West End Games version of Star Wars The Roleplaying Game is excellent (many people don't know this, but this is actually the basis for the newer Star Wars D20 RPG and Minis games, though many people think the original D6 version is even better). And this book is no exception (especially the 1996 version -- see below). This one book contains pretty much everything both the player and the GM need to play (though there are lots of great supplements -- including premade adventures -- you can use if you are interested and can find them). The book begins with a very nice \\"Player Section\\" that covers everything the player needs to know about creating and playing a character. The rest of the book is for the GM. For example, the \\"Gamemaster Section\\" covers all the basics that the GM needs to know run an adventure (including rules, combat and injuries, movement, space travel, the Force, etc.). There is also an \\"Adventure Section\\" (contains tons of ideas about designing adventures) and a \\"Universe Section\\" (provides tons of detail about GM characters, aliens/monsters, weapons/equipment/vehicles, droids, planets, etc). Finally, there are several appendices (with reference charts and character templates). In sum, if you are interested in giving this game a try, you can do so as both a player and a GM with this one book!In addition to providing the above information about the book, I also wanted to make an important point of clarification re: the two different versions of the second edition of this book.The first version of this book is simply subtitled \\"Second Edition\\" -- this one was released in 1992 (WEG40055 -- ISBN = 0-87431-181-0), and has a mostly blue cover with a picture of Darth Vader in a square on the front. This is still a fun book to read (and usually costs a lot less than the 1996 version). But, it DOES NOT contain the latest/final version of the rules. Further, thought the production quality is excellent, it is not quite as good as the 1996 version.The second version is subtitled \\"Second Edition: Revised and Expanded\\" -- this one was released in 1996 (WEG40120 -- ISBN = 0-87431-268-X). It is also a hardcover, and has a picture of the Millennium Falcon racing through space while being fired upon by several TIE fighters. This book DOES contain the latest/final rules for this game. Further, the production quality is excellent, and it is printed in full color on high quality semi-gloss paper.YOU DO NOT NEED BOTH VERSIONS OF THIS BOOK. If you just want to get a feel for the game and save a little money, buy the 1992 edition. In fact, if this is the case it may be worth buying the original first edition (which was released in 1987, and is also excellent and reasonably priced). However, if you want the latest/final version of the rules, than the 1996 edition is a must (it costs more, but I think it is worth it)."},{"Title":"Star Wars Roleplaying Game (Second Edition, Revised and Expanded)","review":"I have been playing the Star Wars roleplaying game for well over 5 years now, and I have read all three of the 'master rule books.' This one was vastly superior to the other two. They colored in the vital information, leaving examples unshaded for fast entry into the game. And they put in examples of every single point in the game. The combat rules were all encompassing as well, and very rarely do I need to ad lib some rules because the 'book didn't mention it.' The only thing I must say I did not like about this version, was the lack of a 'chart page' were basically all of the example tables were listed, and the master skill list. Both of these were in the at least the first Second Edition book. The addition of full color images was also a nice touch, and makes for an excellent coffee table book, even though the words get in the way alot if you use it for that purpose. All in all one of the best RPG books I have ever read, the only thing it lacked was the comical undertones of the Men in Black RPG book."},{"Title":"Star Wars Roleplaying Game (Second Edition, Revised and Expanded)","review":"The Star Wars Role Playing Game is great for fans of both Star Wars and Role Playing.

I mean \\"The Book\\" as my friends and I call it... I'm serious. If you love star wars, and you love either games or acting, this is what you need, plus six sided dice, paper, and the pencil you will have to have to play this game. It's not all mindless action the way D&D is! It has a lot of social interaction, teamwork, and problem solving! But it still has action! It's just not omnipresent is all. The action is very cinematic, giving a true starwars feel to it. You play bold heroes who actually have statistics AND personality!!! This game is very well designed. And it's so easy to modify too if your a big fan of house rules. This game has been a favorite of mine for about 7 years. Don't pass this one up."},{"Title":"Star Wars Roleplaying Game (Second Edition, Revised and Expanded)","review":"I've been with SWRPG ever since 2nd Edition came out, and I have to say that the R&amp;E book is well worth the investment. It clears up a lot of grey areas that were present in the 2nd Edition book and has much greater resources from a beginning gamer's point of view. It also offers many fresh perspectives to those who have some experience with the game. All around, a worthwhile purchase."},{"Title":"Star Wars Roleplaying Game (Second Edition, Revised and Expanded)","review":"I have to say that this book is excellent for begginers since it uses the simple d6 system(six sided dice) the book is very specific in listing what to do if such and such a thing happens.

Like I said, this is a great book to learn with."},{"Title":"Star Wars Roleplaying Game (Second Edition, Revised and Expanded)","review":"This book is a really good RPG, and holds true to the Star Wars books and movies as much as an RPG can be expected to.

It has low violence."},{"Title":"Star Wars Roleplaying Game (Second Edition, Revised and Expanded)","review":"I have no idea what possessed me to dish out 30 bucks for this book, but let me tell you now, it's beyond worth it. This game is perfect for begginner Role Playing Gamers, with an easy to learn D6 (six sided dice) system. The book is clean, colorful, and easy to read. It teaches you how to play, create adventures, and lots more. Probably the best part of the book is the numerous examples of gameplay. Give the author a pat on the back for that, time after time in other RPGs Ive been annoyed by the lack of examples of play. No need to worry here, there is an example for almost every skill or rule in the game, so you don't have to second guess the book's quality. For experienced, and beginner role players, you MUST get this game, and have hours of fun playing it."},{"Title":"Star Wars Roleplaying Game (Second Edition, Revised and Expanded)","review":"I have been playing the game for three years, and have a library of books only on the RPG. I have the basic second edition book, and while the &quot;revised and expanded&quot; version is more user friendly, has more pictures, and covers information that used to be found only in scourcebooks, it does have some flaws. The skills are difficult to locate, and it's not as easy to read because of the lay out. Also, some of the minor rules are difficult to find, and some I couldn't find at all (Rules for healing with out the use of a medpac for example). I'm sure they're in there somewhere, I just couldn't find them. For a Star Wars Fan, it's a good 4 or 5 star book. For the gamer, I'd still stick with my old 2nd edition."},{"Title":"Star Wars Roleplaying Game (Second Edition, Revised and Expanded)","review":"Of all the Roleplaying games out, i was glad to see one that successfully game from a movie universe.

It doesnt hold to the Star Wars movies and a lot of the in game facts were just thrown together by the people at West End Games, with little or NO research into the Movies or Offical Movie Novels. The rules may be easy to learn but the over all game turns out to be as messy as a soup sandwich! One 'Fact' the game states is that only Jedi may use Lightsabres, when in fact Kenobi says that they were once in wide spread use and STILL are in some parts of the galaxy! And sadly there are a 100 more errors like that in the gaming book which shouldnt be!So if you want to play an easy to learn RPG this IS your what you are looking for... But if you want a true 'Star Wars' gaming experience you should look else where . I have many bones to pick with the nuts at WEGs, lets just hope those friendly people at Wizards of the Coast(makers of AD&amp;D) do a better job on the up coming release of the NEW Star Wars Role-playing game System!"},{"Title":"Star Wars Roleplaying Game (Second Edition, Revised and Expanded)","review":"I picked up this book about a year ago and I have yet to be dissapointed. The format is really easy to get into with the narrative intros and highlighted basics so that you can start your adventure as soon as you want. For all Star Wars fans, (inluding the nitpickers, who need to relax) and roleplayers who want more than just guns and trolls. P.S. Hey Bradley, keep up with the times before you mock others.

When mine was destroyed, I was skeptical of this more expensive clone. It IS a little different; however, superlatively well designed and with stunning graphics that left me, as a Star Wars fan, wishing I would have fed my dog the old book earlier. Full colour original drawings and screen shots from the movies, along with quick start text, make this great for beginners. Players may enjoy the more detailed descriptions of weapons, skills and equipment. However, for the seasoned veteran of Imperial Combat, the poor arrangement and over simplification of rules can be frustrating. The Choose-Your-Own-Adventure type game intro is 'Dog Lame,' but the parody advertisements are cool enough to hang in the den."},{"Title":"Star Wars Roleplaying Game (Second Edition, Revised and Expanded)","review":"I've been playing the Star Wars RPG since 1989, and this edition of the game is the best ever. Not only is it easy for a first-time gamer to read and understand, it builds on and expands the material for more experienced gamers. Unlike earlier editions, this book includes plenty of starship, vehicle, equipment, and character data to allow a novice game master to host a session without a library of Star Wars RPG books. Also, its rules are streamlined from the first printing of the 2nd Edition (most noteworthy are a simplified scaling system for large vehicles vs. smaller ones and a quicker and more flexible round sequence). Most importantly, the format is much better for learning and finding information; for example, all equipment, vehicles, and droids are toward the back, while all character creation chapters are clustered at the front.As an avid roleplaying gamer of many years experience, both familiar with the classics and open to the newer systems, I have to give Star Wars: RPG the highest rating of all. For simplicity and capturing the Star Wars spirit, there is none better."},{"Title":"Star Wars Roleplaying Game (Second Edition, Revised and Expanded)","review":"Star Wars... those who love it REALLY love it! The chance to roleplay in the star wars setting is great, and I'm pleased to say that this book offers the perfect entry point. Experienced and new players alike will find it's chatty, light hearted style easy to swallow and packed with information. The book breaks down the rules and processes of creating a character and writing adventures into manageable chunks, and never loses sight of its source material, emphasising plot and character over dice and tables. Don't be put off by the &quot;Inconsistencies&quot; mentioned in some reviews- they are tiny, and mostly due to Lucasfilm's tendency to alter or contradict itself on points that aren't considered &quot;canon&quot;, ie. the stuff in the actual movies.The advice and information within far outweigh these niggles.

When I hit junior high my childhood best friend introduced me to this cool game his brother, Bill, wrote called Star Wars Roleplaying Game: Second edition, and I never looked back. Since then (I am now 31), I have owned, ran, and played every edition of the Star Wars rpg ever published, even being privileged enough to have Bill run a couple sessions for us. These books were so influencial to thep (then) fledgling expanded universe that a stack of West End Games supplements were handed to Timothy Zahn as research material for his Thrawn Trilogy. WotC did a good job of carrying the torch for a period after WEG went bankrupt, and now Fantasy Flight Games has created the true successor to Bill's narrative heavy baby, but this edition, specifically this copy (revised and expanded) captured the feel and grandeur of a galaxy far far away better than anything since.

He disturbs all the residents of the Abbey with his screaming nightmares so is taken to serve under the guidance of Brother Mark, at the Leprosarium of St. Giles. While helping the patients gather firewood in the nearby forest, he discovers the burned body of a murdered cleric who had recently been an overnight guest at his father's manor, and who had been declared missing for a short time. Meriet's father has never had any time for him as his elder brother Nigel was the apple of his parent's eyes and could do no wrong. The mystery evolves with Cadfael, as usual, methodically sifting through red herrings and true clues, with the help of his friend, Deputy Sherriff, Hugh Beringar. It's another fine Cadfael story, linked very closely with the political history and unrest of the day."},{"Title":"The Devil's Novice : The Eighth Chronicle of Brother Cadfael","review":"This is my second foray into the Brother Cadfael Mystery series and this book did nothing to dampen my initial enthusiasm for the series. Most of the comments from my previous review (see The Leper of Saint Giles) apply here as well. In particular, I enjoyed the mix of romance and mystery. Once again, this book delves into themes of unrequited love and also explores the mystery of feminine allure (even among the celibate).Brother Cadfael is a uniquely endearing character, with his mix of gentleness, worldly wisdom, and competence. This book also provided my first introduction to Hugh Beringar, sheriff Shrewsbury. He and Cadfael join together their several talents to make an unbeatable team.My only complaint is that this book takes a little while to get into, as it plows through the political and religious background necessary to understanding the plot. All in all, though, it is worth, as the reader will end up both entertained by the story and educated by the history."},{"Title":"The Devil's Novice : The Eighth Chronicle of Brother Cadfael","review":"The big mystery throughout this eighth of Ellis Peters' Chronicles of Brother Cadfael is not really who, in the depths of the Salop countryside one day in the late summer of the year of Our Lord 1140, committed murder most foul upon the person of Peter Clemence, cleric to Bishop Henry of Bois - but why! And also just what the connection might be between the unfortunate demise of a harmless cleric - seemingly not even relieved of his valuables - and the latest candidate to be accepted into the noviciate of Shrewsbury's abbey of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, the nineteen-year-old, Meriet Aspley. For it is obvious, from the very opening of this book, to both reader and Brother Cadfael alike, that there is some dark secret haunting the latest entrant to the abbey. There is also little doubt that the sad fate of Peter Clemence has some bearing upon it. Equally obvious is that the mediaeval sleuth will need to have not only his wits but also all of his tact about him too, if he is to winkle out the truth behind matters here, both of the circumstances of the cleric's death and of young Meriet Aspley's sudden-found yearning for life within the cloister.In her usual manner, Ellis Peters drip-feeds her hero and her readers alike with tantalising but measured trickles of information, permitting both to proceed but piecemeal (and at about the same pace as each other) towards the final revelation and the story's sudden resolution. Along the way, we are treated to the author's characteristically over-glamorised view of Mediaeval English life, with her entirely comforting (and rather touching) view of the honest goodness of the (Saxon) poor, as well as the essentially corrupt nature of those who would aspire to power (usually those overbearing Normans, of course).In common with others of this series, this book presents a mix of romance and murder mystery, all set against a back-drop of political intrigue. In essence, then, we have here another classic from the Cadfael mould - an engaging read that taxes neither imagination nor credulity over much and which provides some fascinating glimpses of how things might have been in twelfth century Salop. It can be recommended to both established Cadfael fans and newcomers alike."},{"Title":"The Devil's Novice : The Eighth Chronicle of Brother Cadfael","review":"\\"They say there's a devil at him in his sleep, and it was he brought it here among them, and who knows which of them it will prey on next? The devil's novice, I've heard him called. Oh, I put a stop to that, at least aloud. But it's what they're thinking.\\"- Brother Paul, master of novices\\"The devil is always the intruder, the stranger, the one who is different. Every successive wave of newcomers from the mainland of Europe, either from the north or the east, was the very devil in its day.\\"- from SHROPSHIRE: A MEMOIR OF THE ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDEWhile Abbot Radulfus questions the wisdom of accepting novices too young to know what they're giving up, he has no objection to a young man past nineteen entering the cloister of his own free will. Meriet Aspley, younger son of the Norman lord of Aspley, seems like a straightforward proposition: a younger son, perhaps seeking a career rather than a vocation, but surely none the worse for that as long as he strives to be a credit to the order. But Brother Paul, for one, is uneasy about him, having never before seen a postulant pursue his vows with such determination but so little joy.By day, Meriet is all dutiful obedience, studying hard and petitioning to have his probationary term shortened, but by night he wakes the entire monastic household with violent nightmares. He's never served in the armies of either king or empress and seen little of violence save on the hunt, yet the mere sight of a fellow novice struck unconscious by a freak accident sends him into shaken silence. On the other hand, a run-in with Brother Jerome over a keepsake from a red-haired girl suggests other kinds of passion running in Meriet: not only a thwarted love for his elder brother's betrothed, but a hot temper when he tries to defend his trophy from Jerome.Meanwhile Hugh Beringar pursues the disappearance of another cleric connected with the Aspley household: Peter Clemence, envoy from the Bishop of Winchester to the great lords of Chester and Lincoln and cousin to Meriet, last seen spending the night at Aspley on his way north. Why should a priest disappear at the same time the youngest son of the household was seized with a sudden urge to enter the cloister?Very tidy mystery here, particularly since Meriet is given to speaking the literal truth under interrogation, so the reader has a certain amount of evidence to work with.Particularly nice touches:- Meriet attempting to strangle Brother Jerome.- The three most formidable members of the Aspley household: Meriet, his father Leoric, and his father's ward Isouda, who's confident that he will be hers in the end.- How Brother Mark gains a patron for his studies to enter the priesthood (after this book, he doesn't return until SUMMER OF THE DANES).- Radulfus' consultations with various senior brothers on the issue of accepting children into the order.- Character development of Brother Paul, the master of novices.As always, I recommend the unabridged recording narrated by Stephen Thorne."},{"Title":"The Devil's Novice : The Eighth Chronicle of Brother Cadfael","review":"Of all the 16 or 17 Brother Cadfael mysteries that I've read, this is probably the best, not only for the intriguing twists and turns of its cpmplex plot, but even more for Ellis Peters' keen insights into human emotions and her warm appreciation for the young hero whom she has created."},{"Title":"The Devil's Novice : The Eighth Chronicle of Brother Cadfael","review":"Ellis Peters pokes sly fun at actions of the young in THE DEVILS NOVICE and uses Father Jerome to spike the tales.

I had forgotten what a really good writer she was.I found \\"The Devil's Novice\\" an entertaining companion for snowy winter days when I'm at home. The plot is excellent--I was indeed as interested in why the priest was murdered as by whom.Peters' blending of historical events into her story and her descriptions of the 12th century English countryside are excellent as well.The love story is rather saccharine however, and more people recover from their injuries than might have been the case in medieval England.Still, this is a novel and a most enjoyable one. Ellis Peters had a great hero in Brother Cadfael and a marvelous command of the English language. Long may her books live."},{"Title":"The Devil's Novice : The Eighth Chronicle of Brother Cadfael","review":"Meriet Aspley comes to the Abbey of St. Peter and St. Paul as a novice, and Brother Cadfael wonders at the cold parting the 19-year-old has with his father. He also wonders at the boy's almost frantic insistence that he wants to take final vows sooner than is customary. Meriet does not fit in well with the Abbey's other novices; he keeps to himself, and then he disrupts everyone's sleep with screaming nightmares. Soon the other boys are calling him the Devil's Novice, and the day comes when he physically assaults a monk whom he believes is violating his privacy. Abbot Radulphus charges Cadfael with learning as much as he can about Meriet's life before the Abbey, in hope of helping the young man who seems to have no vocation but who is so determined to take vows nevertheless. Cadfael's questioning of the boy's family and friends does little but deepen the mystery, until a chance discovery turns the puzzlement of Meriet into a murder investigation.This eighth entry in the Brother Cadfael series does a fine job of exploring the dynamics of a family in which the second son is barely noticed, eclipsed by a firstborn who seems to be everything a parent could want. Meriet himself presents a mystery, one that engaged me long before the murder came to light. Ellis Peters excels at character study, and this novel is a particularly fine example of that skill.--Reviewed by Nina M.

Perhaps I thought that by the word 'teach' in the title, that it would assist, but in fact, it didn't at all. If anything, it made me wonder why I was attempting to start this instrument so late in life!"},{"Title":"Violin Playing as I Teach It","review":"This little gem of a book reads like a tip book, expose, soapbox, gossip column and memoir. Auer is witty and funny, sometimes he had me laughing in stitches. For example, his description of chronic vibrato, \\"this physical evil generally may be traced to a group of sick or ailing nerves, hitherto undiscovered.\\" Another diatribe on the lack of standards for violin teachers: \\"Many are indeed desirous of doing their best, but alas, having themselves been ill-taught, they spread the poison of their own ignorance broadcast, a plague which carries off many hapless innocents, victims of their pernicious teaching methods.\\"Auer was in the position to learn from, observe, and teach some of the best violinists of the last two centuries. He studied with Jacob Dont in Vienna and Joachim in Hanover, was a contemporary of Davidov, Wieniawski, Seidel, Wilhelmj, Sarasate, von Bulow, and taught Elman, Zimbalist, and Jascha Heifetz. Who would have known that Joachim had such stage fright, or that Mischa Elman almost died of coal-gas fumes the night before his debut?The book has nice tips on fingering, bowing and tone production. He also devotes a chapter to nuance, the soul of interpretation and phrasing and another chapter to Style, where he wisely suggests that each generation interprets the music to suit the style of that era. No one really knows how Bach played baroque music, and no one can claim to be authentic to a time period that has long since passed away. \\"The musical spirit of Bach transcends all narrow limitations of period, and the artist of today who truly enters into this spirit will play Bach as he should be played, and will play Bach better because he will play him in the interpretative spirit of our own generation, not that of 1720.\\" He deplores the blind upholders of \\"tradition\\" and insists that the violinist must form his own style, not just copy that of another.On the famous shoulder-rest controversy, Auer comes down strictly on the \\"no-shoulder-rest\\" school claiming that it makes the player lose a third of the whole body of tone. One look at a picture of Auer playing the violin and you can see why his physique is suited to no-shoulder-rest. He has no neck, a protruding chin, and a squat frame upon which he can rest the violin on his chest, with relatively short arms, so he can hold the instrument directly in front of him. He also insists that you hold the violin as high as possible, especially when playing on the G string. You can see the results with Jascha Heifetz, who holds his violin up high and uses no shoulder rest. Of course, men of those days had padded shoulders on their suits and tuxedos, so the violin fit right up there.This book is of interest in learning about violin pedagogy as taught in the Russian conservatories at the turn of the last century. And has valuable tips and technical aids. However, it does not substitute for a good teacher. And Auer would wholeheartedly agree, especially for beginners: \\"There is no instrument whose absolute mastery at a later period presupposes such meticulous care and exactitude in the initial stages of study as does the violin.\\""},{"Title":"Violin Playing as I Teach It","review":"I find this book invaluable as a resource for serious violin students and teachers. Leopold Auer elaborates a lot of insights and perspectives on better techniques to play the violin. This book is not merely about performing certain violin techniques, but also about the logic behind better ways of executing them.I would agree, however, that this book is not for beginner level violin students. Auer does say that correct foundation should be built since the early stage, but many of the explanations are beyond the reach of those beginner who can't even produce the techniques way too difficult for their stage; say, vibrato, double-stops, spiccato, etc. However, this is a good resource for violin teachers to lay correct foundation step by step following the progress of their students. Also, this is a good book for more advanced students as a comparative reference on how well they have understood the techniques, at least as another perspective.Overall, this book is highly recommended for serious students and teachers of violin."},{"Title":"Violin Playing as I Teach It","review":"When Auer is mentioned, you usually hear about him primarily in terms of who his students and teachers were. Heifetz, Galamian and Joachim come to mind. But I didn't find the book very useful. First off, it's a little skinny. Then the style is heavy turn-of-the-century egotist. It's very short on specifics. The only thing he really mentions that kind of turned my head is fingered-octaves. (He's definitely not appealing to beginners, is he?) Most of the rest reads like a pep talk and not the best, at that. If you want a quality read from the past get the Baillot book instead, where the discussions on bowing are much better, and replete with details and examples."},{"Title":"Violin Playing as I Teach It","review":"Auer's book is a gem. The old violin Maestro describes in few and simple words the intricate and complex state of mind and abilities of the serious violinist. The book is NOT, I repeat NOT intended as a violin technique textbook. The book is directed, primarily, to violin teachers whom are responsible and concious of the fact that they are responsible for the correct development of the upcoming violinist. For those who so wrongly bashed the book for its prozaic content; learn to read between the lines. I give this book 4 stars!"},{"Title":"Violin Playing as I Teach It","review":"I must say that Mr Auer is one of the supream violinists of our century. Disregarding his amazing student track record, he is an amazing teacher who's methods are still prized today. Above my commentary there are several reviews that bash the book. In no way did Mr. Auer ever intend this book to be for a begginer. His sole objective in writting this book was to set in words what he had taught his entire life. This book was a great help in answering some of my techincal problems that are never talked about. If you are a violinist, this book is a neccesity. It's content is spectacular and well disserves a 5 star rating."},{"Title":"Violin Playing as I Teach It","review":"My friend who is a composer recommended this book which was written in 1920. The author mixes the autobiography remminiscing of his youth studying the violin with famous teachers like Mr. Dont. He highlights the drama of being on stage including how he saved a perfomance from another musician's unsteady bow. I like the photographs of his students which display well on my kindle. This book is ideal for those who can read music and play the violin since there are a few scale exercises. This book was a fun read beacuse the author mixes sound advice for practicing the violin, increasing a repetoire of famous composer's works with wicked wit. :)"},{"Title":"Violin Playing as I Teach It","review":"Auer was a very famous teacher in his day. He produced some of the most famous violinists of his time. Between this book, and his \\"graded course in violin playing\\", a student or teacher can get an insight into why his teaching was so successful. If you want practical exercises then look at his graded course. But for a general overveiw of the principles of teaching, and an awareness of which areas need to be focussed on, this book is great."},{"Title":"Violin Playing as I Teach It","review":"This was a wonderful insight into Leopold Auer's time, and incredibly helpful for me as a violin teacher to expand my thought processes.

It is an honor to be taught by such an exceptional violinist and to read about how Sarasate, Vieuxtemps, Wieniawski and other 19th-century masters played."},{"Title":"Violin Playing as I Teach It","review":"Exemplary collection of principles and guidelines: holding the instrument, practicing, tone production, bowing, fingering, phrasing, etc.From another edition of same book:Witty, opinionated, and insightful, March 21, 2004By C. Chu - See all my reviews(TOP 1000 REVIEWER) (REAL NAME)This little gem of a book reads like a tip book, expose, soapbox, gossip column and memoir. Auer is witty and funny, sometimes he had me laughing in stitches. For example, his description of chronic vibrato, \\"this physical evil generally may be traced to a group of sick or ailing nerves, hitherto undiscovered.\\" Another diatribe on the lack of standards for violin teachers: \\"Many are indeed desirous of doing their best, but alas, having themselves been ill-taught, they spread the poison of their own ignorance broadcast, a plague which carries off many hapless innocents, victims of their pernicious teaching methods.\\"Auer was in the position to learn from, observe, and teach some of the best violinists of the last two centuries. He studied with Jacob Dont in Vienna and Joachim in Hanover, was a contemporary of Davidov, Wieniawski, Seidel, Wilhelmj, Sarasate, von Bulow, and taught Elman, Zimbalist, and Jascha Heifetz. Who would have known that Joachim had such stage fright, or that Mischa Elman almost died of coal-gas fumes the night before his debut?The book has nice tips on fingering, bowing and tone production. He also devotes a chapter to nuance, the soul of interpretation and phrasing and another chapter to Style, where he wisely suggests that each generation interprets the music to suit the style of that era. No one really knows how Bach played baroque music, and no one can claim to be authentic to a time period that has long since passed away. \\"The musical spirit of Bach transcends all narrow limitations of period, and the artist of today who truly enters into this spirit will play Bach as he should be played, and will play Bach better because he will play him in the interpretative spirit of our own generation, not that of 1720.\\" He deplores the blind upholders of \\"tradition\\" and insists that the violinist must form his own style, not just copy that of another.On the famous shoulder-rest controversy, Auer comes down strictly on the \\"no-shoulder-rest\\" school claiming that it makes the player lose a third of the whole body of tone. One look at a picture of Auer playing the violin and you can see why his physique is suited to no-shoulder-rest. He has no neck, a protruding chin, and a squat frame upon which he can rest the violin on his chest, with relatively short arms, so he can hold the instrument directly in front of him. He also insists that you hold the violin as high as possible, especially when playing on the G string. You can see the results with Jascha Heifetz, who holds his violin up high and uses no shoulder rest. Of course, men of those days had padded shoulders on their suits and tuxedos, so the violin fit right up there.This book is of interest in learning about violin pedagogy as taught in the Russian conservatories at the turn of the last century. And has valuable tips and technical aids. However, it does not substitute for a good teacher. And Auer would wholeheartedly agree, especially for beginners: \\"There is no instrument whose absolute mastery at a later period presupposes such meticulous care and exactitude in the initial stages of study as does the violin.\\""},{"Title":"African Artistry: Technique and Aesthetics in Yoruba Sculpture","review":"The Arnett Collection, which is presented in this book represents a very good overview of the artistic work of the Yoruba in Nigeria dar.

They've omitted some original material. That was why I wanted the \\"Table Talk\\". It's supposed to be the REAL Martin Luther. Very disappointing!!!!"},{"Title":"Table talk, (Luther's works. American edition)","review":"At the time of the Reformation Martin Luther was a professor in the theology department of the University of Wittenberg at Wittenberg, Germany. He was also the regional head of the Augustinian Monks, and resided in the Augustine monastery at Wittenberg, a few blocks from the university. As a result of the Reformation, the Augustinian order in Northern Germany was disbanded. The ruler of that area, the German Elector Friedrick the Wise, who supported and protected Martin Luther, gave Luther the building which had housed the Augustinian monks. It consisted of 26 sleeping rooms, a study, dining room and other common areas. When Luther married, he and his wife lived in the building and raised a family. To support Luther's meager professor's salary, they took in boarders, who were fellow professors and students. The professors and graduate students realized that the comments at the Luther dinner table contained philosophical and religious wisdoms that should be preserved, and they took down what was said in shorthand, and later transcribed the full text into notebooks in their rooms. A collection of these \\"Table Talks\\" by Johannes Aurifaber was published in 1566, twenty years after Luther died. Aurifaber had boarded at the Luther household during the year 1545 and until Luther's death in February, 1546. He was Luther's last clerk, and was with Luther at the time of his death. In addition to collecting manuscripts of other table guest, Aurifaber recorded the table conversations during Luther's last months. The Aurifaber collection was the only known form of the Table Talks for more than 300 years. The Aurifaber collection was translated into English in 1652 by Captain Henry Bell. This translation was reworked and expanded by William Hazlett (1778-1830), an English writer and literary critic who was active in the Unitarian Church. The book under review here is a reprint of the Hazlett edition of the English translation of Aufifaber's collection. However, the original Aurifaber collection was neither complete nor accurate. Many items were not conversations at the Luther table and several others were edited and censored by Aurifaber to reflect his own views. In addition, the Bell-Hazlett translation contained further errors and misunderstandings. By edict of the German Emperor, a complete review of all of Luther's works, including the Table Talks, was undertaken by a special commission, which published the comprenesive Weimar Edition of Luther's works in 1883. The Table Talks make up six volumes of the official Weimar Edition. They are printed in the original medieval German and medieval Latin as they were recorded by guests at the Luther table. The Weimar edition is the only authenticated version of the Luther Table Talks. A portion of the authentic Table Talks from the Weimar Edition have been translated in Volume 54 of the collected works of Martin Luther published by the Lutheran Press (Fortress Press and CPH). A more complete translation of the authentic Table Talks is availalbe in Off THE RECORD WITH MARTIN LUTHER, An Original Translation of the Table Talks, by Charles Daudert, with foreword by Dr. Paul L. Maier, professor of ancient history, renown Christian writer, historian, and second vice president of the Lutheran Church, Missouri Synod.Off the Record with Martin Luther"},{"Title":"Table talk, (Luther's works.

Those are urban legends. The stories are probably not literally true (or at least no one can prove them), but they do express concepts of what we need to be cautious about in life. For example, Little Red Riding Hood was not literally true (unless wolves are a lot different from the ones I have seen) but it conveyed warnings about being careful about assuming too much (the wolf was not grandma) and following advice that seems against your best interest (let me show you my big teeth).In that same spirit, Ms. Fiery has created \\"a treasury of our best urban legends . . . most exciting, beloved, and morally laden tales. . . .\\" But they need to be rewritten, because they are \\"the uncut gems of our literary heritage.\\" In the book, the urban legends are dressed up to be more like written short stories, and to be more plausible.The concept is an interesting one, and I enjoyed reading the book. I must admit that I had only heard of one of these urban legends before reading this book. Perhaps I have been out in the suburbs too long!I found that some of the stories worked much better than others. In some, the detail built the story. In others, the detail either directed you away from the story or was irrelevant. The illustrations are attractive, but sometimes they telegraphed where the story was going too soon. If you already knew the urban legend, you would already know where the story was going. I would have preferred to have been surprised.I thought the best two stories were \\"Old Dog, New Tricks\\" about a man, his dog, and a lady in an elevator, and \\"Babysitter's Club\\" about a haunted house that scares all of the babysitters.I also enjoyed \\"Warm as Toast\\" (a woman helps her dog dry off), \\"Such Clean Floors\\" (life support equipment keeps failing in a hospital), \\"The Flying Gypsy Trick\\" (traveling in Greece), \\"Fiat Lux\\" (about a driving lesson), \\"LigHt Beer\\" (new properties of the latest ale), and \\"Hot Potato\\" (a doctor having trouble diagnosing his patient's problem).On the other hand, more than half of the stories didn't work very well for me. They seemed either implausible, uninteresting, or gross . . . rather than seeming like modern fairy tales. I graded the book down accordingly.What jokes do you know that provide good lessons that we all should follow? What stories that are too good to be true actually capture essential truths, nonetheless?Get the point!"},{"Title":"Born To Win - Transactional Analysis With Gestalt Experiments","review":"The order was sent in just a couple of days.

Pullen's superb regimental history, \\"The Twentieth Maine\\", has stood the test of time. First published in 1957, and since reprinted at least twice, it is a remarkably readable narrative of the adventures of a volunteer infantry regiment in the Civil War.Pullen's history follows the regiment from its formation in the summer of 1862 through the battles of Antietam, Fredericksburg, and Gettysburg; the siege of Petersburg; and finally, the surrender ceremony at Appomattox. The 20th Maine is best known for its pivotal stand at Little Round Top on the second day of the Battle of Gettysburg, where a desperate bayonet charge saved the Union line and perhaps the Union Army.The 20th Maine's most famous regimental commander was pre-war college professor Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, who went on to post-war prominence as an educator and as governor of the State of Maine. His leadership at Gettysburg is known to more recent audiences from Michael Shaara's novel \\"The Killer Angels\\", and from the superlative Ken Burns documentary \\"The Civil War.\\" Chamberlein is however only one of many heroes to inhabit Pullen's narrative, closely documented from official archives, letters and personal histories of the war.\\"The Twentieth Maine\\" is very highly recommended as an exemplar of the regimental history genre, and as a superb read for students of the Civil War."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"The problem is: If you are not familiar with 20th Century Irish history, you will be lost reading this book when Part 1 ends. Doyle provides the reader with no historical background and writes the book assuming that the reader is all ready well-versed in Irish history. I also had trouble visualizing Ireland, the places, buildings, streets, and the battle scenes, which I attribute to Doyle's lack of description and to my lack of Irish knowledge."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"I am a huge fan of Roddy Dolye's previous work, but this book is extremely disappointing. There is potential here, but the characters are underdeveloped and trite. The story seems to have been done a billion times before. Why is Roddy going down this well beaten path? He should leave this topic to Frank McCourt and the Clancy Brothers. If you have had the misfortune of purchasing this book do not pass it to a friend unless they have a 3 legged couch.A star for &quot;A Star Called Henry&quot;. Let's all pray this is not a trilogy."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"Before I picked up 'A Star Called Henry', Roddy Doyle was one of the few authors of whom I could say, 'I would read anything he wrote'. In the future I will be more careful. I found the main character to be self-centered, vain, unrealistic and awfully stupid for someone who considered himself a genius. This would have been fine except for the fact that Mr. Doyle seemed intent on presenting him as a sympathetic figure. The only thing more annoying than the character of Henry Smart, however, were the reviews of your customers. If one more person stated that they learned so much about the IRA or the Easter Rising from this book, I think I would have started planting my own car bombs. Has it escaped each of you that you found this book in the FICTION section! There are plenty of wonderful books out there if you want the real story of early 20th century Irish history . For instance, if you want to learn about the IRA pick up 'The IRA: A History' by Tim Pat Coogan. And if you're interested in a fact packed story of the Easter 1916 Rising, 'Rebels' by Peter DeRosa is incredibly accurate and beautifully written. In the meantime please don't take history lessons from novels. And as for you Roddy Doyle, the everyday characters from your earlier books were far more heroic than the gun toting, big talking Henry Smart, and far more inspiring."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"What a waste. Mr Doyle started off magically with his book only to succumbs to a tedious cut and paste history job. This book could have been great if it wasn't so bogged down in history most intelligent adults know about. Why didn't he talk about the characters life outside of history? That would have been to unglamorous and unreadable or maybe to honest and harder for a writer to write. Skip it!"},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"Until I read this book.

It was a fairly easy read and had a decient story line, I do however think he should of did this story in one full novel, it seems to me that writers have sold out completly to commercialism and decide to make 3 books out of one, which ruins the artistic quality of the story... but over all it was a good read."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"Engaging, thought-provoking writing. Brought me to Ireland in my imagination."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"Roddy Doyle's writing is engaging, effusive, enlightening, and a bunch of other E words - except English. The flavor and rhythm of Irish life is so vividly captured in all of his books that by the end, you're swearing by all the saints and Mary as you're on your way down the pub for a pint and chips.A Star Called Henry is Doyle's best yet - a young man, coming to age during hardship (is there any other -ship in Ireland?) with a sickly brother to care for, ends up finding himself in the midst of The Troubles in early 20th Century Ireland. You admire his spirit and carefree nature, but you worry for him also: he throws himself into conflict after conflict with utter abandon beacuse he alternately doesn't care or wants to continue living very dearly.While the quirky, photographic style of Doyle's Barrytown Trilogy (c'mon, you saw The Commitments) has given way to a darker style of narrative, Doyle treats his subjects - Henry, his mother, and the city of Dublin - with care, affection, and humor. An additional bonus is all the backstory about the formation of the IRA, Michael Collins, and the sewer system under Dublin.While A Star Called Henry is based on historical fact, it's still a novel centered around a young man who is alternately Henry Smart or Henry Not-So-Smart - the setting is incredibly well-researched, and will only whet your appetite for more accurate detail - which can be extensively satisfied by the excellent bibliography in the back of the book.Enjoy Henry Smart, fer chrissake, and look forward to the next one coming soon, ya eejit."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"Mr. Doyle has written some great ones - Booker Prize for Paddy Clarke Ha, Ha, Ha; Barrytown Triology before that - but this is his best. He has retained that uniquely Irish humor, underwhelmed with the world's pretensions, and taken on the grand sweep of the Irish Republican movement from the turn of the century. Born into the foul holes of the poorest of Dublin's poor, Henry is a rollicking hellian from birth. Irrepressible, hardshelled, opportunistic, he learns and lives fast, with allegiance to none - the son of an assassin, he fills his father's shoes. The prominent figures of early Republicanism and the 1916 Easter uprising - Michael Collins among them - appear throughout, but it is really the story of Ireland's long suffering common poor, their pride and spirit and love of life, their survival instincts, that shines through. I can't wait for the next installment on Henry - only 20 at the end of this tale, which is much longer than most old men's lives."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"This book is simply amazing. It's written with a colossal amount of cognizance and understanding of the problems in Ireland of the last century. Having only discovered the wonder that is Roddy Doyle (apart from the The Commitments) it's reassuring to know a great presence in literature still thrives. After the occasional snippets I read out to my girl - she's now commandeered it and enjoying it thoroughly. Well written."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"Satisfactory on all counts! Doyle has a wonderful ear for the cadence of Irish speech, a real gift for making his characters come alive on the page, and a story to tell of a remarkable young man who lives the history of Ireland during its most turbulent times. His powers of description --of the grinding poverty of the Dublin slums, especially- are masterful. In giving us a history lesson, he also tells a tale of betrayal, loyalty, honor, and love. Roddy Doyle's novels get better with each new arrival, and there will be many of us awaiting the next volume of this trilogy."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"Doyle sentences are like sticks of dynamite, or maybe they're lit fuses for the explosion of the last line. Either way, the most admirable and memorable thing about this novel for me is his use of language. I've read PADDY CLARK and THE VAN, but I think this is his best novel so far. We've been to this Ireland before in other books, but we haven't been given the tour by Henry Smart, and it's his voice and his life that make the travelled ground seem fresh and dangerous. The last line of the novel is truly a revelation. If you haven't read it, don't look."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"The first quarter of this novel is an incredibly fierce, surreal picture of turn of the century Ireland that burrows into the reader's mind like the artificial leg that doubled as a limb and lethal weapon for the hero's father. Henry Smart is an infant with the perspective of a raging, sexual adult -- a unique and thrilling point of view. When Henry grows up and joins the IRA, you'd think that the violent colorful history that is the background for the story would enable the reader to continue the wild ride of the opening. Ironically, though, Henry's bloody history as an IRA soldier and assassin doesn't come close to matching the mind-bending expectations of the opening. Doyle shows us the forces that shaped the heart and mind of a terrorist, but we never truly empathize, perhaps because it's impossible to transcend our own abhorrence of terrorists today (including the IRA kind)."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"This is a terrific book. I gave it five stars despite some disappointment in the ending. I hasten to add that the ending suffers only by comparison with the rest of the book, which is utterly superb. This book is not for the faint of heart as Doyle generates an upheaval of emotional contradictions. He cuts your heart out with a jagged edge, then replaces it with childlike tenderness and humor. Hold on tight for an entertaining emotional rollercoaster ride."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"I have to admit to being a Roddy Doyle fan. I have read all of his books and this one definitely does not disappoint. I think it is his best work yet. I enjoyed this book as I learnt a lot more about the terrible conditions in which a lot of people lived in Ireland at that time and also about the Irish struggle. This is a powerful work as it also illustrates how corruption and greed set in amongst some of the people fighting for freedom and how this impacted on Irish people. Roddy Doyle is a great author and I hope we see more books from him in the future."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"On this evidence Roddy Doyle has far more to give us than the bitter-sweet but largely comedic novels that we expected and found A STAR CALLED HENRY not to be. This is a gritty, semi- or pseudo-historical novel with all the hate and anger of his previous work but not so much the laughs. Still, if you're scared of something stronger you deserve not to enjoy this. Artful, sour, violent and highly readable: I'm certain we're going to be treated to an even greater ending when parts 2 and 3 of this work are written."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"Maybe because I have recently read Morgan Llywelyn's novel,&quot;1916&quot;, I feel like I have already read parts this book (except for the beginning which takes Frank McCourt's &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; several shades darker). The first-third of the story is unforgetable as Doyle takes the reader through the dirty alleys and waterways of Henry's lonely, desolate and violent childhood. But then Henry starts fighting for a country he doesn't care about, against a country he doesn't know about, for reasons Doyle won't tell us about. If you are a Doyle fan from his previous works, read the synopsis of the story and then decide if it is the type of reading you are looking for. If you are already familiar with fictional renderings of the Irish rebillion of 1916, you may want to skip this one."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"This one makes Angela's Ashes sound as fascinating as your t4."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"&quot;Doyle vividly portrays the wild passions of an Irish everyman, and the birth of the modern Irish nation&quot;- Time Magazine. &quot;A Star Called Henry&quot; captures the essence of Ireland as stated by Time Magazine. Although Henry Smart's character never existed the book really portrayed a hauntingly realistic and clever vision of an Irishman in the midst of revolution. The book had me enthralled and deeply passionate about the cause and the people up until the very end.&quot;'Do you love Ireland lads?' They got no answer. We didn't understand the question. Ireland was something in songs that drunken old men wept about as they held on to the railings at three in the morning and we homed in to rob them; that was all. I loved Victor and my memories. That was all i knew of love&quot; Henry is a character that you will never forget, and the book brought Ireland to life."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"Love...war...family. This book is a combination of three threads intertwined to make a beautiful cloth of Henry's life and each thread represents a part of his life. His family he left behind that he is trying to rediscover. His life in the war agaist Britan for independance. Love, his love for Missis O'Shea amd trying to find her.&quot;Astonishing&quot;-The New York Times Book Review. I completly agree because it is written with a view of the mind and body of Henry Smart rather than just being a action book. He is described in the most detail I've seen from head to toe. It also describes a multitude of other types of people in the Irish revolution. I give this book 5 stars because it over adequatly sketches a life of a revolutionary and his war."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"The following is an evaluation of \\"A Star Called Henry\\". I am in eighth grade... and in our lit. class we read \\"A Star Called Henry\\". I found this book entertaining as well as educational. It was the first book that I have read for school that I have enjoyed so much that I didn't want to stop reading. \\"A Star Called Henry\\" helped me understand the situation in Ireland at the time. Reading this book made me actually feel like I was there, living in famine and sleeping on the street.However, I would not recomend this book to someone who would be offended by sex and violence. It would make a great movie because Holywood wouldn't have to add anything to make it sell.In conclusion, I would reccomend this book to anyone over 13 years of age."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"An incredible story of life in Ireland... one person and his struggles throught life, love, war, sickness, and independence."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"I loved it.... Ireland, the description of the places, the sounds, the people... LIFE in a very rough time for the Irish... the fight for independence, one persons struggle to live and raise above.... it is simply marvelous!"},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"In Henry Smart, Roddy Doyle has created a narrator who is both entirely engaging and not the least bit trustworthy. If we are to believe Henry, he was just out of the frame of a famous picture of early IRA members, the uncredited author of a famous poem, the most handsome man in Ireland, the best \\"ride\\" in town...the list of Henry's \\"accomplishments\\" is nearly endless.Henry's recounting of his adventures during the early days of the IRA is entrancing-the events themselves are full of large-scale drama, tragedy and courage, while the way in which these tales are told is full of braggadocio and humor. I look forward to Henry's next escapades in this planned trilogy."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"Roddy Doyle proves as adept at creating history as he is in reflecting contemporary Irish society. This is a funny, heartbreakingly beautiful and slightly bawdy novel that portrays the world as neither black nor white but simply a place to live. I simply adored the title character, who is as well realized as any in fiction. Henry has heart and soul and guts, not to mention the most beautiful eyes in the world, and you will care about what happens to him. For those of you who love Doyle's stories but have had trouble understanding the vernacular in the Barrytown books, rest assured that this one is less challenging."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"Born into a poor Irish household, the son of a one-legged hit man, Henry Smart grows into a soldier, lover, and assassin for the early IRA. Roddy Doyle has returned in full force with what may be his most captivating novel to date. Doyle's story is equal parts action, love story, history, and mystery. Since this is Roddy Doyle there are plenty of laughs (believe me!) but what really drives this story are the moments both tender and brutal in Henry's experiences. The characters spring to life on the page, and the dialogue, distictly Irish and classic Doyle, will ring in your ears for days. One of the things that also makes this novel such a compelling read is the way Doyle unravels the puzzle one piece at a time, letting his story unfold before you. It is rare to find a novel so engaging on every level, and &quot;A Star Called Henry&quot; proves that Doyle is at the top of his game!"},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"Roddy Doyle has given us a well-crafted story of a young boy growing up in abject poverty in Ireland in the early years of the 20th century. The beginning reminded me a bit of Angela's Ashes--but then went on to take many dark turns. Instead of coming to America to become a teacher, as Frank McCourt did, Henry becomes an IRA assassin with no real loyalty to anyone, save the woman who taught him how to write his name. Henry is well written and entertaining, as are all Doyle's novels plus there is the added bonus of an Irish history lesson."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"War. War in Ireland was a predominant point in this book, which was intertwined with other story line. The Star Called Henry by Roddy Doyle took place during the time of Ireland's &quot;troubles&quot;. This book is about a boy named Henry Smart from the time of his birth until he was 20 years old. This book is a wonderful book that has everything that an entertaining and hooking book should have including romance, war and violence, family values, and the plot is very realistic and is very detailed and articulately spoken.I would definitely recommend A Star Called Henry to anyone who's learning about Ireland's history. At the moment I am studying the history of Ireland in my Humanities core class during my winter tri-mester in 8th grade. This story helped me understand why the Irish Catholics were so angered and how almost every person was willing to give up their lives at the snap of their fingers for their independence.Their living conditions were worst than the worst that you could most likely think of. Henry explains when his brother dies,&quot; His cough had been different. Just a cough. It was what you did when you breathed Dublin air. When you slept on the ground. When you didn't have shoes. You coughed when you ate bad food or none. When you'd never worn a coat. When everyone else around you coughed. When you'd no mother to fix you and no father to run for the doctor. And no doctor who'd come, anyway. The city killed victor.&quot; These people had nothing to give up, and they fought so easily because there was nothing to lose anyway.This book really depicts the harshness of life in Dublin at the time. This book was very well written. It was descriptive, articulate, and although it was very harsh and violent it was very easy to understand from any point of view. This book is worth the time it takes to read it, I'd give it five stars out of five. This book would be good for people from the age of 13 to adult."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"This is Roddy Doyle's weakest work yet. Roddy Doyle;s inimitable endearing style that shows itself in paddy clark ha ha ha... is not be seen in this latest novel. Even the main character seems to lack the depth that his prior novels had. On the positive side, it is a neat story of the IRA and shows a side of the revolution ( and michael collins) that is not often written about..."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"Unfortunately, even though this book is a work of fiction, the events depicted have happened over and over again in Northern Ireland -- and continue to happen today. Anyone who wants to know why Ireland is divided should read this book for a clearer understanding and better insight into what it really means to be Irish and Catholic."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"In fact I found this book so transparent I could almost read it from cover to cover without opening it. Not a particular fan of any of Roddy Doyles books, but I got the book from a friend with the literary equivalent of 'Taste this, it's awful&quot;. As a Dubliner it's easy to be critical of local or incidental aspects of this story, but ignoring that my reaction on finishing it was, 'what's the point'. I got the impression of a collage of factual information from reference books joined together to create a not very convincing story. The use of real historical figures confused me, was it a tale or an historical commentary, or both. In fairness it came across as an interesting political commentary, ie. the so-called heroes of the era being not much different than our current batch of politicians, shuffling for power and walking over any socialist ideas that stem from republicanism. But the story doesn't justify it's own existence. Roddy Doyle could have written a better book if he indeed did lose the plot."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"This novel presuposes that the reader has some familiarity with the historical events it describes. I'm not sure to what extent a reader without previous knowledge of the Easter Uprising or the development of the IRA could appreciate this book. I was quite happily surprised by the fact that Doyle strips these events of their romanticized veneer, but disappointed by the disipation of the plot and the characters as the piece drew to a conclusion.I will, however, read the next part of the trilogy."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"The story of Henry Smart, who comes into this wrld without so much as a name to call his own. The poverty and misery of his young life provide fuel for the rebellion, but he keeps a bit of himself aside, and that bit is always trying to figure it all out; and firgure it out he does.This book will be added to the short ist of classics."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"Buy it. Read it. This was the first time I'd read one of Mr. Doyle's novels. I'll be reading the others. While A Star Called Henry isn't an easy read, it does require that you pay attention, it is more than worth your time. Someone tell me when the next book is due."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"Man.. it's all good !!! I was happy. made me cry.. made me smile... full range of emotions filled my soul all at one time. Gave me peace to live this life and to go on with courage. I don't know how he did it.. but he's da man.!!"},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"Roddy Doyle is an accomplished writer of populist fiction and one of the greatest exponents of street dialogue around. He isn't up to the task he has set himself here. His central character is a one-dimensional cartoon whose 'Dan Dare' antics are sadly at odds with the grim reality of 1916. It is a cliche that many writers of pop fiction decide at middle age to write 'something important'. It is almost always a disaster - as indeed it is here. What is particularly unfortunate from Doyle's point of view is that he has publicly trapped himself into writing a trilogy and is now tasked with carting this imbecile across the Atlantic and next depositing him in Chicago. William Boyd did something very similiar in 'The New Confessions' but managed it in one, tongue-in-cheek volume. Doyle's earnestly menopausal grab for the stars, coupled with this atrocious character suggest the going could be hard for the next two rounds. Unless he has actually typed the first sentence of 'Henry - just when you thought it was safe on Lake Shore Drive', I suggest he start scouting North Dublin for a 'Snapper' style yarn. This is what he does best and it appears as though he is intent on discovering it the hard way."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"Any book which Patrick Geoghegan decides to grace with his image has to be a classic."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"Roddy Doyle, Ireland's great author of such works as &quot;The Commitments&quot; and &quot;Paddy Clarke, HA HA HA!&quot; has written a truly astonishing work. At once a personal narrative, a great adventure story, a horrific epic, and a comment on history itself, &quot;A Star Called Henry&quot; is a great read, a fun book, and a literary near-masterpiece.Set in Dublin and surrounding areas in Ireland from 1897-1920, it cronicles the first twenty years in the life of Henry Smart, a beautiful, intelligent warrior in the fight for Irish independnace. He becomes a member of the resistance at age 14, and through his eyes we see the fight to regain Ireland.Doyle's protagonist is searingly honest about himself and history. He knows that he is a cog in a great machine, but knows that he can do nothing about it. He realizes that he is at once a major part of the resistance and a totally expendable man. He is constantly reminding us how he should be in the history books, but he knows he never will be. He is our witness, but the narrative he brings is not one born out of great battles, but instead individual triumphs and failures.Roddy Doyle is not trying to synopsize history. If one wanted that, they could read any one of the many sources he lists in the back of the book. Doyle is instead personalizing history. Showing us an uncommon commoner caught up in history's tide, incapable of swimming back to shore no matter how hard he tries.Even if you have no interest in Ireland whatsoever, read this book. Hell, even if you're an Ulster Unionist read this book. It's written so compellingly and so unflinchingly that I dare you to take longer than a week to finish it."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"This book is wonderful. It's realistic, its characters are living people (even the legends like Michael Collins and James Connolly), and the story is compelling. I didn't like the main character at first, because I felt he was a braggart and a jerk, but later on I really started to appreciate him. I'll definitely read the sequels, even though I picked this one up because it dealt with the Easter Rebellion. I gave it four stars instead of five, because I agree with one of the previous reviewers in that it requires quite some knowledge about Irish history. The casual remarks about Pears, Plunkett (and his marriage to Grace Gifford) etc. will make no sense if you have never heard of these fellows. I've heard of them, though, so it didn't really bother me."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"This book has everything anyone could want from a novel. It is funny, adventurous, thought provoking and extremely well written. Henry Smart is a boy who grows up in the Dublin slums amidst poverty and neglect and takes part in the Irish rebellion against England. We view the rebellion and its mythic heroes through his eyes and learn that the uprising, and new Irish nation that it fostered, was not fought for all Irish but for the few Irish who lusted after power, stature, and wealth. I think this is an amazing novel and I can't wait for the next two installments of this trilogy."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"Son of murderous one-legged bouncer, Henry Smart is born into a world where might makes right. Named after his dead brother who was named after his father, Henry Smart grows up struggling to make his name his own. His mother won't let him forget his brother, a star called Henry. And the only memory he has of his father--who fell in love with a name and created a person to fit that image...twice--is one contaminated by the scent of human blood and grime woven into the fabric of his father's shirt and cleansed by the Dublin's sewage. Father rescues son by throwing him over a wall and plunging him into the Swan River. Father, the absent patriarch, will have no home rule.After Easter, 1916, Henry Smart's name is known too well. He's become a living legend valorized in song. History has been made, but as Henry Smart alias Brian O'Linn, alias Fergus Nash, finds out, has yet to be endured-homelessness, bribery that gets one hired or fired, torture if caught by the enemy. While living with the effects of creating a part of Irish history, Henry also begins to unearth his family history. He buys information about his father from his maternal grandmother, Granny Nash. A book, written by a woman, for a fact. By the time Henry has pieced together his father's story, Granny Nash has the largest library of women authors in Dublin ... and Henry has already become unwittingly adept at his father's trade in the disposal of human bodies. His father whispered, Gandon says Hello. He pins notes to lapels that say, Killed as a spy by the IRA His father worked for a politician, and so does he. And ultimately both of their names end up on a hit list."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"Another great title from Roddy Doyle. Doyle has alway had a knack for capturing the language of his characters, and 'Henry' proves no exception. You'd swear you can hear the characters talking! I think Doyle also did a good job controlling the pace of the book. Some of the events involving fighting, for example, seem to whiz by in a blur of action.I think Steve Boulhosa's review of the book is a little off base. He is probably correct that there are better books on the history of the IRA, etc., but is the average Joe actually going to pick up one of those books and read it? I doubt it, but they might after reading 'Henry,' and that's an achievement!"},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"A star called henry is one of the most exciting books i have read in resent times, it showed a boy who grew up in trouble times as we live in now in Ireland, how he could love.His constant loyalty to his father who had abandon him, the strong love for his mother,and his unselfish devotion to his little brother Victor.The courage to move on in life, Roddy Doyle shows how my future has developed, how men, young men, women and children lived and died for what they believed in. His strenght [henry] his courage his cleverness to stay alive to do what he had to do was quiet unique. I loved this book i could relate to all the places Henry ventured to.Roddy Dolyes discriptions of towns and countys were brilliant as i read this book i could feel myself going through the Towns with Henry on the arseless with him,i could feel the love and respect he had for miss O'shea and the undevoted love she had for him and the love they both shared for the freedom of their country. I thank them and all the other Henry Smarts of the 1916-1922 war without them all i would not be a free woman today, I wondered while i was reading this book was it really fiction? or was it based on someone i once knew?"},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"In agreement with most of the comments here in that I thouroughly enjoyed this book. Similar in style but different in substance from Doyle's other novels, A Star Called Henry is worth the read. One observation I would like to make that others may take issue with is Doyle's almost Orwellian portrayal of the events that followed the Easter Rising. In Smart's perception and in mine, those who eventually gain control of the Republic differ very little from their predecessors. Doyle made me feel very keenly the loss of Collins' more democratic ideals for the sake of a few individuals' personal gain. I am looking forward to the rest of the trilogy."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"I feel sorry for Roddy Doyle having to publish one of his best works yet alongside the 'other' Irish export, Frank McCourt. Now, this is not a review of any of McCourt's work, which just happens to be a great mass of 'poor me' drivel. Nevertheless, I believe that after the last two years of the McCourts putting forward one particularly scewed version of Irish history, Doyle has now been lumped into the same category. This is unfortunate because 'A Star Called Henry' is one of Doyle's most important displays of writing to date. Every passage entrances and Doyle's gritty, tough writing brings you into the story so that you are fighting beside Henry, laughing beside him, and almost dying beside him as well. Doyle is a very real writer, and although Henry may do some very surreal things in the book, the fact remains that Doyle's honesty and knowledge of his own past shine through brilliantly. Doyle's rendering of the Anglo-Irish war and the subsequent Civil War are by far the best that any author of fiction has penned to date. Frank McCourt Tisn't, Roddy Doyle Tis'."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"It is a stroke of brilliance for Doyle to employ the device ofde-mystifying the brave men and women who gave their lives, the legends of the Irish Rebellions, while conversely creating the myth of a Henry Smart. Doyle is like a jazz magician playing discordant notes as a device of forcing the listener to intently listen to the music.I was in Dublin in '96, fifty years after the rebellion, looking up my roots at the genealogical Office. While there, I took a walking tour given by a Trinity College Masters student. We visited many of the Easter Rebellion sites and the Kilmainham prison. Doyle's vivid descriptions took me back to Dublin, I was in the GPO, next to Henry as he shot at the windows across the street. When they brought Connolly near death out on a chair to be executed, I am at the wall of the jail as well.The San Francisco Chronicle Online Book Club chose Roddy Doyle's &quot;A Star Called Henry&quot; for it's (9/19 (Sun.) - 10/16 (Sat.)) selection. Please join us by chiming in our online bulletin board. We would love to hear any additional thoughts that you might have."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"Admittedly, the final chapters pale in comparision to the stunning opening acts, however this is a book not to be missed by patrons of Irish literature. Doyle has a remarkable ability to carve characters whose flaws are as evident as cancors yet whose vulnerability is utterly engaging."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"A Star Called Henry is probably far more accurate in its portrayal of Ireland in the last years of British rule than many would realise. The activities of the members of Michael Collins' &quot;Squad&quot; were much like those performed by Henry Smart, who was, in the novel, on the periphery of possibly the most effective counter-intellegence agency in the world. Roddy Doyle's excellent novel captures the period as well as anything I have hitherto read on the subject. He captures the feeling of Dubliners towards the Easter Rising, before and after the executions, and the attitude of those beyond the Pale (English-controlled region around Dublin, where the phrase comes from) to the &quot;jackeens&quot;. Henry's delay in leaving Ireland was, I believe, not as surprising as some seem to think. Henry had great loyalty towards Michael Collins, similar to his feelings towards James Connolly, a debt of honour, if you will, that kept him from abandoning him while that was unresolved. After his betrayal and the death of Collins, he was free to leave the country. These attributes are visible in the character of Henry Smart, and are a major influence on his actions. His various loyalties are strong and are probably the driving force of his life.Before A Star Called Henry, I wasn't much a fan of Roddy Doyle the author, preferring the film versions of the Barrytown Trilogy, but I await with anticipation the remaining books in his latest Trilogy."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"Roddy Doyle's great new book, &quot;A Star Called Henry,&quot; is a stirring rush of a story set at the beginning of the century as the Irish Republic Army is taking shape. The novel, the first in a trilogy planned by Doyle, takes narrator Henry Smart from an infant in his boozy mother's arms to a damaged 20-year-old with a long career as an IRA assassin. Henry's addled mom spends her time looking up the stars, which represent all the children she has lost. His father is a dim-witted bouncer at a Dublin brothel who threatens (and kills) people with his wooden leg. Henry takes to the streets, developing keen survival skills and contempt for the forces that keep he and his family down. He hooks up with men who hate the British. Henry, while a bitter youth, is apolitical and is just looking for adventure and sustenance. Henry also has an odd, Bonnie and Clyde-style romance with Miss O'Shea, an older woman as eager to battle the Brits as any man. Doyle mixes in real historical figures (his depiction of famed rebel Michael Collins is wonderfully entertaining) and events into Henry's adventurous life. But, this is no romanticized tale of Ireland's fight for liberation. The book is filled with flawed leaders, inducing violence and putting Ireland's innocent a risk in the name of profit, as well as freedom. Henry grows up fast and his narration comes at a breakneck pace. In the beginning, Henry is a folk hero. He makes it clear he is a great warrior and lover, and quite possibly a genius. By the end, he has realized the tragic cost of the cause for which he has committed murder - a cause that eventually turns on him."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"One of the great perils for successful authors must be that point when they decide to 'stretch' their creative wings. The horror writers pens an introspective character study (Stephen King - ROADWORK). The English satirist attempts an American crime novel (Martin Amis - NIGHT TRAIN). The crime novelist delves into science fiction (Walter Mosley - BLUE LIGHT). At times like this, the fan base holds its collective breath, hoping for the best, fearing the worst. After all, why mess with a good thing?A STAR CALLED HENRY, thank God, is one of the good ones. Great ones actually.Previously, Irish novelist Roddy Doyle has focused his talents on life in modern-day Ireland. His works have been small character studies, with simple plots that come alive through Doyle's ear for dialogue and eye for intriguing themes. PADDY CLARKE HA HA HA, while considered a departure from his BARRYTOWN TRILOGY novels of blue collar Irish, was nevertheless a similar sort of story. A very small, intimate view of remarkable characters.But A STAR CALLED HENRY takes Doyle into the new realms of historical fiction. In a story that can only be described as 'epic', Doyle traces the formative years of Henry Smart, street urchin turned IRA assassin, living at the beginning of the 20th century, as Ireland began to revolt against its English rulers.Henry's beginnings show that Doyle has not traded his gift of characterization for narrative sweep. Henry's starts his tale before he was conceived, as his well-meaning but young mother falls in love with Henry Senior, a one-legged bouncer and hitman. With terrific economy of style, Doyle manages to convey both the excitement and desperation of Henry's life. After his abandonment by his father (in a heart-wrenching scene of loneliness and betrayal), Henry takes to the streets. But lest the reader believe that Doyle will begin to cultivate Henry as a loveable pickpocket a la OLIVER TWIST, the subject matter ensures that Henry's path will be a dark one.As the years pass, and Henry grows into quite the ladies man (at 14 years old, no less), he becomes embroiled in the quickening Irish rebellion. He becomes a hitman for the cause, and a student of famous IRA leaders, most notably Michael Collins. He also marries Miss O'Shea, his elementary school teacher (for about two days), and together they begin to rewrite Irish history.As I said, Doyle has not lost his knack for characters. Henry is a true original, a vicious killer and confused young boy. His relationship with Miss O'Shea is touching, if slightly bizarre. His continued search for elements of his past through his book-reading Granny is a plot device of startling originality.But Doyle also shows his new-found maturity as a writer in his mixture of fact and fiction. He expertly traces the IRA rebellion, from its admirable roots to its disheartening failures. It is not an exhaustive examination; Henry himself is not one of the top men. But enough information is given to enable the uninformed reader to understand the situation. Doyle might have been tempted to flood the reader with names, dates, and events, but he wisely avoids the trap of simply listing famous events and putting Henry in the middle of them. Every scene has a purpose. While the revolution may be the backdrop, it is first and foremost Henry's story.Doyle has proclaimed that A STAR CALLED HENRY is only the first volume in a planned epic entitled THE LAST ROUNDUP. While I eagerly await the second volume, I am also cautiously afraid. A STAR CALLED HENRY might be best left as a stand-alone novel. Thinking of Larry McMurtry's LONESOME DOVE quartet (a terrific set, really, but arguably shouldn't have continued past STREETS OF LAREDO), I can only hope that Doyle keeps up the same level of quality. Henry Smart is too fine a character to appear in sub-par sequels."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"If you are not familiar with the particulars of the Irish Rebellion, you'll enjoy HENRY more if you grab an encyclopedia and read up a bit. The author assumes that the reader has a certain amount of knowledge, and this can be frustrating if you don't. I also recommend watching the movie MICHAEL COLLINS with Liam Neeson, which covers the same historical events as the book. Together they give a fairly complete picture of this period of Irish history.HENRY isn't my favorite Doyle title, but it has his usual scintillating writing. This is a tough story about a scrappy lad in a nasty time in Irish history. Worth reading."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"This is an extraordinary ballad of Ireland during the first quarter of the 20th Century. As Doyle points out early on in the book, all the &quot;real songs&quot; come from &quot;the people.&quot; Written from the point of view of Henry Smart, a Dublin street &quot;guttie&quot; turned IRA rebel (and perhaps the most self-aware infant in literature since &quot;A Tin Drum&quot;), it demonstrates a deep love for the Irish people without the sentimentality of much of the literature of the period. Doyle commingles magical fictional characters with figures from the Irish Rebellion like James Connolly and Michael Collins in a way that illuminates the history. Ultimately, Henry--never one to embrace the goal of making &quot;Dublin a jewel again&quot; in any event--concludes that life in the Republic is no different from life in colonial Ireland, except that the controlling authorities have reverted to Gaelic spellings of their surnames. I think this is Doyle's best work yet, and I look forward to the next volume of the trilogy."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"This is a really good work of fiction. Just don't expect one of Doyle's gently humorous looks at the lives of working-class Irish people, like his Barrytown trilogy.This novel deals with the eventful first twenty years of the life of Henry Smart, the son of Henry Smart Senior. Senior is a whorehouse bouncer in early 1900's Dublin, and becomes a part-time murderer for the mysterious Alfie Gandon, whom he never meets. He eventually abandons his family, and their slide into desperate poverty and the decline of his wife is described in haunting detail. Henry Junior leaves home to fend for himself, assisted by his little brother Victor, who dies from consumption.Henry Junior then becomes involved with the Republican Movement, not because he is a staunch Republican, but because he is hoping for a better, more socially just, Ireland. He becomes a crack Republican assassin in an increasingly dirty war, and eventually realises that he is serving a new, shadowy elite, one of whom is the same Alfie Gandon his father used to serve.In the process Doyle makes a number of telling points about \\"liberation\\" movements, points not only applicable to the Irish experience. Three of the most important are:1. Such movements are often mythologised/idealized, with the myth serving to hide skeletons in the cupboard.2. The leaders of a liberation movement easily form a new elite, intent on amassing wealth and not serving the common people.3. The footsoldiers in a liberation struggle are dispensable, and often do not gain from the struggle.But this is not a pedantic novel, and can be read for enjoyment as well. I would rate it as one of Doyle's best two novels to date, on a par with the excellent \\"The Woman Who Walked Into Doors\\".My only gripe with the novel is that Henry is just too perfect a specimen of manhood given that he grows up on the streets of Dublin. A street kid of 14 who stands 6 feet tall and possesses enormous strength? Only possible in fiction."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"That's the only real way to react to this book.The story itself is sad enough: a kid born into poverty, denied education, drawn to revolution, and then betrayed by it.What makes it more sad is to look at Ireland and see just how much today's Ireland reflects the power grabs that went on during the War of Independence and the following Civil War, and have continued ever since.Ireland today is ruled by an elite that comes directly from the 1916-1923 period. Until the mid 1980's your only real political choices were Fine Gael and Fine Fail, two centrist parties whose only difference was over the 1922 peace treaty with England. Both parties favor a strong central government, with all the evils strong central government brings - see Charley Haughey for a recent example.Having grown up in, and run screaming from, Ireland, I can see Henry's growing enlightenment, which becomes my enlightenment and causes me then to reflect on Irish history from 1923 to the present day, and see just how much of it has been driven by power-hungry animals out to do well for themselves at the expense of all others.And don't get me going about Irish anti-semitism.It's enough to break your heart."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"I usually feel trilogies are somewhat commercially manipulative. The reader is given a piece of a story and obligated to finish the epic over a period of years. Somehow it seems to rob the book of its compression and intensity-- its finality. Doyle has created a memorable set of characters. His description of the Easter Rebellion is scintillating. The depiction of the poverty and desperation of the Dublin slums poignant. The life of an IRA volunteer is unromantically and realistically portrayed in all its bloody carnage. His language is eidetic and at times mesmerizing (which saved the 4 stars). There seems to be a tendency, though, to present Henry as a personna while keeping the person a mystery. Other characters are left fustratingly oblique. I'd suggest that developing subsequent books around the lives of some of the characters here-- the martyrs of Easter, the madame, Henry's father-- would a better literary route than Henry himself, who seems chiseled in stone rather than flesh and blood."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"This is the first Roddy Doyle novel that I have read, and I am hooked. Ultimately, this is not a &quot;revisionist&quot; novel about the leaders of the Easter Uprising and the struggle for Irish independence, or a conventional historical novel, as other readers have suggested. Rather, this is a very personal, and very compelling, story of one young man's early years, set against the backdrop of Irish history. But this is NOT history; it is Henry's story, as he sees it.In addition to creating a very likeable and sympathetic narrator, what Doyle has done here, quite skillfully, is to craft a novel that draws the reader into a reconsideration of the violence that has accompanied the Irish struggle, a very timely exercise given recent developments in the Irish peace process. In the course of the novel, Henry gradually learns that murder is murder, and that the ends do not justify the means. Quite literally, he discovers that his crimes served no greater purpose than did those of his father before him.But putting aside the deeper meanings and possible interpretations, Roddy Doyle has created a great read. I enjoyed the book tremendously, and would recommend it anyone, even readers with little background in Irish history."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"I finished reading this story while visiting my then-boyfriend in Ireland. We were sitting in a pub, when I mentioned this book, and said \\"But they talk about Michael Collins so much! Who the heck is Michael Collins?\\" and the bar went quiet. They all looked at me, exasperated, pointed to a picture hanging on the pub wall, and said \\"THAT is Michael Collins!\\"So, like another poster mentioned, you should probably read up a little on Irish history before you read this. It made some things a little vague for me at first, but I quickly put 2 and 2 together. If you want a crash course, try google-ing it: \\"Michael Collins\\" \\"Eamon DeValera\\" \\"Easter Uprising\\" and \\"Irish Civil War\\". Or do what my boyfriend did for me, and rent the movie \\"Michael Collins\\" (Liam Neeson & Julia Roberts).In my opinion the two greatest things about this book are:1) That Doyle weaves fact with fiction so beautifully. Like I said, he mentions big names and events, and you really learn some Irish history in the process.2) Doyle's writing. Simply put, it's beautiful. Especially in this novel (his others, set in modern Ireland, not as much). He puts a sing-song quality to his words, that somehow translates when you read it.Honestly, this is my favorite book of all time."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"Henry Smart, born in 1902, leads such a miserable childhood that he is on the streets by the age of five and solely responsible for his younger brother Victor by the age of nine. Always cold, hungry, and lacking a warm place to sleep, Henry and Victor are at the mercy of the elements. By the age of fourteen, Henry has met up with other poor who have some of the same resentments he has. In 1916, the Irish Republican Brotherhood takes over the General Post Office on Easter Monday, declares the establishment of a new government, and raises its flag, and Henry is there--not out of a sense of patriotism so much as a sense that he is at home--and is fed--when he is among these people.Depicting Henry's life from his wretched early childhood through the Irish War of Independence (1919 - 1921), author Roddy Doyle uses his formidable descriptive talents to show the horrors of poverty in Dublin and the resourcefulness of characters like Henry who manage to postpone starvation day by day. The vibrant narrative of the Easter Rising itself and of the action inside the General Post Office provides some of the novel's most fully drawn scenes and some of its best dialogue. In the aftermath of the Rising, with the leaders of the movement dead, various rebel factions with different philosophies vie for control, leading Henry to note, ultimately, that a successful movement is run \\"like a business,\\" not necesssarily a positive observation.Including characters like Padraic Pearse and James Connelly, with whom Henry comes into contact at the GPO, and Michael Collins, for whom Henry later works as an assassin, Doyle recreates Irish history. The focus, however, remains on Henry, who evokes empathy, even as he is performing terrible acts. His discovery of love with \\"Miss O'Shea\\" is the one aspect of his life which allows him to feel \\"normal.\\" Despite his contributions to the success of Michael Collins and his cohorts, Henry remains an outsider, never allowed to participate in the inner circle.Written in 1999, A Star Called Henry marks a departure for Doyle, becoming his only novel to date which deals with a grand historical setting and includes some of the real-life characters who shaped it. The scenes in the General Post Office are fast-paced and vibrantly written, some of the best of the novel--but they are so exciting that the aftermath (and much of the novel) is a bit of a let-down by comparison. And though Henry is a well-developed character, he is very young--lacking the inner conflicts which make great characters come alive. It is not until the end of the novel that Henry begins to ask questions.A Star Called Henry is a significant novel, however, one of Doyle's most important. Though it may never be as loved as much as some of his other novels, which often include humor to set the misery into sharp relief, Doyle has treated his serious subject with respect and honesty, taking a close look at the people involved with the independence movement--both the heroes and the unknowns--and making them human.

I knew nothing about the nitty gritty of Ireland's problems politically, but now I have a great bird's eye view of the whole conflict. All of this while at the same time we see a real have-nothing Irish kid growing up to learn to hate the \\"enemy.\\" As the book progresses, he finally comes to see himself as a dispensable tool of whoever he is working for...a truly sad awakening that puts the lie to those Revolutionary ideals. This story is so true to life that it shows us something of what Peggy Noonan wrote about in the Wall St. Journal yesterday: \\"They would grow up and assign their misery to outside forces. The boy humiliated because he's never sent to school with a clean shirt will turn that into 'Britain Get Out of Ireland.'....We often think it is large and abstract forces that drive history, when it is personal forces, too.\\" The life of Henry Smart is a masterly illustration of this."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"This book is a very successful attempt to portray Irish history in the early part of the century via the experiences and perceptions of a fictional character. You come away from it feeling that you have both read a good, well-written novel and learned something about history.The subject matter is absorbing, both in the early part of the novel, where one sees how abject the poverty was of Dublin's poorest inhabitants, and later on, where the focus moves to the characters who got the British out of most of Ireland, and the way in which they did it.Doyle also does some interesting things with language and structure in the book, which moves it past the common herd of novels and gives it some interest on the literary level as well.All in all it's a very satisfying book, and I look forward to reading the rest of the trilogy."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"I loved the way that Mr. Doyle built this novel, and all of its twists and turns. Henry is such a wonderful character. At every turn I was rooting for Henry to find his way. It was masterful.I was very reluctant at first to read this book. I was thinking it was another hard luck Irish story, but it turned out to be much more.Well with the read."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"...and probably one of the most charming and engrossing books I've ever read. (And to think, I only bought it because my bookstore was out of &quot;Roddy Doyle Ha Ha Ha&quot;) No, it's not a strict history of the IRA or the Easter Rebellion but more of a social and personal history. It tells the story of the beginning of the Irish Republic in the same was John Dos Passos tells America's coming of age in the U.S.A. trilogy. One has to imagine that Henry could represent the lives of hundreds of Irish youth during that time.The novel's great hook is it's humor. It carries the plot through Henry's childhood, and while the parts about the Rebellion and the IRA are predictably darker, the wit and precociousness are present throughout. Doyle has also done a beautiful job of conveying the experiential aspects of the story. When Henry is in the sewers, you can almost smell his father's coat and hear the tapping of his wooden leg on the cobblestones. You always feel as if you are in the story along with Henry.Maybe the best part of all is that A Star Called Henry is the first volume of a trilogy."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"Roddy Doyle exhibits his penchant for creating power by using a narrative that is richly minimalist in his story about the Irish struggle beginning with the Easter 1916 Uprising in the General Post Office in Dublin. I had flashbacks to the maximalism of The Tin Drum by Gunter Grass, which also concerns a violent political standoff in a Post Office. Doyle's style is extremely accessible and vivid and powerful in the way that Hemingway created strength by his use of short, punchy syntax like a newspaper writer. Doyle worked hard in his research for this novel and he succeeded in transporting me back to another era. The dialogue was noteworthy: masterfully terse, dense and authentic. The characters, many of whom are historical figures from Easter 1916, despite their often hideous acts against the state and each other were round and fully drawn in only a few brush strokes: they usually evoked sympathy or compassion. It is a tale about the human spirit striving to free itself from the fetters of poverty and oppression despite the worst possible odds. I admire Doyle as a writer and respect his command of his craft. I encourage you to read this incredibly moving novel about a star named Henry, who seemed to me to embody the Ireland of his heyday -- this novel is a very fine and inventive work by one of the master storytellers of our time."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"I'd read Doyle's other books and loved this detour into historical fiction. I disagree with the criticism above that you have to have a deep understanding of modern Irish history. I have a passing understanding and it did not keep me from enjoying this book one bit. It's a ripping tale -- and I have to add that Miss O'Shea is a breath of fresh air as heroines go. We've got an older woman/younger man thing going, she's not content to make sandwiches for the revolution, she'd rather be hurling bombs, she's lusty as all get out. She's great! I'd read the book just for Miss O'Shea.A terrific book."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"Roddy Doyle amazed me with his style with this attempt. Henry Smart is an unique and intriguing character. The main story set in Dublin from 1901(when henry was born) to 1921(when the story ended with Henry merely 20).Henry is a star of the book, He has an extraordinary life. He become a solider at 14,prepared to die for Ireland, then later an IRA who work for Michael Collins, marries his teacher, Miss O'shea, has a daughter called Freedom and particular been through everything in his teen. This book's written with numerous historical references from various sources as stated in the epilogue . Clearly showed Doyle's sincerity and passion.Doyle cleverly mixed his fiction with historical events and people make this book highly readable and fascinating. He showed the another side of Irish.This bitter sweet story is filled with sentiment,passion and sensibility."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"Henry Smart, born in Dublin, is enraged from birth. He wants to be noticed and nurtured by his parents. His mother, too busy having other children, becomes heavily dependent on alcohol. His one-legged father is much too involved with his job as an occasional hit man and bouncer for a fancy brothel. As a very young child, Henry takes to living on the streets with his even younger brother Victor.The beginning of A STAR CALLED HENRY is reminiscent of how Frank McCourt describes childhood poverty in Ireland. The difference is that Henry Smart becomes infuriated by it. From the anger with which Henry is born, to his developing philosophy of terrorism, through his cold-blooded and feelingless executions, the story leaves the reader shuddering. At times it becomes hard to read because it presents the idea of a terrorist and murderer as protagonist. Doyles uses short clipped sentences and phrases to keep the action hopping. Because the reader becomes so involved with Henry, it's difficult to know whether to root for him or against him. As in other Doyle novels, the author does a terrific job of capturing the flavor of Ireland as well as pentrating deep within an individual's psyche. Even if the reader lacks specific knowledge about the Irish Rebellion, the turmoil of warring factions (and even factions within factions) is captured so well. Here is an engaging read not to be missed for any Doyle fan."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"Roddy Doyle is his usual entertaining, intelligent and engaging self as he constructs the first part of Henry Smart's (larger-than)life. Doyle comes from a long tradition of expert storytellers,and even if the reader doesn't know much about Irish history, the tale is compelling.As a glimpse of Irish political figures, the book made me want to read up on early 20th Century Ireland.Like all of Doyle's protagonists, Henry Smart is no victim. He has an inner strength and confidence that keeps the reader cheering--even if he does engage in criminal activities like murder.I can hardly wait for the next two thirds of the series!"},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"Henry Smart is a sorrowful figure. A robber, a beggar a doorman and destined to be caught up in the \\"struggle\\" as so many working class Irishmen and women are. Where else do they turn? Why do the English provoke them so? Answer these questions and you will answer the age old \\"Irish Problem\\" and end the hostilities once and for all.Roddy Doyle takes us through the slums of early 1900's Dublin and asks the question Why? time and time again. At times the book makes me ashamed to be British and then I pinch myself and remember it's fiction. Or is it? It's the mark of a good fiction writer to make you think.Roddy Doyle is the best Irish fiction writer alive today. Read him and weep!"},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"Those having enjoyed &quot;the Barrytown Trilogy&quot; and &quot;Paddy Clark Ha Ha Ha&quot;, will find this work an abrupt departure from the style and tone of Doyle's earlier works. Though the other novels incorporate a degree of light heartedness and humor, they are also include substantical characteristically melancholy Irish personal interactions. However, this book's following &quot;The Woman Who Walked into Doors&quot; will lead Doyle devotees to conclude that the author has moved to focus on darker, more morose depictions of human behavior.While Doyle's other works are easy reads, surreal aspects of the first part of this book, wraught with symbolism, challenge the ability to &quot;get into it&quot; or to sustain interest. This section focuses on the seamy, unsavory, and just plain revolting aspects of Dublin slum life in the late nineteenth century. I found that the overstatement not only left me with a queasy feeling but undermined the reality of what Doyle attempted to portray.The remainder of the novel is both educational and insightful. Those lacking familiarity with the Irish Easter Rebellion and subsequent civil war will probably have difficulty appreciating what is being described and conveyed. However, despite a considerably amount of distracting hyperbole (e.g.: Henry's superhuman height, strength, maturity, sexual prowess) the book offers some profound observations which transcend the period and events being described. Doyle accurately describes the Irish revolution as being only a revolt, where the British bureaucracy and petty bourgeoise was replaced by a nearly identical Irish counterparts, and that the opportunity for such superficial changes was what motivated many in the Irish uprising. He reflects how access to power subverts guiding principles (if they ever in fact existed) corrupts those who might have initially been led by noble objectives, and prompts colleagues to ruthlessly abandon and attempt to crush former comrades who might now stand in the way of their material advancement. Apt, but chilling and depressing observations on government, society and human relations.This is a powerful book, but the excessive overstatement, symbolism, and hyperbole detract from the profound and crucial observations."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"A star called Henry was one of the best books i have read in the last few years. If you like Irish history you will love this book. Another excellent book i recommend is Tread Softly on My Dreams: The Robert Emmet Story, Gretta Curran Browne. You will surely love this book if you liked A star called Henry."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"The Historical Novel is in many ways a dangerous territory. No description of historic events/times/places are written without the advantage of hindsight and, therefore, without opinions of what went down. This is true for both scholarly works (which this is not, of course) and fiction. When you mix fiction with facts and real people, you also run the risk of falsifying history to your readers: for someone unfamiliar with the time it is difficult to say what is fact and what is fiction.There are few uprisings covered in so many myths as the Irish in the beginning of the last century. The winner writes the history books and some facts become forgotten. Was Michael Collins a good guy or just a ruthless hood? Was De Valera a cynic or the great father of a nation? Doyle adds to the myth by relating the Easter Rising and the following years through the eyes of young Henry, a boy born and raised in Dublin's slum who goes on to become a killer for the Irish Cause-and for himself. He kills and he trains other to kill. All in all, not a very sympathetic guy. But Doyle lets him tell his story unbiased.Since I cannot see through Doyle's motives, I have to keep my distance when reading this book: I cannot allow myself to be &quot;sucked in&quot; in the otherwise very skillfully drawn environment. This is not pure fiction: I am certain Doyle wants to make a point, but I cannot fathom what it is. Surely he wants to say something else than &quot;people were very poor in Ireland and then there was a civil war&quot;. These nagging doubts kept me from enjoying the book, and that is not how it should be. Hence the &quot;only&quot; medium rating.I think the Barrytown trilogy (The Commitments, The Snapper, The Van) was better since I did not have to worry so much about the motives when reading them. Sure, they are commenting and reflecting on the modern Irish society but the author's point of view is easy to grasp and, indeed, to sympathise with.Review written on St Patrick's Day, 2001"},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"This book was difficult for me to get into. Unlike the Barrytown Trilogy which sucked you in - this books seems to push you away. It is almost painful to read as you feel for Henry so much (I am not a sentimental person..). However, what sticks with me is the last line in the book. Made me terribly sad. Brilliant."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"The first of Roddy Doyle's books which I have read, and if his others are as well written and interesting, I am sure to add him to my list of favorite authors. Doyle's writing ability is impressive,as he is able to make the reader actually feel the physical pain endured by his characters.One does not need to have prior knowledge of Irish History to enjoy this piece of historical-fiction. Doyle adeptly gives the reader an insight into the Easter Rebellion, the beginings of the IRA, and the political strife that has existed in Ireland for centuries and continues to this day, without giving a lecture on the subject.Henry Smart, who represents many young Irishmen of this century is an unforgetable character - from his arrival into this world, to his parentless childhood living on the streets of Dublin with his brother Victor, to his involvement in the fight for Irish liberty, to his deception.Overall a very well written, interesting and unforgetable book.I look forward to reading more by Roddy Doyle."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"Doyle masterfully blends historical detail with the brilliantly conceived narrative of Henry Smart. His voice, diction and tone are perfect for this story.

There are a number of set piece events -- Henry's escape from the &quot;rozzers&quot; into the sewers of Dublin -- that are genuinely thrilling. And there are some that take us nowhere and add up to little -- the pointless and repetitive violence in the books second half, for example. There are two big problems with the book: the central figure of Henry never, imo, coalesces into a convincing character and as a result you find yourself watching from a cool uninvolved distance. And second, and most frustrating, the historical material is hard to follow. It seems to me that the book is intended for readers more familar than most with the events in Ireland of the 'Teens and 20s; Irish readers iow.

Then I went to buy it at the book store and couldn't recall the author so I asked and the store clerk nearly lost his pants he was so excited I was buying it. 'One of my favorite books' he told me. So I was pretty excited that this book was going to be pretty good.I really don't think there's much worth explaining, but I really did not like this book at all. In fact, after page 168 I closed it for good which I try to never do -- especially that far into a 350 page book. But it was boring and dry for me with no real plot. It reminded me of Middlesex a bit where there is no real crisis to the plot, except to examine this cultural idea or whatever. Well, this book feels the same to me. It seems more a look at Ireland's history than anything of actual plot line substance. And I don't mean to offend anybody by saying this book was that bad, but for me it really was awful. The worst part for me was the writing. I'm sure it's helpful to be familiar with Irish dialect but the whole read was chaotic and flowed -- well it didn't flow. At all.

If you want to learn it through the eyes of a depressing, amoral, pitiful, continually swearing fictional character named Henry then by all means this is the book for you. I suppose 'artistically' this is a well written novel but I just don't see any enjoyment in wallowing in well written discriptions of disgusting poverty and having to see the F-word several times a page. I'm beginning to think most Irish writers are simply engaged in a contest of topping one another in describing baseness in all phases of human existence. We all know it exists (poverty and suffering...etc.), we all know children are suffering all over the world but I just don't see the entertainment and productivity of continually wallowing in it and noone seems to do that better than the Irish author. Let's do something about it rather than visit it again and again and again in vivid detail. Let's get over it and move on... If you've already smelled and inhaled the stench this book conjures up so artistically well I suggest a couple of Alice Taylor's books for the brighter and positive side of Irish life which also existed and exists. We need more of that. But unfortunately it seems dwelling on the experience of pitiful suffering appeals most to the angst of many of the most talented writers. Don't ask me."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"I tought that this book was very intresting and it kept me reading. I enjoyed it very much!"},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"This is a beautifully written novel! Although Henry's exploits are unbelievable in many places, the book sweeps the reader along through the brutal, unsympathetic, and inhumane life of a poverty-stricken kid/man following in his father's unfortunate footsteps (oops footstep!). The only reason I don't think this fine book earns five stars is that its portrayal of women is absolutely weird. If attractive Henry met one more lady desperate for &quot;the ride&quot;, I might have gagged. Roddy Doyle needs to put more thought into his women characters."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"If you read this, you should then compare it to Ernie O'Malley's memoir of fighting in the Irish independence struggle, \\"On Another Man's Wound.\\" It's one of Doyle's credited sources, and Henry Smart acts out some of that memoir's best moments. The urge to demystify the icons of 1916 has been a strong tendency in recent historical studies of this period, and one that many intellectuals and writers in Ireland have espoused--at least in part.Not that such a suspicious attitude towards hero-worship is not wise. It's just that, taken as an underlying motif in Henry Smart's growing-up, it weakens the novel's energy, and saps its cumulative narrative drive. Doyle describes many incidents vividly (as in \\"Paddy Clarke\\") in specific scenes. He gets down the inner voice of Henry and renders it at times grippingly.Yet, as another reviewer here has noted, you wonder why, if he's so \\"smart,\\" why he does not jump ship for America even before the British make him a wanted man. He spends the second half of the novel on the run, believing not in the cause but only in his cunning, yet he stays and endures not only the Rising, but the Tan War (and even the Civil War--disappointingly glossed over rapidly in the melodramatic final pages), when I could not understand why he remains so long in Ireland, since he has no loyalty to the ideals or the rhetoric or the future of the Irish nation anyway.I know in my mind why Doyle sets up a revisionist narrator, but as a reader seeking a compelling story, his Henry fails to prove to me his smarts. Maybe we are meant to regard Henry as an unreliable narrator, but we are not given any other p-o-v to adequately balance against Henry's worldly-wise slum-kid skepticism. The tale--like its hero--runs out of steam long before it's over. Doyle gives us a young man who can figure out all of his opponent's gambits, but who does not believe enough in himself to win.While attention to this engrossing period is to be commended, and Doyle has read widely while researching the details of early 20c Ireland, his urge to cut down the big figures leaves us with too little to care about. We become as fed up as Henry, and I wonder how the next two volumes will sustain him as he wanders through America. (Although I know I'll read vols. 2 & 3 anyway!)

He is a risk taker where other writers a la Maeve Binchy stick to formula to maintain their ratings and their bank accounts. He is moving and I am pleased to go on the ride with him. I almost waited before I bought the book because I am a little sick of the Dublin slums being trotted out as the back drop for yet another veiled autobiography. Doyle has broken that pattern by introducing us to Henry Smart, a thoroughly unlikable and realistic character.Henry is as dead as his feet are cold. He is damaged goods and there is no apology or epiphany...but he is real. The one thing Doyle does is explain so skillfully that the young zealots and idealists who fight their wars are most often not fueled by conscience or values.They are just Henrys and that is what should scare us most. Brilliant read."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"As a great American Roddy Doyle fan, I long awaited this book, and the promise of a trilogy (or at least one more to follow up &quot;Henry&quot;). I was not disappointed. I was hooked from the start, and loved Doyle's interpretation of &quot;Mick&quot; Collins, Connolly and other big names of the Revolution. As usual, Doyle brings his characters alive, but here, he skillfully interweaves them with equally vivid real-life figures. This is certainly a departure from any of his previous works, and I agree wholeheartedly with the previous reviewer who aptly summed up which Doyle books to read depending on what you're looking to get out of them.However, the one caveat I offer is that I find that this will be a hard book to wholeheartedly recommend to even my most diehard literature-reading friends, as I believe it requires more than a fundamental knowledge of Irish history to fully appreciate the story. I think that a lot of meaning and irony (like waiting for the IRA to put down its arms before sitting down to talk peace) might be lost on readers not following the twists and turns of Irish history.The novel finished with quite a crescendo, and I look forward to following Henry onward!"},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"I read somewhere that Roddy Doyle is JK Rowling's favorite living author... and as I think she is incredibly intelligent, I decided to give him a try. I have to say, I really liked this book. It is not for everyone though, as you can see by other reviews. It is vulgar and hard to follow at points, but in my opinion these things only add to the wildness of the main character who I found fascinating.Henry is a licentious and rebellious person who cannot get enough out of life and seems to be running around causing trouble throughout the entire book. I cannot relate to him at all, but that is part of the fun. It's a wild ride, but it also teaches you a lot about the main players and events of the Irish War of Independence. It also shows you the absurdities of war, and that in war there it is nearly impossible to determine who is good and who is bad.Some might say Henry is full of himself, but to me it seems like he just has a really good idea of who he is, and isn't afraid to let you know. I think it is also a survival technique -a person living in constant danger needs a lot of self confidence to live. He also seems to be about double his age throughout the book, which I think can be attributed to the fact that he grew up in poverty and had to grow up fast.There were moments when I considered putting it down for another book, but I'm glad I stuck with it because at the end of it I was thoroughly satisfied and looking for my next Roddy Doyle book to read."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"Henry Smart is the star in \\"A star called Henry\\". Born on the very beginning of the twentieth century, he was able to participate in the Republic of Ireland's struggle for liberty from the United Kingdom. Born in the utterly poor side of Dublin, he was drawn to live with and fight side by side with important characters in Irish history, like De Valera, Michael Collins and James Connolly, among others.Henry is the narrator of the book. We see everything from his point of view. And he is surely not a history teacher. While the descriptions of his infancy and teenager years in the streets of Dublin are very vivid, the pivotal moments in Irish history are given to the reader as if he (the reader) already knows the historical background. I certainly didn't. After a research done via the internet, things started to become clearer.Doyle writes in gunfight style. Many things happen to his main characters, one on top of the other. The important thing is, Doyle was able to put me right in the middle of a war-ridden Dublin in the early 1900s, and he left me wanting to know more about Henry Smart, as the book ends when he is only twenty (but during the book he refers to things that happened to him after the period portrayed in this story).\\"A star called Henry\\" was my first book by Doyle. I will certainly buy the eventual sequel to this book, as well as \\"Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha\\".Grade 8.2/10"},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"Briefly the premise of the book is the first 20 years in the life of Henry Star growing up in poverty in the troubled Ireland in the early part of the 20th century. Henry is a hard man and becomes involved in the troubles, eventually to be consumed by them.You do not need any expertise in this period of history to understand or enjoy the book. In fact, unless you are very knowledgeable, you will probably learn a few truths. The only thing you need to know is that the English colonised Ireland for centuries and the Irish Republicans were determined to throw them out.I highly recommend this book to any one who is interested in character novels with an historical bent. I am now looking forward to the sequel which Doyle is currently working on."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"The man behind \`Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha' and \`The Barrytown Trilogy', Roddy Doyle, is capable of working more magic than we readers can ever imagine, and \`A Star Called Henry' is a testament to his ability as a historian and a storyteller. Never has a miserably poor Irish childhood like Henry Smart's been described in more beautiful prose, replete with imagery of dead siblings reborn as stars. Henry Smart's boyhood in the dirty, crime-infested streets of Dublin is humorous, touching and often sad. Orphaned not by the death of his parents but by poverty and abandonment, Henry leads his younger brother Victor into a life of crime; hunger and desperation being their main motivation for \`fecking' bread and killing cows with blades hidden in caps. The hard life led by the children is tempered with the tenderness the brothers feel for each other. Henry and Victor's attempt at \`getting an education' is seriously funny, but the gaiety does not last long. Victor dies of tuberculosis, and this bitter experience shapes many of Henry's beliefs and ideals as an adult. By the time he is 14, Henry is a handsome young hulk in the Irish Republican Army. In the Army, he finds love, respect, but also betrayal. At once a love story and a history of the Irish Rebellion, \`A Star Called Henry' is a novel that is all substance and no filler."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"I read this in a college level course and loved every minute of it.

The interweaving of history and fiction together works very well here, in a similiar fashion as Morgan Llywelyn's 1916 and 1921, also excellant documented stories of Ireland's most turbulent times. The characters such as Henry Smart, are engrossing, and completly believable. What seperates this book from 1916 and 1921, is Henry's unique witty humor and dialogue. Along with being an excellant telling of history, it is a fine, captivating story, one I would encourage any Irishman to read."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"A Star Called Henry is a fine book. However, this book is far from a five star. Henry has too much fortune in all his misfortune. In attempts to create suspense, Doyle outdoes himself having Henry elude disaster time and time again. I am sure one had to be fortunate to survive the Irish Civil War, but Henry just has a little too much Irish luck for my liking.On a positive note, I very much enjoyed Doyle's use of the intricacies of the IRA."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"Nowhere near as good as I had hoped, wouldn't recommend, a bit too long and parts of the story went nowhere, was also hoping for a better ending."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"Started reading this book not realizing that the author had indeed created a series from this story . . . hence felt that the book took too long in certain chapters and glossed over others . . . with no clear ending. In other words the ending seemed precipitous - just so that a second book could be realized."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"A cross between Oliver Twist and Angela's Ashes, with a heavy dose of the Irish Republican Army thrown in, this book is the first in a trilogy featuring picaresque hero Henry Smart, alias Fergus Nash, alias Brian O'Linn. He even claims to be Michael Collins from time to time and makes a habit of escaping from pursuers by way of the Dublin underground sewers. Henry joins the IRA not so much for its revolutionary cause as for a means of somehow getting revenge for the extreme poverty that pervades his existence. In fact, it soon becomes clear that the IRA is a haven for boys with a thirst for bloodshed, violence and close calls with death, not to mention food, clothes and firearms. Henry's one-legged father worked as a bouncer for a brothel and also performed the occasional hit for an unseen thug. Henry finds himself doing similar dirty deeds for the not-so-poverty-stricken leaders of the IRA and realizes that the apple hasn't fallen far from the tree. When a friend is targeted for termination, Henry begins to re-evaluate the path his life has taken. His distaste for killing marks him as an enemy of the IRA as well, and he has to go into hiding once again. Sometimes I enjoy a good testosterone-y read, but in this case I never really understood what was the purpose of all the fighting. At first, the insurrectionists didn't even have popular support, and later it became obvious that the IRA were vastly outnumbered and under-equipped, lacking airpower and organization. All they really had was passion, and sometimes that seemed to be aimed in the wrong direction. Even after a compromise was reached with the British, the Irish leaders admitted that change was going to be minimal. Then I suppose infighting led to the Irish Civil War. At least I knew that Henry was going to live to inhabit two sequels."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"I was interested in this subject and had liked the movie The Commitments. I don't know if his style works well with the subject. The main character is very odd, kind of a Forrest Gump, but dirty. This did allow him to witness all sorts of events, but then the other parts didn't work. Gump was in a war, Vietnam, but that was kind of nonsense. I don't think the Irish revolt was nonsense even if there were ugly aspects to it. I'm not sure if Irish people were much like the way he portrays them back then either. They seemed a bit too modern."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"Roddy Doyle spins a yarn about a brash youngster growing up in the worst of circumstances during the Irish War of Independence in his book A Star Called Henry. Henry was named for his father and dead brother who his mother tells him is a star in the sky. Henry's father has a wooden leg which Henry inherits when his father disappears and Henry ends up raising himself and his brother Victor by whatever means available to him.While there are shades of Angela's Ashes in this book Henry Smart is more of a criminal than Frank McCourt ever dreamed of being. The book is about the fight for Irish independence told through Henry's perspective and Henry is a character who is big, strong, can pass for somebody 4 years older, has only to bat his lashes and a likely lass will offer him a bed, and is so slick he can get himself out of any bit of trouble.The book is interesting and fast paced, but Henry is a bit of a male conceived Irish superhero, which of course is a bit of an anti hero and given that I had to roll my eyes just a bit as I read it."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"A Star called Henry is a brilliantly conceived look at the Irish rebellion through the eyes of one Henry Smart. We first meet Henry as a self described Dublin 'Street Arab\\" who is learning survival skills at the tender age of 5 as he struggles to make do in pretty dire circumstances. Flash forward and the teenage Henry is holed up in the GPO during the Easter rebellion with other members of SinnFein and he distinguishes himself enough to be handpicked by Michael Collins for special missions.The character of Henry is Doyle's Irish everyman, who adapts and makes the most for himself in every situation.I was pleasantly surprised by the turns this novel took. It was a very engaging page turner. There is much here that lends deeper understanding of the period than can be gleaned from many formal histories. Fine historical fiction and highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"A STAR CALLED HENRY is the story of Henry Smart - who, born in Dublin in the beginning of the twentieth century, is precocious, handsome, and recklessly adventurous. But more than any of that, he's a survivor. And survive he does, from the bowels of poverty-stricken Ireland (think \\"Angela's Ashes\\") through his role as a soldier in the Irish Rebellion. A STAR CALLED HENRY is the story of Henry's tangles and clashes, and it's replete with Irish history I'll admit I knew little about until I read this book.Though I found the book confusing at times, I never once had the urge to put it down. It's a glorious read, written in a voice that is both funny and poignant.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"Do yourself a favour and read this book.... quickly followed by 'Oh, Play That Thing'."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"Although few authors could handle the premise of this book as well, this story could have been set in Watts or Freetown, Sierra Leone, Kosovo..or maybe even your backyard. That is heavy food for thought. Roddy Doyle is gifted...I will always read his next book; he has yet to disappoint me. His fictional character, Henry Smart, is encouraged to use the cunning he learned trying to survive the mean streets of Dublin...and the rage that kind of life breeds against the English in the fight for Ireland's independence. He fought and won many battles only to discover he had traded one master for another and was still just a pawn in the struggle for power."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"Contemporary Irish authors such as Maeve Binchey, Edna O'Brien, Frank McCourt, and Roddy Doyle have gained in popularity over the last several years, and Doyle's latest novel, A Star Called Henry, is an intense and powerful addition to this rich heritage. Doyle introduces the character of Henry Smart, bringing him from the shining miracle of his healthy birth through his childhood on the streets to early adulthood and into the dark and bloody Irish battle for independence. Even at its ugliest moments, A Star Called Henry is real and forceful and compelling, never allowing the reader to look away or dismiss the characters with pity.Through the eyes of protagonist Henry, Doyle depicts the bitter, dirty, and ugly slums of turn-of-the century Dublin, filled with disease, poverty, hunger and imminent rebellion, a rebellion that will roll through Ireland just as Henry reaches adolescence. Independent at age five, with no food or warmth or comfort to keep him at home, Henry takes to the streets and at fourteen, joins up with the Irish Rebels. Burdened with the legacies of a prematurely senile mother, a betrayed father and dead siblings, Henry throws his lot in with Michael Collins and the rebels during the Easter Rising in 1916, becoming an assassin and trainer of young countrymen.But Henry is not a character to feel badly for, as Doyle injects him with stamina and a zest for life. Doyle makes no apologies or attempts at redemption for Henry, instead chosing to stay true to Ireland's strife and violence and bringing forth a character that remains faithful to this. Even from his earliest, nameless moments in his zinc cradle, Henry struggles to come into his own and lay claim to his name and life. He is a character full of fire, driven by an iron will to endure, and to find the one woman, known only as Miss O'Shea, his counterpart in daring and character. Henry is adept at survival and adapting to the rapidly changing circumstances of Dublin in rebellion, even prospering as a member of the motley crew that is the Irish Citizen Army and becoming a trusted ally of the legendary Michael Collins.Doyle seamlessly fuses Ireland's blood-spattered history of rebellion with Henry's own brutal yet remarkable tale of poverty and survival, never becoming preachy or making excuses. He never looks away from what Henry and his counterparts must do to survive, and therein lies the brilliance. Skillfully, Doyle weaves history and fiction into a spellbinding blend, producing an unlovely but unforgettable portrait of Ireland in rebellion and the cast of characters that made it happen."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"After seeing this book listed as one of the New Yorker's (magazine) top books of the year, I picked it up at the bookstore and thoroughly enjoyed it. Roddy Doyle is an extremely accomplished writer. I do agree with a previous reviewer that Henry was sometimes just a bit too lucky! All in all, I enjoyed learning more about Ireland during that time period."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"I had to write to the reviewer from Ireland who compared Henry Smart to Forest Gump. Forest Gump on crack maybe. Henry Smart is not the Gump.

At times while reading this highly enjoyable novel I was reminded of the movie 'Forest Gump'. The main character, Henry Smart, is located by the author at some of the key moments in Irish history at the time of the insurrection in 1916 and the following civil war. The book does however start slowly giving the impression of drifting forward in essoteric fashion rather than grabbing the readers attention. Stick with it though, it turns out to be well worth it. Forget you politics (if you have any) and enjoy the story..."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"If you liked roddy doyle before, you'll love him after reading this book. If you have read him before but didn't like him, read it anyway, it's quite different to his others. If you've never read him, make this a place to start."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"I am a fan of Paddy Doyle. His books have humor and reality and great style, and his characters are believable, except for Henry Smart the cental character in this novel. The book starts with a rambling almost Joyceian description of the terrible turn of the century poverty in Dublin, then the reality breaks down with the larger than life and thoroughly amoral Henry Smart. He quickly evolves into a sort of Irish Rambo and soon follows up as a bicycle Bonny and Clyde with his lady love as they scourge the country side with a tommy gun on the handle bars. Contrasted with the stark reality of the beginning of this work, and the grainy believability of his earlier books; I have to wonder what the author has in mind. Still Paddy Doyle writes a good yarn and I have a better understanding of the history of the Irish rebellion than any of the history books can convey. Maybe that's his plan, but I'm not sure I'm ready for more instalments, which I'm sure are coming as we leave Henry at age twenty."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"Roddy Doyle started out as a talented, extremely promising young novelist with The Commitments. He got better with his follow-up, The Snapper. Then came The Van, the final story of his Barrytown Trilogy and now he was a major novelist. The movies of those three novels were coming out, each better than the last, and he was writing the screenplay adaptations too. But he wasn't finished. Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha blazed out in 1993 and went on to win the Booker Prize, a true, shattering masterpiece. He took a step backward with the lovely little The Woman Who Walked Into Doors, but it was a great book nontheless. And now . . .A Star Called Henry is a wonderful book, a stunning, stirring fictionalized history of hard times and revolutionary activity being run by savages and monsters fighting an arrogant and oppressive dictatorship. It is hard, it is fast, it is extremely violent and is only part one of another proposed trilogy. There likely will not be a finer novel released this year."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"The first third of the book contains some of Roddy Doyle's best writing, but as the main character grows up the events portrayed become ever more fantastical. My interest in Roddy Doyle stems from his ability to portray the harsh realities of daily life in modern Ireland with a touch of humour but by creating a 'mythical hero' in this novel I find that I cannot believe the story as representing life in Ireland at the beginning of the 20th century. As the novel does not work for me as a fantasy (check out the legends of Finn MacCool or Cuchulain if you want some real Irish heroics) it leaves little to recommend other than Doyle's gift for dialogue which is better represented in his earlier works. Also I don't think his historical revisionism of Irish republicanism during 1900-1920 is as ground-breaking as some people think. There were obviously left and right elements to the events of 1916-1922 and all the participants had pretty much the same human foibles as the rest of the human race. Essentially this novel fails to convince me as to its historicality or to entertain me as a fantasy or to involve me with its characters. Doyle has done better before and hopefully will do better again - perhaps Henry Smart will get killed off early in the forthcoming second part of this trilogy."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"Rarely would I give a 5 star rating to anything that didn't move me beyond my ordinary reality. But, this novel, and, this writer (first time reading Doyle), deserve every bit of praise that I could muster up. Doyle is astonishing. I can't recall anyone that can write like he does. He spins an historical yarn that is epic and personal and universal. There are very few profound truths in this book, exept for the insight that soldiers are really businessmen, and, poverty is the seed of revolution, but Doyle can create a world that you can enter, smell, almost feel his characters, and, most of all, empathize with them. You want to know what's going to happen to them more than you want to know if this is historically correct. I'm sure it's not too far from the truth. My discovery of Doyle is certainly a revelation. I can't wait to read some of his other works."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"Roddy Doyle could have played it safe. He could have continued to crank out more of his hilarious, winning Barrytown books, but he decided to grow as a writer, and we're all the beneficiaries. His latest book is audacious in the scope of its ideas -- and contrary to appearances, this story of the birth of the Irish Republic far from &quot;a well-trodden path&quot; for an Irish author. Doyle's unflinching view of the Rebellion and especially the IRA may anger many people in his native land; they opened my eyes. I'll recommend this book as often and as highly as I can."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"I loved this book! As a Dubliner currently living in the USA, I often find myself in search of a well written book about my homeland. Roddy Doyle usually provides a way for me to feel at home. Although the poverty and violence in the book could not have been further from my own life in Dublin, the characters were all people I knew. Like any well written book, I became emotionally attached to the main character, Henry, and could not put the book down. It was an interesting blend of history and fiction. Roddy took the reader through a wide range of emotions connected to the problems in Ireland and the problems faced by the poor in every city."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"This book took a while to get into, but once I did I could not stop reading. I enjoyed the beginning and middle more than the rather over-the-top ending, but overall the book is still highly recommended. It also inspired me to pick up some of Roddy Doyle's older novels (The Barrytown Trilogy, The Woman Who Walked Into Doors) which are amazing as well. Discover this wonderful Irish author for yourself!"},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"Thank God! At last,a book about the 1916 Rising and the War of Independance that doesn't try to portray the Irish as brave, selfless heroes, and the British as cruel but cowardly oppressors.This book is a triumph, and Mr. Doyle certainly has a way with words when it comes to describing lustful sex scenes set in the basement of a besieged postoffice during a rebellion against an imperial government.A funny, insightful and utterly brilliant book!"},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"This book is a breathtaking and ambitious departure for Roddy Doyle - it is an account of Ireland at the time of republican revolution, told through the eyes of one of Dublin's teeming citizens, who rises - literally - from the gutter, to become one of Michael Collins boys - a cop-killer for the IRA.Not only an account of the birth of the Irish Republic, it is the tale of a one legged whorehouse doorkeeper, and childhood and life of his son, Henry Smart, who finds employment with the IRA not because of burning political ideals but as a means of survival and possible fame.The sheer depth of the descriptive narrative is impressive. Like Graham Swift's Waterland, it serves as a historical document as well as a work of fiction - this reader came away from the novel entertained and educated, and from a British point of view, shocked at the subjugation of Empire.Tragically comic, Doyle exhibits much of the pithy, down to earth, humour of human tragedy that served him so well in his earlier work. It would have been easy to write a biased account of the embattled Irish fighting a united war against the evil English - but Doyle concentrates on the experiences of Henry, who finds that all sides have the capacity for double-crossing and murder.A Star Called Henry marks the maturity of Roddy Doyles' writing, and will doubtless be classed as one of the great works of Irish literature."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"I have to admit I didn't hold out too much hope of finishing this book about a hundred pages in. It had been given to me as a gift, and having never read Roddy Doyle before I was anxious to see what all the fuss was about. The premise sounded promising enough; A young boy in Ireland who grows up to become an I.R.A. terrorist. The book is broken into four sections beginning with his impoverished childhood that could be gleaned directly from the world of Frank McCourt, to his young retirement at the battered and weary age of twenty. Where the book almost lost me was his bloody recounting of the 1916 Easter Day Massacre. This section of the book starts literally with a bang in an almost cinematic vision of gore, glass, bullets, and frightened young men. Not being a history buff, and especially not European History, I was confused at what was suddenly going on without the benefit of a third person narrative to shed some light on the incidents at hand.Luckily, the story snapped back into for me what became a comprehensive progression as he grew up and continued into a violent political destiny. Doyles' characters such as Miss Dolly Oblong, the Madame of a brothel where Henry's father works, seem inspired by the world of Dickens for their richness of character existing in the underbelly of the city.I was glad I stuck with it. It's made me want to learn more about the I.R.A., and about that period in history. That's a testament to the writer and his Henry."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"I have just finished reading &quot; A Star Called Henry&quot; by Roddy Doyle. The story charts the first 20 years of Henry Smarts life from his birth in the slums of Dublin to his involvement with the Irish Republican Movement.Once I was used to the style in which the book was written, which,in my opinion,is Roddy Doyle's finest work to date, I could not put the book down. The characterisation is mesmerising and I found myself almost part of the story, as if I was there as an observer of history. The use of non- fictional characters adds to the realism and I soon found myself believing in the main characters existence.The author has clearly researched the facts thoroughly and whilst the story has a strong political leaning I was not left feeling as if there was any hidden agenda as it clearly portrayed the best and worst of the struggle for freedom.The story has many threads running through it, including a touching romantic theme, and I finished the book both satisfied and craving for the next volume. I urge any fan of Roddy Doyle to read this book as I would anyone with an interest in Irish history."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"Doyle resembles Guinesss...very addictive and obviously, Irish to the core. While the Women who walked into Doors (btw, Ipolan's comment that the Woman...is a &quot;lovely little book&quot; demonstrates either my original theory that Americans cannot fully appreciate British literature - no insult, as I cannot completely appreciate American literature - or that he/she has not read the book, as The Woman who walked into Doors is not lovely at all - it is superficially about a battered wife - and not little, it is towering in genius and presence), was without doubt his most difficult book (for him &amp; us) and his most emotive, but A Star called Henry gives Doyle a massive challenge.You get the impression, with his other books, aside from the Woman..., that they were relatively easy for him to write, with such familiar surroundings and subjects. A Star...takes him before his time and into the partially foreign mentality of Henry Smart.If you are a Doyle virgin, I'll cut to the chase...You want humour and humanity, read the Barrytown trilody.You want a fresh perspective on a hackneyed subject, read Brownbread and War.You want one of the very few realistic and effective first person narratives by a person of the opposite sex of the first person, read the Woman who walked into doors.You want a beautiful, endearing, deeply saddening portrayal of childhood and domestic violence, read Paddy Clarke Ha ha ha.You want Roddy Doyle's most adventurous and demanding effort yet, read A Star called Henry. You won't regret it. Down that Guiness, baby!!"},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"A STAR CALLED HENRY is the first novel I've read by Roddy Doyle, whom I'd never heard of, until I got this book as a gift. Doyle's style is crackling and attention-grabbing. It's certainly an easy book to get into, especially in the first part of the book, where we experience Henry's sorid childhood on the streets of Dublin. In many respects, the beginning is the most solid part of the novel; this is where nearly all of the characterization is done and Henry's humanity is front and center as he mourns for his mother, father, brother, and the life that he never had.As the novel progresses, we witness Henry's involvment in the movement for a free Ireland. These passages are exciting, but not as moving as the earlier chapters. Some of the blame for this must be laid on my shoulders, as I know virtually nothing of Ireland's struggle for independence. Maybe someone more familiar with the history will be more easily drawn into the descriptions of guerilla warfare. Still, even as an ignorant American, I found myself wrapped up in the story. My only complaint is that Henry ceases to change much as a character after he reaches the age of 14. The idealism and violence of the period of \\"troubles\\" does little to alter his outlook, and he seems to possess an uncanny confidence that does not lend itself to much reflection. Henry is unrepentently selfish (not a criticism) and never seems to have a moment when he questions his actions. On the other hand, the novel's statement about the way revolutions shift power to the revolutionaries, and not to the people, is presented in a profound way.A STAR CALLED HENRY is not a life-changing novel by any stretch of the imagination, but is certainly a cut above most fiction, and easily recommendable."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"Roddy Doyle weaves a bit of the blarney with a wealth of Irish history in his amazing tale of young Henry Smart, the anything-but-average poor Irish child. Henry, an unbelievably handsome, rather vain, and seemingly indestructible young Irishman, narrates his own tale-- from pre-conception-- with complete clarity. He recounts a startling self-consciousness in the days just following his birth, already enamored with women and aware of his effect upon them. More importantly, he recalls the early cry of infancy that continues throughout his story: &quot;What about meeee?&quot;Indeed, what about Henry Smart the second, or third? Forced to share the name not only of his father but also of the baby who died before his arrival, our Henry is driven to prove himself a star, a real-life star far better than the celestial spark his mother identifies as her first Henry. This early-established competition takes Henry down strange and dangerous paths, most significantly to the Irish Republican Army and the Easter Uprising at the tender age of fourteen (though we have good reason to doubt his age).It is here that Doyle outdoes himself, depicting the history of Ireland's efforts toward independence within the character of Henry Smart. Proud, vain, loyal, motivated by his own hatred of the class divide--but unaware of the bigger picture-- Henry dedicates himself to the cause and becomes a pawn to men with other agendas. In the twisted path Henry travels, Doyle mirrors the changes in the IRA. And Henry's ultimate departure from that path in favor of searching out his family history and affirming his own identity-- which persists, despite the hell he lives through-- is a hopeful image of Doyle's Ireland reshaping itself in the face of those internal oppressors who replace the British. A Star Called Henry is at once a page of history, packed with pathos, and a rollicking good chunk of the blarney stone. Doyle provides the reader with ultra-real scenes of war and rebellion, then animates those scenes with an almost superhuman fourteen-year-old who is not only drop dead handsome and bulletproof, but also a water diviner, a great escape artist, and apparently the best ride in the nation. Doyle has proven himself a truly gifted storyteller in the great Irish tradition, and Henry Smart deserves a place next to the great shining stars of literary creation."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"What is young Henry Smart to do, with a mother who searches for a non-existent past and a father who ends futures with his wooden leg, with parents chasing after fantasies? He fights, steals, pushes, beats, bleeds, sweats, and yes, *ucks, his way into life. Unlike most protagonists, Henry is not chasing after a dream-instead Roddy Doyle presents us with a character chasing after life. Henry wants to feel the grit of life; he wants to be fully aware of \\"living.\\" Doyle's challenge in this novel is that his main character must always be larger than life because he is trying to encompass all life (including death). In Henry's quest for life, we watch him tumble his way through an impoverished and lonely childhood in Dublin. We watch Henry explode into the Irish rebellion of the Teens and Twenties: wiping off the dust of the General Post Office, shaking off the blood of the \\"spies\\" that he killed. Henry is the definition of active; he lives and blusters and loves and hates-true to the cause of rebellion but never an idealist. Having watched his mother slowly decay and his father abruptly disappear because of idealism, he remains rooted in the physical.We usually think of history being made by the visionaries who can turn that vision into action-Alexander the Great envisions a great Empire and sets about to make it reality. Henry Smart is the opposite-for him, reality is his vision, his driving force. While Henry's reality matches the vision of the rebels around him, Henry is fully in the midst of history: Collins, De Valera, Connolly, Pearse-names that were and are celebrated in song and myth. His reality of a life that encompasses death matches the vision of these Irish heroes for a time-but peace breaks out and what was a seemingly united rebellion fractures. None of the fractions want or need Henry-not the statesmen of the new Irish Republic, who want respectability and clean practices; not the underbosses of the old IRB, who are splitting into the single-minded IRA and local strong men."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"\\"Who was he and where did he come from?...He invented himself, and reinvented.\\" From the early pages of the novel, A Star Called Henry, Roddy Doyle creates a memorable character, Henry Smart, whose search for identity coincides with Ireland's struggle for independence. The history of Henry's life, son of an one-legged, bouncer and sometime hitman for a Dublin brothel, mirrors the often bloody, violent battles of the Irish Rebellion against the oppression of the British Empire. The fictionalized life of Henry Smart, captures the energy, struggles, and contradictions of Ireland's move from British rule to independence.The birth of Henry Smart signals the beginning of his identity crisis. Named for a deceased brother, and his father, initially Henry's birth is met with fanfare and celebration. However, like the marriage of his parents, the beautiful Melody Nash and the beastly Henry Smart, the harsh reality of living in the slums of Dublin replaces all illusions. While first believed to be a blessing from God, Henry comes to represent the pain of too many loss children for his mother and the end of a dream for his father. When Henry's father abandons his family, a young Henry hits the streets, searching for adventure, love, and his father. While living on the street, Henry encounters members of Sinn F&eacute;in, a nationalist organization, and the first of his many identities. After the Easter Uprising of 1916, Henry's reputation as a killer, and lover, grows and sets the stage for his greatest adventure - the truth about his father. Henry's involvement with Sinn F&eacute;in and the freedom of his fellow countrymen, lead him to a startling realization about his father and himself."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"This was the first Roddy Doyle title I've read. It was a compelling book - well written and riveting from the first page. The protagonist, Henry Smart, is finely developed. He provides insight for the reader into the events and emotions surrounding Sinn Fein's fight for the Republic of Ireland in the early 20th century. While written from an Irish perspective, it does not glorify either side of the conflict. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"Doyle's one of my favorite writers, and this story could be classified as slightly above average. Many of the locales were detailed and descriptive to the point of easily recognizing for resident's and historical visitors to Emerald Isle.As Brad Pitt's character said to Harrison Ford's character at the end of the film, 'The Devil's Own,' not all stories have happy endings; a very Irish sentiment. This story doesn't have a happy ending and is obviously written with a future book in mind. The characters are very interesting but not likeable. The theme is very appealing; one can sense the situation and the flavor of the creation of the Republic of Ireland. But Henry's history and maturity is too much to accept for a 20 year man.An interesting read, and vaulable for giving life to the comtemporary history of Ireland. And Doyle' style is always worth your time."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"The first salvo in Doyle's fictional chronicle of 20th century Irish history lands only slightly off the bullseye.Consistently funny, unrelentingly grim, populated by sharp characters speaking pitch-perfect dialogue, A Star Called Henry begins with a bang. The first chapters, detailing the grinding poverty of the Dublin slums, are so arresting the tale that follows can't help but suffer somewhat in comparison.Henry Smart's journey from homeless orphan to folk hero, from troublemaker to terrorist, and finally to an understanding of this journey, plays like myth and documentary intertwined. Though this combination is unusual and powerful, the book flags around the two-thirds mark as the violence becomes repetitive and the characters seem to recede into their more simplistic, folk-hero silhouettes.But Doyle's narrative is purposeful, if perhaps overlong, and he eventually draws his story taut, as Henry's hard won understanding of exactly what he's been killing for brings the book to a wise and chilling conclusion.A Star Called Henry takes some work, but in the end proves well worth the effort."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"The Irish life is an exuberant, cantankerous harmony with a choir of ghosts. In Eire, the past is passion and even the newest landmark looks like the oldest place you ever saw.And Roddy Doyle captures the melodic cacophony of Irish history, passion and appetite in his new novel, &quot;A Star Called Henry.&quot; It is narrated by Henry Smart, who takes us through his first 20 years, from his birth into Dublin's savage poverty in 1901 through the romance of his naive young mother and one-legged alcoholic father.The real ghosts of Ireland's rebellion drift in the background of this novel, providing harmony to Henry's fictional life. The heady passions of Dublin and the quirks of its people are spun into the yarn so deftly the reader will actually hear a brogue in Doyle's dialogue. It's funny and moving at the same time, an Irish peculiarity. But it is also an immense story about a small island where ghosts walk among the living, just as Henry Smart walks among us, real as a Dublin fog."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"Roddy Doyle tells the captivating story of story of a fictional prodigy, Henry Smart, who, by age 20, has been a key behind-the-scenes figure in the Easter Uprising of 1916 and the Irish war of independence from Britain. The story is told in the first-person by Henry.Doyle's description of childhood in turn-of-the-last-century Dublin is reminiscent of the horror and despair of Angela's Ashes. Henry Smart as a revolutionary is a cheap imitation of Conor Larkin of Leon Uris's Trinity.The book is witty, clever, well-researched and highly entertaining. The characters are fascinating, the mark of a great writer. Where actual events or characters are interwoven, the story stands up to the historical accounts. If this book doesn't make you at least crack a smile every few pages, you're too uptight.Yet, the book has its shortcomings. You won't have a clue what's going on if you don't have some understanding of Irish history. A little reading about the Easter Uprising of 1916 and the Irish war of independence, before reading Henry, will help. The language seems too modern, more present-day than early 20th Century (though, admittedly, I did not live in Dublin 100 years ago). The sex scenes, while funny, are gratuitous.Frankly, the protagonist, Henry Smart, is not always terribly likeable. He's a survivor and, apparently, a genius. But he's wise and experienced beyond his years - even for a kid who raised himself - which makes him somewhat unbelievable. It's hard to imagine a 14 year old boy being the object of intense sexual attraction of scores of women, particularly Irish-Catholic women a dozen or so years removed from the Victorian era. It's even harder to believe that a boy, from Dublin's ultra-poor and uneducated masses, would be an invaluable help to James Connolly, author of the Easter Uprising. Perhaps Doyle's trick is that he's telling the story of a conceited compulsive liar. Undoubtedly, the title has several meanings, one being that our hero is a star, a life to be celebrated.If you respect the Catholic Church or whatever was the \\"establishment\\" in both pre and post-independence Ireland, you might be offended by Doyle's thinly-veiled disdain for those institutions.Smart is a cold-blooded killer, atheistic, and angry at the world. His outlook changes little by the end of the book, though Smart's lot in life is greatly improved. To that extent, it has a pleasant ending.Whatever detracts from the story's credibility or tinges it with bitterness does not make this book unpleasant. It is a great read and particularly enjoyable if you love Irish history and culture. While I had higher hopes for this book, I cannot wait to read another Roddy Doyle novel."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"I have not read any of Roddy Doyle's other books, so I don't know if he always employs the technique of &quot;magical realism&quot; in his work; I just know I am not a fan of this particular style. The opening chapters of &quot;A Star Called Henry&quot; are much more engaging than what follows; as Henry grows up I found him a rather boring macho braggart. There are better fictional accounts of the Uprising of 1916 &amp; as far as accounts of growing up poor in Ireland, well, &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; is as good as writing can possibly get. All in all, if readers were not slavering for anything resembling a McCourt book, this novel would probably have sunk without a trace."},{"Title":"A Star Called Henry","review":"This extraordinarily rich tale of young Henry Smart, from his birth in 1901 to age 20, is made even richer by the lyric reading of Roddy Doyle.Henry, son of a one-legged bouncer and hit-man, is the couple's third child and the first to live through infancy. He suffers the quintessential poverty-stricken Irish childhood described rather frequently in current fiction, but he is also a &quot;star&quot; in his mother's eyes.Forsaken by his father before his double digit year, young Henry is on his own and on the streets. Yet he contains such a zest for life and is imbued with so strong a heart that he becomes one of the more endearing protagonists in recent years."},{"Title":"Gods, Demigods and Demons (Greek Mythology)","review":"Of all the mythology books I've read (which is quite an extensive list), this is by far the best of them. Bernard Evslin's book is extremely detailed and contains only known and proven facts and no minor little things that have no use to further a story. Now this is not a book with plot, so don't purchase it mistaking it for one with a story line. What it does do, though, is give you a list of Greek mythological characters and tell you about them, much in the form of an encyclopedia. Many lists of classical mythology characters include only major people and gods. Not this book. It contains so many more than just major ones. It has gods and mortals that I have not been able to find information about in any other way. It also includes many stories of Greek mythology. Besides mythological charcters, it alsoincludes major objects or events like the phoenix, Pandora's box, or the Trojan War. ALso, also, almost every mythology story is in here, from the birth of Zeus to the capture of Persephone. By far superb to all others. A great buy for a cheap price.

The Great War is raging half a world away from the desolate, rocky shore of Greenland where a perfectly good thermos bottle washes up on the wave-swept shore. A man stoops to pick up the strange bottle. Inside is a manuscript-the fantastic story of adventurer Bowen Tyler, who has been taken captive aboard an enemy submarine, and at this moment is battling flesh-ripping dinosaurs and brutal cave men on the lost continent of Caspak. In the uncharted seas at the bottom of the world, the submarine has stumbled upon the towering, rock-bound coastline that kept Caspak hidden for eons.Book one, The Land That Time Forgot, is the story of Bowen Tyler's adventures on the mysterious forgotten continent where the savage inhabitants of millions of years past roam beast-infested jungles. Book two, The People That Time Forgot, begins when Tom Billings goes in search of his lost friend. More giant prehistoric creatures of the land, sea and air of Caspak battle the bewildered but determined Billings. Book three, Out of Time's Abyss, neatly wraps up the Caspak trilogy by unraveling the mystery of the land where time has stopped. The characters of the two previous books reunite in a satisfying and spectacular conclusion.Edgar Rice Burroughs, creator of the Tarzan books as well as the founder of the town of Tarzana, California, lived from 1875 to 1950.

The author has rejected myths, generalizations, and prejudiced thinking to give a fascinating history of Polish Christians and Polish Jews. She is careful to give the viewpoints of both groups, beginning in the Middle Ages and continuing to the present. When she quotes a source, she reminds us that this is that person's opinion, not necessarily a universal truth. She cites to references in Polish, Yiddish, and Hebrew. She does not condemn or defend either group, and realistically argues that neither was right or wrong; some people helped each other, some people harmed each other. She gives a detailed account of the history of Poland that is not widely available in this country. The author is both Polish and Jewish, and grew up in Poland. Her ability to abjectively at her subject is convincing and admirable."},{"Title":"Shtetl: The Life and Death of a Small Town and the World of Polish Jews","review":"Shtetl is an excellent work of social history, although it is also a good outline of Polish history at the political level over the 8 centuries it covers. It is well written and an easy read.The author has a clear agenda, which is to be more balanced in her treatment of Poles than Jewish writers have usuually been and to be more balanced in her treatment of Jews than Poles have been. The book digs deeply into the sources of Polish perceptions of Jews and vice versa. It gives a deep feel for what life was like in Jewish communities in Poland. The chapter on the period between World Wars I and II is particularly good for showing the political, cultural and economic vibrancy that had come even to the rural shtetls. It must be one of the most \\"objective\\" books written about the historical relationship between Jews and Poles. A sympathetic portrait of both peoples that celebrates their virtues and describes their shortcomings as perceived by the other."},{"Title":"Shtetl: The Life and Death of a Small Town and the World of Polish Jews","review":"This book filled me with hope, despair, joy, sorrow and finally, at the end, a disquieting and lingering sadness.

Once here, they successfully assimilated, raised families, and bought homes. Family history and the effects of the holocaust erased the stories from the old country that could be handed down to future generations, including me. Ms. Hoffman's book recreates the socio-political history of Poland, and allows me to piece together various snippets of family history and attitudes and culture. I am sharing this with my family, as there were many &quot;ah-ha's&quot; of recognition for me in reading this work. While dry and more scholarly than I expected in some spots, this book was a gift to read. Thank you Ms. Hoffman."},{"Title":"Shtetl: The Life and Death of a Small Town and the World of Polish Jews","review":"This book paints a complicated portrait of almost a thousand years of relations between Jews and Gentiles in Poland as they played out in a small town or shtetl. Without ignoring the horror of events such as the Holocaust, the author seldom describes this history as black and white; favoring shades of gray and multiple perspectives instead.I appreciated the author's attempts at balance and her non-vindictive tone especially considering her own background. Focussing on how events played out in one particular town, grounds the account in the lives of real people and makes the subject more accessible. This is a good book for general readers but it suffers from overly academic language and a tendency to repeat itself in some places. I also thought the author's thesis about multiculturalism was underdeveloped."},{"Title":"Shtetl: The Life and Death of a Small Town and the World of Polish Jews","review":"This serious, well-researched, and ultimately frustrating book is full of information and analysis.But it is definitely not the companion text to, say, the photography of Roman Vishniac, as the title might lead one to assume. In fact, it's historiography, and the title and subtitle are a bit misleading. It's as much about Poland as about the shtetl, and is -- incomprehensibly -- lacking an index. Hoffman grew up in Poland, emigrating as a teenager, and brings a compassionate mind to the historic problems of that country. Definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Shtetl: The Life and Death of a Small Town and the World of Polish Jews","review":"The superiority of this book over many of the other books out there on Jewish history can be summed up in one word - objectivity. In fact, having read this book, Eva Hoffman will go down in my estimation as one of the most fair and impartial writers known to human kind. Just when she had convinced me of one side of an issue, she would essentially counteract it with an equally compelling argument supporting the other side.Shtetl is essentially a history of the complex and often tangled relationship between Poles and Jewish Poles. Hoffman tells the history of a small village in Poland named Bransk which, at one time, had a demographic that was significantly influenced by its sizeable minority Jewish population. She uses the story of Bransk as a case study and places her findings about this town into a greater historical context with several chapters of in depth research on the history of Poland in relation to the Jewish question.I suspect that, like me, many of the reviewers gave this book four, rather than five stars because of Hoffman's exacting, yet sometimes tedious history of Jewish-Polish relations. In all fairness, although Hoffman is no David McCullough (in the sense of breathing life into monotonous historical facts through superior story telling capabilities), she does masters the English language in her own style (I had a dictionary close by the entire time I was reading). Fortunately, she interrupts the history lessons with meaningful and relevant first-hand accounts from her interviews with individual Jews and Poles who lived in Bransk when the Jewish community was still intact there.If you are looking for a book on Jewish history with strong entertainment value, you've come to the wrong place. However, if you would like to read a refreshingly objective historical account of Jewish-Polish relations, I highly recommend Hoffman's Shtetl."},{"Title":"Shtetl: The Life and Death of a Small Town and the World of Polish Jews","review":"Hoffman traces the experience of Jews in pre-modern Poland, partitioned Poland, the Second Republic, WWII, and the immediate postwar period. There is a wealth of information presented in this volume, and I generally focus on matters not elaborated by the previous reviews.After the Partitions, and particularly as the 19th century wore on, Jewish and Polish political interests increasingly diverged. Consider the situation in Russian-ruled eastern Poland: \\"In fact, Jewish attitudes towards tsarist rule were mixed. In contrast with the Poles, Jewish communities basically accepted the legitimacy of the Russian government, even though they may have bridled against some of its policies.\\" (p. 117). Hoffman sees the later Litvak Jewish immigrants as not so much a force of Russification, as a significant source of pro-Russian political orientation as well as radical-left sentiment (p. 137).By the time of the resurrection of the Polish state in 1918, the Polish-Jewish gulf had grown large. Polish Jews wanted not only civil rights, but, in contrast to western European Jews, also minority rights (p. 164). Not surprisingly, this led to overt separatism. Hoffman writes: \\"In Bialystok, representatives of the Jewish community proposed that the city and surrounding region should become part of Lithuania rather than Poland, because this would put Jews in a better numerical position. The suggestion was met with outrage by Polish politicians.\\" (p. 164). During the Polish-Bolshevik War of 1920, Jewish loyalties were ephemeral. Hoffman remarks: \\"According to the Yizkor Book, views were divided between those who sided unequivocally with the Polish cause, and others who felt that Bransk did not really belong to Poland, and therefore should not be required to supply soldiers to the Polish army.\\" (p. 165)Much has been said about prewar violence against Polish Jews, but little about internecine Jewish violence. Hoffman comments: \\"The factions quarreled, splintered, and accused each other of betrayal and Jewish anti-Semitism. Not infrequently, members of competing parties disrupted each other's meetings and got into bloody street brawls.\\" (p. 179; see also pp. 180-181).Most Bransk-area Jews were murdered by the Germans at Treblinka. Those Jews who managed to flee the ghettos not only faced the danger of betrayal by Poles, but also betrayal by other Jews (pp. 224-225). In fact, two of Hoffman's fugitive relatives perished as a result of a Jew who led the Germans to their hiding place (p. 6).The small percentage of Jews saved owes to the rarity of Jews who escaped the ghettos. Furthermore, Hoffman remarks: \\"The Yizkor Book records several instances in which Jews refused help offered to them by Poles, because they did not want to abandon the others.\\" (p. 223).Hoffman recognizes the fact (p. 2) that the Germans' choice of occupied Poland as the site of the death camps had nothing to do with actual or presumed Polish attitudes towards Jews. She is also open-minded to the possibility that the Kielce Pogrom had been a Soviet-staged event (p. 249)."},{"Title":"Shtetl: The Life and Death of a Small Town and the World of Polish Jews","review":"Very few all-encompassing books about life in the Polish Shtetl before World War II are readily available. Many, written in the 80's, are out of print. It's a shame, because the world is reaching an incredible crossroads -- in Poland, a new-found interest in the history of their tragically absent neighbors - the millions of Jews murdered or displaced because of the Holocaust -- and, 70 years after the death of the Shtetl, we are approaching the final years of living memory of these unique communities. This should be a time of frantic research and recording to help preserve this history before it's too late.For this reason, I had a lot of hope pinned on Eva Hoffman's Shtetl. Overall, it's an excellent resource on the political history of the Shtetl and several hundred years of Jewish-Polish relations. It is a complete timeline, from the origins of the Shtetl, through the many years of solid, virtually unchanging tradition, to their period of rapid cultural and intellectual growth, so heartrendingly close to World War II. In the beginning of the book is an excellent introduction that gives a compelling argument about why learning about the Shtetl is important as part of a complete picture of the Holocaust. The best part of the book, in my opinion, is the extremely detailed and well-researched chapter giving the historical background of Jews in Poland.However, I read the book hoping to get a glimpse of the culture, customs, and daily life of the people in these communities. The book was light in this area, although it did hold some wonderful details. I enjoyed learning about the literary culture that flourished in the beginning of the 20th Century, with many Yiddish publishers printing both classics and new stories which were eagerly read and cherished by the Jewish community in Poland. I also learned a lot about the diverging culture within the Shtetl, with a growing number of people wishing to integrate into Polish society, and the many political beliefs and groups within the communities.The book was both a focus on one particular town, Bransk, and an overall history of Polish Shtetls. I got the feeling that Bransk in particular was chosen because the author relied heavily on a book written by the town's survivors. This gave the feeling that there was a missed opportunity for a richer look at life in the Shtetl had the author had a larger set of resources to draw from. The book and its authors were mentioned so often that at times I felt like putting this book down and picking up the original source!Although its content is a little heavy on politics, \\"Shtetl\\" is engaging, well-written, and approached from a very unbiased and fair perspective. It's an important book on a sadly neglected topic."},{"Title":"Shtetl: The Life and Death of a Small Town and the World of Polish Jews","review":"I must first say that I am blown away by Ms. Hoffman's clear and concise summary of the problems during WWII between the Poles and Jews. She has echoed and clarified my own internal examination of the problem. I have always considered myself a fairly brave person, yet wondered if I would go so far as to try to hide someone in the circumstances at that time. I'm sure! I would as long as I did not have small children at home. I'm just as sure I would not if I had children to protect and survive a war.I have read much of Poles and Jews during and before WWII. Always I have wished there was more interaction between the two groups; considered that the vast social distance between Poles and Jews in Poland surely played a big part in how events occurred at the time. In addition, the Poles themselves, were also trying to survive the German invasion of their country.Enriching oneself by taking the property of \\"disappeared\\" Jews, I am also aware of. That at the war's end, Jews were unable to have their possessions returned to them.How would these same events play out today?

Currently, I am enrolled in a lower level astronomy course and have just completed the book. IN the early chapters the book is supurb, primarily because it relies heavily on definitions, however, further into the book (where it supplies explinations) it becomes extremely confusing. While explaining something the author will quickly spit out 3 or 4 new words which immediately leaves the reader mind boggled. I found myself reading a whole section just to have no clue what it was really trying to say. I recomend this book if you are an advanced astronomy student, yet if you are a beginer or just taking it to satisfy your science core requirment (which I am) stay lightyears away from this book.

Twenty-three essays reflect the breadth of disciplinary competence and the standards of scholarly rigor that Struever instilled in her students and demonstrates in her scholarship. The book is organized around three divisional areas of inquiry: Renaissance Humanism, Histories of Art, and Rhetorics, Philosophies, and Histories. The first part includes studies on Shakespeare and Ariosto; essays on Machiavelli, Caterina da Siena, and Lorenzo Valla; and Manetti on the library of Nicolas V. The section on histories of art contains contributions on L.B. Alberti, on early modern spectacle and the performance of images, and on rhetoric and art. The third section continues with discussions of rhetoric, history, and literature from a more theoretical viewpoint. The book concludes with a bibliography of Struever's works. Authors include: Marvin Becker, Marjorie O'Rourke Boyle, Salvatore Camporeale, F. Edward Cranz, Elizabeth Cropper, Marc Fumaroli, Thomas M. Greene, Michael Ann Holly, J.G.A.

There were no markings or problems with the book that was not stated on the order description."},{"Title":"The Winter's Tale","review":"Can you really make up for lost time? If you betray someone, even if it's only through bad luck or negligence, can you make up for it? If years are lost, can things ever be as they were before?No, they cannot. If a precious vase falls to the floor and shatters, the shards can be glued back together, but the cracks remain to remind you of the loss. The vase that was is gone, only an imperfect reconstruction remains.Leontes is king of Sicilia and he has played host to his good friend Polixenes, the king of Bohemia. Polixenes must return home, but Leontes wants him to stay a while longer. \\"No, no, I must go\\" says Polixenes. Leontes asks his wife Hermione to plead with Polixenes to stay. Polixenes relents and stays.Leontes grows suspicious. Why does his plea fail and his wife's plea succeed? Is there something going on between the two? Jealousy overpowers Leontes. Polixenes goes back home and Hermione goes into hiding.Leontes declares his daughter Perdita to be a bastard and a servant runs away with the baby Perdita to save her. For his troubles, he is pursued by a bear (Shakespeare's most famous stage direction) and killed; Perdita is saved by shepherds. Twenty years pass. Leontes repents his rage and jealousy, and he miraculously finds Hermione and Perdita again.But weren't there many years irretrievably lost? There were. When he first sees Hermione again, she is pretending to be a statue. Leontes marvels at how lifelike the statue is but he immediately notices that \\"Hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing so aged as this seems\\" (act V scene 3 lines 28 and 29). He realizes those good years are gone.The play thus ends bitter sweet. Leontes repents, Perdita is found, and Hermione returns, but those twenty years of what should have been family bliss are gone forever. The family was put back together again, but only as a reconstructed shattered vase.The play is quite dark. Hermione, Polixenes, and Perdita all forgive Leontes, so to a point, this play is like The Tempest where Prospero also forgives those who wronged him. But nowhere in The Tempest is there a hint of the destructive power of time. Prospero feels the pain of having lived in exile on an island, but he is not bitter at having lost ten years or so of his life there. Neither he nor we even think about those lost years.The Tempest urges us towards virtue and forgiveness, but The Winter's Tale is more realistic in that respect. Forgiving is not easy, and it doesn't retrieve what's been lost.Vincent Poirier, Tokyo"},{"Title":"The Winter's Tale","review":"I needed this book for a college class. It was shipped quickly and was in great shape when I got it. Also, it was very affordable, much cheaper than other carriers. Also, it is an entertaining tale from the work of \\"the master\\" Shakespeare."},{"Title":"The Winter's Tale","review":"I feel like this Shakespearian play doesn't get enough face time. The first time I ever saw its title, I was in High School, looking at the names of all the plays Shakespeare ever wrote. We all know about his overly famous plays, like Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, A Midsummer Night's Dream, but what about The Winter's Tale? I was intrigued by the title at the time, and the fact that I'd never heard of it before (and with a brother heavily into Shakespeare and acting, that was unusual). I've never seen this title on a playbill, though I'm sure it must be preformed somewhere, and my curiosity about this play was peaked--though in High School I didn't do anything about it. Recently, I had to teach Hamlet, and as I was looking on Amazon for a copy for my Kindle, I once again came across The Winter's Tale. As it was a free copy, I scooped it up and read it right away, just to assuage my curiosity.It was interesting. In my opinion, it's not really like Shakespeare's other plays. It's a bit intense in the beginning, and though there are comedic scenes, I wouldn't necessarily classify this as a comedy, nor a tragedy either. A romance, I suppose, but for me, it's a bit strange. Through a little research I found that Shakespeare actually modeled his play off Pandosto, by Robert Greene (which I've never read), but I, personally, see much of Oedipus Rex in this play. I know Shakespeare dealt a lot with Greek mythology in his works, and The Winter's Tale seems to really follow that of Oedipus Rex. I'm not going to give the entire synopsis away, or any spoilers, but, like Oedipus, King Leontes is a haughty man, paranoid. He refuses to listen to oracles and attempts to do away with his newborn child by sending her away to die. While there are many differences between The Winter's Tale and Oedipus, there are also many similarities and I found this rather interesting, especially because I really enjoy Oedipus. That being said, I'd like to see this play preformed someday, I always tend to like plays more when they're preformed, so I'll have to keep my eyes peeled for this one.(Please note: I use the star rating system of Goodreads, which is different from that of Amazon. My overall rating is that I liked it.)"},{"Title":"The Winter's Tale","review":"\\"The Winter's Tale\\" is one of Shakespeare's last plays, and it boasts one of the best ensembles of characters in the entire canon. This is a text where no single character dominates, and many have more than one brilliant moment.The play follows the jealously inspired downfall, and eventually redemption, of King Leontes. While taking us on that journey Shakespeare glorifies the ideas of grace and forgiveness, the simplicity of country life, the lasting bonds of friendship, the power of parenting, the ardor of young love, the patience of mature love, and in the great character of Paulina, the lengths and benefits of loyalty. This text is the result of a writer at the top of his game, and the episodic plot (it takes place over 16 years) allows the Bard to weave in many varying themes that lead to a pleasing and satisfying conclusion.This text is often maligned as not one of Shakespeare's better efforts, and I wholeheartedly disagree. Read it, and then try to find a really superior theatre company doing a performance. Enter the kingdoms of Sicilia and Bohemia; meet Paulina, Autolycus, the Old Shepherd and his doltish son, as well as many others. You will be glad you did!As for the Pelican Shakespeare series, they are my favorite editions as the scholarly research is usually top notch and the editions themselves look good as an aesthetic unit. It looks and feel like a play and this compliments the text's contents admirably. The Pelican series was recently reedited and has the latest scholarship on Shakespeare and his time period. Well priced and well worth it."},{"Title":"The Winter's Tale","review":"\\"A Winter's Tale\\" is two romances in a single play. The tragic but open romance of Leontes and Hermione, and the ultimately joyful but initially clandestine romance of Florizel and Perdita. The tale spans more than a decade and can serve as a cautionary tale about mistrust and jealousy.My favorite character was Autolycos. Rogue, thief, impersonator of nobility, but the linkage that pulled some of the threads together in the end.This one feels long, even by Shakespearian standards. On the other hand it was easier to follow than other Shakespeare plays. A great story with the capacity to present well on stage or screen. I'm just sorry folks don't hear about this one more.E.M.

I'm very impressed with Amazon.com who delivered it quickly and cheaply!The CD itself is great. It really helps to hear the play, as the intonation is correct, which is sometimes difficult to do when reading it yourself.The actors' voices are clear and suit their parts perfectly. I'd definitely recommend it - and I will look out for more titles in this series when I've finished studying this one!"},{"Title":"The Winter's Tale","review":"Although this play is not one of Shakespeare's better known plays, it is one of his very best. It is a tragicomedy suffused by gentle melancholy. Unreasonable and cruel jealousy are also portrayed. We also have two endearing young lovers to liven up the story. These characters are very well-drawn, and the story is quite beautiful."},{"Title":"The Winter's Tale","review":"This play starts nice enough with Leontes (King of Sicilia) and Polixenes (King of Bohemia) enjoying a friendly visitation. Suddenly, out of nowhere, King Leontes gets struck with a spell of mental illness. He suspects that his wife Hermione is pregnant (not through him), but his friend Polixenes. To Shakespeare's credit, he does not limit the mental illness to sexual jealousy, but a fear that Hermione and Polixenes are plotting to murder him. Leontes's adviser Camillo is disturbed by this and tells Polixenes that he must flee for his life. But this leaves the issue of Hermione. Leontes puts her on trial for infidelity. She naturally protests her innocence, but Leontes is so struck by his illness, that he is deaf to her pleas. Paulina tries to soften Leontes with his new daughter Perditia, but Leontes is trapped in his madness and wants the child burned. Antigonus (Paulina's husband) pleads for the child's life and Leontes says that Antigonus must leave the child somewhere in a barren land. (Failure to do so will not only lead to Antigonus's death, but Paulina's as well.)Antigonus is often looked on with less than fairness. He pleaded for the child's life and was threatened not only with his own death, but the death of his wife as well. Antigonus reluctantly leaves to perform this task. An oracle declares Hermione is innocent. But as Asimov pointed out: \\"In fiction, oracles may interpret, present, and foretell future with faultless vision; in actual fact, they can do nothing of the sort.\\"Paulina reports Hermione's death. Also, Leontes's son dies, and more realistically, that seems to break the spell of Leontes's madness. As sorry as Leontes is, the harm is done. Also, poor Antigonus is killed by a bear as he leaves the child (as directed under threats) in Bohemia. Perhaps reminding us that Antigonus is to be pitied, Shakespeare has Antigonus follow the directions of Hermione (in a dream) as to where to place the child. Though it may have been more fortunate, if she had told him to bring the child back to the penitent Leontes.But now, Shakespeare has to give us the romantic plot of Perditia and Florziel. (Romances usually have their annoying flaws.) But now the tone of the story changes. Perditia (the abandoned girl) is brought up by a kind shepherd. Well, onto act 4, 16 years have passed. We see that Leontes has been through a long and sad penance. (But we won't see him again until 5.1. Well, Polixenes has taken Camillo into his employ. Polixenes has been suspicious over the strange activity of his son Florziel. So Camillo agrees to help him find out what is going on. In disguise, they spy on Floziel and meet with him. We then meet Autoclyus who is a literary reincarnation of Falstaff. He is a rogue and thief, but a really likable one.4.4 is VERY long. Polixenes is furious that his son has fallen in love with a common woman. No one knows that Perditia is a princess. (Not even her.) And of course, Florziel is not frightened of being disinherited. And if we are not blinded by this romantic plot, we may see that Forziel has been somewhat disrespectful to his father (while he didn't recognize his father), and that Perditia has not been overly kind to the shepherd who raised her. She knew Florziel was a king's son, and she did not have the decency to let her 'father figure' know what was going on. As Asimov pointed out: \\"Heaven only knows how many marriages have been ruined because real life could not fulfill the dreams of the romance-fed girl.\\"Autoclyus offers great comical touches as he deals with counterfeit goods, makes a fortune, and is able to trade his older clothes for new and extravagant ones. In addition, people think he's a courtier!In a good scene of reversal, Forziel and Perditia make their way to the penitent Leontes for help. But even here, the romantics are not so likable. They make up a story that Perditia is a princess from Libya. But reality re eneters, and Leontes rises from his state of sorrow and agrees to talk to Polixenes on their behalf. Leontes does this, and all is well. Leontes and Perditia even realize their relationship to each other.Paulina also reveals that Hermione is still alive. Leontes also has a hapy ending. Even Autoclyus agrees to mend his ways. But Asimov points out that it does seem strange that Paulina kept Hermione from the penitent Leontes these 16 years.That said, it is a good play filled with sadness,reversal, hope, a reincarnation of Falstaff, and a happy ending."},{"Title":"The Winter's Tale","review":"What can i say? I enjoy shakespeare as much in this book than any other. I recommend it to anyone who finds themselves confused and in a world of many realities to read this book and they will find much sence and at the same time escape into the world of their imagination."},{"Title":"The Winter's Tale","review":"Here's a suggestion for high school English teachers: Instead of teaching a comedy like \\"The Taming Of The Shrew\\" that ticks off half your class, or a tragedy like \\"Hamlet\\" that could bore even more of them, why not take a walk on the wild side and make this winning genre-bender your mandatory Shakespeare play?For its first three acts, \\"The Winter's Tale\\" is a hard-nosed, riveting tragedy about a Sicilian king named Leontes who jealously mistakes his wife Hermione's hospitality for their guest, the Bohemian king Polixenes, as something more carnal. Misery ensues. A heir dies, another is sent away to die. At a trial protesting her innocence, a broken Hermoine pleads her innocence to the unyielding Leontes in a touching, tender way: \\"The crown and comfort of my life, your favor/I do give lost, for I do feel it gone/But know not how it went.\\"Then the play shifts course and becomes a rustic romance featuring a prince and a shepherd's daughter. Even though the two parts are connected, and you know why thanks to a bit of narration from \\"Time\\" himself, it does feel like a Midwinter Night's Dream, with clowns, rural tricksters, and a more lyrical tone predominating along the course of one of the longest scenes (Act IV, scene iv) I think the Bard ever wrote. \\"For you there's rosemary and rue; these keep/Seeming and savor all the winter long,\\" says the daughter as she chooses from an array of flowers to greet guests at a shearing party. (The title is a bit of a misnomer; this part of the play is actually set in fall.)While not the most compact or linear Shakespeare I've read, \\"The Winter's Tale\\" is immersive and satisfying. Even better is to see it performed; the play moves in ways you don't expect from Elizabethan drama with twists and turns featuring characters that you come to care about as people.In Leontes you have a character of deep moods which pull him in directions bad and good. His part in the first three acts is a tragic arc all by itself. Then you get Act IV. The main character here is Perdita, the shepherd's daughter, who acts as much from quiet wisdom as Leontes did from mad anger and yet suffers all the same. Is Shakespeare making comment about the blind mutability of nature, or the importance of sticking to your moral character no matter what?This was one of Shakespeare's last plays, written around 1610. It is said to have been followed only by \\"The Tempest\\" and a collaboration history play about Henry VIII, so it has Shakespeare pretty much at the point of having learned all he would. While \\"The Tempest\\" is revered for Shakespeare taking his bows as a creative giant, \\"The Winter's Tale\\" feels more like him putting it all together and taking some narrative chances in the process. This is not as lyrical a play as \\"The Tempest,\\" but it's far more dynamic and absorbing. Forgiveness and redemption are at the center of both plays, but here the emotional aspect is played out for all it is worth.While Leontes and Perdita alternately draw our attention, there are also gripping secondary players like Polixenes; Paulina, whose bitterness about Leontes' treatment of his wife is understandable yet effective at transferring our sympathy over to the misguided king; and Autolycus, \\"a rogue\\" who brings a lot of timely comedy into the fourth act. Autolycus is strategic comic relief; the right actor can make an otherwise solid staging into a stellar delight, as was the case with a Yale Repertory Theater production I saw in 1986.\\"The Winter's Tale\\" may be a favorite of mine, but I don't think I can rank it as among his greatest works. The two halves really are separate animals, the full-stop in between seems a cop-out, and I found the dispatching of one of the minor characters, though employing one of Shakespeare's most famous stage directions (\\"Exit, pursued by a bear\\"), disappointing. The big revelation scene occurs offstage, told to us via third parties, but I'm still not sure whether that's another cop-out or one of Shakespeare's most dynamic and successful gambits, setting up a final scene even the most jaded reader will come away remembering for a long time.Reading it is fun, and definitely different for those expecting another blood-and-thunder tragedy or happy pastoral gambol from the Bard. This one time you get the better if not the best of both."},{"Title":"The Winter's Tale","review":"Then read this before you retire from Shakespeare! I read this in AP English after Hamlet, and I have to say that this was a surprise to me. The Winters Tale is refreshing compared to Shakespeare's earlier tragedy works. No one dies in this play except for one person instead of the entire cast.This is mainly a love story with several different types of love affairs- Leontes and Hermoine, Leontes and Polizenes, Farid and Perdita... There is no single major character as this play is set up in two different time periods and each character mostly acts independently of each other.As for the characterization in the play, readers can observe the classical Shakespearean characters (similar characteristics to the earlier plays) and newly personality designed characers. This mixed play reveals Shakespeare's transition from his original writings to his attempt to prove his audience that there is good in life.I recommend this play for readers and interested literature majors because I have found this play to be widely used on college campuses and I can see why. Although we are done and we spent some time but I felt that this play deserves to be discussed in depth since there are many different elements to it. Even short plays can evolve into a course as well as long Russian style novels."},{"Title":"The Winter's Tale","review":"This play, in my opinion, is Shakespeare's greatest. It doesn't have the great quotes or the great characters or the action of many of his plays, but it has a 'Surprise Twist' which caused chills to run through my entire body. I read ALL of Shakespeare's plays and 'The Winter's Tale' is the ONLY one which shocked me at the end, took my breath away, and sent chills through my body.If you read only one Shakespeare play, make it 'The Winter's Tale'. I am so surprised that nobody ever recommended this play to us when we were in school. People just talk about Hamlet, Macbeth, Othello, King Lear, and Romeo and Juliet, but 'The Winter's Tale' beats them all. Read it!!!

Go elsewhere for indepth analysis."},{"Title":"The Winter's Tale","review":"\\"The Winter's Tale\\" is one of Shakespeare's most underrated works, probably because it can't be easily classified as a romance or a comedy. That's a shame, because this lush, emotionally-wrenching little play displays Shakespeare's powerful writing and fine grasp of human nature. It's just incredibly moving and exquisitely written.Polixenes, the King of Bohemia, has been visiting his pal King Leontes in Sicilia, and eventually he wants to go home. But after Queen Hermione convinces him to stay awhile, Leontes suddenly goes nuts and decides that Polixenes and Hermione have been having an affair, and that her unborn child must be his old friend's. Polixenes flees back to his own land, and Hermione dies soon after her newborn daughter is abandoned in the wilderness.Of course, Leontes soon finds out that he was off his gourd, and that poor Hermione was completely innocent. Charming, isn't he? Sixteen years later, Polixenes' son Florizel falls in love with a mysterious young shepherdess, who is actually Leontes' daughter Perdita (of course!). But with royal opposition to their marriage, the young couple must overcome many obstacles before everything is settled happily.\\"A Winter's Tale\\" is a curious hybrid of Shakespeare's different theatrical \\"types\\" -- there's some gentle comedy, some mellow tragedy, and a hefty dose of romance. The first three acts are basically one long disaster, with Leontes' crazy paranoia destroying his friendships, marriage and children's lives, until it seems that there's no happy ending for anybody.But the last few acts are very different. Shakespeare's writing takes on a more romantic, sweet tone, particularly when Florizel and Perdita are lavishing lovers' praise on each other (\\"My prettiest Perdita!/But O, the thorns we stand upon!\\"). Having worked up a massive tragedy in the first parts of the play, Shakespeare spends the latter half repairing all the cracks in the characters' lives.If there's a flaw in the story, it's that Hermione is so in love with a crazy belfry-bat like Leontes, but I suppose his story is meant to show the folly of letting suspicions rule your actions. Florizel and Perdita are charmingly earnest young lovers who initially know nothing of their parents' tragic past, and there are solid supporting characters like the thief Autolycus and the steadfast Camillo.\\"The Winter's Tale\\" is an emotionally wrenching but eventually uplifting story, and a roller-coaster ride that plunges you down into tragedy before hoisting you back up."},{"Title":"The Winter's Tale","review":"I enjoyed this play a great deal. After the theatre at my college performed it, I became interested in the story and decided to read it. Reading it only added to my appreciate of the work.

You can know how a person become crazy because of jealousy.I thought how complicated the context is. So, I can't say the whole outline in this book report. Many people have connection with each other in the small world. And this is the reason many incidents happen one after another and that this story is interesting, I think.As I wrote in the first paragraph, I think this story is comedy.

The Winter's tale is one of my all-time favorite Shakespearean stories.The story revolves upon tragicomic figure of Leontes, King of Sicilia. Essentially a good King, Leontes buys himself a heepin' spoonful o' trouble and grief because of his suspicion, envy, and foolish rashness.I won't spoil the story here so I will end by saying that The Winter's Tale is a wonderfully entertaining story of romance, loss, redemption and restoration. It is of course superbly written; with Shakespeare tossing in one of his great comic rogues: Autolycus.This book gets my highest recommendation"},{"Title":"The Winter's Tale","review":"Playscripts are more like blueprints than finished products, and this one is no exception.

Leontes' initial rage is too sudden and abrupt. Furthermore, there is something too artificial about the happy ending when Shakespeare makes it clear that Camillo will marry Antigonus' widow Paulina. Antigonus is too awkwardly dealt with. Remember, Leontes threatened to kill him and his wife if he did not agree to leave the infant girl in the wilderness. But all of that aside, the play is an excellent piece of literature. Leontes' rages are frightening and effective. Furthermore, his regret and repentance is touching and convincing. Antigonus is memorable as the martyr who offers us some comical touches. Hermione is fine as the forgiving queen. Perdita and Florizel are pretty good as the determined young lovers. Camillo deserves special notice as one of the few level headed characters. First he protects Polixenes from Leontes' fury, and then he protects Perdita and Florizel from Polixenes. But the most memorable character could very well be Autolycus, who in my opinion is a literary reincarnation of Falstaff. This play does have its weaknesses, but it also has good poetry, drama, comedy, moments of suspense, interesting surprises, and well developed characters."},{"Title":"The Winter's Tale","review":"I read shakespear a lot.

It's light tone that lacks in syrupy drama and exaggeration yet contains elements that get you where it counts makes for a well put-together play. I recommend it."},{"Title":"The Winter's Tale","review":"Ask anyone to name a play by Shakespeare and it most likely will be Romeo and Juliet, or Hamlet, or Macbeth or even Othello. Rarely will you ever hear anyone say The Winter's tale, but is its lack of popularity due to it being any lesser than Shakespeare's other works? Unfortunately I would have to say yes.The play is taken from Greene's Pandosto and follows it quite closely in most parts. The plot is fairly simple, Leontes, the King of Sicilia gets into a jealous rage over his what he believes is his wife's infidelity with his friend. This causes him to break off a close relationship with his childhood friend the King of Bohemia and his servant Camillo. He also banishes his daughter, and kills his wife and son by flouting Apollo's judgement that Hermione, his wife, is innocent.The second part of the play is concerned with the reunion of his banished daughter and her newly acquired husband with Leontes. There is a surprise at the ending which I will not spoil for those who have not yet had the opportunity to read the play.If you've read Othello, you will find similarities between Othello and Leontes and also between Desdemona and Hermione. The only major difference is that there is no Iago in this play; Leontes is his own Iago. Shakespeare in Othello develops the reasons for Othello's suspicion of Desdemona, unfortunately this is lacking in The Winter's Tale. There is not much of a motive and the reader (or audience) is asked to believe that Leontes develops his jealous rage over one minor incident and almost immediately.Another problem I have with this play is with the surprise ending. Here again, there is not much of a clue as to how this happens, it is just assumed that we will accept it unquestioningly as fact. Apart from these minor \`faults' the play is still an interesting read, and as always the inclusion of the clowns and Autolycus give it some lightness which balances the tragedies.If you'd like to dive deeper into the play, I'd suggest the commentary by Fitzroy Pyle (1969) which I found to be quite helpful."},{"Title":"The Winter's Tale","review":"This seller was very prompt and gracious.

It takes a while to comprehend all of the Shakespearian langauge, but is very interesting. It is boring at parts."},{"Title":"The Winter's Tale","review":"As usual in Shakespearean plays, the language here is very prettily written. As usual in Shakespearean comedies, there are plot holes that one could easily drive a tank squadron through. But since this is not just a comedy, but a tragicomedy, in which the first part is a tragedy and the second a comedy, not everything comes out well in the end: some worthy characters die. Also, as is usual for Shakespeare, we have a morality play on the evils of jealousy and closed-mindedness. Really, though, other than the pretty Shakespearean turns of phrase, there isn't much to recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Winter's Tale","review":"THIS REVIEW APPLIES TO THE KINDLE VERSION ONLYThis is another example of lazy publishers dumping text into a Kindle \\"book\\" and foisting it on the public without so much as a 10 second skimming of the text to see if it is worthy of release. It isn't. The text of the play is paginated so poorly that footnotes are now interspersed in the text (footnotes are helpful for reading older plays) and line numbers are now embedded in the text and the indication of who is speaking what lines are often jammed together.As I said before, a supremely lazy effort that makes the kindle and e-book concept look bad."},{"Title":"The Winter's Tale","review":"The Winter's Tale is a lot of things: heart-breaking, exhilerating, funny, beautiful, romantic, profound, etc. Yeah, it's all here. This is one of the bard's best plays, and I can't believe they don't teach this in schools. Of course, the ones they teach are excellent, but I can see high school kids enjoying this one a lot more than some of those others (Othello, King Lear).The story is, of course, brilliant. King Leontes goes into a jealous rage at the beginning against his wife Hermione. Leontes is very mistaken in his actions, and the result is tragic. Shakespeare picks the story back up sixteen years later with the children, and the story works to a really, really surprising end of bittersweet redemption.This is one of Shakespeare's bests. The first half is a penetrating and devestating, but the second half shows a capacity for salvation from the depths of despair. Also, this being Shakespeare, the blank verse is gorgeous and the characters are well drawn, and the ending is a surprise unparalleled in the rest of his plays. The Winter's Tale is a truly profound and entertaining read."},{"Title":"The Winter's Tale","review":"For me The Winter's Tale is the most satisfying of Shakespeare's plays. And why? It may not be Hamlet for tragedy, it may not be Twelfth Night for comedy -- indeed, perhaps in the great objective sense this is not nearly his best; but as a coherent work this has them all beat. Here we find all sides of Shakespeare's genius on display: Leontes shares his intense sexual jealousy with Othello, and Florizel and Perdita take their light-hearted romantic comedy interplay (complete with disguises and recogntions) from the best of Shakespeare's comedies, before his sense of the romantic soured into the bitter genius of the problem plays. Add that to the eerily lyrical poetry of Act IV, and you've got a masterpiece. The Winter's Tale is laugh-out-loud funny at times; it's ribald; it's profoundly tragic; and in the end, it's a look at the craft of theater, the craft of literature and ultimately the craft of living. Unjustly ignored, The Winter's Tale is easily as good as its immediate successor, The Tempest -- and that's high praise indeed."},{"Title":"The Winter's Tale","review":"Early compilers of Shakespeare's plays classified this a comedy, but there is much tragedy in it. Later it was called a romance. Through irrational jealousy a king is apparently responsible for the deaths of his entire family -- wife, son and daughter -- by mid-play. Time is a character in the play and at his one appearance summarizes the passage of sixteen years. If you have an overy high regard for realism, you may not much enjoy this play, but that will be true of more of Shakespeare than just this one tale. I thoroughly enjoyed it.I look forward to seeing it. I've ordered the BBC DVD and it's being performed at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in 2006. These Cambridge School editions have the play's text on right-hand pages; they have summary, commentary and exercises, and vocabulary on the facing left-hand pages. As I read through the play, I'd read the summary, read the play text paying attention to vocabulary, and then read the commentary and exercises. Some additional, unusual vocabulary was only explained in the commentary.

If you think you know all about how a play must be constructed, read The Winter's Tale. It will greatly expand your mind.The play opens near the end of a long visit by Polixenes, the king of Bohemia, to the court of his childhood friend, Leontes, the king of Sicily. Leontes wants his friend to stay one more day. His friend declines. Leontes prevails upon his wife, Hermione, to persuade Polixenes. Hermione does her husband's bidding, having been silent before then. Rather than be pleased that she has succeeded, Leontes goes into a jealous rage in which he doubts her faithfulness. As his jealousy grows, he takes actions to defend his misconceptions of his \\"abused\\" honor that in fact abuse all those who have loved him. Unable to control himself, Leontes continues to pursue his folly even when evidence grows that he is wrong. To his great regret, these impulsive acts cost him dearly.Three particular aspects of the play deserve special mention. The first is the way that Shakespeare ties together actions set 16 years apart in time. Although that sounds like crossing the Grand Canyon in a motorcycle jump, Shakespeare pulls off the jump rather well so that it is not so big a leap. The second is that Shakespeare captures entirely different moods from hilarious good humor to deep depression and remorse closely adjacent to one another. As a result, the audience is able to experience many more emotions than normally are evoked in a single play. Third, the play's final scene is as remarkable a bit of writing as you can imagine. Read it, and marvel!After you finish reading this play, think about where your own loss of temper has had bad consequences. How can you give yourself time to get under control before acting rashly? How can you learn to be more open to positive interpretations of events, rather than dark and disturbing ones?Love first, second, and always!"},{"Title":"The Winter's Tale","review":"A sad romantic play about human behavior and emotions ...a merciless decision issued by the king Leontes against his wife Hermione and his boyhood friend Polixenes is the shocking beginning of a real tragedy ....immaturity,mistrust and devastating jealousy that completely blinds Leontes of seeing the truth and the consequences of his actions..Just like a real life story ... call it destiny or Shakesperean justice ... everything evolves to bring those apart back together ... but it takes time to learn and change.

This is the occurrence that sparks the King of Sicilia's jealousy and forms the basis of this play (written circa 1611) by William Shakespeare (1564 to 1616).(Note that this play is traditionally classified as a comedy but is more accurately known as a tragicomedy or romance.)Having this play recorded on this compact disc set is a treat. This play (of five acts or fifteen scenes) is presented as uncut, fully dramatized, and accompanied by original music. This recording aids in comprehension by bringing the play to life using the voices of distinguished actors.Included with the compact disc are liner notes that include among other things a complete cast list and a synopsis of each scene. What I did was before each scene, I paused the recording, read a particular scene's synopsis, and then listened to that scene. Doing it this way resulted in (for me anyway) complete comprehension of this play, something not easily obtainable when you simply read the play.With respect to the play itself, it should be remembered that in most cases, the characters are not realistic. Jealousy appears with little motivation; characters perform actions that are symbolic rather than believable in terms of everyday life; common sense seems frequently to be lacking. (In fact, this is why many 17TH and 18TH century critics dismissed this play as absurd and totally lacking in reason.)However, it seems to me that Shakespeare deliberately made most of these characters symbolic rather than realistic. The themes of the play (evil, repentance, and reconciliation) are of such a universal scope that they must be represented clearly in its characters.This play is famous for the stage direction that Shakespeare gives in Act 3 Scene 3: \\"Exit, pursued by a bear.\\"Finally, for those playing this compact disc on their computer compact disc player, beware that a \\"cookie\\" of 0.1 KB size is stored on your computer's hard drive.

Leontes, King of Sicilia, is one of Shakespeare's most convincingly self-tortured characters, while Hermione is an icon of long-suffering patience, incarnated in the famous statue of the play's conclusion. Her daugher Perdita is the subject of potentially blasphemous adoration, not only for her suitor Florizel but for the entire world; she glows in the suggested light of pagan mystery cult, the Eleusinian mysteries of mothers and daughters in secret collusion with nature and against the withering forces of jealousy and death. In this light, the critical essay included with this edition is sadly tone-deaf to Shakespeare's potent poetic raptures in this play, hearkening instead to a dogmatic, albeit at least clearly presented, rehearsal of Renaissance attitudes about &quot;patriarchy&quot; which deadens Hermione and her faithful advocate Paulina into mere totems for self-exculpating males of the sort whom Shakespear embodies, with withering criticism, in Leontes and the judgmental Polixenes."},{"Title":"The Winter's Tale","review":"Though usually overlooked, this is a play with a finely woven plot (even though it does not all mesh together until late in Act V), complex characters, and echoes and allusions from such disparate plays as \\"Othello\\" and \\"Macbeth\\". The poetry here is Shakespeare at his finest - Leontes' soliloquies are fascinating and offer a pitch perfect glimpse at one whose jealousy blinds him completely,while Perdita and Hermoine are part of the same theatrical pantheon as Rosalind, Miranda, and Viola.Those who only enjoy realistic plays (well, Shakespeare's version of realism anyway) may find the plot much too far-fetched; it is a fairy tale with psychological depth, a wondrous mixture of genres that almost out Cymbelines' \\"Cymbeline\\".As usual with Arden, the introduction and notes are informative without being intrusive. If you are a lover of theater you will love this play. The recogntion scene in the last scene is one of the Bard's finest, most dramatic and moving scenes.

His insights into the human condition are possibly the most profound to come from the HolocaustIn Messengers of G-d, Wiesel takes classic characters using classic midrash and make them utterly modern. This book might be a surprise to those familiar with Wiesel only through his Holocaust texts, but it should also be a pleasant surprise. From Adam to Yitchak to Job, Biblical characters are infused with a universality largely forgotten by modern commentators.While this is essentially a Jewish book, it should be enjoyable to anyone who's wanted to study either Classic or Biblical texts."},{"Title":"Messengers of God: Biblical Portraits and Legends","review":"Wiesel has conceived an amazing and important set of human beings from several Biblical figures. People, strong and weak, right and wrong, very much flesh and bones, are presented from the unique perspective of a Holocaust survivor who sees human natures in the extremes of good and evil. What was it like for Job? How flawed were the Forefathers? And how did their personal relationships with the Almighty lead to inner peace? Most remarkably, a portrait of the Lord emerges as few scholars have painted. The juxtaposition of, for example, Moses and Abraham, with their individualities crisply drawn is a new level in Biblical scholarship, and most relevent for us today. When faced with the challenges of life, the people of the Bible are as human as each and all of us. This book is truely a gift to mankind."},{"Title":"Messengers of God: Biblical Portraits and Legends","review":"Elie Weisel has a very descriptive style. He is able to describe the many possible interpretations of the characteristics of Adam, Cain, Abel, Isaac, Joseph, Jacob, Esau, Moses, and Job. Especially interesting is the description of how G-d created Eve. Why from the ribs as opposed to the eyes, head, neck, etc.. Interesting stuff and I won't spoil it by giving you readers the analogy. The snake's role in Eve leading Adam astray is dealt with from many interesting points of view. The punishment of Cain is quite unique according to Weisel's theory.Anyway, the parables are a little hard to interpret and some of the stories ramble a bit without comming to a point. But there are many captivating parts and the beautiful imagery makes me rate this four stars."},{"Title":"Messengers of God: Biblical Portraits and Legends","review":"Most of this book rehashes midrashic legends- and does so without enough detail for the reader to fully understand the context of those legends. Maybe if I was less knowledgeable I would find this book more interesting.Having said that, the book does occasionally come to life when Wiesel brings in his own perspectives. For example, he asks why Joseph is so often described as a \\"tzaddik\\" and points out that Joseph's uniqueness lay in his ability to get past the suffering he experienced at the hands of others, despite the absence of the kind of Divine revelation that his ancestors benefitted from."},{"Title":"Messengers of God: Biblical Portraits and Legends","review":"For those familiar with Elie Wiesel only through his Holocaust literature, \\"Messengers of God\\" may seem like a departure. It is a book that examines the Biblical portraits and legends of Adam, Moses, Job, and others. To do so, Wiesel uses a mixture of Bible and Torah stories and the rabbinical commentaries (or midrash) to examine the life and legend of each profit.Wiesel beings with Adam, the first man, examining his relationship with God, before and after the Fall. He naturally follows course to Cain and Abel, an example of the frist genocide as he calls it, and raises some interesting questions concerning the borhters' relationship with each other and with God. He examines the sacrifice of Isaac, Jacob's struggle with the angel, and Joseph's education and purity. The final two portraits are those of Moses, an unlikely leader of the Jews, and Job, a man who would fit in very much with our contemporary time period. For that is exactly what Wiesel tries to accomplish in \\"Messengers of God\\": by examining the pasts of these characters he tries to explain how they are still alive in the world today. And for the most part he succeeds.Each portrait, except the last, is followed by a short section of parables and sayings that illuminate what Jewish scholars have had to say about each of these Biblical figures. Some of these help further Wiesel's purpose, while others seem out of place. Wiesel draws from a variety of sources to paint his portraits and also mixes in his own thoughts and opinions concerning these figures, especially that of Job, whose predicament is easily understood and sympathized with by a Holocaust survivor. \\"Messengers of God\\" is a quick read, but one that is best deliberated over after each portrait is complete. For anyone looking for a more diverse sketch of these Biblical characters, \\"Messengers of God\\" is an excellent place to start."},{"Title":"Messengers of God: Biblical Portraits and Legends","review":"Amazon's ease and convenience of purchase and delievery made it a pleasant purchase. The book is a great wry and whimsical analysis of the core Biblical stories.

This book is idylic for any thorough study of liberal arts such as history, sociology, theologhy, and philosophy."},{"Title":"Messengers of God: Biblical Portraits and Legends","review":"Elie Wiesel brings the reader into the world of the first Jews, and how their actions shaped the future growth of the Jewish faith, people, and nation."},{"Title":"Messengers of God: Biblical Portraits and Legends","review":"ELIE WIESEL IS A GREAT WRITER! I WILL ALWAYS KEEP THIS BOOK IN MY HOME. I HAVE READ IT MORE THENONCE."},{"Title":"Messengers of God: Biblical Portraits and Legends","review":"Elie Wiesel is a learned and learning Jew, a poetic storyteller whose work is rich in meaning and beauty. In this book he retells the stories of Adam and Eve, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses and Job. His method is to read the Biblical story and the Midrashim and from them retell each Biblical hero's story. The retellings are interpretative and suggestive. He will often raise one set of possibilities and then move on to another. He will often prefer leaving us with a set of questions rather than with a definite answer.Yet throughout his readings there is a strong feeling of his great love for and devotion to the Biblical text. He reads with respect and a sense of sanctity. He can wonder and protest as he does for instance at Job's acquiescence to God's answer from the Whirlwind but he maintains always a closeness and loving relation to the Tradition.I read these retellings with very great pleasure. The poetic beauty was one element of this. But another was the sense of searching for and enriching the meaning of stories I myself have since childhood read and reread. I learned much I did not know.I believe any person who has a feeling for the Bible, or anyone who simply cares for the question of Man's relation to God will benefit greatly from reading this very meaningful and beautiful book."},{"Title":"Messengers of God: Biblical Portraits and Legends","review":"In this book, Wiesel tells of seven Bible characters from several different viewpoints: the Bible, the Talmud, Midrash, and his own. The most intriguing of these views is his own because each character is viewed through the lens of the Holocaust. Wiesel identifies with different forms of suffering that each character goes through. Also, the way he portrays God seems to come from an understanding of the Holocaust rather than pre-Holocaust Jewish tradition alone. This book is a definite good read because of the different angles that it attempts to view each character."},{"Title":"Messengers of God: Biblical Portraits and Legends","review":"Received quicker than I thought.

In other words, what book inspired them as children and how would they create one scene from that book? What a clever idea! What wonderful results!Robert Lawson writes: \\"No one can possibly tell what tiny detail of a drawing or what seemingly trivial phrase in a story will be the spark that sets off a great flash in the mind of some child, a flash that will leave a glow there until the day he dies.\\" Lawson created \\"Make Way for Ducklings\\" and \\"Blueberries for Sal.\\"David Wiesner, creator of three Caldecott Medal books, re-imagines one scene from \\"2001: Space Odyssey\\" --the obelisk. Instead of appearing in the open as a catalyst for early man's thinking, it becomes a big, black book in one boy's bedroom, a catalyst for Wiesner's connection with books and art. In fact, his explanation of how one movie, one book, then a book explaining the making of the movie from the book is a wonderful piece of writing and inspiration to a new generation of illustrators!William Joyce, an artist who happens to live in my city of Shreveport, re-imagines a scene from \\"Where the Wild Things Are,\\" by Maurice Sendak. \\"I got lost in that book and haven't come out since.\\" His depiction shows a wild-haired little boy standing at the edge of a giant book (or perhaps he is a teeny boy), reading a sentence that says: \\"That very night in Max's room a forest grew.\\"Richard Egielski was influenced by the Classic Comics of Moby Dick.

Jerry Pinkney re-creates a scene from \\"Little Black Sambo.\\" Mary Azarian's recreation of a scene from \\"A Girl of Limberlost\\" is quite beautiful. Mark Teague, who read and reread \\"The Silver Chair\\" from the Narnia Chronicles, re-imagines a scene in his fantastic artwork.\\"The Art of Reading\\" is a treasure chest of how artists were influenced by one specific book.

Forty of the top children's book illustrators in the country were asked by Reading Is Fundamental to \\"re-imagine\\" a favorite book from their childhood as a way of celebrating the birth of their personal interest in reading and art. Short statements from the artists accompany the full-page illustrations (almost all of which are original to this book) and demonstrate that there are many ways young people can come to the reading experience.The essays are a charming window into the childhoods of these artists, but the heart of the book is the illustrations themselves. Every artist brings his or her own sensibility to the task, which makes this a rare side-by-side compendium of children's book illustration styles and creative philosophies. It's a thrill to move from David Wiesner to Raul Colon to Bryan Collier to Jerry Pinkney to Peter Sis to Nina Laden to William Joyce, and on and on. RIF has put together an illustrator all-star team, packed with Caldecott and Coretta Scott King winners and a diverse mixture of established stars and up-and-comers.This book would be a great addition to any family library and should be placed in every elementary school reading and art classroom and used as a tool to inspire kids, parents, and even teachers.

Looking for that book, the title of which I've forgotten, I found the Art of Reading, and got that instead. This was probably a mistake.The subtitle, Forty Illustrators Celebrate RIF's 40th Anniversary, explains the concept. Each illustrator is given a 2-page spread. One full page is devoted to an illustration by the artist, while the facing page has a 3/4 to 1/4 format, with the smaller portion of the page containing a photo of the illustrator and a picture of a seminal book from his or her childhood, and the larger portion of the page containing a narrative about the illustrator's experience with that book. The full page illustration is inspired by the favorite book.Conceptually, this seems like a great idea for a book, but somehow, somewhere, the execution just fails, fails, fails, at least for me. The order of the artists covered follows no apparent rhyme or reason, i.e. alphabetical, chronological, or even in terms of importance/fame as evidenced by awards received, etc. This makes it difficult to casually find a specific artist and/or necessitates the use of the index. In addition, I found the overall format to be more than a little forced; quite a few of the artists seem to have rather dispiritedly churned out a minumum of copy. (Four sentences, for instance, are attribued to William Joyce.) I don't blame the artists for this. The concept itself is just so heavy-handed and narrow. It appears that the artists weren't allowed to refer to their own books in the text. If you want to find out about the work of the featured artists, you have to page through a biography section in the back to find out. Why? This seems like such a missed opportunity, as well as a huge disservice--almost a slap in the face--to the the artists featured. This is such a shame. I would have loved to hear about how the work of these favorites influenced a specific book or character rather than read over and over a version of how \\"books have changed my life\\" blah blah.I can see why a school librarian would love this book; I don't think it has much to offer the average reader, however. That said, I've decided to keep it anyway. Amazon's special rate of $7.00+ is more than reasonable and I didn't see any actual damage to the book I got.

However still a great overall collection of recipies. I would have liked to see more detail. For example the book sais &quot;cook beets separately&quot;, well how long do you boil beets? Americans now adays generally just know how to open can, pour and microwave. Also substitutes for ingredients like pike and carp should be mentioned. I know from living in Lithuania that these fish are common there, but not easy to find pike and carp in the grocery stores here in the states. Also, the book often sais to use mushrooms. However Lithuanians are masters at mushrooms. They have different terms for a species of mushroom depending on when they are picked, if they are under, on the side or on top of a log, etc. I personally use cremini mushrooms for Lithuanian cuisine for the more &quot;gamey&quot; nature. To make this book special a professional editor could do wonders. It would be great to see the meals broken down by the regions of Lithuania, and a historical reference of how these foods and spices made their way to Lithuania. However, I guess I am reaching for the sky. I would just like to see a book that gets people focused on the amazing foods of Central Europe. So many times people ignore agrarian cuisine as &quot;peasant food&quot; and fail to see the brilliance of it's simple ingredients mixed w/ expert preparation. With all this said, I am happy I spent [the money] on this book. I will definitely use it as a reference."},{"Title":"Art of Lithuanian Cooking (Cookery)","review":"In retrospect, I should have gone with a Lithuanian cookbook where the author has a Lithuanian name, because I was disappointed to find that less than 1% of the recipes had Lithuanian headings. I found the recipe\\"Little Ears\\" in this book and found it to be nothing like the Little Ears recipe I know, which would be called Ausiuk&eacute;s...little ears where the end product were tied up knots of dough fried in oil and dusted with powdered sugar...yummy! This was a traditional sweet for holidays like Christmas and Easter.When I ordered this cookbook \\"Art of Lithuanian Cooking\\", I expected a real lithuanian cookbook with their proper names. If you want a real lithuanian cookbook, see if you can get a copy of \\"Popular Lithuanian recipes\\" by Josephine J. Dauzvardis. I received this cookbook from a very dear friend back in 1982. Its excellent! Anyone who has a lithuanian background and is familiar with the dishes will recognize the recipes right away, because ALL of the recipes have their true lithuanian name right before it, like Kaldunai, Zeppelinai, Kop&ugrave;st&uacute; Sriuba (Sauerkraut soup), Duonoj Keptas Kumpis, R&uacute;g\`stus Pienas (Lithuanian Yogurt), and much more.This book will probably just sit on my shelf.

And, there are some difficult recipes for the seasoned cook or one who has a Lithuanian-American grandmother to help, such as: Lithuanian Rye Bread (I am having a terrible time baking an acceptable rye bread!) or Porkupine Cake (Definiely need the grandmother for guidance on this one!).All of the Balto-Slavic cuisines are inter-related, but each nationality has its own, unique, version of several dishes.

The commander of the army post, Captain Bryce McGregor tries, but fails to persuade the siblings to go home as they do not belong in the rugged unsafe Rocky Mountains even inside the fort. Bryce does convince the women to stay with him until the store can be renovated and made hospitable. His young daughter Pamela serves as a perfect chaperone so Abby and Moriah accept the kind offer.Pamela adopts Abby as a mother figure and the former St. Louis resident cannot stop her heart from reaching out to the young child. Inadvertently Pamela plays matchmaker as Abby and Bryce fall in love. However, Abigail willingly sacrifices her happiness because she knows the scandal she fled would destroy the man she cherishes as a rising officer cannot afford a dishonored (even if she is innocent) spouse.There are few if any authors that can provide such well drawn characters including secondary players with a colorfully vivid nineteenth century Americana panorama inside an exciting historical romance than Leigh greenwood can. His latest tale INDEPENDENT BRIDE matches up two honorable individuals in love and encouraged by her sister and his daughter and even to a degree his men, but those same principles stand in their way of happiness. Mr. Greenwood shows that principles are important even if it costs achievement of a personal goal all that within a fabulous post Civil War romance with a deep message.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Independent Bride","review":"Great story.

Well, here's my two cents:I never liked baseball that much. Now a book about baseball would frighten me away. I've never been interested in reading about people involved with drugs, cross-dressers, call-girl romances, alcoholics, and even crazy sexual exploits.I learned about the book through a friend and thought to myself, \\"oh what the heck. If I hate it after the first three chapters, I'll sell the book.\\"I read the first page, then the second and for some reason, I found myself on the fourth chapter. After that, I couldn't put the book down. It has practically everything that I mentioned above (drugs, sex, cross-dressing etc) and with a dollop of baseball. Perhaps the fact that it is a memoir that makes it all the more of a page-turner. I kept thinking to myself, \\"wow, this is an entirely other world with people trying to survive Hollywood.\\" And throughout the book, I sympathize for all the characters (well, they're real-life people). Also, Mr. Albert gives the truth about \\"Hollywood's Wasteland\\": people who dream of making it big but fall short. Baseball becomes their road to recovery.Because Mr. Albert was able to hold my attention for all those pages, I must give him five stars.

At first, I wanted to say simply that I couldn't put the book down. I read it in a 24-hour period, losing sleep in order to get to the end. How often has that happened in my life? First time was with Witch of Blackbird Pond when I was 10. Then Outsiders at 12. And Exorcist at 14. But as an adult? I think the last time was Ironweed.The writing is that good. The story that engrossing.But there's more to it. I've been a baseball fan forever. And one of my most memorable dates was in New York, watching the sun setting over the stadium, wrapped in a boyfriend's arms and sneaking sips of beer from his plastic cup. It was romance in motion, set at the ballgame.This book is nothing like that.Flash forward to same boyfriend in L.A. We'd both moved to Los Angeles within months of each other, and were inseparable. Until he took me to a Dodger game and explained that he still wanted to see me, but now that he was trying to be an actor, he wanted to be available to f*ck some starlets, too. Same game. Same man. Different coast. Different setting.This book is much more like that.I'm giving it to my friends this year on their birthdays. I'm reading it over again when the images start to fade.

The writing is good, the story is catchy and the characters are OK. It may be the jock in me but i actually wish there was more baseball in the story.

Actually, I mostly love hearing anyone who can wax rhapsodic about baseball as a metaphor for life. I love the actual game slightly less. And John Albert does a nifty job of combining baseball, the meaning of life and what seem like dead-on character sketches. Not to mention the brilliant job he does of evoking LA. That, to me, may be the book's greatest, if most unexpected, achievement. I find LA slightly horrifying and yet something about these guys (and gals) who were so sad made me feel a little something tender for the place, or the people who try to live there, anyway.Not for the squeamish, but definitely worth the read."},{"Title":"Wrecking Crew: The Really Bad News Griffith Park Pirates","review":"I just finished this book and wanted to check out what other people thought of it.

And while I could have done without the inevitable \\"Big Game,\\" and a few standard characters (like the cross dressing pitcher), the majority of the book moves quickly, almost like a CD of two minute songs. Its lack of character depth may trouble some readers, but others may enjoy that it does just keep moving foward.

Secondly, he's an awful lot like The Honourable Schoolboy's Jerry Westerby as a character type: a tall, affable Englishman who is lonely and overall a bit of a sad sack. Also, there are nearly 300 pages of backstory leading up to the present-tense action that, when all is said and done, is poorly built up and awkwardly concluded. And yet I kept turning the pages. I guess even a relative disappointment from le Carre is still a pretty good book."},{"Title":"Absolute Friends","review":"John LeCarre has outdone himself. As usual he draws you into the story where you feel that it is happening to you. And what is happening is oh so relevant to all os us. If you are a LeCarre fan this is a must read ASAP. If you haven't read his works before, this is timely and riveting. I'm going to have to add the hard cover, larger print book to my collection so I can re-read it every so often."},{"Title":"Absolute Friends","review":"(Fair warning, spoiler contained in this review)John Le Carr&eacute; is, without doubt, along with Len Deighton, one of the luminaries of the Cold War spy novel. To those born after 1985, the way things were when the 'superpowers' were the US and the Soviet Union must be mostly a historical curiosity 'before I was born'. The rest of us remember those days well. John Le Carr&eacute; lived them, made his literary career based on them and unfortunately, doesn't seem to believe that anything important has happened in the world since the fall of the Berlin Wall.In all fairness, Le Carr&eacute;'s George Smiley novels are undeniable classics. His later novels tend to replow old ground, and his writing style - by turns amusing, arch and enraged - hasn't changed or deteriorated much. It's pretty clear where Le Carr&eacute; is on the political spectrum; all govenments are deceitful and brutal, ours (meaning the UK) ought to know better, but doesn't, the world is full of moral ambiguity. The problem is that Le Carr&eacute; has always known that the lesser enemy is the UK government. With the fall of the USSR, he's been casting about for a greater enemy. With this book he's decided: The enemy of the world is the US, the \\"hyperpower\\".Strangely, for a book that is supposedly written in the present day, there's no mention of the Pacific Rim countries -- China is pretty big these days, India is a comer, Japan and Korea are still in the game and even little North Korea and Iran have pretensions of developing nuclear weapons in order to sit at the big table and threaten like a major power.In Le Carr&eacute;'s universe, no geography outside of England and Germany receives much attention (Pakistan gets a little attention for the sake of color and ethnic diversity). There is little evidence of the impact and change of technology post 1970; no high tech gear or weapons, computers rate hardly a mention, all that stuff is the responsibility of those offstage. It's as if the world's governments and secret services agreed that they will only do battle in the \`70s and in places were German, Russian or English is spoken. This is an obvious conceit, and appears to be primarily based upon Le Carr&eacute;'s own background and history (murkily hinted at over the years as having involved some kind of secret intelligence work, but as he now states, involved very little; see http://www.randomhouse.com/features/lecarre/author.html). Many of Le Carr&eacute;'s anti-hero protagonists are sketchy self portraits; the badly-born expatriate, with a rogue father and a strange upbringing. This novel is no exception.\\"Absolute Friends\\" is essentially an anti-American screed. The characters are trotted across England and Germany (and a bit of Austria) in various amusing spy adventures, they have various crises of conscience, but in the end, the whole plot is based upon the crude manipulations of shadowy ex-CIA operatives now hooked up with unnamed corporate and right wing religious interests to sacrifice innocent Europeans for the sake of oil, with the evil complicity of their own governments cravenly bowing to the Americans and the \\"neo-cons\\".For a book that focuses so much on how much of a bad influence the Americans are, Le Carr&eacute; seems not to know much about us. The sole American character of any importance is an old-school WASP spy from Boston, with a menacing geniality that makes him seem more British (to me, anyway) than American. I imagine that Le Carr&eacute; has actually been to Boston (or at least to Harvard, which is across the river in Cambridge), on the lecture circuit, but he can't have stayed very long. He doesn't know the culture of New England or anywhere else in the US.As other reviewers have noted, this book seems to portray the world battle against terrorism as based wholly upon lies, as if we haven't endured thirty years of airplane hijackings, school massacres, embassy bombings, invasions and assassinations perpetrated by Islamic extremists and funded by those who would profit from their violence. Le Carr&eacute; also seems to uncritically accept that the US, (evilly, of course) goes to war principally to protect the oil companies that secretly run the government - apparently giving no thought to the long history of great power struggles over resources that determine the fate of societies. The North American economy certainly runs on oil - but so does Europe's, India's, China's and every other industrial nation's. It is simply impossible to believe that any government, corrupt or rigidly honest and humane would willingly surrender its fate and that of its' people's to the whim of Islamic fundamentalists. But ultimately, Le Carr&eacute; seems to say \\"What's the fuss all about? These Arabs are really our true friends, it's the Americans that are the real problem\\".That's another strange point of view of Le Carr&eacute;'s. Although he fancies himself a master of human ambiguity, the few Islamic types are all saintly women or children. None of them are cutting the heads of civil engineers on video, none are involved in \\"honor killings\\", there are no Islamic sharia court amputations, no frenzied mobs lynching victims, then waving their bloody hands in triumph for the cameras, no Al Qaeda torture chambers.So what is this book, really? It's an anti-American screed, peopled with retread Le Carr&eacute; characters acting as puppets for Le Carr&eacute; to assert that all this fuss about terrorism is based upon lies and expert US manipulation of the press. While entertaining, it is itself a false document that plays to those anxious to have their anti-American and \\"progressive\\" values validated.Ultimately, we should take this book, and Le Carr&eacute; as he portrays himself, in his own words:\\"The answer is that nothing that I write is authentic. It is the stuff of dreams, not reality. Yet I am treated by the media as though I wrote espionage handbooks. I am regarded as a sage on every spy case from the double-agent Judas to your wretched Mr. Aldrich Ames.And to a point I am flattered that my fabulations are taken so seriously. Yet I also despise myself in the fake role of guru, since it bears no relation to who I am or what I do. Artists, in my experience, have very little center. They fake. They are not the real thing. They are spies. I am no exception.\\""},{"Title":"Absolute Friends","review":"Le Carre is a great writer, but he has his blind spots, especially if Americans are involved.OK, that said. Le Carre has created a memorable character in Ted Mundy.His evolution from being failed and adrift to a player in cold war espionage is a classic. A great cynic and observer of human nature, le Carre has no equal when writing about cold war espionage. Hugely entertaining."},{"Title":"Absolute Friends","review":"John Le Carre has excelled himself in this book. His painting of character and his development of plot have only improved with time. The end of the cold war has changed his focus from the secretive clashes between superpowers to the clashes between unchallenged power and the rest of the world. This book has been accused of being leftist but I think many of the critics are largely unaware of what is happening in contemporary politics."},{"Title":"Absolute Friends","review":"It is unusual for a British writer to uncover the genuine German left political scene, and perhaps not typical of LeCarre's previous espionage sagas.Spanning 40 years, a friendship of two non violent political radicals is a deeply and intricately developed story, possibly painstakingly so.This is not a fast paced thriller, nor your average spy novel, it is something else entirely.If you are looking for heart stopping suspense you will be disappointed.But if you are looking for a good and genuine look at German politics and its true cultural flavor, particularly the political left, from the 1960's up to the present, you are in very good luck.If you are a patient reader who will savor new flavors and ideas, this is a wonderful read and a true mirror of the reality of the German left. Frankly, I was surprised that as good a novelist as he is, that LeCarre could write at this depth of perceptiveness.The two non violent characters meet a violent end in Heidelberg, Germany, in an unlikely way. Probably this is an unbelievable and too abrupt ending, but philosophical and thought provoking nevertheless. This may be the greatest fault of the book, but perhaps LeCarre thought he had to end this and go on to other things.The American anti terrorist response taking the lives of the protagonists seems a bit severe, even for the current political scene.Even so, this seems a deep development in LeCarre's writing and he may be hitting his peak now with this novel."},{"Title":"Absolute Friends","review":"The novel tells the story of two friends in the spy trade, Ted Mundy who works for British Intelligence, and Sasha, a Stasi double agent who passes him information. The story follows Mundy's life from a childhood in Pakistan, public school in England, and his adult life in Germany. He first meets Sasha at the height of the Cold War, and their friendship continues through the fall of the Berlin Wall to the war in Iraq. They both get involved with a philanthropist who wants to create an alternative university to counter anti-war propaganda, but Mundy soon discovers it's not quite what it seems.John le Carr&eacute; shows that espionage is a conspiracy game, and those who play it are no more in command of their fate than any other person. The spy is a target for betrayal, even as he goes about his business of encouraging others in the practice. Mundy's dilemma is worse than a prisoner's, because for a spy there is exposure or worse if you are not lucky. This is the dark side of things which le Carr&eacute; explores well. Most members of SIS and the Security Services tend to be competent and decent people, as le Carr&eacute; has acknowledged at one time or another. But we get his meaning in \\"Absolute Friends\\": here is someone matched to the temper of our times: the hero as fall guy, as casualty of the workplace - the spy as victim.The novel is very well read by Michael Jayston for BBC Audiobooks."},{"Title":"Absolute Friends","review":"John LeCarre needs no endorsement from anyone as regards ability to weave an intricate plot, develop fascinating and yet believeable and potentially realistic characters, and write outstanding spy novels. He has been it is for decades, and he's pretty much the best. Or he used to be.The Cold War allowed LeCarre's worldview full scope. While his readership generally understood the world to be divided into at the very least dark grey and light grey, LeCarre insisted in bleeding the sides into one another, with greys virtually indistinguishable from one another; the stories were about the people in the trade, and less about one side or the other having any moral or other distinctive 'right' or 'good' on their side. As such, characters like George Smiley would fascinate by their very ordinariness, while LeCarre could use his cultivated moral ambiguity to present riveting stories in a world where conflict would never fully be resolved, it would simply consume and churn and destroy the various actors attempting to influence it, those who were vain enough to think they were controlling it.The end of the Cold War kind of knocked all that out of the box, and it was some time before LeCarre could adjust. He had to find villains convincing and serious enough, but also make them vulnerable. Of course, since he is from the west, he has ultimately found the villains to be ourselves. LeCarre's villains over the last ten or twelve years have typically been found right here at home, and his books have come across occasionally as crankier and testier polemics merely disguised as spy novels.Absolute Friends is not hugely different in that sense; it is impossible to read Ted Mundy's and Sasha's outrage over the Bush/Blair invasion of Iraq as anything other than mirroring LeCarre's own. However, the reader is grateful that it takes 350 or so pages to get around to the point, and the balance of the book is about as good a spy story as he has written in many years. Two characters are tracked over decades, from childhood and youth to their first girlfriends through experimentation with radical politics (and a little more than just experimentation), through Cold War work and double-agency. Throughout, there is a miasmic feeling of ambiguity, of drifting, of directionless and aimless resignation to Ted's character, as he loses his previous identity, his wife and son, his own self-image, all in exchange for what? Sasha's character, all feverish energy and idealistic fervor, is also well-drawn, as are most of the secondary characters. It is only towards the end, when the fatal double-cross is first set up, that the book begins to lag...just where the author is trying to make his big point.LeCarre can tell a spy story as well or better than any other author, but he seems convinced that he must do more than that, and sometimes the lecturing and political fingerpointing pops through the yarn like a poking finger through a loose sweater. But all the same Absolute Friends is a testament to an excellent writer who can still come up with the goods when he wants to."},{"Title":"Absolute Friends","review":"This novel was a real pleasant surprise for me. I'd read one or two le Carre novels quite some time ago, and I had some vaguely pleasant memory of them, but I'm certain I enjoyed this book a great deal more than I had any other le Carre stuff I've read.First of all, it's topical. It's wonderful to see that the end of the Cold War did not mean the end of interesting espionage tales. Though it was published 3 (4?) years ago, it's still very relevant to what's going on Iraq, perhaps even moreso now than on its publication date.That's not to say that it's all about America and Iraq, really only the climax during the last 150 pages or so is directly involved with that issue. The backstory of how these two men met, befriended each other, and became involved working on both sides of the Berlin wall occupies the bulk of the novel. Mr le Carre is many things but he is not direct; IMO that's an admirable attribute and it's a pleasure to weave through the narrative until we arrive where we know we're going: these men become spies, and they become involved with British intelligence.A few times I scratched my head and wondered \\"where is he going with this?\\" In a novel that one expects to be formulaic and in which certain things are taken for granted from page 1 it's a joy to be confused about where the author is taking me. And maybe I'm a dullard, but I didn't see the end coming until about the same time as the two central characters, to their detriment but to my delight. Who doesn't enjoy a surprise ending?And though the politics of the novel may seem a bit paranoid, it's a shame to have to say that in this day and age...they may not be so paranoid, after all. And at the very least the reader is left with a few things to go over in his or her mind after the story's through. What more can one ask of a novel?Pick this one up."},{"Title":"Absolute Friends","review":"I have a lot of connections with this book, being almost the same age as Mundy, sharing his surname, being a Brit, having experienced the 60s on the counterculture front line, having known German and British radicals in the 70s, having worked for the British Council, knowing Germany moderately well, etc, etc. I don't much like it, however.The book starts well, relating Mundy's present life, his early life and his radical Berlin years in rich detail. It then dissipates into skimming through the years, making the bulk of the book tediously lightweight in atmosphere and character, apart from Amory, who is well drawn.In the final part, the story becomes richer again, but the only really enjoyable thing is Dimitri's rant. It is spot on and it is great to see such a fine analysis of today's world jump out of a popular novel.I note that all the people who hate this book are American and that they hate it because of its punchline. Once more Americans demonstrate their warped view of the world, a view formed in a grossly narrow political culture where the only practical choice available is between a moderately conservative party called the Democrats and a seriously conservative party called the Republicans."},{"Title":"Absolute Friends","review":"Is this book a satire on the whole Euro looney left? Seems like it. A long, but snappy and often funny backstory on how Ted becomes what he is in 2003/4 pokes fun at the 60's pink radicals and useless cold war intelligence games played by the Brits and East Germans. Le Carre just can't let go of Berlin and MI5/6/?? The ending gets a lttle confused and wraps up quickly with the USA religious right as the bad guys and le Carre siding with the Naomi Klein/Noam Chomsky - ites. And Ted and Sasha as absolute friends and not so lovable losers caught in the middle. All in all a good read!"},{"Title":"Absolute Friends","review":"John le Carre demonstrates his command of the English language as well as his ability to develop characters. These aspects of the book are truly enjoyable.Unfortunately the plot is a rant against America and is simply not believable. If you enjoy this sort of thing and want to indulge in a left-wing, paranoid-delusional fantasy, then this book is for you. The rest of us should give it a pass.Given how much I have enjoyed his past works, this one is truly disappointing. I used to think that le Carre was a master of subtle and believable plots. No more."},{"Title":"Absolute Friends","review":"As a long-time fan of le Carre, I found this and The Constant Gardener to be great disappointments. Interesting character development but plot and pace are nil. Le Carre sounds like a broken record of Michael Moore. If I want to read editorials, I can go to the New York Times. This will be my last le Carre."},{"Title":"Absolute Friends","review":"300 pages of character development (of a character not worth developing), followed by 100 pages of sophmoric plot. I regret having wasted many hours of my life reading this book. Lamest ending I've read in a long time and definitely not worthy of le Carre."},{"Title":"Absolute Friends","review":"The story is straightforward: the story of Ted Mundy, a Pakistani-born Briton who randomly joins a 1960's era student protest group in West Berlin and becomes a lifelong friend of a West Germany student anarchist named Sasha. Sasha defects to East Germany, and during the 1970s and 1980s Sasha feeds Mundy information about East Germany and Statsi. Mundy plays the role of a double agent and Sasha relishes the role of a turncoat.The espionage story in itself is not remarkable, but the way LeCarre approaches the story is different; the psychological complexity here is akin to Graham Greene's \\"Human Factor\\". Both Mundy and Sasha are naive victims of circumstances, politics, borders, history and ideologies - a theme ripe in LeCarre's previous novels. Their friendship survives because both are rejects of the very societies that nourished them. Mundy must play the role of the British gentleman, but he could never truly aspire to become one. Sasha is the revolutionary hero, but his leftist ideology is more of a rebellion than a belief.LeCarre notes the fall of the Wall as a small event, not important, just as a footnote of history. Yet, the wars in the Middle East are the major watershed. And it is during these times Sasha and Mundy once again conspire with grandiose schemes to combat American military and industrial globalization. In the end the two idealists end up the pawns of the very group they are protesting against."},{"Title":"Absolute Friends","review":"In this 2003 novel, le Carre predicts that the next 'War on Terror' will be an attack on Iran and if you read the subtext of the novel it's clear that he, like many others believe that 9-11 was a complete hoodwink of the American populace.Well he's spot on about Iran....just listen to those new war drums beat and 9-11 is still as murky and weird as ever.Good plotting and a sad ending but a must read for everyone. Take the blue pill......."},{"Title":"Absolute Friends","review":"The pressure is on these days--at least from literary agents--to write longer and longer works of fiction. No doubt, the highly focused blast at Bush/Blair neoconservative imperialism that reigns from pages 296 through the end of the text formed the core of LeCarre's original submission. Then his agent said, \\"you've got to pad it out old boy, your public expects it.\\" If so, t'is a public that raved about The Honorable Schoolboy and not the one that worshipped A Small Town in Germany.Belongs in the same company with, though not quite up to the level of Brazil and LeCarre's The Night Manager."},{"Title":"Absolute Friends","review":"Beyond any doubt, this is the worst John le Carre novel published. What begins as an interesting story of two reluctant spies suddenly deteriorates into a sadly naive and blatantly sophomoric anti-American screed ending in an outlandish climax derived from the depths of some personal hatred rather than the genius of a fertile imagination. It is sad to see how low this once great writer of fiction has fallen"},{"Title":"Absolute Friends","review":"I have always felt that John Le Carre was one of today's finest authors. His works about the Cold War and such characters such as George Smiley have provided endless hours of enjoyment.For the first 400 pages of Absolute Friends, it seemed as though LeCare had found a new arena for is writings. It's only in the last 60 pages that the book trails off into the sort of cynical, paranoia that has become so stylish around the world.It's sad, but I will never purchase another Le Carre work again."},{"Title":"Absolute Friends","review":"It's been a while since I've read a novel of Le Carre's, maybe a dozen years, but after my wife told me I had to read it, this one knocked me out. It's an amazing portrayal of the mix of idealism and delusion as the 60s movements disintegrated.It's a wonderful classic Le Carre look at people trying to act morally in an amoral and often immoral world. It's a totally gripping read.I've seen some complaints here about the ending, but to me, ittotally blew me away, as you saw the trap closing. The only problem I see, is that because no one wants to spoil the great read by revealing how it turned out, we don't have room to really talk about the ending unless we've read the book-and given Le Carre's statures it should have been all over the media.I don't see it as anti-American at all. But if you you go back to the Wall Street Journal story on the mob of Republican Congressional aides who shouted down the Palm Beach vote counters in 2000. Or the BBC stories on 85,000 people illegtimately thrown off the Florida rolls. Or outing of Joseph Wilson's CIA-agent wife when he debunked the manufactured story linking Saddam Hussein and Niger uranium--well I hope the dark story in Le Carre's ending isn't prophetic.And whatever your politics, it's a pretty amazing read....Paul LoebAuthor of Soul of a Citizen and The Impossible Will Take a Little While: A Citizen's Guide to Hope in a Time of Fear"},{"Title":"Absolute Friends","review":"OK, John le Carre is always a bit predictable: His female characters are one-dimensional (sex goddess, mother, or overweight bully); the fathers con the sons. But he usually creates interesting male characters, his use of the language is always intelligent and admirable, and he usually creates great suspense.After wading through a very long, slow beginning that took up nearly half the book, I nearly gave up. I saw none of the suspense that usually keeps me reading le Carre, and the two primary characters just didn't fire my imagination this time.Then, at about midpoint, we watch the main character get sucked into the world of spying, and things got a bit more interesting, more suspenseful. This is what le Carre does better than anyone else: the double world of the spy, with all its tensions, sacrifices, and ambivalence.Then about three quarters of the way through, it began to descend into a sermon. I will forgive an author many things, but sermonizing isn't one of them, whether I agree with him or not. Believable plot, characterization, and subtlety went out the window, and we ended up instead with an angry diatribe against the U.S., Christianity, Republicans, and corporations, all lumped together in le Carre's fire-breathing, apocalyptic, hell-and-brimstone conclusion. I'm not sure how much he'd appreciate being compared to a tent evangelist, but that's how the book reads in the end.My one wish: that he'd save the rhetoric for the interviews and get back to writing good stories again. But after all the excellent thrillers he's given us over the years, I figure le Carre doesn't owe us anything at this point."},{"Title":"Absolute Friends","review":"I've been a le Carr&eacute; fan forever, and worried, after the fall of the Soviet Union, that he would have to \\"come in from the cold\\" because the spy business had fallen on hard times. Of course, he rose to the challenge of the post-Wall world, brilliantly and relevantly, with his subsequent books. There is no doubt in my mind that he continues to be one of the English-speaking world's best novelists, not just its best spy novelist. And I feel he has become, as well, one of the world's most well-spoken political consciences.Absolute Friends is All That: a well-written book that, as is always the case with Le Carr&eacute;, makes a reader care about his oddball, strife-ridden, three-dimensional characters; a well-researched, plausible scenario that defies a \\"high concept\\" one-line definition; and a story that is so thoroughly relevant to these dark days of PR-as-truth and might-as-right that it should be required reading for anybody who takes his daily news fix from CNN or Fox.In my opinion, Absolute Friends gets it right. It engaged me; it saddened me, and it made me angry. I've seen some pretty rugged reviews here that make me think it's had a powerful effect on other readers, too. If you're one of the folks who consider the US and its allies the Guys in the White Hats who will save the world and can do no wrong, the odds are that this book will really tick you off. But take a good look around at the world we live in, a clear-eyed look tempered with a bit of humility, and ask yourself: Is what happens at the end of Absolute Friends really so impossible?If this book makes you think, if it moves you beyond the mere enjoyment of its fine writing and fascinating plot work and gets your wheels clicking and ticking, then perhaps Le Carr&eacute;'s two misbegotten friends have truly accomplished something positive with their sad idealism.Susan O'Neill, author, Don't Mean Nothing: Short Stories of Viet Nam"},{"Title":"Absolute Friends","review":"It is interesting to note how polarizing le Carre's latest novel is. Reading through the reviews, you get the sense that the neocons are angry that what they thought was a loyalist decided to bite the hand that feeds. Now that \\"godless communism\\" has gone, le Carre has evolved, and the result, this book, along with The Constant Gardener, is evidence that le Carre is more than a Tom Clancy-type slavering attack dog. Absolute Friends is prescient, it's angry, and serves up a very sobering message: be careful what you wish for."},{"Title":"Absolute Friends","review":"I've liked most of Le Carre's books, the spy novels as well as the others. Absolute Friends is an interesting and mostly enjoyable read for much of the book, but the author permits his almost extreme anti-American views to take over the last 50 or 60 pages of this novel, creating a wholly unacceptable and bizarre ending.

These talents are wasted here, just as your time will have been if you pick up this book."},{"Title":"Absolute Friends","review":"I've read some wonderful books by the author, but this one seems overwritten-- at least the first half repetitive and tedious-- endless pages of left wing rant.

Ted Mundy is a nondescript sort of guy who, because of a long ago friendship with a radical in the Berlin of the 60's, is recruited as a British agent. Sasha is an almost unreal character, impossibly idealistic, with no physical appeal but tons of charisma, and he attracts Mundy to his radical, socialist/anarchist cause. But Sasha disappears behind the Iron Curtain and Mundy is expelled from Germany; they only reconnect many years later as Sasha becomes a double agent and Mundy his contact.Le Carre sets his story firmly in the Post-Iraq era; alliances are murky, there are no good guys and bad guys, and US allies have become unsuspecting pawns. Le Carre is a jaded and cynical man, suspicious of power in any form, convinced that idealism is useless in this confused world. The end of the story is violent and shocking, and not for those who like black and white resolutions. But Le Carre has lost none of his skill; that the stories are now ambiguous, cynical and angry is only a reflection of the real world. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Absolute Friends","review":"This is The best Le Carre novel I have read since Smiley's people and I have read them all.

It's not exactly a spy book, and it's not exactly an edge-or-your-seat thriller. Espionage just happens to be part of what occurs, but it is not really even central to the story. What is central is the character, and the changes of history. The story spans the cold war to present, following the main character as he goes to many countries and watching him change with the times.The book is written in the first person, so the readers know only what the main character knows, which I think is the best way to write a novel like this. I read The Spy Who Came in From the Cold after I read this, and I was disappointed to find that The Spy used a narrative style that let you see into the minds of more than one person, and it didn't let you know all of the thoughts of even the main character. For that and other reasons I liked Absolute Friends better.With such a great story, I was disappointed to find that the ending was a bit far-fetched. However, I'm still going to give it five stars because the rest of the book is so good.

In fewer than twenty pages the reader can predict the outcome but it takes a good three hundred pages to begin to get interesting. That fades quickly with le Carre's ham-fisted slamming of the West for everything wrong with the world, a numbing tirade that seems to be the only purpose for the novel. It certainly isn't to tell a story. Le Carre fails to use even the slightest subtlety in either character development or plot. What happened to the master story teller?

Well, that doesn't begin to describe the rant at the end. The ending of the story is positively ludicrous. (BTW, I am very middle of the road politically.)

If you are naive enough to believe that America is the cause of all that is wrong with the world, you may just be barely naive enough to read this book without laughing out loud.

Amongst modern history, the Berlin wall is a speck of dust. He'd be better off writing about Panama or Grenada. Writing about the Berlin Wall segment of the Cold War in the 21st century is like beating a dead horse. The characters are ridiculous. If this guy Mundy is so smart, why does he worship Sasha? Why?

Instead of taking her up on her offer, Mundy plays the Good Samaritan and offers her a meal.Drawn to this neglected and abused woman, Mundy escorts her home, against her will. It doesn't take long for Mundy to establish himself as a father figure to Zara's eleven year old son, Mustafa, and soon enough within Zara's bed.Although things change while Mundy is entertaining a multicultural group of English speaking tourists at Linderhof, a Bavarian Palace, where he works as a tour guide. Like a shadow from the past, Sasha shows up requesting a meet. Sasha is the son of a East German Lutheran Pastor and a middle aged double agent. Mundy agrees and follows Sasha to a secluded flat. Here Mundy's memories take over after the two men greet.Recollections reveal who Ted Mundy really is, where he comes from, as well as his feelings. A boy born in Pakistan, an adolescent with an alcoholic father who refuses to clarify his mother's identity, and for most of life has associated himself with any cause encountered. From communism and socialism to his first meeting with Sasha in Berlin, when they were university students and at the height of the cold war.Mundy himself is a flawed individual that has practically failed at everything: college, reporter, novelist, businessman, and radio interviewer. But has managed to succeed at one thing: a secret double agent.John le Carr&eacute;'s book could be seen as \\"anti-American\\" if one chose to read into things and very easily find reason with phrases such as: Journalists, however, were blandly reminded that the United States reserved to itself the right to \\"hunt down its enemies at any time in any place with or without the cooperation of its friends and allies.\\" Or \\"The easiest and cheapest trick for any leader is to take his country to war on false pretenses. Anyone who does that should be hounded out of office for all time.\\"But how far is America willing to go? How much are we, the people, willing to tolerate?The war in Iraq, government deception and corporate misdeeds on an unsuspecting public are just some of what readers can expect. Absolute Friends is filled with engaging characters that guarantee to generate reader sympathy. The underlying layers and messages are sure to evoke much thought no matter how one feels of the ongoing war, 9/11, political views or President Bush.Absolute Friends is an exceptionally powerful and spellbinding novel. Not only in its implications of democracy but also in how the threat of terrorism is being used, in our world of today. If you liked Fahrenheit 9/11, you'll like this book. This is one book you'll want to read or give as a gift to your favorite activist!Reviewed by Betsie"},{"Title":"Absolute Friends","review":"ABSOLUTE FRIENDS is perhaps John le Carr&eacute;'s most elegant construct in some time. By its conclusion, it also reflects the author's anger against America's and Britain's overt justification for their current involvement in Iraq, i.e. as the front line in the war against Muslim terrorism. I doubt if it will be preferred bedtime reading for George Dubya or Tony Blair, just as CONSTANT GARDENER wouldn't find favor with pharmaceutical company CEOs.The hero of the story, and its ultimate patsy, is Edward \\"Ted\\" Mundy, born in Lahore of a British officer in the Indian Army and a native nursemaid to an aristocratic English family on the very night that the Raj formally splintered into India and Pakistan. Ted's mother dies during childbirth. His father, the \\"Major\\", subsequently joins the new Pakistani Army, but is eventually sent back to England in disgrace after striking a brother officer. Over the decades, the younger Mundy plays cricket, drops out of Oxford, becomes a Berlin anarchist, is expelled from West Germany, and becomes a minor functionary in the British government and an MI-6/Stasi double agent. Then, after German reunification, Ted fails as an English language teacher in Heidelberg, becomes a tour guide at one of Mad King Ludwig's castles in Bavaria, and meets his final destiny as an apparent Muslim sympathizer who's fallen in love with a Turkish ex-prostitute. Mundy's largely directionless life is characterized by a lack of entrenched commitment to anything political, and, like a leaf, is blown from cause to cause by girlfriends, wife, mistress, intelligence handler, circumstance, and, above all, his \\"absolute friend\\" Sasha, a stateless, radical visionary/philosopher/anarchist, whom Ted originally meets during his youthful anti-establishment period in West Berlin.As with any le Carr&eacute; offering, all of which compulsively stress character and plot development, the reader seeking action and thrills need not open the cover. To my mind, the author's greatest triumphs were the two George Smiley novels, TINKER, TAILOR, SOLDIER, SPY and SMILEY'S PEOPLE, both of which were made into superb television miniseries by the BBC and starring Alec Guinness in the title role. Here, Mundy, in his own way, is as engaging a protagonist as Smiley. However, I must ultimately knock-off a star because I, while no uncritical supporter of George Dubya and his Iraqi venture, somewhat resent being presented with an entertainment opportunity that becomes, in the end, simply a vehicle for the author to grind an ax, albeit cleverly done. John must be getting cranky in his old age."},{"Title":"Absolute Friends","review":"Strong friendships in the spy business are allegedly rare and even deemed impossible to maintain. Who can you trust? What is truth? On which side is the other? Who is the enemy, yesterday, today and tomorrow? In this latest endeavor to explore the spy thriller genre beyond the cold war, Le Carre explores these and other questions. First of all, this is the story of two unlikely friends: one English, with a strong colonial background, the other German, with an East German background. They first meet in Berlin during the late 60s student rebellion. From then on they get drawn together by circumstance or design over years and decades after, until ...The story's centre is Ted Mundy, an unidentified narrator follows him and seems to view the world more or less from the same perspective. Mundy's on and off reflections of his increasingly complicated life expose him as an accidental spy. He feels like he's having multiple personalities. Drawn by a sense of responsibility toward his student friend, he gets enmeshed deeper and deeper in political intrigues even long after the Berlin Wall comes down. Why does he continue despite the alternative of a fresh start and a small piece of personal happiness? Does he have a real choice?Sasha, his friend and German counterpart, incorporates traits of young German rebels of the day. He also typifies a certain type of former East German refugee in the West who is torn between dream and reality: anti-west as well as anti-east. The question keeps arising whether he has any real moral standing or is a floater, a prime candidate for the double agent. Several other players who stand out in their respective roles surround the two main characters. There are several attractive women, of course, and English and American spymasters. While all are a bit shady, the \\"honest\\" spymaster remains, not surprisingly, the Brit.Le Carre knows how to draw people and create situations. His description of life in a student commune in Berlin of the time is brilliant in its accuracy and atmospheric depiction. Ted's childhood in India, then Pakistan, is conveyed through images that explain its influence on him, his ongoing nostalgia for the place and the people. A major strength of the book is these images and the characterization of Mundy as a result of all his experiences. Being familiar with the events of the time, especially in Berlin, I was captured by the story. For me Absolute Friends is more than a spy thriller - the core thriller only starts more than halfway through the story. While the first half is a build up of the two main characters for the later events, it also sets the stage for the ongoing exploration of friendships and the complexities of human relations. The final drama of the book has led to criticism of Le Carre. However, while unlikely in reality, within the context of the story it was a logical conclusion.Absolute Friends has attracted friends and foes. Those interested in the European scene up to and beyond the fall of the Berlin Wall will find the story especially interesting. Those looking for the traditional spy thriller may be disappointed in the length it dedicates to the characters and their interactions. [Friederike Knabe]"},{"Title":"Absolute Friends","review":"Okay, le Carre's last book, The Constant Gardener, was marred by too much anti-capitalist pontificating, and the ending of this one declares its post 9/11 ideological leanings in a very blunt way, but don't dismiss le Carre as a crank: Absolute Friends is a first rate novel by a first rate writer working near the top of his form.In this book le Carre fuses two of his main preoccupations: the inner lives of spies and the patched-together moral systems of men living on the crumbling fringes of the British Empire. Ted Mundy is the son of a disgraced soldier mustered out of the British Army in Pakistan. Ted's father takes him back to England where he endures the rainy, inhospitable life of a down-at-the-heels English schoolboy. His love of the German language and its literature carries him to Berlin during the sixties, where he falls in with a left-leaning tribe of radicals and anarchists. It's here that he meets his lifelong friend, Sasha, the renegade son of a German Lutheran pastor.Sasha, both street-smart and hopelessly romantic, jumps over the wall to East Germany, where he becomes as disillusioned with ham-fisted socialism as he had been with exploitative capitalism. Ted, now back in Britain, shepherding art groups on tours through Iron Curtain countries, meets his old friend again in East Berlin. Sasha, under the guise of recruiting Mundy as a German spy, becomes in turn a double agent for the Brits. This is familiar turf for le Carre, and he mines it for his usual insightful explorations of individual identity. Ted has to deal with who he is, both in the existential moments of deception, and during the dead times when it's just him and the left-over bits of personality that he's kept out of the day-to-day masquerades.The crumbling of the Soviet Empire puts an abrupt end to Ted and Sasha's spy careers. Ted is rewarded with a language school in Germany that eventually takes a financial nosedive. Sasha wanders in the wilderness as an itinerant radical lecturer until he meets Dmitri, a man with a murky past and a messianic vision for the modern west. Sasha finds Ted and enlists him in yet another scheme to redeem the world from error. What happens next is what might occur if America were run by a dogmatic, not- very-bright leader who happened to be fronting for people opportunistic enough to use the threat of terrorist attacks as a means of consolidating their power.Sasha and Ted are immensely sympathetic characters who have compassion in abundance, a sense of history, and a belief in the world's inter-connectedness. What makes them different from Smiley and le Carre's other spies is that they're only intermittently propped up by their sense of historical imperative; otherwise they're forced to improvise, and it's this combustible mix of idealism and improvisation that leads to tragedy.Le Carre burns with moral outrage, but he doesn't let his beliefs outrun his literary judgment. The pacing here is masterful, the prose precise, and the characters nuanced in their feelings and reactions. At a historical moment when the very idea of nuance is under attack, we need more writers who have the drive and talent to make us ask what it means to be a socially responsible human in this particular time. Such writers are a necessary counterweight to those politicians who use current events to ram home their political agendas."},{"Title":"Absolute Friends","review":"This effort by le Carre is as much literature as it is spy thriller. While dry and slow to get going, you will be rewarded if you stick with it. This is first-rate character development, better than anything else he has done so far. Well worth the price in paperback."},{"Title":"Absolute Friends","review":"If you can ignore a totally forced and therefore poor ending, quite uncharacteristic for LeCarre, you can still find this a delightful reading experience.LeCarre has the gift of engaging and finely wrought narrative down cold. He can probably do it in his sleep. And here, he delivers such a gift with some depth of human content and feeling, following his hapless hero Ted Mundy and his \\"absolute friend\\" Sasha through the third world and through an absolutely hilarious account of radical 60s Germany. This comes across marvelously authentic and one suspects it is vintage first hand observation stored up for years from the author's early agent days in that era. It alone is worth the price of the book, and merits 3 stars all on its own, without a care for the rest of the book.Frankly I don't think my country is the Great Satan so I'll let the ending pass. LeCarre simply has never understood Americans very well. But we're big enough to take it. It works plotwise up to a point and is not a total spoil. It is certainly possible, sure -- as possible as Tony Blair and George Bush coming out of the closet and getting married, though highly unlikely. Well, taking a pie in the face of this sort comes with the territory of what we have become. You don't have to either buy the neocon line, either, to dislike it, and being anti-war shouldn't cause you necessarily to endorse it, either. It just exposes the guy as a little on the bender, somewhat off his balanced center, under the influence, whatever. But great writers are entitled to occasional screw ups, and this book delivers a lot else in terms of character and dead-on observation anyway."},{"Title":"Absolute Friends","review":"I've read every one of le Carre's books and this is his weakest effort. A good story, I kept turning the pages but the story left me with the impression that it was a political statement with a plot wrapped around it. I couldn't agree more with the political statement, but it would have been better as a non-fiction book reading directly about le Carre's opinions."},{"Title":"Absolute Friends","review":"John Le Carre's an angry man. Years of working at intelligence and writing of the spy's world, you'd think he'd earned a rest. But the lessons of the Cold War, ignored by the West's leaders today, fuel his creativity. So, in his seventh decade, his ascerbic pen [keyboard?] continues chronicling political fallacies. In a style harsher than most of his previous books, Le Carre confronts today's world even more forcefully than in the past. His command of language remains unmatched, but subtlety has been tempered with a new assertiveness.In creating a new character, Le Carre depicts a long span of time in this book. Ted Mundy's early years as a student radical in Berlin establish the foundation for this story. There, Mundy encounters Sasha, who becomes friend and mentor. Mundy, not a revolutionary, has a vague notion of wanting a better world. Lacking Sasha's dedication, and being shipped back to Britain, Mundy's life becomes the image of a man shambling along a country lane. No purpose, no successes - the images of his childhood in Pakistan with a drunken officer father and Muslim Ayah [nanny] impinge on his consciousness. As do the tales Col. Mundy told of Ted's almost divine mother. In his wanderings, Ted's links with Sasha are lost. He's an absent friend.After many frustrating years, some in America, Mundy returns to Britain. His wanderings and introspections have led him to create a series of \\"selfs\\" - Mundy One, Two and so on. A new one is created when he's recruited to become an agent. The \\"cultural\\" maven is an old ploy for snooping or running agents. Mundy seems to have a magic touch, not least because his primary contact is Sasha. Sasha, disillusioned with the absolutisms and hypocrisies of the communist regimes, is a double agent in his own right. Between the two, links are forged to give Mundy the highest accolades from his British masters. The collapse of the Soviet Union reduces much of Mundy's focus - he's already passed through a marriage and fatherhood.Adding to his confusion is another appearance of Sasha, who had vanished with The Wall. Sasha has a project. A big project - one that will remake the world. The American invasion of Iraq has unbalanced Mundy and Sasha's proposal tips him further. What role could a tired, middle-aged former radical have in relation to the crusade of the Coalition of the Willing? Le Carre speaks through his characters to condemn the sham of a professed expansion of liberty hiding a new colonialism. He uses Mundy to act as a foil to hypocritical Anglo-American adventures. Mundy knows both worlds, and some beyond. He should be a valiant campaigner with Sasha as his partner and mentor. Can he meet and overcome this new challenge?Le Carre's mastery of portrayal of the spy's persona has lost nothing with the passage of years. Ted Mundy is an entirely new character. He's not the dotty old uncle of George Smiley, nor the rambunctious adventurer of \\"Honourable Schoolboy\\". Mundy could be a neighbour, even a cousin or close friend. His stresses are internal, but not entirely closed off. Hiding your life's work in mundane employment is a soul-breaking role, and Le Carre has depicted it masterfully. A book to be enjoyed in reprise, even if the ultimate outcome remains in the hands of the Coalition of the Willing. [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]"},{"Title":"Absolute Friends","review":"Unlike most of the negative reviewers, I am fairly sympathetic to Le Carre's basic message in this book--that the US has far overreached in the \\"war\\" on terrorism and that European governments have cynically gone along with the US.But I found the book overwrought and unsubtle, which is surprising from the creator of Smiley's world where what was not said was more important than what was said. In Absolute Friends Le Carre takes off on radical cants and screeds from the late 1960's and early 1970's that last for dozens of pages and lead absolutely nowhere. The words he puts into his characters' mouths in the commune in West Berlin or Sasha's later \\"conversion\\" period read as if taken from the script of a really bad movie--stiff, hyperrevolutionary, unreal. I was active in the radical left in that period, and while the concepts and words he uses were tossed around in print and in a few beer-sotted discussions in dark bars, no one talked that way all the time or took themselves that seriously.Saddest for me was that Le Carre made his main characters--Ted and Sasha--so blind as to be stupid. The reader has so much more insight into events than the main characters that we wind up wondering how they could be such blind idiots, how they can miss what is so obvious to anyone else. This disrespect for the characters was a major drawback to my enjoyment of the book. In the Smiley novels, there was plenty of self-ignorance, as there is in all of us, and this made the characters human. But in Ted and Sasha, we get cartoon characters who do not see the anvil balanced on the door they are about to open. It just does not ring true.So, bully for the message, but I wish it had been contained in a better missive. One can only wonder what Alan Furst would have done with this material--likely far more subtle, quiet, and disquieting."},{"Title":"Absolute Friends","review":"Having been a huge fan of John leCarre for over thirty years, it pains me to give one of his books only two stars. But this book doesn't warrant anything more.Anyone who's read any of his other books are by now familiar with leCarre's extensive use of back-story -- seemingly random memories and events of the past that unfold in mind-numbing detail over the first third of the book that seem to have no point until all the various threads are carefully woven together into a master tapestry by the end of the novel. Alas, in this novel, the back-story goes on and on for about three-quarters of the book, yet there's no big payoff. We learn a lot about the two main characters -- wandering idealists with no real purpose in life who find themselves rebelling against the evils of capitalism and communism alike while getting get caught up in the spy-trade -- , but other than painting a sympathetic portrait of these protagonists, there's no real point to all of this back-story.Worse, however, is that the ending is completely implausible. The ending might have worked in a Robert Ludlum novel, where the implausibility of the plot is part of the entertainment value of the story, but it doesn't work (at least for me) in a leCarre novel where I expect everything to fit so well together at the end. I can't go into any more detail without giving away the ending, but unless you are bound and determined to read all of leCarre's books it's probably not worth it to buy this one. Instead, read The Spy Who Came In From The Cold or Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. Those are truly fabulous books."},{"Title":"Absolute Friends","review":"I loved le Carre's spy novels and was expecting more of the same but this book has been a disappointment. It is very slow moving and hard to get any sympathy for the characters. It's taken me a week to get to chapter 5 (I usually read a book in a few days) and I'm not sure I'll make it to the end on this one unless it gets better soon."},{"Title":"Absolute Friends","review":"Guess what, I actually didn't finish this book in one goal because the first part of the book was a bit too slow to me while the author spent time building up the backgrounds of the characters. After few months I went back and continue the rest of the book, the story is so much of a surprise! It's actually heartbreaking as well!"},{"Title":"Absolute Friends","review":"John le Carre's ABSOLUTE FRIENDS is an excellent read from an excellent author. The Cold War may be over, but the spying is not, especially now that terrorism and numerous hot wars have replaced their cold war cousins. Devotees of Cold War literature must have reveled in the first two thirds of this book, with its descriptions of 1960's protest movements and recollections of what used to be called East Germany and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Remember them?But the world's hegemon is no longer the USSR, is it? Two guesses as to which \\"hyperpower\\" has replaced it. It is this finger-pointing at one's own western self that has got the knickers of so many le Carre critics in a twist.How can le Carre imply that America is the new bad actor? Just because we invaded and destroyed another country, continue to deny that our prisoners of war are actually Prisoners of War, reject as \\"not applicable\\" the Geneva Conventions on humane treatment of prisoners, hide our captives from the Red Cross and their own governments, spy on our own citizens, and kidnap and render the innocent and guilty alike, is no reason to believe that we are somehow out of control, is it? After all, it's what made Britain Great; besides, other people are worse, aren't they? And for le Carre to imply that our military-industrial-espionage complex and its freedom-loving corporate sponsors are making a packet out of it all is just beyond the pale. Isn't it?Just remember to say, as you reach the denouement of the book, \\"It's only a novel.\\""},{"Title":"Absolute Friends","review":"I really knew better; I had read The Constant Gardener for heaven's sake. But in the airport shop, desperate for something to read on my next flight, I took the plunge. Le Carre is not the first of my favorite authors to get his devotees hooked on totally absorbing, intriguing books and then betray their trust, stabbing them in the back, inflicting his bitterness and hatred on them.How could the author of The Spy who Came in from the Cold and the Smiley books do this to us? It took me three readings, two viewings of the TV series and copious notes on yellow pads to understand Tinker, Tailor thoroughly, and it was well worth the effort. George Smiley has to be one of the most fascinating characters of all time. And now, Absolute Friends?? Gimme a break.After the first few pages, I'd decided to drop the book into the first trash receptacle at the next airport, but, curse the man, he is just so hopelessly INTERESTING. His choice of words is flawless. His wry wit provides more laughs per page than most humourists'. I have to agree with others that there are overlong passages of repetitive, boring philosophical diatribe, but it is easy to skip paragraphs and even entire pages and go on from there.I've concluded that aging authors realize that they won't be here forever and they'd better get busy dispensing their political biases to their captive audiences while they still can. And instead of expressing their beliefs in honest, straightforward non-fiction, they know that they can rope in more devoted, trusting fans with exciting page-turners (and this book certainly is that.)John, my advice to you, if you are determined to dispense your personal philosophy, is that you weave your political ideas into your plots with shorter, more frequent, less predictable doses, so that the reader absorbs them before realizing it, and can't just skip along, blithely ignoring the gratuitous philosophy."},{"Title":"Absolute Friends","review":"John le Carre is in that rare group of writers - Graham Greene, Martin Cruz Smith, Robert Littell, among a few others - who write \\"thrillers\\" that occasionally transcend the genre and become Serious Books. \\"Absolute Friends\\" is one such book. In it, le Carre lets his fury fly as he lets fly at the leaders who ran the world during the Cold War and the aftermath.Based on \\"Absolute Friends,\\" I wouldn't want to share table conversation with le Carre when the Iraq War comes up. In the world of \\"Absolute Friends,\\" governments create military actions, intelligence assignments, and entire wars out of cynical self-interest, and have no qualms about terrorizing the people whom they purport to represent. Le Carre may not believe the precise B.S. to be found in \\"Fahrenheit 911,\\" but he also does not believe that the Iraq War has been fought with any thought for the good of the Iraqi people.To tell his story, le Carre creates two protagonists. The first is Ted Mundy, born of a drunken blow-hard of a British major in a brand-new Pakistan. Ted is a bit of a cipher, an empty vessel, but in his soul-searching wanderings he meets up with his lifelong friend, Sasha. They meet in Berlin during the student protests against the Vietnam War (and seemingly anything and everything), and Sasha is one of the charismatic student leaders. Le Carre pokes quite a bit of fun at the student protestors, but nothing like the savaging he gives the various governments.Ultimately, Mundy and Sasha end up playing an intelligence game on both sides of the Iron Curtain. Unlike in James Bond movies, where there is a clear villain and plot line spelled out early on by a helpful intelligence minister, the spy world of \\"Absolute Friends\\" is a weird place where nobody is really sure exactly what is going on, and so much of the game is inside baseball, making no sense unless you are steeped in the game. Along the way, Ted and Sasha form a bond that is stronger than marriage, stronger even than brotherhood.It is true that \\"Absolute Friends\\" is a long book, with rather slow-developing story. A couple of times, I considered dropping it, only to soldier on. And I thank the stars I did - the novel's final act is so cynical, so surprising, so pitch-perfect in le Carre's twisted world, that everything that went before fell into place.Le Carre is a writer with an accomplished set of books to his credit. \\"Absolute Friends\\" belongs near the top of that list."},{"Title":"Absolute Friends","review":"Covering events spanning seven decades from the partition of India to today's war in Iraq, this novel tracks a pair of left thinking, anti-establishment men who, despite very different personalities, become and remain through the years \\"absolute friends.\\" Le Carre examines the development of their poltical and social values, and he chronicles their on and off exploits as they move from 1960's Berlin revolutionaries to cold war spies and beyond.The story is excellent, though it is guaranteed to offend some readers--particularly many American conservatives. Better than the storyline though, is le Carre's superb writing style and his complete command of the English language. His literary craftsmanship is truly remarkable."},{"Title":"Absolute Friends","review":"Have over hundreds of books in my \\"library.\\" Not a whole lot by many standards, but I have many fiction/nonfiction espionage books & have been a long-time fan of Le Carre (the nom de plume of David Cornwell). I read about 120 pages into Absolute Friends before putting it down in disgust. It went nowhere -- no plot, no substance, shoddy character development. In the past, I have persevered with slow-moving books which picked up at the end, but with Absolute Friends, it was Absolute Disgust. Like any other aging artist, Le Carre/Cornwell may just have used up the last of his artistic ability. What a shame. If you are new to Le Carre, buy his earlier works -- they ROCK!"},{"Title":"Absolute Friends","review":"An unusual thriller that gives good insight to how someone can get caught up in espionage in the first place, without ever really thinking about about the true nature of what he is getting involved with and its consequences."},{"Title":"Absolute Friends","review":"Ted Mundy is the son of a British officer who, after being expelled from Pakistan, spends his days drinking.

Here the tall Mundy meets the small, cripple Sasha, who is the thinker and leader of the commune and an unexpected friendship ensues that will last for the rest of their lives.After numerous adventures Mundy becomes a kind of cultural representative at the British Council and when he meets Sasha agin in East Germany there follows a complicated game of espionage and contra-espionage in which Sasha gives information to the West and Mundy gives disinformation to the East.At the end of the cold war they go their separate ways for a while, but ultimately Sasha asks Mundy whether he wants to join the contra-forces: this time to set up a university of inteelectuals who want to resist against the large influence that corporate America has on free thinking and to try to discover the truth and spread the information. This is of course against the will and interest of the Americans and they fight back hard.A good, believable book, but it takes a long time before the action starts."},{"Title":"Absolute Friends","review":"Beautifully written, a joy to read through just like Constant Gardener, but I'm not the type who can follow spy plots and pre-war government philosophies, etc. I just hope they make a movie out of this so I can follow it better."},{"Title":"Absolute Friends","review":"\\"Absolute Friends\\" starts as a coming of age novel, and ends as a fictional conspiracy theory, reflecting Le Carre's deep distrust of the American political establishment and its intervention in Iraq. In between is vintage Le Carre: Ted Mundy is a very decent guy recruited to spy for England, with unhappy consequences for his personal life. He never achieves the unambiguous satisfaction of a job well done.Mundy is a nicely realized character, and his situation is not that different from a denizen of the corporate world who gives up a lot for his employer. Le Carrre is only moderately successful with his other characters, but at least they are convincing in their roles. The idealist, Sasha, is very intense, which is reasonable, and if he seems hopelessly nave at the end, it is a naivete born out of a desperation to believe. At the same time I can understand while some reviewers have called this work \\"overwrought\\". The novel moves at a pace more appropriate to a literary effort, which this is, than to a page turner."},{"Title":"Absolute Friends","review":"One of his better books I have read.

As for my opinion of the book, I assert that his politics have never been more right-on or nuanced, his characters more developed, or their existential crises more vividly and heartbreakingly described."},{"Title":"Absolute Friends","review":"While reading this book I got the distinct impression that it was changed in mid-course. It was as if le Carre had written 300 pages of a taut cold war thriller when the invasion of Iraq occurred, and he diverted the course of the story so that he could deliver a personal diatribe against American hyper-power hegemony. He would have been better served to use the subtlety and character development he is so famous for rather than stick-figure neo-con caricatures to deliver his message.I have read every book that le Carre has ever written, and enjoyed most immensely. Let us hope he returns to form in the future."},{"Title":"Absolute Friends","review":"Absolute Friends is in some ways a typical LeCarre production: protagonist Ted Mundy is the son of a soldier of the British Raj, and former student radical who fails honorably at many pursuits but excels as a Cold War spy. He could be one of Smiley's people, one of the more eccentric denizens of the Circus. He has the ironic detachment and the shadows and sadnesses of LeCarre's best creations.But Mundy is more ambiguous and interesting, and more appealing, than the typical LeCarre misfit. Brought up to think his mother, who died bearing him, was a member of the aristocracy, he learns that she was really an Irish servant. The discovery does not displease him: Mundy identifies with humble people and underdogs generally, from his love for the Pakistani Ayah who mothered him to his romantic attachment to a Turkish prostitute.Like Smiley (and LeCarre himself), Mundy immerses himself in German at Oxford. There, he is radicalized by the left-wing beauty Ilse. His subsequent study in Germany brings him into contact with Sasha, an intense and radical student and a \\"weird little bugger,\\" as Mundy observes toward the end of the book. Mundy's radical Berlin days, and apparently his friendship with Sasha, come to an end in a violent clash with the police. Afterward, Mundy tries and fails at many things, before returning to Britain to become an employee of a British arts council and to attempt a normal married life.But Sasha comes back into Mundy's life when, as part of an international arts exchange, Mundy accompanies a troupe of actors into East Germany. There he meets Sasha again. Sasha has been seduced into the workers' paradise and has now, against his will, been recruited into the Stasi, the East German secret police. But the reader soon learns that Sasha is actually a double agent working with British intelligence. Soon, so is Mundy.Once the Berlin Wall falls, Mundy's career in espionage ends. But he cannot escape Sasha, who returns to Mundy's life with a new project. LeCarre here begins a more swiftly plotted but ultimately unsatisfactory story dominated by a sinister, paranoid, and ruthless U.S. bent on eradicating terror.LeCarre clearly has strong feelings about the Iraq War, about Blair and Bush, and about the U.S. as a malevolent \\"hyperpower.\\" If you are at all pro-Bush or pro-Iraq War you will probably not enjoy this book very much. The book eventually descends into tiresome anti-American polemics, and the principal American character comes across as too relentlessly evil to be really credible.I love LeCarre's work generally. I wanted to love this book, but only was able to admire it for its literary quality and deft craftsmanship. However, I am still looking forward to LeCarre's next."},{"Title":"Absolute Friends","review":"Don't listen to the silly, muddle-headed writer below: this is fine, well-written spy novel that, like all such books and films, stretches credibility at times, but still manages to wrap itself up nicely at the end with a climactic finish that is all the more thrilling because it is SO thoroughly BELIEVABLE. The novel makes it clear that LeCarre is a wise and broad-minded author who well understands the tangled mass of the new global media and its ramifications for international politics during times of War. Ultimately, his political message is nothing so crude and base as the \\"America is the root of all evil\\" line which the overly-defensive alarmist below accuses him of. Rather, this book is a sweeping, objective look at the ways people develop, act upon, promote, are blinded by, and ultimately fall victim to their own ideological fervor. Yes, at the end of the story America comes out looking bad, but let's face it: America is doing a pretty good job of THAT with or without LeCarre's help - He was simply smart enough to turn our recent follies into a genuinely good and wholly sincere work of fiction.

People from all over the world (included US and Israel) expressed similar distrust. In the other hand, there clearly exists another side. I did hear Arabs, officials and others, refer to Saddam Hussein as \\"criminal\\". He did send missals to Israeli civilian targets. 9/11 did happen, followed by an ambivalent response from the Arab world (people in the Palestinian Authority celebrating, remember?) Things couldn't be that simple! And who if not John Le-Caree can better introduce us to the conflict, the powers behind the scenes, the international interests as well as the possible power and influence of individuals?But not this time.This is a book about two men, one of then we've already met (in a different name and fate) in a previous book, the other constantly dwells into unintelligible left-ish high talk, and in the end the coalition's behind exposed to us, the reader, but not to the nave world. Wou.Now, if the author just wanted to tell us the story of Mundy and Sasha, then it's just another mostly slow paced book. If he want to tell us that the whole world is lead by few Westerns that feel closer to God than the rest of us, and are only motivated by the joy of war and are using the poor Arabs as dispensable toys - well, this nihilism is not logically impossible; Maybe 9/11 is an American conspiracy, as well as missals to Israel, Palestinian terror against citizens etc. The problem with such approach is - just as well one can believe the reverse it true! That all Arabs are bad, that all they want is to rule the world, that Arabs leaders abducted Le-Caree and put a cheap in his brain or something. How do you decide between two unsubstantiated extremes? By your own religion? The people you had better sex with? Those who cheat you better? I'd rather think there is moral and practical guidelines out there, people who may be fallible but they sometimes try. I know for a fact there are good people, bad people, and in-between people in every country. However, they didn't have an equal opportunity to be represented in this book.And the problem I am facing now, is that I realized Le-Caree is not impartial to the truth. What about his others books, then? The Tailor from Panama, Single & Single, Our Game, The Little Drummer Girl, The Constant Gardener? All those books that I saw as introduction to reality and so warmly recommended to others, could they, too, be completely off? David Cornwell is not to be trusted more than George W. Bush?Please tell me there will be an additional, corrected, edition."},{"Title":"Sexuality, Obscenity, And Community: Women, Muslims, and the Hindu Public in Colonial India","review":"Before reading this book, I did not know much about Indian History, especially the cultural aspects, and this book goes into great detail about Indian nationalism and how sexuality played a role in Indian nationalism's development. The reason that I gave the book 3/5 stars is because the author, who is Indian, seems to write mainly to people who not only know Indian History, but who can also read the Hindi language. While she does give a glossary at the end of the book, it becomes very confusing to read and understand when Hindi words make up a large part of the sentences. While not all sentences are written like that, many are, and it becomes annoying to continually refer to the glossary. Also, pictures and advertisements are spread throughout the book, but some of them have no translation, which makes the pictures less helpful than if they were translated. I understand that in each language there are words that have no translations, but words could have been chosen in English that could have at least approximated the ideas that she wished to convey. Don't get me wrong, the book is very interesting and informative, but the language poses a problem. Had the book not used so many Hindi words in its progression, I would have given it 4/5 stars. Instead, it only received 3/5, but of course that is just my humble opinion. Or it may just be that I am too lazy to memorize the 150+ words of Hindi in the glossary that are used throughout the book."},{"Title":"Khrushchev Remembers","review":"Not your conventional auto biography. Publisher states, \\"Whether the author intended or expected his words ever to find their way into print, either in his own country or in the West, is a matter of speculation.\\"Qustion everything you see, hear and read today.That's all I'm saying."},{"Title":"Creative Editing","review":"Although this book has been helpful, several of the worksheet exercises were torn out of the back of the book."},{"Title":"The Philosopher's Pupil","review":"Dame Murdoch convincingly creates a rich world within the fictional English spa village of Ennistone. The sweep of characters and allusions, historical, literary and philosophical, are impressive. In typical Murdoch fashion, the action revolves around an anti-social genius, in this case the philosopher, Rozanov. His famed intellect is more than offset but his petty cruelty and utter alienation from human society. His wretched ex-pupil, George, is his drunken disciple, repeatedly spurned by the &quot;great man.&quot; The various sub-plots, involving Quakers, an homo-sexual Anglican priest, half-Gypsy maid-servants, a swimming lap-dog, and Rozanov's absurdly innocent and estranged grand-daughter, all illustrate various human foibles. All of the mere mortals want different things from the philosopher, but he is an empty man. All brain, no heart, except for his incestuous lust for his grand-daughter. I greatly preferred &quot; A Fairly Honourable Defeat,&quot; and &quot;The Sea, the Sea,&quot; as examples of the author weaving her tapestry of human frailty, self-deception, and morality. And at 700 pages, I wonder if a bit of judicious editing would not have kept things more interesting. A staggering and erudite achievement, nonetheless. Murdoch attempts more in a single paragraph than many authors achieve in a lifetime."},{"Title":"The Philosopher's Pupil","review":"The philosopher's Pupil was the first Murdoch novel I read. It will always stand for me as her best. What a shock! It starts with the best couple argument I've ever read (insight, humor, cruelity, style) and finishes with a perfect ending. You will find here Murdoch at her best: close and opressive ambients sudenly moved by a new and powerful presence, water all over the place, sex as salvation, philophical arguments, high minded personalities, women earth and men demons, victims, wolfes, all her imaginary to create a perfect moral tale about love, family and getting old. It is always a pleasure to read Iris Murdoch, but The philosopher's pupil, for me, outstands her other novels. A jewel between good jobs."},{"Title":"The Philosopher's Pupil","review":"This is a brilliant, consuming, sweeping panorama or a work--that surprisingly seems yet to get its full due, whereas many of Murdoch's earlier, shorter (and lesser) novels enjoy rave reviews, large sales, &quot;classic&quot; status, and theatrical adaptations.Yet it's a masterpiece on a multiplicity of levels, and as Mahler once said of *his* more &quot;difficult&quot; work, &quot;[Its] time will yet come.&quot;I wouldn't recommend this to someone who has naver read Murdoch--but, if you've read and enjoyed *The Black Prince* or *The Sea, The Sea*, for instance, make this your next selection."},{"Title":"The Philosopher's Pupil","review":"This is the first time I read a work from Iris Murdoch. Years ago I read one of her earlier books and was not impressed, but after years of living and reading I decided to try her again. Well - I'm hooked.Murdoch describes her characters in a most detailed way with their human foibles, and their small town gossip The scenes at the sea side are marvellous. This writer knows how to evoke atmosphere, how to create believable characters who are flawed and still so (humanly) endearing.Her style is simple and without pretense - she introduces all the characters before she even starts her story. I delighted in the narrator \`N' who butts in every once in a while and who is just as small-town minded and slightly smug) as his characters. When Murdoch ends the book she ties up the many loose ends and gives credit where credit is due, you discover that most of the characters know \`N', which, in a way, makes sense as he/she is, after all, their creator.My complaint is that the book is too long. Like the previous reviewer I feel it should have been shortened. I simply began to skip the philosophical passages in the last part of the book, but I want to come back to them at a later date, as I enjoyed these passages the most.[Sorry, I'm not a reviewer at all - simply can offer my feelings about this book.]"},{"Title":"The Philosopher's Pupil","review":"Absolutely wonderful. A stunning novel. \`The Philosopher's Pupil' is a Dante-esque tale of love - in which numerous types of love are evoked, from dishonest to honourable, self-defeating to masochistic, platonic to deviant, and never ever simply just one type at any one time - that is set in Ennistone, a town renowned for its natural hot water springs/baths, and also filled to the brim with the heat of gossip, anger, passions, and small-minded mischief makers. But this review is not about the plot, as that's for you to enjoy in your own reading. This is an homage to the truly marvellous characters that Murdoch's genius has given life to in this novel.Murdoch has a mature nineteenth century novelist's depth to her characters; she is easily a match for Tolstoy, Trollope and Eliot, to name some of the giants of fiction. Her fictional beings are beautifully detailed, fully realised in scope and complexity, and each draws you in with their own personal world view, and reasoning and often troubled emotional life, and you are captivated in your watching and listening to them live and breathe and assert themselves in their muddled worlds.Her dialogue alone is worth the price of the novel - and the prologue, relating the car \`accident' (for it really isn't one, but an incident resulting from a violent action), is a tour de force, introducing George, the novel's devil in (barely) human form. But he is scarily human. He is, for me, the most fully realised and horribly convincing, nightmarish psychopath and sociopath I have read in fiction. Far scarier than Hannibal Lecter as a fictional creation, and more believable than a real-life monster like Ed Gein. With his extreme ranting and raving, his sheer loathing and violent, misogynistic fantasies (as well as behaviour), he is apocalyptic in tone and revenge. Yet he could just as well be one of your neighbours who has become utterly mad, yet within a framework of apparent sanity at the same time.He is the strongest case and example - though there are several others in this novel - of Murdoch's tremendous ability to create flesh-and-blood human beings that convey her passionate intellectual and creative interests, while never failing to be merely conduits or foils for her fictional plotting. There's never any sense of Deus ex Machina at work, here - her creatures spring from the page, and are all tremendously individual in language, thought and action.As if psychotic George wasn't enough for one novel, there's also the philosopher of the novel's title as well, John Robert Rozanov (George was once one of John's pupils): he is manipulative, amoral, uncaring, soul-less, intellectual and emotionally moribund and, in many ways, is far more of a devil than George himself (though never committing physical acts of violence, or verbal, as George does with such relish and ease).Then there are the brothers to George: Brian, who is just the most miserable, endlessly complaining and always irritable sod - and relentlessly funnily drawn through his dialogue and through whom a lot of the novel's humour is brilliantly played out; and Tom, the youngest of the brothers, at university and, for most of his life, to his teenage years, he is naive, delightfully happy and at one with his world and his peers, until corrupted by a Faustian task that John compels him to take up.Besides the above-named individuals, you also have the joy of being entertained by Brian's put-upon wife, poor, defeated Gabriel, always tearful, always troubled, and ready to blubber at the drop of the proverbial hat; then there's the intellectual, yet remote, and incredibly martryrish Stella, wife of the monster George (to give him credit, besides his murderous rage and violence and misogyny, he does save Zed - probably one of fiction's most charming, delightful and convincing portraits of a clever little doggie, who is Zen-like and always understanding, even when he's clueless; both part of the natural world, and yet connected with his human peers - including, most particularly, the other marvel in this novel, the boy Adam, offspring of Gabriel and Brian, and who is Francis of Assisi-like, as well as Buddhist, in his immediate and deep empathy with all living things. Murdoch clearly knows her Varieties of Religious Experience, and if the Gabriel, Stella and Zed weren't enough, you have Father Bernard, an Anglican priest who's also an atheist, who believes ultimately that the only hope and saviour for the world is religion without god, and ends up preaching like some sort of ethereal combo ascetic-Russian hermit/-ancient Desert Father-type to remote Greek island kindly peasants (and otherwise local birds who'll hang about, and the sea and the rocks).In short, I loved, loved, LOVED, this novel. It's PHWOR, and fab, funny and dark, with substance, yet as light as a perfect souffl&eacute;. There's also plenty here for lovers of Plato and Dante, for example, and yet such references are never done in an ostentatious way, but flow seamlessly with the events and thinking of the novel and her characters. And all these riches are carried through with zest right to the end and beyond, with you being totally immersed in and absorbed by the mess and muddle of these human lives (a true Murdochian talent). You are left joyous and breathless and happy and utterly, utterly impressed by Murdoch for her philosophical wisdom, her mischievous wit, her darkness and light, her psychological insights, her innate appreciation of what it means to be human. She is a novelist extraordinaire."},{"Title":"The Philosopher's Pupil","review":"If you want to make your life seem much longer, read this book. Murdoch may be a great writer but it's not evident in this book. Remember those writing classes where the prof told you to \\"show, not tell\\"? Murdoch must have decided to see if she could write a book using the completely opposite method. There is no reader interaction required here at all - you are supposed to be an open, empty vessel into which Murdoch pours an unending analysis of each character and each action. Nothing at all for your brain to do. This book is great for insomnia.All the characters in the book are, quite simply, crazy. Not one of them is the least bit believable. They are completely and utterly self centered and about as interesting as a laundry list. If you are interested in philosophy, this book will show you just how irrelevant and silly it can be. Don't say I didn't warn you."},{"Title":"Bob Books Set #3: Even More Bob Boo","review":"Alot of easy readers are boring to kids. My daughter has found the Bobs books series interesting and FUNNY, from the very first book. The books are written by a teacher and so there is a logical phonetic progression from book to book. The pictures are so cute, line drawings illustrate every page. Each little booklet is just long enough, giving the child just enough challenge. WHen my daughter finishes one, she feels so proud. I have bought literally hundreds of easy readers for my library over the years, and these books are number one with my daughter."},{"Title":"Kajira of Gor","review":"I read this series when it first came out, and I'm enjoying it again now.Everybody knows the basics---but I don't always see this series of books reviewed in a way that I would consider to be accurate, or even appropriate.John Norman is constantly berated as a misogynist gender-bashing sexist---and, if the trappings and settings of the books are to be taken in a very superficial way, then I suppose there is some merit to these claims. But I can attest to a much greater depth in these works than often meets the eye (or the psychology) of the average page-eater.Very often, and in many ways, Mr. Norman illustrates that it is the women in this series of novels who are the deepest characters---the strongest---the most noble---the most complex---and, assuredly, the most interesting. Without giving away any of the plot elements of this book, if there is a theme that is being explored here, it is the same theme that is almost universally manifested in these stories---that the female of the species, whether they be of Earth or of Gor, is exceedingly superior to the male.The guys in these books are grudgingly typical---boorish, power-hungry, easily led, and always adhering to a shallow \\"gimme gimme\\" philosophy that drags them through the plot as if they were the ones in chains---and not the women they so fatuously profess to \\"own.\\"But this is only a starting point for the gender-specific character development that Norman grants us. It goes much deeper than it looks on the surface.I am not here to give my own views on these matters---but only to alert the on-the-fence prospective reader of the Gor series that these matters are here to be found and confronted and, ultimately, to be revealed in their fullest nature---which is done in ways that I, as an avid reader of these books, always find satisfying and rewarding.As for that, it is difficult to find any living writer who has managed to delve so deeply into the dense and complicated phycho-sexual nature of today's woman. It's a tricky place to go---especially tricky to bring anything of literary value back from there---but Norman does it, time after time. And I, for one, respect and admire his work in that regard.So don't be one of those readers who gets hung up on the flashy, trendy, superficial cinematic effects that accompany this literary journey. Look beneath it. You'll find much of value there."},{"Title":"Kajira of Gor","review":"At this point I am reading the rest of the Gor novels simply to be able to say that I finished the series. Don't get me wrong, the eroticism of submission has been well (and HEAVILY) illustrated, but if I see one more woman tricked into slavery, saying she was a slave all along masquerading as a free woman, another comment on how ALL women are slaves and not truely happy unless at the feet of a man, I would happily throw these books all out. Norman is certainly entitled to his philosophy, and I have much respect for the women who chose to model a lifestyle after him (with submissive tendencies myself), but isn't there a point where you are just beating the proverbial dead horse to an even bloodier pulp?Also, please tell me how many people have actually read the portions of the story where he describes a game of Kaissa or the measurements of the war ships. I've been able to skip several sections of these books without losing out on any of the story."},{"Title":"Kajira of Gor","review":"Having read all of the Gor books, this is one of my favorites. For those who are into the slavery angle, this has the delicious forced submission of Judy Thornton to her former rival, Elicia Nevins, who makes Judy her abject slave. Turn about is fair play when Elicia is forced to submit as well."},{"Title":"Kajira of Gor","review":"This novel is seriously anti-woman. Every woman portrayed is either a slave or hateful. The author writes long tirades, supposedly the thoughts of the main character, about the superiority of Gorean men, and the natural inferiority of Gorean women. It is adult fiction. It would probably be good as a marital aid, as the sex scenes are long and sweaty."},{"Title":"Kajira of Gor","review":"Having read \\"Imaginative Sex\\" from the same author before, I understand the Gorean Saga as wonderful collection of truly romantic stories. Every bit of them holds some small truth, wrapped in myths and science fiction stories, vividly and carefully drawn characters and rich phantasies.\\"Kajira of Gor\\" is certainly one of the finest stories of the Gorean Saga, maybe only surpassed by \\"Slave girl of Gor\\" but equally thrilling and entertaining."},{"Title":"Kajira of Gor","review":"This is one of the best of the Gor series, if you happen to like the kajira characters. Some think John Norman goes over the top with his descriptions and plot, but if you're into BDSM and particularly service-oriented play, you'll really enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Kajira of Gor","review":"John Normans Counter-Earth of Gor is nearly as detailed, maybe more detailed, than Middle-Earth. But you can't really compare them, because they're not even quite in the same genre.Like Middle-Earth, Gor is full of strange creatures and unique yet Earth-like landscape, but unlike Middle-Earth, it's not the animals that are interesting, it's the humans.Kajira of Gor is told from the point of view of an Earth \\"Barbarian\\" named Tiffany Collins. An ordinary woman of unusual beauty ('Slave curves' is a term often used in the book) who finds herself first treated like a slave bu strangers in her oun appartment, and the next minute Tatrix of Corcius, or Queen of a city on Gor.SPOILER ALERT! Don't read any further if you don't want me to spoil it!Although she has authority over life and death in the city and even has a slavegirl under her oun direct command, she is treated like a slave by a han who I gather is like her Visere.And Susan who serves her, herself a Barbarian, is actually ouned by that man, and has simply been told to serve the Tatrix and instruct her to be more Gorean.But all this is just part of a conspiracy. courcius is at war with Ar, aparantly courcius is loseing the war and, if the true Tatrix were found, she would be taken to Ar like a slave and then impaled. so they found some stupid Earth purfume counder sales girl who looks a bit like the Tatrix and made her parade around the city without a veil (Freewomen on Gor wear veils, and for a Tyraness being recognizeable is particularly dangerous.)tiffany only saw the true Tatrix momentarially, she was veiled but otherwize disguised as a slave, and Tiffany was basically left there as a decoy as Ar stormed the tower while the true Tatrix escapes as a slave.That's only the first fiew chapters.I would reccomend the works of John Norman to men and women.it's a very erotic book about submission and arousal, and the connection thereof. on Gor, the 60's never happened. The American civil war never happened. Hell, the Industrial Revolution never happened. The result is that Gorean men are true men and Gorean women are true women (except for Freewomen, who are just cloaked bitches who treat slavegirls badly just because they're jealous.)I think I could learn a thing or two from gorean men. I don't think I could be as rude as them, and I would hesitate to harm let alone whip a girl (unless she told me she was a masachist) but I could definitely be as strong as them and I could stand and walk like them, i liked the way Tiffany described the Visere, \\"Asif a lion had assumed human form\\".I think women could learn a thing or two from Kajira, too. not so much just to submit to men. It's not just about pleaseing men, it's about fullfilling your oun desires.slavegirls also tend to actually say exactly what they mean litterally \\"I beg for love\\" for example. Women are much better mind readers than men, but the one thing they can't read for themselves is that we aren't.One point in the story personally struck home for me. at one point she figured out that there's two ways to please a man; one is to do stuff for him, the other is to simply let him do stuff to you. And I think she figured out, also, that her involuntary reaction to what he was doing was partly what pleased him the most. it's the latter that's more important, I think. Women could also learn from Gorean Slavegirls how to articulate their desires to their husbands/boyfreinds. If after reading a Gor book you still can't tell him what your turnons are, just hand him the book and let him read it."},{"Title":"The Redaction of the Books of Esther: On Reading Composite Texts (Monograph Series / The Society of Biblical Literature)","review":"This book requires a good grasp of Koinia Greek to follow some of the evidence presented. Fox bases all his work in this book around the premise that the three most common versions of Esther are the work of redactors rather than having been inspired.

It is simply the application of centuriesof accumulated wisdom to our modern experience.By writing this book, he has done us all a greatservice. Now, if only my manager and CEO wouldread it....Morrison applies the four dimensions of humanexperience identified by the Greek sage, Aristotle,to business development. Each dimension has adirect application through four foundations ofexcellence. As Morrison summarizes it, the IntellectualDimension aims at Truth; the Aesthetic at Beauty;the Moral at Goodness; and the Spiritual at Unity.But don't groan about the esoterics just yet. Morrisonapplies each of these very complex notions to oureveryday experience and shows how striving forfulfillment in the four dimensions brings excellenceand success in business, small and large.Morrison fails to step beyond Aristotle, however,in not discussing the Economic foundation thataims at Utility. Any attempt at the introductionof philosophical principles to business shouldinclude it. Heilbroner could give him a few pointerson that one.Lastly, the aphorisms and quotations spread throughoutthe text, while interesting and applicable (I'll bebe using some as marquees on my screen saver), arequite distracting.Without a doubt, If Aristotle Ran General Motorsis a great resource that should be studied and appliedto every person's employment. I've been waitinga long time for a book like this one."},{"Title":"If Aristotle Ran General Motors","review":"This book is neither about Aristotle nor General Motors. Do not be fooled into believing it is in any way an application of Aristotelian ethics in modern business; it is not. Morris consistently contradicts Aristotle throughout the book.An example is Morris' proselytizing conclusion that leadership requires humility. To make his point Morris quotes ancient Hasidic verse and the Tao Te Ching to establish that we are all worms. Nobility, Morris suggests, is lowness.Did Aristotle ever say this? No. Could Aristotelian writing lead us to these conclusions? No again. Is Taoism consistent with Aristotelian reason and logic? No, no, no. Is Hasidic verse? Definitely not. So what is going on? Did Morris forget to read Aristotle?Aristotle understood Man as a rational being with happiness as the moral purpose of his life. Morris does not. This book does not.Morris peppers his book with quotes at the furious rate of no less than one or two per page. He quotes every thing from fortune cookies to Einstein. Ironically with all this mad quoting he never once, ever, (I checked) quotes Aristotle - never.This book could better be titled, \\"If an irrational populist ran a non-profit organization.\\"The prefaces of basic economic texts usually contain better discussions of the practical intersection of business and philosophy."},{"Title":"If Aristotle Ran General Motors","review":"I've been working globally on &quot;people issues&quot; for too many years without finding guidance that works in most cultures, at all organization levels, and for any industry.

Specifically, Morris teaches us about business ethics, or, as his subtitle states, &quot;The New Soul of Business.&quot; But his teachings transcend the business world (or perhaps Morris would say the business world transcends business places).

Together, these principles make for an insightful look into human nature and into why we do what we do in the corporate world.Another good book that may parallel this a bit is \\"Why We Do What We Do\\" by Edward Deci. This book would be a quick and easy primer for Deci's book (see my review), while focusing more on how to make communities, organizations, and businesses better.Particularly interesting is Morris's definition of the meaning of life. If you enjoyed Ayn Rand's definition in \\"Atlas Shrugged,\\" or could echo Neitzsche's call in \\"Thus Spake Zarathustra,\\" it may be worth the buy if only for that. (Hint: It's on page 94 in the softbound copy.) It's also much easier to read.In summary, although this book will never really take the place of Dr. W. Edwards Deming's books or usurp Peter Drucker in your business library, it still comes highly recommended for all."},{"Title":"If Aristotle Ran General Motors","review":"Morris's attitude is, &quot;Gee whiz, I'm a real live philosopher!&quot;--even though he has no real philosophical perspective. His book is intellectually flabby. He does not portray philosophy accurately and trys to make it seem as though there is a unity within the whole of philosophy that supports his overly simplistic outline of what's important.He does not discuss how Aristotle or any other philosopher would do things differently at any particular company. (Thus the title, which is intriguing, does not portray the content of the book accurately). Rather, he discusses how such and such a value in his conceptualization of things is held important by philosophy in general. This is not real philosophy. Philosophy is not a unified set of feel-good beliefs and morals that can guide us in making our decisions. Rather, philosophy comprises many divergent and contradictory sets of beliefs and perspectives. People do in fact take guidance from particular philosophers and their works, but they usually adhere, more or less, to a certain philosophical school, since other schools are likely to believe totally opposite things. Either Morris doesn't get this, in which he's incompetent, or he's purposely selling a dumbed-down version of &quot;philosophy&quot; to the vulger masses.The above are bad flaws. But the killer flaw of the book is that it is dull.As a person who has a BA in philosophy and is currently working on an MBA, I highly dis-recommend this book!"},{"Title":"If Aristotle Ran General Motors","review":"This book is a delightfully readable and energetic presentation of the classic virtues and their relevance for business and institutional life. Morris does not parade his mastery of the technicalities of academic philosophy (amply demonstrated in his other writings) but does a masterful job of conveying the heart and soul of what motivated the great philosophers. This book is a great step in retrieving philosophy from its cultural obscurity and bringing it back into its natural habitat, namely, everyday life, where all of us seek meaning and purpose in our various pursuits. Morris shows how businesses and institutions can recover the great human values of truth, beauty, goodness and unity by citing not only the famous thinkers of history, but also numerous contemporary business executives who have applied these principles with positive results. This book is a great read for anyone interested in the renewal of morale and meaning in corporate life."},{"Title":"If Aristotle Ran General Motors","review":"When you ask business people what they think about ethics and morality, they usually answer that these are important things in today's business environment. When you ask them what they REALLY think about ethics and morality, most of them don't want to answer you in any detail. A few will reply that morality is \\"idealistic\\" and that one must be \\"pragmatic\\" in everyday business practice. The belief that \\"morality is a topic to be debated after the bills are paid\\" seems to be the dominant belief in business (and other) circles.This book, brilliant in every way, attempts, and succeeds, in arguing that wisdom and its concrete manifestation in ethics, should be the cornerstone of business life. The author is a philosopher, and not a business owner, but with his insight into the dynamics of the marketplace and its optimization, his ideas are clearly thinking \\"out of the box\\". One can only hope that business leaders (and others) will discover the ideas in this book or some other like it. With today's headlines in corporate fraud and other scandals (some justified and some not), business people need to start believing in the efficacy of ethics in optimizing their business ventures.The preface to the book concerns \\"reinventing corporate spirit\\", the author drawing on the thoughts of the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle to set up the foundation for his arguments in the book. He recognizes correctly that it is ideas that fundamentally move the world.Throughout the book are many interesting insights into the psychology of business practices. When speaking of happiness for example, in relation to Aristotle's notion of eudaemonia, one of these is the recognition that money is frequently not the end goal for business people, the real goal being to achieve admiration in the eyes of others. The resulting ostentatious lifestyle is primarily done to impress, this being a transient and ultimately unsatisfying motivation in the eyes of the author.The book is divided up into four parts: Truth, Beauty, Goodness, and Unity. Each of these stand for respectively, the intellectual, aesthetic, moral, and spirtual necessities for achieving true happiness.In \\"Truth\\" the discussion is interesting in that it emphasizes the importance of telling the truth not just from the standpoint of what it will do in relation to others, but what it will do for the individual involved. Telling a lie damages one's self confidence. Individuals who practice the telling of falsehoods are intimidated by truth and do not have any confidence in the efficacy of their own minds. In addition, the author discusses the importance of \\"open-book management\\": that the sharing of knowledge results in greater productivity among the employees. This is to be contrasted with the nervous attitude among some managers who feel threatened by information, again lacking self-confidence and are in a perpetual state of worry that the dissemination of knowledge among employees or co-workers will result in their comptetitive demise. These views on truth are most refreshing. \\"Lying is the most dangerously corrosive and subtly destabilizing activities to be found in human life\\" he says. He's right.Quoting the Hindu proverb \\"The true nobility is in being superior to your precious self\\", the author encourages the view of competition as being one in which individuals surpass their former abilities, instead of worrying about their status in relation to others. He's right.Even more important is that the author addresses the influence of philosophy in the development of ethical attitudes in business. Ethical relativism and nihilism have wreaked havoc in society as a whole, not just in business, and the author emphasizes the need for coming to grips with these beliefs, and replacing them with sound philosophical systems that are both rational and meshed with common sense. \\"Ideas rock the world\\" he states. He's right.Most refreshingly, the author does not shy away from addressing the issue of self-interest. Confronting the \\"What's in it for me?\\" question that is asked by some, he clearly believes that self-interest is not something to be swept under the rug in discussions on ethics and morality in business. \\"The view that ethics requires total personal disinterestedness is a dangerous distortion of the truly moral point of view\\", he states. He's right.Peer pressure and \\"going with the flow\\" are always issues that everyone has to deal with in the business environment. Not being labeled as a \\"team player\\" can be detrimental to one's growth in a particular organization. The author asks the reader to count the costs of conformity and not to \\"associate with evil men, lest you increase their number\\", quoting George Herbert. He's right.But ethics is not merely a collection of arbitrary rules to follow, the author argues. The right course of action is built into the nature of reality and meshes with human nature and human needs. Since this is the case, the practice of true ethical norms is not only productive, but pleasureful to the individual, and instead of causing boredom as some might believe, alleviates it, argues the author. He's right.Some might label, and the author does unashamedly, the framework outlined in the book as \\"spiritual\\". Goal-oriented, truth-valuing, truth-loving conduct results in a productive, life-loving spiritual individual, in complete antithesis to that of a sterile, non-creative, cynical one who views life as a burden with crosses to bear.Some of course might view this book, and one on ethics in general, as being \\"idealistic\\" or \\"naive\\". Such individuals may not wish to even pick it up, let alone read it. But individuals who practice these ideas, or ones very similar, haved moved the world, and will continue to do so."},{"Title":"If Aristotle Ran General Motors","review":"I purchased the audio version of this book to listen to during my commute, and a year after the original purchase I realized that I've played this tape more than any other.Why?Aristotle's ideas can be like knives cutting through cluttered thinking, but his presentation can be a bit long and dry. Morris does a nice job of presenting Aristotle's virtues of Truth, Goodness, Unity, and Beauty as they can be applied to business while putting a fun and popular face on them.You can find good arguments in many books for being honest in business as well as doing good and creating a sense of unity. Beauty was a surprise, but Morris argues well for it. I felt that the combination of ancient wisdom with modern examples made Morris' message meaningful and more inspirational than many other business books.I've gotten a lot of mileage out of these ideas, and wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to anyone looking to find Aristotle's virtues in the workplace."},{"Title":"If Aristotle Ran General Motors","review":"This book is not intended for the professional philosopher but for those in the business world who have an interest in business ethics. It would be quite useful as a text for kicking off an undergraduate business ethics course. Morris takes a different approach than one might expect when addressing the foundations of business ethics and excellence. Rather than focusing on rules, compliance, and the like, he places the soul of business in the context of a good life in general. He offers the idea that the foundations for sustainable excellence in business are the same as the foundations for excellence in life: truth, beauty, goodness, and unity, which correspond to four dimensions of human experience- intellectual, aesthetic, moral, and spiritual.Truth is the foundation of trust in all of life, including the life of business. Pragmatically speaking, an atmosphere of trust will actually increase efficiency in the workplace, given the amount of time and energy wasted by gossip, rumor, and speculation. An environment with respect for the truth should contain respect for people as well. Given this, the truth must be handled in a manner consistent with beauty, goodness, and unity.Beauty is important in part because it liberates, refreshes, restores, and inspires us. If we surround ourselves with beauty, and are attentive to its presence in our work, this can foster excellence. For Morris, the best businesses are those that are beautiful structures in which human beings can work, grow, and flourish.Goodness is about living well, to the fullness of our capabilities. Ethical living is not restrictive or constraining, but fosters fulfillment. In any corporate human endeavor, good people in harmonious relationships yields individual and corporate strength.Unity for Morris has to do with the spiritual dimension of life. Here he draws from existentialist thought as well as that of several religious traditions. This foundation for excellence includes living in and from the depths of ultimate reality, as well as being connected to others, the rest of nature, and to the Ground of all Being, as he puts it.The result of all of this is human fulfillment and true excellence in whatever context we find ourselves in, including the context of a company. The best business will include collaboration, in which people put their individual excellence to work in partnership with one another, carrying out a shared vision that is mutually developed.The upshot is not a set of procedures or management strategies, but what the reader should take away is a desire toask and answer the right kinds of questions about life and business:\\"How can I enhance the level of truth, the experience of beauty, the assurance of goodness, and the sense of unity felt by people who work around and with me?\\" (p. 213)"},{"Title":"If Aristotle Ran General Motors","review":"Browsing over my peer reviewers' comments, for the most part-they are good at capturing the spirit of Tom's book.

And if he offered you advice, I think that thiswould be at its core: Always think of yourself as entering withother people into partnerships for living well.

Weshould always be asking ourselves whether what we contemplatedoing will enhance or diminish this crucial function of thebusiness within our own domain of influence. Are we buildingpartnerships for living well?I saw the professor later that day and asked him about it.

The section on goodness was especially interesting because it mentions how everyday situations can be seen as ethical decisions. I particularly enjoyed the quotes that Morris uses throughout the book which provide other thinkers' ideas about ethics. Morris also does a great job of combining all of the elements at the beginning and then giving his justification."},{"Title":"If Aristotle Ran General Motors","review":"If Aristotle Ran General Motors is a wonderful book. Don't think it only applies to people who work in corporations. It is a book of wisdom that provides a comprehensive view of human life in all its dimensions. I teach a leadership course for freshman leadership scholars at the Univesity of North Carolina at Asheville. I use Morris' book because it provides a way to discuss leadership ethics that is non-utilitarian or materialistic. It is humanistic in the classic, noble sense of ethics being how people work and live together in harmony. This is the kind of perspective that leaders need to have to gain the confidence to act with integrity and success. I've looked for books on ethics to use with students, and this is by far the best. Students love his treatment of the four human dimensions. And starting the course with his text, it provides a context for discussing the varieties of leadership theories that illuminates either their shallowness or their wisdom.

Tom Morrison's lessons for humanity in business should be must reading for leaders who want something more than today's dog-eat-dog approach. Brilliant and inspiring!"},{"Title":"If Aristotle Ran General Motors","review":"Despite a provocative and promising title, Tom Morris delivers neither a new nor a true approach to the art of business leadership. While the book is occasionally clever and sometimes humorous, the vast majority of this book is mostly just a hodgepodge of relativism only somewhat related to the art of management and leadership. In short, the content of the book leads the reader miles away from what might result from the title scenario.Morris falls short perhaps because he is simply a mediocre scholar of Aristotle, perhaps because he was a professor of philosophy at a Catholic university, or perhaps because he is simply just a below-average writer. Regardless, the author comes up lacking in both the style and substance of a book premise that could be truly great in more capable hands.As to style, the book is replete with anecdotes that sometimes illustrate points quite well and sometimes are clearly inserted only because the author had them at his disposal. Likewise, the book is peppered with quotations that interrupt the flow of the narrative and only rarely have anything more than a tangential relevance to the text surrounding it. One such quote, from the author himself, neatly summarizes my view of this production: &quot;Obscurity is not a mark of profundity, however many confused writers have hoped to bully us into believing otherwise.&quot; How true, how true indeed: I wonder how many of his students felt the same way after one of his philosophy lectures.As to substance, the book is almost a complete loss. I say almost because, to be fair, Morris does come close to painting an Aristotelian view of life when he delves into the meaning of life. The author frames up his answer beautifully but then promptly undermines it in his attempts at clarification. To be more specific, Morris claims that the meaning of life is to be found in &quot;creative love&quot; (or, more accurately, in the love of creativity). While this sounds at first blush to be both logical and promising, not unlike the true motive power behind human innovation, Morris explains his surmise so ineptly that it becomes readily apparent to the reader that any proximity to the truth was merely an accident. Far from leading the reader closer to any meaningful answers, Morris abandons the audience as if in mid-thought, convincing them that his conclusions were as much the product of coincidence as of rational thought.This is just one example of the sort of philosophical inconsistency that exists throughout this book. In nearly every chapter, Morris makes sweeping, unsubstantiated statements and then proceeds as if these statements were self-evident truths. This might be passable if the author were able to consistently proceed from these sweeping statements in a logical progression. However, the reader frequently gets no more than one or two steps away from an assertion masquerading as immutable law when the author creates transparent straw man arguments to bolster his tenuous premises. Even if the reader can forgive (and accept as true) the first premise of the author's progression, the subsequent steps are so disorienting and fallacious that it is hard to move past them.Perhaps the most obvious example of this is how Morris routinely equates rational self-interest with intellectual myopia. For instance, in painting the entire philosophical landscape, he cites only three schools of thought: Nihilism, Relativism, and Absolutism. While he aptly defines the concepts of Nihilism and he readily betrays himself as a Relativist, he casts Absolutism as the province solely of religious zealots.Morris's emphatic use of the relativist's scale on which to measure thought is perhaps the fundamental flaw of his book. It is a small wonder that he finds no thematic consistency when he shows us a different yardstick for the measurement of each new topic. This changing standard sometimes becomes outright silly. For instance, on nearly a half dozen occasions, Morris attempts to weave coherent messages by juxtaposing concepts from the writings of Aristotle next to those of prominent theologians. The result of this sort of conceptual looseness is that better than half of the supposed insights delivered by the book turn out to be little more than fortune cookie proclamations-statements devoid of both context and independently verifiable meaning.All of this should be hardly surprising from someone who openly claims that any &quot;unifying principle of philosophy is a dream.&quot; The question that remains for the reader, however, is: Why choose Aristotle if you believe philosophical unification is unachievable? Why co-opt the one Philosopher who may have come closest to philosophical unity than any other? Why not be honest with your readers? Why not entitle the book: If Dale Carnegie Ran General Motors? Even Plato or Immanuel Kant or William James would have been better choices, but that discussion is for another time.Like so many academic philosophers and modern business writers, Morris selects philosophical concepts based on their emotional appeal rather than with regard to any underlying consistency. This book, like virtually every business book on the market (with a few highly worthwhile exceptions) simply promotes the art we witness in greeting cards and long-distance phone commercials on television. From it, we get nothing more than the regurgitation of unthinking, it-takes-a-village drivel that characterizes so much of todays supposed non-fiction writing. Morris' entire effort seems to be very much like a Hollywood production-aiming to tug at heartstrings with nothing more substantive as a goal. In the end, that is all this book is equipped to do: provide us with a feeling...sadly, that feeling is simple, straightforward disappointment."},{"Title":"The Heritage of American Methodism","review":"This is an incredible book by one of the foremost teachers and authors of the history of American Methodism. Dr. Kinghorn has gone above and beyond the norm by including virtually a complete second book. The text of the book is very easy to read and informative, but the bonus comes in the illustrations. The captions for the mostly color pictures constitute almost a book in themselves. On initial perusal, just looking at the hundreds of full color images with their people-centered information made me want to go back and more carefully read the text. And it was worth it! Also, when I first saw the book in the bookstore, I put it down figuring that it would cost upwards of $50 just because of the quality and the color, but fortunately I looked first and found it more than affordable too. I am not a Methodist, but as a pastor-to-be, I gained a great deal of useful information about the Methodist church, it's beginnings, and where it's gone since the first preachers landed on the American shores.

The buyers of most opening books are class players who do not have either the time or the need to go through a book jammed packed with variation analysis trees. Williams seems to understand this, and while his book does of course have variation analysis, it is not very cumbersome and is quite easy to go through. Most importantly, in each variation, Williams often explains the key ideas and moves clearly. That said, if you ARE looking for a very detailed book full of analysis trees, this is not the book for you.For the curious folk, here are the chapters of this book:1. The Ilyin-Zhenevsky System with 7...a52. The Ilyin-Zhenevsky System with 7...Qe83. The Ilyin-Zhenevsky System with 7...Ne4!4. Ilyin-Zhenevsky System: Deviations for White5.

Other LinesFollowed by an index of variationsBasically, this book is a short but informative read at 128 pages, and it should leave you prepared to begin playing the Classical Dutch with confidence."},{"Title":"Play the Classical Dutch","review":"The author begins this book with a discussion of the strategic ideas associated with the Dutch defense then shows a mix of older games and more recent games. Each strategic idea is supported by several games with annotations discussing that key strategic idea. One nice aspect of this book is that Simon Williams shows what can happen when Black goes wrong - some from his own games.The author discusses typical ideas that both sides are likely to want to execute in clear language: perhaps this is one of the benefits of the Dutch defense, it lends itself to clear strategic themes.One draw back so far is that many of the games are abbreviated. While this is ok for me, I know some people like having complete games to review. This is not to say the author doesn't include full games, but they are fewer in number than other titles offer.For folks that include the French in your opening repertoire this is an excellent book. The author shows numerous games beginning with 1...e6 to avoid anti-Dutch lines. For those that play the Nimzo Indian, you will recognize many of the themes discussed as well."},{"Title":"Play the Classical Dutch","review":"This is a great book to learn the Classical Dutch from. Unlike most books, in which the \\"ideas over variations\\" theme is marketing dross, this book actually delivers a manageable number of concrete positional and tactical benchmarks for analyzing positions. Williams writes very clearly and his discussions are focussed and purposeful.There are plenty of options to choose from, but not too much depth of lines in the analysis. You can treat this as a good or bad thing as you please - it was fine by me. So it is a \\"minimal\\" coverage of theory.But the biggest oversight was the lack of guidance over which lines to choose and how to combine them in a cohesive way. It takes a fair bit of work to work out how to handle the early move orders (although the obvious divergences are handled well). So I dropped a point for this lack of guidance. Overall the book is very well written and rewards study.And the Classical Dutch is a nice opening. It is widely applicable (against all but 1.e4, 1.g4, 1.Nc3), has a fairly routine development model, and only a few sharp lines to memorize after early deviations (eg. Staunton gambit) which aren't too bad.Update: I wanted more and I got it. There is now a terrific DVD, The Killer Dutch, available from Simon's website which follows the book closely but adds alot of value and addresses the few issues I had with the book. This is one of the most instructive DVDs I have ever watched. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Play the Classical Dutch","review":"This book is really great. I had been wondering what to play against 1.d4 for a while and was never satisfied with typical responses, however most non-typical responses are not sound or are harder to learn, etc. This book on the other hand, makes it easy to play the dutch well and explains the themes and concepts in concise and understandable ways. The Dutch is no longer a skeptical opening. By following the newly Grandmaster Simon Williams strategies and advice its easy to play the Dutch with success and at high levels. Also, even if you decide not to play the Dutch by studying it you find yourself spotting more mates and playing more aggressively which definitely improves your game. So overall this book is a great buy for chess players of all levels who want to improve their game and/or add this great opening to their black repertoire!(On a side note I have found Gambit chess books to be very easy to understand and learn the concepts and play of the openings so for newer players who want to learn fast, look to Gambit books.)"},{"Title":"Play the Classical Dutch","review":"Short but concise with good information about the Classical Dutch in it.

Than I like the Stonewall."},{"Title":"Play the Classical Dutch","review":"Let me say that the Dutch is an excellent, but risky, system that should appeal to people who like to \\"burn their pants\\" early. In the dutch, there is no such thing as as a loss that is based on one static factor. All losses are SLAUGHTERS. It doesn't matter if your on the white side or the black side. The reason I give this book 1 star is because the Classical Dutch is not the best system to play. When you play the dutch, you want the full point. The Classical dutch doesn't do that. It usually leads to quiet positions where you have good chances in the endgame. Trust me, I know what I'm talking about. That leaves to other systems. The Stonewall Dutch and The Leningrad Dutch. The Stonewall is OK. Black is extremely solid and his defense is hard to break down. But the one major problem with it is that there are gaping holes in blacks position, so white usually has the better chances. Now we have the Leningrad. This it it! This system is the most riskiest, newest, and most blood thirstiest system in the dutch. Both sides have to play on there toes , as one slip could cost the game for either side. Endgames are hardly never reached in this sytem for game usually last 30 moves. You have to be on your top at tactics. I wouldn't recommend weak players to play the dutch and especially the leningrad. However, if you are tacticaly good and accurate with your moves and love blood thirsty battles and hate endgames. Then I seriously recommend you get the book \\"The Dutch for the Attacking Player\\" by Steffen Pedersen. It provides you with a full repertoire against any thing that white can throw at you using the Leningrad system. All of whites major replies and sidelines are covered in detail with complete games and provides the logic behind the moves. But let me remind you.... The Leningrad is extremely risky. I hope this review has aided you in which system to play. Keep in mind that this is my opinian. If you like a rock-solid wall of pawns then play the Stonewall. If you like endgames and quiet play, then play the Classical dutch by all means. If you decide to play the Stonewall, please keep in mind the gaping holes you are letting white have."},{"Title":"How to collect stamps, coins, and paper money","review":"Good read and reference for those who are uninitated to the ways and means of stamp/coin collecting.

This collection of 24 items include interviews with Arab and Western journalists, handwritten letters, and video recordings.Lawrence also helps one to understand why bin Laden is a heroic figure for millions of Muslims, including many with no sympathy for terrorism. This is based not just on his success in eluding Americans and their allies, but because his personal reputation for probity, austerity, dignity, and courage - contrasting starkly with the mismanagement, lavishness, and arrogance of most Arab regimes.Bin Laden points out that his terrorism acts are only retaliation, and that the West has killed far larger numbers in the region within living memory - poison gas and strafing of Iraqi villages by Britain in the 1920s, crushing the Palestinian uprising of the 1930s, France's colonial war in algeria in the 1950s-60s, and deaths through malnutrition and disease of Iraqi children in the 1990s due to the U.N. sanctions. Bin Laden estimates 1.5 million were killed in the preceding - Lawrence estimates it as 300,000.Bin Laden began his massive undertaking against the U.S. after seeing the mujahidin victory over the Red Army in Afghanistan, and the withdrawal of American forces from Somalia in '93. Unfortunately, bin Laden greatly underestimated the special circumstances associated with both - the U.S. and Pakistani support in Afghanistan, and the inconsequentialness of the U.S. landings in Somalia.Bin Laden on 9/11 (10/21 interview): \\". . . they have done this . . . in self-defense, defense of our brothers and sons in Palestine, and in order to free our holy sanctuaries.\\" \\"the defeat of America . . . is easier for us . . . than the defeat of the Soviet Empire previously. We have already fought them . . . as in Somalia. We have not yet found a significant force of note.\\" \\". . . America, has lost its values and appeal . . . Freedom, Human Rights, and Equality . . . were revealed as a total mockery.\\"On Surviving Tora Bora: Bin Laden reports that bombing was around the clock, every second. There were about 300 mujahidin dug into 100 trenches, spread over one square mile in ten degree below zero temperatures - only about 18 were killed by the combination of ground and air attacks. Certainly this had to have been an easy opportunity for American ground forces if they had been deployed at that time, instead of outsourcing the job to Afghans!Bin Laden also speaks of how Iraqis should resist the U.S., describing a guerilla campaign like that actually waged.\\"Messages to the World\\" is essential to understanding bin Laden, America's \\"Public Enemy #1\\" - especially for counteracting the incomplete and misleading statements provided by our own government."},{"Title":"Messages to the World: The Statements of Osama Bin Laden","review":"From the very first speech in this collection, I began to realize how little I knew about bin Laden's ideas--and yes, he has ideas--and how most of what I thought I knew was wrong. I had heard, repeatedly, that he was a relative latecomer to the Palestinian cause, that he had essentially declared solidarity with them merely to gain popularity in the larger Islamic world. That is not borne out by this book. In his very first speech, dated to 1994, bin Laden is already sounding the notes that reverberate throughout this collection: the entire Muslim world is under seige, from Afghanistan, to Palestine, to Iraq, to Chechnya and Bosnia; the humiliation (and emasculation) of Islam by the western world is the implicit goal. Now, clearly, one can quarrel with his analysis, but such a message has broad appeal. The editor and translator are to be commended for striking just the right balance here; they provide imformation, really crucial information, without taking immediate sides and without claiming a false neutrality either. As the editor has emphasized in his interviews about this book, to defeat bin Laden's ideas, \\"one must decode them, first.\\" This book is an essential part of that decoding process. Perhaps the most salient interview is one granted by bin Laden to a Spanish Muslim. That man, who gives what is by far the most confrontational interview, questioning bin Laden's orthodoxy, among other things, was subsequently jailed for his trouble. That is perhaps the most fitting parable for this book: the very attempt to engage in a dialogue with this man and his ideas will be suspect to some. But it is the critical task before us, and the editor and translator are to be commended for enabling this dialogue, and for having done so with the moral seriousness it demands."},{"Title":"Messages to the World: The Statements of Osama Bin Laden","review":"Osama Bin Laden's statements have been widely covered in TV and radio in bits and pieces; but they haven't been gathered together under one cover before; so to receive a unified presentation of all his admonitions, turn to Messages To The World: The Statements Of Osama Bin Laden.

Messages to the World is a collection of those speeches, selected by a professor from Duke. The themes are mostly global politics and religion, and the tone is simultanously detached and hectoring. If you are an American, it's a bit odd to read, but it never fails to be enlightening. As I was reading Messages, I realized how little I actually know about Bin Ladin's goals, motivation, and political views. Reading this book is a basic, important way to position yourself in the world, to see where you stand in relation to Bin Ladin's ideas. It's necessary reading."},{"Title":"Messages to the World: The Statements of Osama Bin Laden","review":"This collection of translated and annotated statements by Osama bin Laden is the sort of primary source collection I had begun to fear would never be published.In order to understand the \\"War on Terror\\" environment in which we currently live, it is imperative to understand the rhetoric of both sides. Regardless of which viewpoint one supports, it is important to know exactly what the other side is fighting for. This knowledge is abundant on the non-terrorist side, but has so far been available on the terrorist side purely through analyses by expert commentators. Thus, being able to read the actual words of the major ideologue of world terrorism at the moment is a considerable boon.I say \\"ideologue\\" for very good reason. As these statements and their accompanying (and copious) notes and introductions demonstrate, there is a distinct ideology involved in this movement. It may be an ideology directed against everything the West holds dear, but it is an ideology nonetheless. Osama bin Laden has clearly thought about a great many issues prior to initiating the campaigns of violence he has.As case in point, the significance of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is often debated by academics and policymakers: Is it central to the globalisation of terrorism, or is it merely a convenient justification to use when asked? As even the earliest statements here demonstrate, this is a key plank in al-Qa'ida's ideology - perhaps even more so than many writers have realised.While one particular statement (the \\"Declaration of Jihad against the Jews and Crusaders\\") will be familiar to any reader interested in this conflict as it has been included in a great many works (Gunaratna's \\"Inside Al-Qaeda\\" being the most well-known), many of these statements appear never to have been translated fully into English before. In this case, the team involved in this collection deserve even more praise for enabling those with an interest in understanding these issues to do so - particularly when, as they frequently note, the websites originally hosting these messages have been shut down.The scope of these statements will probably be debated for many years to come. One review here makes the dogmatic assertion that these are not all of the statements made by bin Laden, for example. While this may be true - and bear in mind that many of these statements have been excerpted by various news outlets at various times, which may create the impression of there being more than there are - it seems rather immaterial. Far from only presenting a reasoned side of the man, these statements present his ideas in a clear form. Those translated from audio and video tapes, for example, never make mention of any gestures or tones of voice, since to do so would be rather pointless in my opinion.Taken as a whole, these statements tend to appear rather repetitive - the only notable change from one to the next being a slightly different emphasis on particular events as they've changed. That said, reading the book cover to cover is probably not the best way to go about it anyway.The copious amounts of footnotes and introductory matter are also a great strength of this collection. While it is possible to criticise the scholars involved (and it's almost a hobby for some of the reviewers here already), they have at least attempted the difficult task of placing Osama bin Laden in context. He's not a representative of all Muslims, but neither is he the \\"monster under the bed\\" for the new millennium.The footnotes, too, provide a wealth of Qur'anic and Hadith references - including remarks on when the verse or tradition has been taken out of context or deprived of a section of text. Similarly, key figures and events (both past and present) referenced in the text are explained concisely in the notes.Unfortunately, the sheer volume of these notes has presumably caused the poor proofreading which some statements suffer from. There are a number of words and phrases footnoted which do not have an accompanying note below, and some of these are germane to the text.Further, one of the introductory notes makes the comment that Yemen is a \\"military dictatorship\\" (along with Pakistan and Nigeria). In reality, Yemen is a multi-party democracy (the only such in the Arabian Peninsula) and was so both at the time the book was written and at the time the statement was made. Admittedly, the country may not have a stable and entrenched tradition of democracy, but it is far from the military dictatorship described in this note.In conclusion, \\"Messages to the World\\" is an invaluable aid to those who want to understand the current conflicts \\"from the source\\" as it were. It is somewhat heavy reading in places and will remain a controversial book for much of the foreseeable future. Its publication, however, represents a great step forward for much of the world."},{"Title":"Messages to the World: The Statements of Osama Bin Laden","review":"Rather along the lines of \\"only Nixon could go to China\\", it takes as unimpeachable an authority as Lawrence, Professor of Religion at Duke University and author of several acclaimed works on Islam, to collect, edit, and comment on the published statements of Bin Laden, translated from the Arabic by James Howarth. \\"Know thine enemy\\" is the adequate justification for an inevitably controversial publication- it has already attracted more media attention than other books in the counter-terrorism franchise.

Any who want insights on Bin Laden's thoughts and viewpoint must have MESSAGES TO THE WORLD.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"},{"Title":"Messages to the World: The Statements of Osama Bin Laden","review":"This collection of translated and annotated statements represents a unique historical record of a defining and divisive figure. Although bin Laden appears to have been retired for some time, this shy do-gooder enjoyed a certain Robin Hood status in the Islamic world, as if he had tried to reform their world solely by force of alms. Given the possible consequences, it is worth understanding why. I happened, due to a backlog, to buy it some time before bin Laden's death and read it after, so it has gone from an exercise in \\"know thine enemy\\" to a historical record while on my shelves, but perhaps that lends some perspective.His historical importance can certainly be exaggerated, but bin Laden assumed stature in our own age primarily as a polemicist. (Notoriety for other reasons, of course.) Absurdly, we in the West were not permitted access to his statements through the popular media on the pretext that this man whose satellite phone they were bugging could be sending coded messages in his epistles. Read them now and you will immediately understand why they were deemed too dangerous to guarantee the correct reception, and in one missive he openly ridicules this attempt at justification. Did I mention that he was a polemicist? Worse, though, they were circulating covertly on tapes in the Islamic world all the time, so the attempt at censorship played right into bin Laden's hands.Bin Laden's reputation among radical Muslims stems from his perceived piety, honesty and preparedness to sacrifice himself. It is easy to dismiss him as a mirror-image of the US Republicans, but this reputation for personal integrity gives it the lie. However, his statements are not entirely consistent. He assumes direct responsibility for 9-11 only rather late on, being somewhat evasive at first. Here and there he quotes Qur'anic text in his support but leaves off conditional clauses at the end of the original, but it is never clear that this is actively misleading. At any rate, his piety and self-abnegation are clearly sincere and his will be a hard image to tarnish among more militant Muslims. He is no Wahhabi exegete, however, and he concedes authority and the leadership of the faithful to others.Ultimately, bin Laden's utterances have had such power because they are 95% self-evident truth or articles of shared Muslim faith. For every attack of his own, killing ten people, he can point to a prior one on Muslims killing 10,000, and it's quite a striking record when you see them all collected in these statements. As Chomsky has said, you need quite a special education to be able to not see it. His simple view of Islamic justice is that reciprocity applies - when they attack us, we attack them. And in at least one case the reciprocity was so clear that it toppled the Spanish government. Bin Laden knew that this war would see his death, and accepted it, but his missives carry a sense of inevitable victory: I will not see it, but we are winning. He will be a memory hard to discredit, even if most Muslims rejected his choice of methods. As we have seen in recent months, his disgust at the ruler-ship of the Muslim world is widely endorsed. One hopes that his Semite's anti-Semitism is not, and this is an ugly aspect of his words that is hard to dismiss as applying only to the polity of Israel.Attempts to suppress bin Laden's words have led to repressive measures. A Spanish journalist, Tayseer Allouni, was jailed without trial and confined to solitary merely for having interviewed him. Ultimately, however, in his calls for reform of the Muslim world's leadership, he has already won. Of the four regimes against whom he rails - Libya, Iraq, Egypt and Saud - only one remains standing today: The House of Saud. We actually gave him Iraq! Meanwhile, we are being routed in Iraq and Afghanistan This book is no longer just a means of understanding our enemy, therefore - it yields clues to a new political reality wrought partly by Osama's words."},{"Title":"Messages to the World: The Statements of Osama Bin Laden","review":"However readers might dispute the validity of the claims made in Messages to the World: The Statements of Osama bin-Laden, they will no longer be able to claim ignorance regarding the intentions of the Saudi-born Islamic radical. Presented together in their entirety for the first time, the twenty-four essays and transcripts comprise the body of public messages bin-Laden released during the ten year period from 1994 to 2004, a decade during which relations between the West and the Muslim world underwent dramatic changes. Since that time, the battle for hearts and minds has been waged by governments and Islamic reformists alike through discourse that legitimizes or condemns terroristic acts. Bin-Laden's thoughts in Messages clearly aim at the former but also more radically attempt to redefine \\"terrorism\\" as a justified political tool and an appropriate response to American imperialism. Challenging the basic tenets of democracy, capitalism, and even Islam as understood by many Muslims, the collected statements both clarify bin-Laden's political goals and complicate Western responses to his unique methods for realizing them. The source of this polemic tension is bin-Laden's reliance on a relatively well-accepted narrative to justify Islamic retributive attacks on Western targets--his knowledge of history and current political events should give even the most nationalist Westerners pause. However troubling the methods might be he endorse, Messages finally provides a brutally honest answer to the somewhat disingenuous question widely asked in the contemporary West: \`Why do the terrorists hate us?'The book's value is immense given that Western suppression of bin-Laden's thought provides valuable ammunition for an argument he repeats throughout the collection: that the West is grossly hypocritical by overtly professing democratic values while covertly and simultaneously pursuing authoritarian, hegemonic foreign and domestic policies--like censoring free access to information. In an October 21, 2001, interview with reporter Taysir Alluni of al-Jazeera, bin-Laden claims that freedom, human rights, and equality all conceptually collapsed along with the Twin Towers on 9/11: \\"These values were revealed as a total mockery, as was made clear when the US government interfered and banned the media outlets from airing our words because they felt that the truth started to appear to the American people.\\" (112) Bin-Laden's statements were indeed deliberately censored by US authorities who claimed to fear that \\"encoded messages\\" in his taped interviews would be communicated to terrorist cells and trigger more attacks on Americans. Bin-Laden dismisses these \\"laughable claims\\" while he warns against underestimating the technical savvies of today's Islamic radicals: \\"It is as if we are living in a time of carrier -pigeons, without the existence of telephones, without travelers, without the Internet, without regular mail, without faxes, without email. This is just farcical; words which belittle people's intellect.\\" (126)Bin-Laden is outraged at what he sees to be Western arrogance and casuistry that informs a double-standard of justice for Westerners and Muslims. In an interview from 1998, he is incredulous, \\"that the Crusader should attack and enter my land and holy sanctuaries, and plunder Muslim's' oil, and then when he encounters any resistance from Muslims, to label them terrorists.\\" (73) Again and again he issues powerful indictments of the \\"Zionist-backed\\" US, a \\"nation without principles or morals,\\" which nonetheless demands from others what it is unwilling to do. (170)The real danger in withholding information from one's citizens is that it can lead to wild speculation regarding the motives of an opponent. In turn, and in the absence of complete information, people are left to develop (with the encouragement of government) negative stereotypes of an imagined \\"Other\\" who's life and goals seem incomprehensible. Following this dehumanization process, opponents can be framed in increasingly negative ways that then legitimize violent political responses--responses that oftentimes prove wholly inappropriate. Failing to interrogate and thus misunderstanding bin-Laden's motives has proved disastrous for US foreign policy since the mid 1990s. Messages makes clear the very different philosophical stakes for both sides and Bin-Laden goes so far as to call his ideological differences with Western \\"infidels\\" a \\"doctrinal\\" one (134). He accuses President George W. Bush of waging war, \\"all in the name of oil and more business for his private companies\\" (234). According to bin-Laden, \\"victory is not material gain; it is about sticking to your principles\\" (154). Thus, he describes the nineteen September 11 \\"post-secondary students\\" come hijackers as the \\"living conscience\\" of the umma, who were motivated by a desire to take \\"revenge against the evildoers and transgressors and criminals and terrorists\\" (120).Bin-Laden's critique of neoconservative politics and capitalist economics is so nuanced that one is initially receptive to his broadly painted social landscape despite the picture's omissions. In the entire collection, he makes a scant reference to providing financial support for the widows of martyrs (101) and encourages pious Muslims to emigrate from corrupt Islamic states to escape \\"psychological pressure\\" (274). This is roughly the extent of his social strategy. Instead, his rhetoric breaks off, rather than down when talk turns to implementing his brand of \\"Qutbist\\" Islam. He claims to need no alternative vision for the umma's politics--in fact, that's forbidden. Save organization under shari'a law, bin-Laden articulates little with regard to what the Arabian peninsula might actually look like after corrupt and \\"unaccountable\\" Arab leaders are deposed and the Prophet's law reinstated (227). Bin Laden never indicates, however, that he agrees with Muslim women who feel discriminated against by shari'a law as widely interpreted by the four major jurisprudential Islamic schools of thought. Many feminist scholars, for example, have explored the egalitarian potential of Islam, but currently lack the political and social capital that conservative legal traditions possess.His disgust with injustice is genuine, although it curiously stops short of condemning all systems of oppression in its blindness to the workings of patriarchy. Feminists (both secular and Islamic) might wonder how an eye so keenly trained to spot the transgressions of \\"Western apostates\\" can miss the injustice endured by his own wives and daughters under shari'a law? Bin-Laden's tunnel-vision-like focus on martyrdom and \\"the real life of killing, striking, fighting and injuring\\" (204) impoverishes his theory of justice and overall conception of a healthy, functioning community. Thus, his proclamation of the umma as, \\"the Nation that desires death more than you desire life,\\" (172) is more self-defeating than threatening. (Such a race to the bottom is a historic strategy guerilla combatants worldwide have grappled with when facing a more powerful oppressor. The scope but not the substance of martyrdom is at issue with radical Islam.) The work of international and post-colonial feminists who have explored these powerful links between masculinity and militarism would be valuable here for its perspicacity and skill in mapping violence's gendering path through sites of conflict. For example, some feminists are quick to point out that dismissing the exigencies of a patriarchal culture can lead to dangerous assumptions that victimize men as well. In his discussion of the best ages from which to recruit jihadists, bin-Laden describes 15 to 25 year old intellectually immature males as those most able to give service to the umma as mujahedeen, purportedly because of their limited family commitments (91). Not only are these boys disproportionately recruited into warfare because of their gender and impressionable age, but many never return to communities throughout the Islamic world that are worse for their absence.Had Americans any doubt of bin-Laden's willingness to keep his sights on Western targets for the foreseeable future, Messages should dispel that notion. In fact, average US citizens might benefit from conversations on the legitimate use of political violence, theories of representative government, and a crash course on how the global financial market works--and for whom. For it is these average citizens that bin-Laden is talking to. The American people who vote and fund their government's activities with tax money (140)--and particularly those who chose to work in a building symbolic of American economic imperialism--are just as likely targets as uniformed men. This charge of culpability is indeed fearsome--but perhaps not in the way he intended. Bin-Laden's intolerant, narrow solution to injustice refuses to know the burden of a do-it-yourself model of justice that must be tweaked and monitored vigilantly--a model that depends on Westerners' ability to steer, however clumsily, their constructed government. Messages might be the best reminder lately of the responsibilities of citizenship--of each citizen--to keenly observe the political systems they claim to have birthed. That is perhaps the only real check on radical violence of any sort."},{"Title":"Messages to the World: The Statements of Osama Bin Laden","review":"This book was a book of 3 choices in my government class.

The war could come to an end if we could hear what he is saying, if we could understand what he is saying, if we adjudicated what he is saying, and then do something about our acquired thinking. That process begins with the reading of this essential book, which is, actually, a step towards peace."},{"Title":"Messages to the World: The Statements of Osama Bin Laden","review":"As someone who has been critical of US foreign policy through a variety of administrations, it may seem inevitable that I would be drawn to someone like bin Laden. Having read my share of writings by sociopaths such as Hitler, Mao, and even Kaczynski, my only compliment for bin Laden would be that his thoughts aren't nearly as fractured and self-contradictory as others I've read. In a sense, I agree with the commentary provided in the foreword -- whatever his faults, he is very likely a true believer and not merely a charlatan.On to the book. It enlightens on several fronts. It provides small glimpses into the world of Islamic expression -- I was never aware of the existence of Arabic literary forms such as the juridicial decree. It made me wonder how an American analog to bin Laden might communicate with the masses -- the newsletter, the Shakespearean sonnet, the folk song in 4/4 time, iambic pentameter, maybe even a film documentary. Could one man besides Bob Dylan be able to flow between media and literary forms with the ease of bin Laden?Also interesting were some of the Arabic social trivia such as the uses of bin/ibn and Abu in Arabic names.The sign of a good book (as with good research) is that it generates more questions than answers. For instance, why did bin Laden wait until 10/2004 to fully (or at least convincingly) accept responsibility for 9/11? Obfuscation? Maybe. The book itself does not hazard any speculation. My take is that he's reluctant to accept credit for something in which he did not personally participate. Once it was obvious he was going to get the rap anyway, he probably decided it was best politically to accept the credit. After all, he has to compete for resources with other jihadis, and \\"Mastermind of 9/11\\" is the jahidi equivalent to membership in the CFR or Trilateral Commission. We've seen recent (if less credible) examples of self-incrimination in the Moussaoui case.That being said, I wish bin Laden much ill. If anything, he has given America an excuse to shed any vestige of self-reflection about its' past. What we've done to the Muslim world is a drop in the bucket of blood compared to what the Cherokee nation or African-Americans have suffered. If he has come to collect damages, the line forms in the WAY BACK."},{"Title":"Messages to the World: The Statements of Osama Bin Laden","review":"This item never arrived.

Osama bin Laden wages jihad against the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Israel, and those wishing to comprehend Bin Laden's actions should read this book. It is accompanied by excellent explanatory footnotes, offering concise factual context for Bin Laden's statements. While Bin Laden's thought rates only \\"one star\\" - he operates on the primitive logic of tit-for-tat violent retaliation - the book as a source for understanding his thought rates at least four stars. It is a good read for those wishing to understand his motivation for violent jihad."},{"Title":"Messages to the World: The Statements of Osama Bin Laden","review":"This book pretends to open our eyes to the logic of Bin Laden's message by showing us his writings and speeches in their entirety rather than the 'sound bites' we hear in the western media. Supposedly the sound bites give us only a negative stereotype of Bin Laden who is actually a quite intelligent, just, freedom loving, women's rights crusader only 'opposing American policies'. Thus the killing of 3,500 American civilians, the destruction of the Bamiyan Biddha statues in Afghanistan, the slaughter of Shiites in Iraq, all of it is merely about 'opposing' the totalitarian imperialism of America.Despite the leftists encouragement that Bin Laden is a liberal and that he is merely Chomsky in a long robe and beard with an AK-47 the writings in fact prove the opposite and is perhaps the very reason to read this book. The editors of this book tried to show us the 'good' Bin Laden, not the raving hateful lunatic fundamentalist. However some snippets of the true Bin Laden seep through. In one of his letters he explains why he hates the west. Among the reasons is that the west is 'controlled by the Jews and the Zionists\\". Yes, this is part of merely 'opposing U.S policies'. By this logic the American Nazi party, Hitler and Mussolini were also merely 'opposing U.S policies'. Stalin also merely 'opposed' U.S policies, in order to kill 20 million of his own people and take over half of Europe and Asia. Perhaps these writings are a wonderful insight into the true righteousness of the cause of America in fighting terror, the tapes show the true hatred, intolerance, and neo-Nazism that informs Bin Laden's thoughts. Everyone should read this, this is what the war on terror is all about and these are the ideas of the planner of the murder of 3,500 American civilians. Just remmember that this book isnt a compilation of ALL of Bin Ladens thoughts it is in fact completely edited to show his most calm and controlled outburts, rather than the speeches where he speakes glowingly of murdering civilians and slaugther \\"Jews and Crusaders\\". This book is also useful evidence of the continuing alliance of western leftists and Islamic terrorists.Seth J. Frantzman"},{"Title":"Messages to the World: The Statements of Osama Bin Laden","review":"\\"Messages to the World\\" contains interviews with the terrorist leader Osama bin Laden, and various statements attributed to him. I'm not sure whether it's really permissible to publish a book like this one, but I guess you could see it as \\"know thy enemy\\". Unfortunately, the book is edited and introduced by a confused scholar, one Bruce Lawrence, who seems to be sympathetic to Osama bin Laden and his agenda. If you buy the book, brace yourself for a rough ride!Still, the messages of the al-Qaeda leader are quite revealing. For instance, he very explicitly, almost brazenly, supports the killing of innocent women and children. He considers Spain and Portugal to be occupied parts of the Muslim world, so presumably his demand that the \\"Jews and Crusaders\\" leave the Muslim lands also apply to these nations. Indeed, he also regards East Timor (which is Catholic) and southern Sudan (which is Christian or \\"animist\\") to be parts of the Muslim world! This is in keeping with the idea that all areas once conquered by Muslims are legitimately Muslim forever after. He also demands that the United States converts to Islam (yes, really), showing that al-Qaeda doesn't simply want all non-Muslim foreigners to leave \\"the territory of the umma\\". They want to have it all. We do get the message, Osama.Another interesting fact emerges when reading the editors' lavish footnotes. It turns out that Bin Laden often quotes various Quranic verses out of context. Often, he only quotes the seemingly violent or intransigent part of a verse, leaving out the rest, which may be more moderate. As for Palestine, while it's true that Bin Laden always condemned Israel, he originally emphasized other issues as well, most notably the claim that Saudi Arabia is occupied by the US Crusaders. After 9/11, his attacks on Saudi Arabia mysteriously vanished, leaving only Palestine, no doubt because both Muslim and Western public opinion would consider the Saudi angle as somewhat esoteric. A few years later, during the war in Iraq, Bin Laden returned to the Saudi issue, now more militantly than ever before.Another striking thing with these messages is that they are completely devoid of any left-wing leanings. Bin Laden boasts about his role in fighting the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, and in one of his later statements, he actually admits that the United States aided the mujahedeen. He further supports the successful effort of North Yemen to topple the socialist government of South Yemen. Initially, he seems to have hoped that sectors of the Saudi and Pakistani establishments could be turned around to supporting him, and expel the Americans. During the Cold War, most anti-American movements claimed to be \\"left-wing\\" in some kind of way. Indeed, many *were* left-wing. Here, we seem to have a pure example of \\"anti-imperialism\\" from the *right*. This is presumably how Saudi Arabia would have sounded like, had they suddenly broken relations with the US.In the Muslim world, Bin Laden and al-Qaeda are often accused of being sectarians whose main emphasis is fighting other Muslims (often violently). This accusation seems to be correct. Al-Qaeda and groups associated with it have undoubtedly killed more Muslims than Americans or Jews! The opponents of the Taliban and al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, the Northern Alliance, were Muslims. The Shia in Iraq, mercilessly slaughtered by the Sunni extremists, are Muslims. So are the Kurds. Indeed, so is Saudi Arabia. And yet, the hypocritical Bin Laden claims to speak in the name of one billion Muslims?! Clearly, converting to Islam (something Bin Laden demands of the US) isn't a guarantee against being blown sky high by this man and his companions.The simple truth is that Bin Laden will continue fighting who ever happen to reject his sectarian authority, no matter whether that person is Muslim, Christian, Jew or polytheist. Which bring me to the last thing that struck me when reading \\"Messages to the World\\". Despite all his eloquent denunciations of Western atrocities against Muslims, Osama Bin Laden never says what his alternative is. He speaks in vague terms about a new Muslim caliphate. But what kind of economy should the caliphate have? Capitalism? Socialism? Bazaar economy, perhaps? What kind of concrete social and economic policy should be pursued? Should it be a democracy, a de facto monarchy, or what? Except for the usual demand to abolish \\"usury\\", and a forthright statement that a caliphate in Arabia would hike the oil prices, Bin Laden says nothing. And yet, he has been issuing his messages for almost 15 years! My guess is that this person is at bottom a nihilist.When all is said and done, Osama bin Laden really has very little to say."},{"Title":"Messages to the World: The Statements of Osama Bin Laden","review":"This book was interesting, but a lot of it went over my head.

I can't wait to read that."},{"Title":"Messages to the World: The Statements of Osama Bin Laden","review":"Is it morally right and tactically wise to publish such a book? It is possible to say that bin Laden does not need a forum, and that his messages are eagerly transmitted by his followers to one another through all modern technical means, including the 'Internet'. And that therefore the presentation of his speeches in chronological order will not give much of a lift or incentive to already committed terrorists. It is possible to argue that those who will read such a book are by and large precisely those who deplore bin Laden, and who simply wish to better understand how this particular evildoer has deepened in his hatred of the West, and determination to kill innocents, through time. Thus it might be argued that the texts provided simply do a public service in informing us all of the exact nature of one mass- murdererer.He is to himself the defender of Islam, which he sees attacked by the West, and he has come to the conclusion gradually that the murder of as many Jews and Christians as it takes is justified if this will lead to the Islamic domination of Mankind.But then again Mr. Bin Laden is not simply a theorist. He is the man responsible for the murder of thousands of people, including those on 9/11. Giving him another kind of forum somehow does not seem morally wise or right. And this especially as there are hundreds of thousands, no millions of young Muslims , ( and non- Muslims) walking around out there, who might take this book as 'marching orders'.It seems to me the most important point of all is missed by the Editor of this work. Bin Laden may be the name that evokes the most horror. But in fact there are more important leaders in the War Against the West, and the War of Terror to topple Human Civilization than Bin - Laden.He is symbolically the major leader of Global Islamic Strategy but its most important one now is the President of Iran. The President of Iran is calling for the destruction of the United States, and the Islamic Rule of the world in terms Bin Laden certainly agrees with. Bin Laden is not as Noah Feldman presents him in his otherwise excellent NY Times review of this book , a 'deviation' from the main stream of Islam today. As we see with the growing power of fundamentalist Islam throughout the world , Bin Laden speaks to the heart of a good share, perhaps a majority of the leaders and people of the Islamic world.As I understand it the Western world, the free world, the world led by the United States is now in a struggle for its life against a kind of totalitarian force whose aim is to destroy it. Bin Laden will not be the one to lead the legions in doing this. But his written works, his speeches, his communications, his network of Terror, his inspiration to widening circles within the Islamic world , are an important element in this war.Again I am not so sure it was wise to give him this additional forum."},{"Title":"Interpretation (Professional Interpreting in the Real World)","review":"I find the reviews above rather one-sided, so have decided to post this brief review.There are some very useful chapters in this book, for example the introduction and the chapter on restructuring syntax.

Mandy arrives home from camp, and her father gives her a horse for her thirteenth birthday. She calls her friend, Laura, and asks her to come over. Laura seems cool and distant when they talk. A new boy is helping around the stables and both Mandy and Laura like him causing more distance to come between them. Laura and Mandy have a fight and Laura runs off. Later Mandy finds that Solana, her horse, got free and is now sick from eating too much rich food. Later Mandy sees Laura and they exchange words. Then Laura rides off in the night and doesn't come back. She is missing and search parties are sent out. A day passes and they still can't fin her. Mandy rides off on Solana her horse, who is now better, and finds Laura in one of their many spots they went too. She knows Laura needs medical help right away so she ties hers and Laura's scarves to her horse and sends it home, hoping it will be able to find its way.

I had a job at a summer camp in what is now the Lincoln City areaon the Coast of Oregon near Devil's Lake. I had a 1/2 day off each week and since we couldn't go far we almost always ended up, after a couple hours of water-skiing or go-karting, at this really popular seafood restaurant. There was a gift shop there that carried this, the first compilation of Twilight Zone stories ever published. The show itself was just reaching the end of its amazing and improbable run of 6 years on television and I bought the book to read while I was standing in line at the restaurant. I was fascinated, could not put it down. The stories resonated on so many levels I was probably not yet experienced enough to understand the depth. I just new that I loved reading them.The 19 stories in the book are all original stories by the man himself, Rod Serling, and they had all been made into episodes of the show. All the stories in the book were picked by Rod himself and they are just as much fun to read as they were to watch on the telly.I bought this copy because I had long ago lost mine somehow and I wanted another for purely nostalgic reasons (it was a REALLY GREAT! summer). The copy I got was a 1986 printing with a new cover photo of Rod and a new intro by T.E.D. Klein and was in really great shape with just enough yellowing on the paper edges to make it seem older and, to me, closer in age to my original copy (which, by the way, is extremely expensive if you can even find one).Very happy with this purchase."},{"Title":"Stories from the twilight zone","review":"It lies somewhere btween the day and the darkness, between sleeping and waking, reality and illusion.

I also know that it infuriated me; it was insulting-presuming that I had nothing of value to offer because I was a child.Oh, but it's even worse than that. Now in my 50's, I decided to Google this sentence and found that it is from the writings of a Medieval English priest John Mirk (flourished 1390-c. 1414) who wrote advice to parish priests. And in the original, it was not \\"child\\" but \\"maiden\\"-sexism at its root origin! So the time-line of when I could be heard from again was never, for, in Mirk's world, once a maid married then her tongue could only agree with her husband-never to have a voice of her own.I sing the praises of Google.

Crumb.Yes there's a certain level of wackyness that could be appreciated but I, frankly, have never fully enjoyed cause everyone was well, hetero and WHITE yo. Hey I have nothing against the caucasians of this country (my best friend is white), but it's quite different to read a supposed \\"alternative\\" comic and realize it's all the same frou-frou with added crass, sex, and naked boobies.

It even starts with a verse from the 1st chapter in the Qur'an.Well drawn, in the tradition of \\"dykes to watch out for\\", Jennifer Camper's \\"Ramadan\\" Comix is part of the anthology debut of Juicy Mother. It caught my attention \`cuz it explores a Lebanese Lesbian (I never tire of hearing those words together) day's journey of fasting during Ramadan. It has everything: Flash back to childhood memories, culture-conformity in the work place, Nicely introduced Islamic concepts like \\" Suhoor\\" & \\"Shari'a\\" (if you want to know what they are: buy the book), coming out to religious parents, and even some post 911 reflections. A few concise and delightfully illustrated panels takes you through what is usually a life time worth of wisdom in drawing parallels between Anti-Arab hysteria and home-grown homophobia. JC even manages to bring up the subject of hijab and veiling without degrading the point in discussing clothes and oppression \`a la usual western way.

You'll certainly find all of that in more in this compilation trade paperback from Soft Skull Press. The 150 page book features an eclectic array of comic strips that run the gamut from very rough, to professionally polished (although they may be reluctant to admit to it). What's evident in reading the book is the passion that the artists and writers have for the subject matter.\\"Doll Face\\" by Stephen Winter and Robert Kirby is a bittersweet tale of love, found and then lost, by a gay black man who describes himself as \\"old\\". We see his excursion through the gay community and feel his pain but rejoice in his eventually maturation process.\\"Italian Cousin\\" is a rather twisted tale by Serena Pillai. Chris' 15 year old cousin from Italy comes to stay with he and his wife, and spends the entire time trying to seduce the middle-aged Chris. \\"Teddy Bear's Wedding\\" is a delightfully screwball tale of gay marriage long before states were allowing it and before the heated debate. Two, middle-aged, overweight men plan a wedding in the park and use just about every homosexual clich&eacute; in this wacky, and wonderfully illustrated story by Robert Tripton.\\"Look! Look!\\" is a different take on old grammar school reading primers as it tells the story of two lesbians as Delta just gets out of jail and goes out on the town with Peanut. A trip to a bar turns into a brawl as the pair teach a couple of overzealous men a lesson they will never forget with lines like \\"See Delta Kick Ass!\\" and \\"Hear Peanut Crunch Heads.\\" This story features the best art in the entire book, shot directly from G.B. Jones' pencils with words by Jennifer Camper.Other talents in the book include Ariel Schrag, Leanne Franson, and a wonderful cartoon jam by Camper, Howard Cruse, Diane DiMassa, Rupert Kinnard, Alison Bechdel, and Ivan Velez, Jr. This book shows off the true essence of underground/alternative comix."},{"Title":"Juicy Mother: Celebration","review":"I can't stop rereading Juicy Mother. Every piece in this underground queer comix anthology has its merits, but Ramadan by Jennifer Camper is an exquisitely funny/serious departure from her usual rowdy debauchery.

It IS arranged into chapters, but they don't seem coherent. It is a great big album of STUFF, and it is left up to the poor reader to try to figure what the point of each item is, and what goes with what.It does include a lot of pictures, but they have several problems, too.- Most of the pictures include multiple items, both knives and props. It is ALWAYS a mistake to prop knife photos, unless the prop is directly associated with THAT PARTICULAR knife. That is almost never the case here. The result is that the random props set up false historical associations. And not only are the props irrelevant to the knives, the knives in group photos are often irrelevant to each other.- The pictures are only of knives Mr. Flayderman owns or owned. While he does live at the center of the universe, there are 'several' knives that never made it into his orbit. So, as big as this book is, there are probably more types of bowies left out than included. And there is a fair number of non bowies included, merely because he happened to own them. Also many of the knives shown are nowhere near the best surviving examples of their types, in condition.So... I figure it would take a really experienced person the best part of a year to sort it out. And the only efficient way to do it would be to buy TWO copies, cut off their bindings, cut up the pages into individual items, then \\"edit\\" it all into a coherent whole -- using a folio sized album, and leaving gaps for what is not there (which you could then fill in from other books, especially auction catalogs). Flayderman should have done this editing himself, or at least hired it done. [This is exactly what I did when upgrading the somewhat album-like Levine's Guide I into the highly organized LG-II.]A beginner tackling this book would be even more confused than a new driver from rural Idaho renting a car at Logan Airport and trying to drive around rush hour Boston (Boston does not believe in street signs, and Mr Flayderman does not believe in breaking his text into sections with headers). Plus the beginner would not find any help separating fact from fable. Flayderman includes it all.Plus his writing style reminds me of this Wikipedia quote about George Sala: His literary style, highly coloured, bombastic, egotistic, and full of turgid periphrases...BRL...

It's large and heavy, which makes for a lovely coffee table book, but makes actually reading it a little awkward (at least for me). I have yet to work my way through perhaps 25% of the actual written content, but have flipped though all of the photos. I must admit, as a custom knife maker, the photos are the main reason I bought this book. The history is also important to me to a lesser degree; and I plan to work my way through that as well, but the book really excels in being a visual guide to the historical bowie knife.My only real criticism so far, and it's a small one, is that the actual layout of the pages seem somehow dated; that is, the colors, fonts, and internal design has somewhat of a 70s feel to it or something. If this seems like nitpicking to you- it is. I bought this book as more of an art piece, so this is something I noticed. Perhaps you won't even know what I'm talking about (I used to be a graphic designer in another life).All in all, this book is a must for knife enthusiast, collectors of antique arms, and American history buffs.

Usually, a \\"coffee table\\" book doesn't contain this much text.I would recommend that anyone interested in Bowies buy this book.

It tells the basics of scraping; how to manipulate the scraper, sharpen it, hold it and so on. It tells about the tools you need and how to use them. It even tells what type of disposition a man has to have to be a successful scraper.(In case you don't know what 'scraping' is, well, that is just what it is, scraping. You use a bladed tool with a long handle and push it to remove little shavings. It is slow, but precise. With this method you can build, or rebuild, machine tool bearing surfaces for the parts of the machine to slide on.)It tells how to scrape your own straight edges and surface plates and other 'spotting' tools that you need as standards. It shows how to take three castings and compare them to each other in order to make a precision straight edge or surface. It is amazing, and simple, but requires patience. This is the fundamental knowledge needed to make accurate machine tools.After these basics, it goes into some specific machines; lathe,horizontal and vertical mill, grinder.It shows the use of a dial gauge and precision level and other instruments, along with jigs you build yourself, to test the alignment of the bearing surfaces. It tells how to make your own water level with a micrometer spindle, accurate to about 0.001 inch.(One thing it does leave out is details on how to use optical instruments like the collimator and alignment telescope, even though several pictures of these instruments are shown.)The book shows practical know how and discusses the theory behind what you are doing. There are many line drawings. Most are not fancy, more schematic looking, but effective and clear. Some photos also. The photos appear to be mostly donated by various machine tool companies. There are some photos of men working at South Bend Lathe, Cininnati Milling Machine Co and Galmeyer- Livingston, scraping on various machines in the factory. There are photos of tools used in scraping and in measuring.It tells how to examine a machine, where to start, what to look for. special problems that arise. It does NOT tell how to pour babbit bearings, or how to cut gears or lace up leather belts. It concentrates on the sliding bearing surfaces, such as the ways on a lathe bed and the dovetail slide on the cross slide. It tells how to restore the bearing surfaces, by scraping, and how to get the different elements of the machine tool into proper alignment with each other. Different 'frosting' techniques are described.There is no specific brand of machine discussed in this book. The information applies to all machines with linear, sliding bearings.The language is a little formal. Not like what they are teaching in public school today. The author doesn't talk down to the reader. He writes like someone who has had a lot of experience in machine rebuilding, and he is able to express that experience well. This is a rare combination.This is the book to have if you want to rebuild an old machine tool or build a new one from castings or weldments."},{"Title":"MacHine Tool Reconditioning and Applications of Hand Scraping","review":"The book has gotten here and it is in perfect shape,just like new and it was a 1955 printing.The pages are nice and crisp and the cover is just like the day it came from the book store.Very nice wish all books were in as good a shape.Hard to find book a little pricey but what does one expect now a days.Would recommend this book seller."},{"Title":"The Complete Woodblock Prints of Yoshida Hiroshi","review":"Steeped in traditional Japanese culture and trained early in Western art techniques, Hiroshi Yoshida (1876-1950) combined these two sensibilities to revive and renew the ancient art of Japanese woodblock printing on the verge of its disappearance as Japan embraced modernization at the beginning of the 20th century. This book is a comprehensive introduction for those new to Yoshida's work, and a valuable aid to the sophisticated print collector. Excellent color reproductions of 259 woodblock prints plus 20 works in other media shine in a generous and uncluttered format that encourages leisurely enjoyment of each masterpiece. The cosmopolitan Yoshida recorded his travels in India, China, Korea and the United States in his art. A passionate mountaineer, Yoshida translated sketches from his climbing expeditions into stunning prints, in such series as &quot;Twelve Scenes in the Japan Alps.&quot; He also captured scenes of Japan's disappearing traditional life in evocative prints such as &quot;Honest Grocery&quot;, &quot;A Small Restaurant at Night&quot; and &quot;Farmhouse.&quot; In perhaps his greatest works, Yoshida combines his skill in rendering both the monumental and the domestic to show that human existence is at once small and precious. He uses vast mountain landscapes as backdrops for intimate groups of climbers gathered around evening fires or sheltered in tents or caves as they sing and tell stories. Text and captions are in both English and Japanese. Inclusions of full margins on each print reproduction permits study of Japanese and English titles, signatures, dates and seals. A chronological survey of the prints, an illustrated artistic and personal biography, memoirs by Yoshida's artist sons and short essays on Yoshida's career round out this lovely book."},{"Title":"The Complete Woodblock Prints of Yoshida Hiroshi","review":"More than 250 images - each one in beautiful color.

The story often rambles away from talking about piano, and towards the LL Bean, chocolate lab, yuppie lifestyle of the author.

Of the three objectives of the quest, only the last is unambiguously fulfilled. Two things about this book are depressing. First, the author has no patience or self-discipline, and thus cannot possibly learn to play piano well. So that rules out objective number two. So why does he go on this \\"quest\\" to obtain an expensive piano? The real reason, which goes unsaid throughout the book, but is clear to any perceptive reader, is that it is easy for the author, who has money, to spend that money on a piano, and the satisfaction of owning the piano will serve him as a substitute for the satisfaction that would come from learning to play it well. The second reason this book is depressing is a quality that this book happens to share with countless \\"personal journey\\" memoirs that are coming out these days. It is that the author does not have the discipline, education or interest to write a serious work of non-fiction about pianos, piano manufacture or piano playing, and so turns to the much abused memoir format to squeeze a book out of what are, ultimately, a few unconnected experiences, shallow insights and personal challenges that are ultimately abandoned."},{"Title":"Piano Lessons: Music, Love, and True Adventures","review":"Congratulations to me! It's taken 10 years since this garbage was published for me to get around to reading it; ironically it was given to me as a bad joke of a Christmas gift from one of my what?adult piano students! It is mis-titled: it should be called Not Learning Piano for Dummies. Adams writes as an over-indulged, silly, overpaid NPR yuppie whose idea of accomplishing an artistic, creative and disciplined skill such as the fine art of music is totally unrealistic, childish and basically repulsive and insulting to the act of learning. His then-new wonderful Steinway I hope has been given by now to a music student with respect for the theory and technique and structure of music, all of which can be learned and yes, even performed well, by students young and especially as adults WITH PRACTICE, WITH A DECENT TEACHER and by not trying to outsmart-a** what has proven to be gloriously true for centuries: that the beauty of music must be mastered carefully, with dedication and with patience. His attitude - buy a good piano and ignore it for a ludicrously stupid computerized program which refuses the student the basics, reading and counting, let alone the phrasing of music - exemplifies the dumbing down of American culture. Frankly, those of who DO make our living at the piano DO NOT WELCOME FOOLS such as himself. AARGH!(I resent giving it even the 1-star, it was required to have this review printed.)"},{"Title":"Piano Lessons: Music, Love, and True Adventures","review":"I was instantly intrigued by this book. I was disappointed that of the 242 pages, it take until page 181 for him to decide to even play Traumerei for his wife.Quite frankly, this book is filled with self indulgant nonsense. If Adams had stuck to the idea of writing a book about just learning piano , it would have been fine. Instead he meanders onto subjects such buying boats and taking trips. What does any of that crap have to do with playing piano?I think Noah Adam's experience is very indicative of the \\"I want everything now with little work\\" philosophy that pervades our country. I have very little doubt that the exquisite Steinway he bought has either been sold or is gathering dust. What a shame."},{"Title":"Piano Lessons: Music, Love, and True Adventures","review":"It's been years since I read this book, but I have fond memories of it and dropped in here trying to relocate it again. I have to laugh at those who have given this book such harsh reviews with their literal impressions, and I'm very much in agreement with the others, like Bron Mitchell here, who enjoyed it for the right reasons. This is not necessarily about piano. It is about struggling to fulfill a passion in the face of your limitations. About confronting your fears and inadequacies, in the bravest attempt you can muster, given your amateur talents and spare time.I don't play piano, but I've been struggling for years to play my swing violin in much the same way Noah Adams approached his music. I thoroughly enjoyed the side trips and distractions and intermittent and yet consistent efforts to pursue the unrelenting dream.For those who play professionally, and for others who come by music easily with talent to spare, his struggles may seem frustrating and self-indulgent. But I would simply say to them, do they have a powerful dream to develop another talent that they may not be so blessed to possess? For example, have they ever wanted to build a boat and sail it to some far off destination? Or play professional baseball? Or be a comedian onstage? Paint a masterpiece? What would it be like to take on your dream, whatever that may be, regardless of your current profession? If you can't imagine putting yourself out there bravely to take it on, then you won't appreciate the subtle, comic travails of this author. And your own life will be much less interesting for it. Cut the brave souls some slack for they know the enjoyment and challenge of really living and appreciating life.I wholeheartedly recommend the book to any amateur adventurer out there. It is very similar to another book I thoroughly enjoyed and laughed out loud at called \\"Winterdance: The Fine Madness of Running the Iditarod\\" by Gary Paulsen."},{"Title":"Piano Lessons: Music, Love, and True Adventures","review":"Noah Adams, in his book Piano Lessons, presents an honest, straight forward guide on achieving one's goal in middle age. This is not a just a book about piano lessons, but more a story about becoming who we really want to be, or even more, who we really are. Mr. Adams tells the truth about procrastination and about dedication, those traits that tend to haunt us through our middle years. Have we really achieved what we've wanted out of life? And what can we do if something is missing?One thing Noah Adams did was keep a record of his goal setting and the achievement of that goal. By writing the book in the form of a journal, the reader is able to watch his progress as he sets out to learn to play the piano. He starts big, with the investment of an $11,000 Steinway and the rest is history. He stumbles through a Miracle Piano Teaching System on the computer ($259.95), various piano technique books, a music camp and finally some honest to goodness piano lessons. The book ends with Mr Adams presenting his wife, Neenah, with a concert for Christmas, complete with tuxedo, brass candlesticks, candles and the favorite pieces he has longed to play for many years.This might sound overly sentimental, but to many of us who have procrastinated all of our lives in the music field, Piano Lessons is true inspiration. Mr Adams would be pleased to know that as soon as I finished the book, I perused the internet and ordered $75 worth of music books (&quot;Hooked on Easy Classics&quot;). I have built the fire in the little guest house where my inherited piano(my mother's) has rested for five years virtually untouched.

The book is his account ofhow he tried to learn, using several different approaches.It's also about what the piano means to him, and what itmeans to those who play it well.I loved this book, because I'm only a bit youngerthan 50 myself, my wife and I have also bought a piano thatwe can't play,and we also want to learn, but haven't yet begun.This book isn't the Zen-and-the-Art-of-Motorcycle-Maintenance ofpiano literature, but, like that book, it's about much morethan piano lessons. Even if you're not in our situation,you'll enjoy the book, and you'll learn something aboutpianos, pianists, and about what learning is like. It's notonly for kids!"},{"Title":"Piano Lessons: Music, Love, and True Adventures","review":"The irony of &quot;Piano Lessons&quot; is that it's not about taking piano lessons at all, at least not weekly piano lessons with a teacher, and so you might read this book as a primer on how NOT to learn to play the piano.That said, I enjoyed this book and found it to be a lovely meditation on the beauty of the piano and the difficulty of fitting an amateur passion into a busy, career-laden schedule. I thought to myself that if a fine writer and talented journalist such as Adams could take such a weird approach to learning to play - erratically using music software and turning his back on his lovely new Steinway! -- then I shouldn't be afraid to try. It's been a year since I read &quot;Piano Lessons,&quot; and I now own a piano, am six months into weekly piano lessons and am at the skill level where I could play &quot;Traumeri&quot; (although I haven't tried to do so). &quot;Piano Lessons&quot; helped kick-start my own musical adventure.How's it going with you, Noah?"},{"Title":"Piano Lessons: Music, Love, and True Adventures","review":"As I now roll through the middle years of the half century mark in my life, there are things that I wished I would have done, but never had the time, stamina, discipline or anything else that I could rationalize into an excuse to actually complete them. For me, one of them was playing the piano. I played the tenor saxophone for ten years in my school years, but was always amazed at the sound from a good piano player. I tried once in my mid-thirties, but gave up after a couple of months; but I blamed it on that stupid bass cleft. I never really got over that. A week ago I was attending a library book sale and one of my book sale buddies (owner of an online book store) threw this book at me while we were browsing the tables. He has a tendency to do that when we see each other and every one of his recommendations has hit that proverbial spot for me. This one is was no exception that rule.Noah Adams is a reporter on National Public Radio (NPR) and is the host of \\"All Things Considered\\". As a writer, Adams has the perfect rhythm and pace for a light memoir. In this particular book, Adams writes of one year in his life as he battles the ghosts of learning to play the piano. There are plenty of tangentially related stories about other people's inspirational tales in which they have overcome afflictions and life's hard knocks, but the basic premise of this book takes the reader on a journey into Adam's psyche as he uses those same rationalizations that we all have in our pocket when something is just not going the way we want. Fortunately, he also shows some additional fortitude as he circumvents those same failures and proves that you are just never too old to do something that you have been putting off.It is not necessary to have piano playing as your \\"wannabe\\" to enjoy this book as Adams will have you re-thinking anything that you have been putting off. I have decided to take up two things that have been stuck on my \\"failure\\" list because of this book: chess and piano playing. Piano Lessons instills that being good at something is not the end result, it is the joy of doing. So if you are online playing chess, you might get to beat me up pretty badly while I sit back and murmur \\"wow, that was a good move\\", because everyone beats me. But someday.....Someone once told me, \\"You'd better do whatever it is that you want in this life because this is not a practice round\\". I recommend this book to anyone needing a little push."},{"Title":"Piano Lessons: Music, Love, and True Adventures","review":"Noah Adam's book Piano Lessons: Music, Love & True Adventures is not a book on how to play the piano. It is a book that documents the 51st year in his life as he pursues a goal of learning to play the piano.This is a book that many of us can relate to. Living a busy life, Noah Adams like most people would like to accomplish something--in his case, learning to play the piano. As the co-host of the National Public Radio (NPR) program, \\"All Things Considered,\\" he has interviewed many musically inclined people, has done research on music related topics and knows a lot about music.As a child his parents rented a piano for him and his twin brother's benefit; however, it did not work out and the piano was returned. Over the years, while he did not lose his interest in piano music he never took the time to learn how to play.At 51 years of age, he spent what I would consider a great deal of money on a piano and did not want it to end up like his wife's (Neenah Ellis) cello, forgotten while hidden away in a closet. On the other hand, he procrastinated like most of us and was hot and cold about making the time to practice. Nevertheless, he tried many strategies over the year in an effort to learn. He bought a computer program, he took a piano instruction vacation and much more. His year end goal was finally narrowed down to learning to play his wife's favorite piano piece well.In the process, Noah provides a diary like accounting month by month during that entire year and shares his family, work and sense of humor. I found myself laughing at times thinking about all the times I have bought something with grand ideas on accomplishing certain goals and talents, yet settling for much less or nothing at all.I learned a great deal about the field of music reading Noah Adam's book and had a good time doing it. I do not think I will ever spend the time or money learning how to play the piano, but this book reminded me of my guitar hidden in the closet. I think I will make a visit there and pick at it a while. I may even unfold my treadmill, wipe the dust off, plug it in and walk a couple of miles some time this year.I read somewhere that Noah has written other books about a particular year in his life that he has pursued something interesting. I can hardly wait to read one of those.This book will not teach you how to play the piano; however, Noah Adams is an interesting guy who not only knows a lot about music, but also knows about human nature and how to make us smile as we think about our own experiences.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Piano Lessons: Music, Love, and True Adventures","review":"Noah Adams' Piano Lessons reminds me of John Jerome's Elements of Effort; Stone Work; and Truck; and also of Tracy Kidder's House. Each of the aforementioned books is a nice blend of non-fiction about a bit of the world mixed with a bit of humanity, by writers who know what they're about. Adams' book tells the story of why and how this NPR correspondent decided, at age 51, to learn to play the piano. It's a gentle and pleasant story, thanks in large part to the author's skill and quietly humorous, self-deprecating style. He weaves into the book enough information about pianos, their construction, their history, musicians, and so on, to interest at least a non-expert general reader (much as, say, Tracy Kidder wove in information about how houses are constructed). Piano Lessons is a very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Piano Lessons: Music, Love, and True Adventures","review":"Well written, pleasant, and nicely paced but I finished this book deeply disappointed and somewhat depressed.I had expected to be inspired by descriptions of the author's dedication and perseverance, his struggle to balance the demands of his dream with those of his personal and work lives, but instead I gradually became depressed by his instant gratification approach to fulfilling his dream - the discarded computerized teaching aid, the pre-paid but forgotten seminar, the half-hearted participation at 'piano camp', and the endless interviews with accomplished musicians (interesting on their own but most of those interviewed had started playing their instruments as children so what relevant experience could they draw on in order to offer useful advice to a middle-aged novice?). At the very end of the book the author at long last commits to master a very challenging piece but the hard work and the difficulties overcome (the essence of this commitment and, surely, the intention of the book) are glossed over by the trivial details of his Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday preparations.I can't recommend this book - it just doesn't deliver."},{"Title":"Piano Lessons: Music, Love, and True Adventures","review":"I was interested in reading the book becasue I recently returned to playing the piano after 30 years and I thought it would be fun to read someone else's experience on the trials and tribulations learning or relearning the music and buying a piano. Unfortunately, Mr. Adam's short reminisecne was short on information about actual playing and such and more about his very busy life with NPR. His book also suffers from \\"name dropitis\\" and a sometimes an elitist tone. Passages about \\"overfed\\" mall shoppers in \\"stonewashed\\" jeans -- followed by the author's refuge to an organic juice bar was plebian writing. I was most appalled by the fact that Mr. Adams purchases an incredibly expensive piano before even being able to read music! I found his struggle and his inability to \\"get going\\" and play very inaccessible to me as reader."},{"Title":"Piano Lessons: Music, Love, and True Adventures","review":"I LOVED this book. How come, I wonder? Lemme see, maybe it was an early reference to the resonant bass chords from Jerry Lee Lewis' fifties recording of \\"Whole Lot of Shakin' Goin' On\\" which really hooked me. Or it could have been Adams' casual remarks about growing up in southern Ohio (which, as everyone knows, is ALmost Kentucky), with the jacket flap photo of his 13 year-old self w/ a modified DA and shades - a persona that I once went through too. But most probably it was his self-professed life-long fascination with music and musicians - music of ALL kinds; there's no evidence of musical snobbery here, although Adams obviously knows a helluva lot more about classical music than I ever will. In fact the piece he picks to try to learn in the course of a year of studying the piano is Schumann's \\"Traumerei,\\" a composition which I don't know at all (did I spell that composer's name correctly?), but it becomes evident in the course of the narrative, that it is NOT an easy piece to learn, and certainly not for a beginner. So it wasn't the classical part that drew me in. No, it was the all-music-is-good attitude that Adams displayed that attracted me. And maybe his nearly year-long attempt to learn to play (by ear) \\"Misty,\\" an old jazz favorite of mine (and yes, I do know the Eastwood film too). His talks and interviews with music teachers - in downtown NYC and on a mountaintop in Vermont, as well as a whole family of piano teachers in a music camp for adults - are also arrestingly interesting, as are his talks with Minnesota pianists Lori Line and Butch Thompson, who talked of his truck-driving father, who taught him to love the big band and jazz music of the 40s, while Butch tried, mostly unsuccessfully, to introduce his dad to Jerry Lee and Elvis.\\"He did like, my dad, to hear Elvis sing 'Peace in the Valley'.\\"Glen Gould, Horowitz, Mancini, Eubie Blake, Pinetop Perkins, Teddy Wilson - so many piano players and \\"pianists\\" are mentioned here that it's hard to remember them all. But the thing is, Piano Lessons is really mostly a love story. It's about loving music, of course, but it's also, at least peripherally, about how much Adams loves his wife and how he keeps on plugging away over the course of a busy year, trying to make time to learn the piano, so he can play this one beautiful piece (\\"Traumerei\\") as a special gift to her. And he succeeds. Admittedly, he makes mistakes and falters, but it's a gift that matters. And this is a book that matters too, especially if you are a music lover.

Does he rent or borrow a piano, maybe buy a used piano, take lessons, go to a class, set aside an hour every day to play?No. No, no, and no. He does everything wrong, backward, upside down and sideways. He buys a ridiculously expensive piano before he even knows where middle C is (I exaggerate slightly - he actually does know where middle C was at this point, but not much more). He buys expensive computer teaching software and practices on the cheesy-sounding keyboard that goes with it. He practices sporadically, and rarely on the new piano. He buys another course by mail that stresses chords and faking although he actually wants to learn to play classical music. He sets as his goal a Schumann piece that even third-year students find challenging. He spends more money to attend a ten-day piano camp. Piano camp!Adams took piano lessons as a boy, but he'd been an indifferent student and hadn't kept at it. Unfortunately it's not like riding a bicycle and he remembers virtually nothing of what he had once known. He has to start from the beginning.In spite of doing practically everything wrong, he eventually overcomes his own poor judgment, tosses the computer software and mail order course, sets aside some time every day to practice and after about a year, learns the song he'd set as his goal.Imagine that - you can do it all wrong and still achieve your goals. Adams relates his mistakes, not seeming to realize what a mess he was making of it, but at the end, admits that he might have gone about it differently. It's an inspiring story in spite of everything.I was curious about whether he's still playing piano. The year he writes about was 1993, so it would be nice to know that he still plays and has learned tons of music since that first difficult year. But you know, it doesn't matter. Even if he only played for one year and learned the one song, he had a great experience and learned a lot about himself. And he got a good book out of it.Another book about a late bloomer --A Devil to Play: One Man's Year-Long Quest to Master the Orchestra's Most Difficult Instrument"},{"Title":"Piano Lessons: Music, Love, and True Adventures","review":"I thought this book was very well-written and charming. Having said that, I have to admit that it was a bit different than I expected.I think I expected it to be more about the hard work and dedication it takes to become an accomplished musician. I was surprised at Adams' procrastination (although don't we all do that occasionally?), and at the fact that he didn't just go out and find a piano teacher, but instead turned to computer software and and play-by-ear piano course.This book is about a man's dream to become a pianist and the path he takes to begin to realize that dream. It includes tons of personal anecdotes as well as random anecdotes and facts about a large variety of famous pianists (jazz, classical, you name it). I thoroughly enjoyed learning all sorts of random things about musicians such as Glenn Gould, Lorie Line and George Shearing.I also loved how Adams included lots of little experiences with his wife - I thought it was cute.In some ways you could compare this book toLife Between the Keys: The (Mis)Adventures Of The 5 Browns; they both contain a plethora of music- and life-related anecdotes and are about aspiring musicians (albeit at very different levels). The main difference (other than that the 5 Browns are concert pianists and Adams is a beginner) is that Adam's book is much more well-written.So, in conclusion, while I was admittedly bugged at times at his seemingly half-hearted approach to learning the piano (I've gotta be honest about this, I am a pianist and a piano teacher myself, after all), I found that I couldn't put the book down. I gleaned some inspiring and helpful tidbits that I could apply in my piano teaching or my own life."},{"Title":"Piano Lessons: Music, Love, and True Adventures","review":"What a great read! I'm so glad I found this book. I lived every moment with the author as he went through his year of learning to play the piano at age 51.

I really think I will, knowing better what to expect because of Noah Adam's journey."},{"Title":"Piano Lessons: Music, Love, and True Adventures","review":"Several factors came together to bring this book to my attention. I have listened to Noah Adams measured tones on NPRs All Things Considered for years. I studied piano reluctantly for fifteen of my first nineteen years on Earth.(Jewish fathers always want their sons to be doctors by day and concert pianists by night)But most importantly, at the age of forty, with years of neglecting the piano behind me, I had almost decided to buy one again and not only try, belatedly, to justify my expensive lessons but also inflict something similar, but less obsessive, on my own son.Mr Adams book is a beautiful memoir, gentle and ardent. It is a fine blend of history, anecdote, experience and passion. A fifty year old man, successful and assured takes on a challenge - to learn to play the piano - and brings us, month by month, through trepidation, irritation and confidence and joy to the emotional ending that leaves one wishing the book could be longer.

At age 35, I too am just beginning piano lessons. Unlike Noah, I already played other instruments, even majored in flute in college, which in a way makes it even harder to start anew. Noah's book gave me great delight and encouragement to carry on with my lessons, beyond the frustrations of knowing I learned faster when I was younger, or that I'll never be &quot;really good,&quot; into the joy of being A Pianist at my own level in my own good time."},{"Title":"Piano Lessons: Music, Love, and True Adventures","review":"What was the point of this book? Fair writing. Rambling story. Noah made every mistake he could while attempting to learn how to play the piano.

Noah - Stick to your day job."},{"Title":"Piano Lessons: Music, Love, and True Adventures","review":"The reader learns about Noah Adams of National Public Radio, starting and sticking with a musical instrument as an adult, and more in a thoroughly enjoyable, short book.I was pleased and a bit disappointed when I finished &quot;Piano Lessons.&quot; I was glad to have heard Adams' story and sorry that I could not return to hear more. (Adams does recommend books by other authors.)One reason I chose to read his book now: I recently began learning to play nylon-stringed guitar -- my first instrument (if you don't count &quot;song flute&quot; in elementary school and a pass at a desktop keyboard as an adult). My age: 49. My musical talent: none"},{"Title":"Piano Lessons: Music, Love, and True Adventures","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, having been a fan of NPR commentator Noah Adams for years. It was a great pleasure to find out that he can write as well as he can speak. Chronicling his year in learning how to play a single tune, Schumann's Traumerei, we follow Adams on his adventures, from at-home schooling with a computer, buying a piano, private lessons and schooling, and discovering that making music is just more than banging away at the keys. While this book does have some hints and ideas, it's more of a stream-of-conciousness than a 'how-to' book. This is one where you sit down in your favorite chair, and enjoy the experience."},{"Title":"Piano Lessons: Music, Love, and True Adventures","review":"A few years ago, \`Die yuppie scum' was a popular bumper sticker. This book could inspire a comeback of that sticker. Smug, pretentious, rich enough to buy an 11,000 piano, expensive software audio tapes, and a sailboat in the same year, he gives capitalism a bad name. I don't get a sense of his love of the piano as much as his love of himself."},{"Title":"Piano Lessons: Music, Love, and True Adventures","review":"An awful book. A preening book. A silly & self-satisfied book.Adams spends most of it avoiding his piano; attending tweelittle piano workshops, fussing with some witless computerpiano lessons, buying a boat with a literary pedigree (E.B.White!), wondering about those drab people in malls whowear bright white sneakers & lack boats with a literarypedigree, and piddling on with his busy life. Meanwhile,his Steinway sits there! Hey, Noah Adams, if you don't havethe time to put it to use, send me the piano! And throw inthe bench, too! Also, whoever wrote \\"die yuppie scum\\", c'mon over and we'll have a sing-along! Everybody else, read \\"Men, Women & Pianos\\" by Arthur Loesser for its wit and depth,even if it is way out of date. Or \\"The Piano Shopon the Left Bank\\" by Thad Carhart, a short book that's likepornography for piano lovers."},{"Title":"Piano Lessons: Music, Love, and True Adventures","review":"Let's get one thing straight! $11,000 is not alot for a fine musical instrument - it doesn't lose half its value as it rolls out of the showroom, ok? That said, it is disturbing that someone whose livelihood depends on human contact and communication should think that he could learn to play the piano expressively using a book or computer program! (I won't even start in on the idea of practicing on a soulless electronic keyboard when you own a Steinway). Certainly Noah Adam's wonderfully intimate writing is not a product of those methods - I dare say he had several caring, lively, human teachers. I only hope that now he finds one to lead him to the pleasure of the learning process - and then writes about his second year at the piano."},{"Title":"Piano Lessons: Music, Love, and True Adventures","review":"This was a very pleasant and quick read -- and it made me want to rush out to the music store to pick up a copy of Traumerei. The author's comments on attending music camp in Vermont and on purchasing a Steinway were particularly enlightening. Good read for anyone who has been away from music for a while and would like to become more musical. Adams reminded me of why I want to play the piano."},{"Title":"Piano Lessons: Music, Love, and True Adventures","review":"i liked this book. i started playing guitar at age eleven, and took my first lesson at age 30, because i wanted to learn something about &quot;music&quot;, which i mention because there may have to be something dormant in the reader to appreciate what Noah's up to. the 12 month gig is a literary gem!"},{"Title":"Piano Lessons: Music, Love, and True Adventures","review":"This story could be read in installments on public radio. It's about 10% piano, 90& human interest, telling the stories of a couple dozen characters encountered during a year as a beginning piano student. There's the computer course, the week long piano camp, the lessons from the Mountain Man and the Socialite, interwoven with anecdotes of Glenn Gould, Robert Schumann and other notables. All told with a low-key humor and carefully written to keep the reader interested through to the nice O. Henry-worthy ending."},{"Title":"Piano Lessons: Music, Love, and True Adventures","review":"Yes, the story of this book is indeed shallow and self-indulgent, and those who really practice music and who spend years mastering an instrument will have nothing but well-deserved derision for the story of a guy who wants to learn to play the piano but doesn't want to put much effort into studying it. That really is the red thread running through the book: his attempts to learn the piano using instant methods such as a computer program and tapes and books from a guy who will teach you how to play by ear. And even the idea of a week-long piano camp smacks of an attempt to cram a bunch of knowledge in rather than doing what is necessary: playing day in and day out and getting better over a period of years.When he finally plays Traumerei at the end he makes it pretty clear that he didn't really play it very well and missed lots of notes and screwed up on parts, which isn't very surprising. But again, rather than taking the time to do it right (God forbid he should put too much effort into learning music), he'd rather just crank out anything that passes as Traumerei and call himself accomplished. I have a feeling that when his wife was crying at the end it wasn't because of the touchingness of the concert that he performed for her, but rather her tears were tears of agony and pain over the aural trainwreck that was being forced upon her, a pile of musical debris that was once a majestic and beautiful piece of music.So why do I give this nonsense a full three stars? Because there is some good information in it about musicians and pianists and performing. He did interviews with various pianists and it is fun and interesting to read about them and what they say. The small bit he said about Scott Joplin has very much improved my playing of the Entertainer, for example. Nothing in this book that comes from the author's own mind or experience is the least bit intersting, but the information he brings in from others is quite worthwhile."},{"Title":"Piano Lessons: Music, Love, and True Adventures","review":"I loved this book from page 1 to the last one! It is set in Paris, which is a city I love very much, and this book transported me back there. The piano stories are very interesting, since I started taking piano lessons at 30 years old this book touched my heart very fast."},{"Title":"Piano Lessons: Music, Love, and True Adventures","review":"I agree with the author of the review on april 25 97. How can you blow all those big bucks on a Steinway, get all psyched up to take on the world and then think that a computer program or quick learn tapes can possibly teach you one of the most complex tasks that a middle aged human can achive. Nicely written though ( I kept hearing those darn NPR trumpets though out the book). Sell that crappy sailboat, get a teacher, roll up your sleeves, shutup and play your Piano!!!"},{"Title":"Piano Lessons: Music, Love, and True Adventures","review":"will enjoy this book. Reading of his personal experiences in learing the instrument are enjoyable, but not enough are related to fill a book. The sections relating facts about famous pianists, or the excerpts of interviews with them, may interest begining piano players, but I found them boring fillers and actually skipped over parts. However, the last chapters did motivate me to pick up my guitar and practice!"},{"Title":"Piano Lessons: Music, Love, and True Adventures","review":"Noah Adams has captured the soul of learning to play the piano, and in so doing has answered his own question: Why does a fifty-one-year-old man suddenly decide he has to have a piano?Once you learn to play Robert Schumann's devastatingly beautiful &quot;Traumerei&quot; or &quot;Of Foreign Lands and People&quot; you cannot bear not to play."},{"Title":"Piano Lessons: Music, Love, and True Adventures","review":"I am confused and disappointed by other reviews of this book that claim Noah Adams went about learning the piano all wrong. Readers who were hoping for hints about practice and technique have missed out on a thoroughly good read, all because of their misguided approach to this wonderful story of one man's musical quest. This is not a \\"how to\\" book, and nor should it be.What makes this book such a treasure is the exact same thing as what one reviewer callously calls \\"banal fluff\\": talking about his wife, his love for a piece of music that he longs to play but fears he can't, his experiences of meeting and talking with other musicians, his knowledge of pianos and of music in general, and his passion and appreciation for music of many styles. The process of learning a musical instrument is a journey, and Noah tells us of his. From the first chapter, when he talks of the secret desire he has held for years to buy a piano, to the last chord of Schumann's \`Tr&auml;umerei' which he plays as a Christmas present for his wife, this book entranced me with the joys and the struggles of learning to play an instrument. Yes, he may have got there faster if he'd spent more time practicing and less time procrastinating, but chances are the results would have been far less rewarding, and the book would certainly have been far less interesting.Ultimately, if you genuinely have a passion for music, there is no right or wrong way to go about learning. Noah did it this way, and he got there in the end. Who are we to criticise?"},{"Title":"Piano Lessons: Music, Love, and True Adventures","review":"After reading most of the reviews, it seems that people had different expectations of the book and sometimes read it for the wrong purpose. I don't believe Mr. Adams wrote the book as a guide for people on how to buy a piano and learn to play it. It was more of an account of his love of music, his family, his career, and how he managed to juggle all three at once. I totally agree that if you're looking for a book that will show you how to seriously learn to play the piano, this is not it.This book is--to me--inspiring and delightful in every way. I didn't run across any boring passages, nor did I ever want to skip any of it. It was beautifully written and I loved every word."},{"Title":"Piano Lessons: Music, Love, and True Adventures","review":"I think it is misleading that some have written very poor reviews of \\"Piano Lessons\\" by Noah Adams. They say the book does not have enough material about how to play the piano, or that he does not have enough patience to learn to play, and the book minimizes how much hard work it takes to play.But the goal of this book is not to teach one to play piano. It is to trace an adult's foray into piano playing. Mr. Adams chose to begin by using a book rather than hiring a teacher. Though hiring a teacher would be a far better way to begin, by reading his story one can learn a great deal. Because he didn't just hire a teacher, we learn about all his travels through piano educational techniques and materials. We learn of Denise Kahn who teaches adults on the upper west side of Manhattan- this in fact is how I found Denise, through this book- and she is a superb teacher. We read of the Van Der Lindes piano camp for adults. Mistakenly I tried to locate them in NY rather than Vermont, so I was not successful. But I did learn of Bruce Potterton's Summerkeys program in Maine, from Denise, and spent a very valuable week there. The progress one can make in an intensive week in the summer is powerful, and will reinforce your desire to continue studying. Finally, the material with Ned Phoenix makes clear how good used instruments can be, often superior to new ones, even if they need a rebuild. I in fact, bought a used Kranich and Bach for $400. The tone is wonderful and it holds a tuning real well. It is worth around $2,000.If you want to learn HOW to play piano i.e. technique, buy other books. If you want to read about lots of ways adults can learn piano and supplement their private lessons, and read a book with feeling that will encourage you to practice and truly learn to play well, then I highly recommend Piano Lessons."},{"Title":"Piano Lessons: Music, Love, and True Adventures","review":"Noah Adams enchanted me with his touching--and at times very amusing--memoir of learning to play a deceptively simple piece of music on the piano.I read this book years ago, when it was recommended to me by pianist Robin Spielberg. At the time, Piano Lessons struck me as the first prose I had encountered that accurately described the rush of elation musicians experience when successfully conquering the chaos of a difficult phrase. On a second read-through, almost a decade after its publication, Adams' words remain as crisp and as playful as a perfectly played arpeggio. This is a writer who hears what he writes. He has a musician's ear and a writer's sensibility--a rare combination.In music, as in writing, achieving an air of effortlessness distinguishes a true master. It's not easy to describe joys of music, but Adams pulls it off with a lightness that will inspire the secret musician lurking in the hearts of so many adults.Robin Meloy Goldsby is the author ofPiano Girl: A Memoir"},{"Title":"Piano Lessons: Music, Love, and True Adventures","review":"What a wonderful, uplifting, book! Having begun playing the piano again after nearly 40 years away from it, I found myself enjoying Noah Adams descriptions of his joys and frustrations, exhaulting in his successes, and actually learning a few things to boot.A number of people ranted about the fact that Adams spent 11K on a piano. Having diddled around on a number of pianos before purchasing a used Yamaha upright, I can attest to the fact that there are pianos that can not only make even badly played music sound good but seem to call out to you when you touch them. Adams was in the fortunate position of being able to afford a piano that &quot;spoke&quot; to him, despite his somewhat unorthodox method of learning to play it.For an entertaining, enjoyable read, I definitely recommend Piano Lessons."},{"Title":"Piano Lessons: Music, Love, and True Adventures","review":"This book is about Noah Adams' decision to purchase a Steinway and learn to play. This is not a how-to book, but it will provide inspiration to the adult beginner, and it will give you ideas and insight on certain pieces. After reading this book, I went out &amp; got the sheet music for Robert Schumann's Traumerei, which Adams describes lovingly in the introduction (and refers to later in the text). Adams' writing resonates with a love of music, a love of the piano, and an emotional investment in learning to play. The book contains anecdotes about his adventures at piano camp in Vermont as well as tidbits about classical composers and music. It's an uplifting read for a music lover, particularly one who dabbles in classical numbers (although it might be too light &amp; fluffy for a serious, well-trained &amp; educated musician -- not falling into that category, I'm not sure)."},{"Title":"Piano Lessons: Music, Love, and True Adventures","review":"This book is amusing and pleasant. It has nice anecdotes, musical information, names are dropped and a good inspirational message about going after a midlife dream. The 2 stars are for that. Have time on a bus, train or plane? Bring this along its not a bad read. But if you already play the piano and are at home you're better off practicing. If you don't play and want to, well what are you waiting for? Get the inpsiration from the music you love and get a good teacher.As someone else wrote, it's hilarious that Noah would spend $11 grand on a piano and not get a good teacher. I mean with all his connections? If you are thinking of starting, a good teacher is well worth the money, it will get you going faster and you will feel more committed. Spend less on the piano if you have to. A lot of Noah's frustrations in learning could have been made easier with a teacher, but I guess then he wouldn't have written this book. He would have been too busy practicing. But maybe his real midlife dream was this book?When all is said and done, if someone other than a person with a bit of celebrity status, such as Noah, had written this book who would care? You might get better inspiration by learning about the music you love and following your own path."},{"Title":"Piano Lessons: Music, Love, and True Adventures","review":"Noah Adams is best known as a commentator on the National Public Radio network's All Things Considered. His gentle humor and thoughtful insights translate well into print form.In &quot;Piano Lessons,&quot; Adams conveys the attraction of music, even for those of us who have little experience or talent in producing it. He details the course of a year in his life, a year when he decided to invest in a piano and learn to play it. Adams mainly used self-teaching methods, but also participated in a session with a private teacher and attended a week long music camp.Besides chronicling the routines of practicing and acquiring a greater familiarity with the instrument, Adams' book branches off to cover other aspects of his life during the time, and a sizable amount of history of the piano and of notable pianists, past and present. Those tangents are mostly interesting and enjoyable, thanks to Adams' polished prose style."},{"Title":"Piano Lessons: Music, Love, and True Adventures","review":"I'm still wondering, is this book about piano, life and love...or male menopause? Well, it scarcely matters. It's a gentle and pleasant journey we take with Adams, who at the age of 50, finally acts on a wistful dream he's carried inside for years: To learn to play the piano. Most of his readers likely hold their own musical fantasy. But even if you're not musically inclined, you won't be disappointed. Playing the piano may be at the end of the road, but the road leads Adams in many directions. He meanders in the journey, giving us the opportunity to hear his musical influences, watch him work at National Public Radio, peek into his family life, learn about the history and structure of the piano and some about music, music performance, and the joy of growth at any age. Sure, it seemed saccharine at first, but it won me over. Hey, I wanted to say more, but read the book--I'm going to go play my piano"},{"Title":"Piano Lessons: Music, Love, and True Adventures","review":"While Mr. Adams book pretends to be about piano lessons, love of music, and musical adventure, in reality it has little to do with these subjects. &quot;Piano Lessons&quot; is really about a busy middle aged professional, making a half hearted attempt to learn a few pieces of keyboard music. The time he spent rambling on about work, vacations, sailing, and piano purchasing angst, would have been better spent practicing on the Steinway. As a person who began piano at age 40, I feel Mr. Adams can't see the forest for the keys. If he really wants to learn Traumerei, Mr. Adams should practice, practice, and then practice some more. Any person following his path of computer lessons, infrequent practice, long absence from playing, and overambitious music selection, will never realize what a pleasure it is to sit and play a piece of music correctly and with confidence. Mr. Adams - find a piano teacher and go every week. You will be amazed at what you can do!!! In my opinion Mr. Adams did not have enough experience or material on piano lessons to fill a book, so he filled it with all manner of banal fluff. &quot;Piano Lessons&quot; was interesting when it adhered to the topic, and all the rest is unnecessary."},{"Title":"Piano Lessons: Music, Love, and True Adventures","review":"Since I'm in my forties and just bought a digital piano to learn and play music for the first time in my life, I thought it would be interesting to read this book for some tips and inspiration. I did, however, find it quite difficult to get into. Perhaps this is partly because I am not American and also because I don't know much about either the places the author mentions or most of the names he drops. But I persevered, and am glad I did, because although I didn't get what I expected I did enjoy reading about the experiences of going to a music camp and the authors encounters, conversations and interviews with various amateur and professional musicians. These were the best part for me, and especially to explore what making music means."},{"Title":"Piano Lessons: Music, Love, and True Adventures","review":"I don't know anything not-to-like about this little book. Many of us who have taken music lessons as kids have thought about how nice it would be to actually start over and do it right. Noah Adams pretty much did just that.I recently wrote a review of Getting Back to the Piano by W.F. Buckley and mentioned Mr. Adams' book."},{"Title":"Piano Lessons: Music, Love, and True Adventures","review":"I bought this book, Piano Lessons, several months ago on Ebay, mainly because I collect autographed books, and as a piano teacher for 50 yrs., the title intrigued me. It was a real treasure, autographed by Noah Adams, former host of NPR's \\"All Things Considered\\" - another draw for me as a faithful listener of NPR. I really appreciated the book from the perspective of a piano teacher, showing the struggle and dedication of a virtual non-musician with a great passion to learn to play one Schumann piece, Traumerei (although slow, it is not an easy piece). It's very true that Mr. Adams could have progressed much faster had he had an excellent teacher, but it seems to show the lengths one will go to take shortcuts when there are actually none; however, after trying many \\"quick methods\\", he found that out. The book truly gave me a different perspective, insight and appreciation for the adult student and the lengths one will go to in his desire to create pleasing sounds of music on the piano. As an owner of a Steinway B (7ft.), I could understand his buying a \\"pearl of great price\\". No matter how accomplished the musician, or not, any piece will sound better on a high quality instrument. Loved that book!"},{"Title":"Piano Lessons: Music, Love, and True Adventures","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the wonderful stories of people whose names are both known and unknown to me sprinkled throughout this book. The author's writing entertains. I did, however, waver between amusement and irritation regarding his \\"Miracle\\" computer program which I feel should be relegated to the techno crap heap that physically and intellectually pollutes our world. His desire for instant gratification belongs more to youngsters than to a man of his years. I do honor his choice to begin learning without a teacher. Before the music teachers out there charge forth with torches and pitchforks, please may I remind that everyone has his/her own mode of learning. Many learn best with a teacher at the ready for \\"right\\" answers, and then there are those, myself included, whose learning path is made richer and deeper by making their own discoveries and solving problems as they arise. Several books that have been warm companions along my amateur piano journey are: Just Being at the Piano by Mildred Portney Chase, Effortless Mastery by Kenny Werner (a real gem!), Never Too Late by John Holt, Making Music For The Joy Of It by Stephanie Judy (great information AND inspiration), and The Craft of Piano Playing by Alan Fraser (not for the faint of heart)."},{"Title":"Piano Lessons: Music, Love, and True Adventures","review":"Regret not learning the piano or other instrument growing up? Noah Adams teaches us that second chances do happen and with patience and dedication, you too can follow your dreams. I took my first lesson a week after reading this book. Its funny, touching and profoundly true. I enjoyed it immensely."},{"Title":"Piano Lessons: Music, Love, and True Adventures","review":"This book was beautifully written and very sincere; I found it not only inspirational to beginner pianists but a wonderful reminder of how much of a priveledge it is to be able to play an instrument that many take so for granted. It gave me a new lease on my own attitude."},{"Title":"Piano Lessons: Music, Love, and True Adventures","review":"I truly enjoyed this book and I can relate to the travails of the year of lessons, conflicting obligations, and discouragement described in this well-written memoir because I started piano lessons in my mid-60s. I've always loved piano music and have wanted to play since I was a youth but, with two jobs during much of my life it was impossible. I started lessons in the same month that I retired from my primary job and I have worked at it (with a great deal of pleasure) during the years since then; but the first year was not easy.In my case, (and possibly in Noah's) I don't think that a mid-life crises was involved; it was just a matter of doing something new when the necessary resources became available.I think that it is inspiring to read about someone who has chosen to spend his/her later years doing something besides watching TV re-runs. Those who criticize should re-think their priorities."},{"Title":"Piano Lessons: Music, Love, and True Adventures","review":"I began my second round of piano lessons at age 37 last September, the first round abandoned at age 11 when my mother decided to stop shelling out the money if I refused to touch the piano all week between lessons. So I found much in this book to identify with. Though, unlike Adams, I didn't for a minute think a computer version would do much for me, I did understand his feelings about the piano: pull/repulsion. Something very powerful goes on for me in the relationship I feel with my piano (and piano teacher too). I want to keep trying, but I am flummoxed by my dimness frequently too, humbled by how hard it is to improve at some aspects of learning piano. Adams seemed to really express articulately these feelings I've been having. For every time he drew away and left off playing, I knew he would eventually return and try again. I also very much understand his persistence in playing a very difficult piece, &quot;Traumerei&quot; by Robert Schumann. Even when I know I'm presently very outmatched by a certain piece, my piano teacher knows enough to keep helping me plow through it because it speaks to something deep and compelled within me. I will keep coming back to the piece, even if I only get through a single measure, because I feel some connection to the work. I felt, reading Piano Lessons, that Adams' stubborn efforts, first to get somewhere with that computer program, and then to master various pieces at the piano itself, echo my own stubbornness in trying to improve my piano skill on my own terms. If you're just embarking on this adventure, or another similar adventure with another instrument or skill, what Noah Adams muses on has relevance to your own experiences too. Even if you are not, you can still enjoy a quick read related with humor and humility."},{"Title":"Piano Lessons: Music, Love, and True Adventures","review":"Reading this book is like sitting down with a cherished old friend (who happens to be wonderfully witty, sensitive, articulate, discerning, and capable of moving you to tears) to talk about why you yourself should run out and buy a piano in your middle age and spend lots of time every day falling in love with it, as well as with the process of learning something new and beautiful. It's also a book about a lot more than just learning an instrument: it's about pianos themselves (how they are constructed, how they are all different, and how they are all objects of substantial beauty), music of all kinds, and the people who love and make music in our world. Like Mr. Adams, I took up an instrument having never learned to play as a child (in my case, the violin) and found in this book a million new reasons to want to continue learning to play it. Nobody could fail to love this book on a possibly unlikely subject, and certainly no one could fail to fall in love with the man in the tuxedo playing for his wife on Christmas eve"},{"Title":"Piano Lessons: Music, Love, and True Adventures","review":"Like Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance this book isn't as much about Piano Lessons as it is a life lived during a period of the author's learning music as an adult.With a wife who is a journalist and the lessons being taken in the exciting times of the fall of communism in Europe and the Tiennanmen Square uprising in China, there is a burbling undercurrent of change against which the piano lessons, though halting, provide comfort.This is truly a beautiful story, you will resonate with the history, and I would be surprised if you don't cry when you get to the end."},{"Title":"To Catch a Thief","review":"They've restored this book to print again! Hallelujah! No longer do folks have to pay a king's ransom for a 17th paperback printing! Yessssss!"},{"Title":"The Revenge of Kali-Ra","review":"I was recently given a copy of THE REVENGE OF KALI-RA by a friend who thought I would enjoy it, knowing my fondness for Pulp fiction (and all things Pulp related).Being unfamiliar with the work of K.K. Beck, I added this novel to a precariously balanced stack of other books that had already accumulated in my bedroom that has come to called my \\"BOOKS TO BE READ...SOMEDAY\\" stack, figuring that I would get to it \\"eventually\\". But, every time I glanced at the mockingly large mound of books in the corner, the gaudy red book cover with the 30's heroine in peril on the top of the pile kept egging me on, \\"Pick me up and read me,\\" it said, \\"thrills, spills & chills are waiting for you beneath my tawdry red cover.\\"Finally, unable to ignore it's lure any longer, I picked up this book hesitantly, unsure what to expect from this intriguingly titled book by an author with whom I was completely unfamiliar...and am I glad that I did.This story revolves around a hot young Hollywood starlet who stumbles across a long out of print pulp novel written by a long forgotten 1920's hack by the name of Valerian Ricardo (Uncle Sid to his family back in MN). The starlet, Nadia Wentworth, decides that she must play the main character featured in a series of out of print books written by Ricardo about a femme fatale character called Kali-Ra, Queen of Doom (think Fu Manchu in a dress). Out of this simple premise follows a rollickingly good story about a flaky Hollywood starlet and her level-headed but put upon assistant, a hectoring old harridan of a widow clutching for control of her husbands memory, a drunken screenwriter being held against his will, a shady off-shore money man living in exile, a possible illegitimate child, a senile old crooner and his mountain of a chauffeur, a directionless great-great-grand-nephew from MN, and a mad dash to claim the copyright to the long forgotten, but now much in demand, writings of Valerian Ricardo. It all leads to a bevy of twists and turns, a few good laughs, and a very satisfying ending.This humorous, light-hearted send-up of Hollywood and the self-absorbed characters that live their may not be Shakespeare (or Hammett or Chandler for that matter), but if you're looking for a well told story and a memorable cast of characters, I can sincerely recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Revenge of Kali-Ra","review":"This is not a mystery in the traditional sense. In fact, the crime is committed surprisingly close to the end of the book (and don't be let down by the solution). The real focus here is the wild sendup of trashy pulp novels from the '20s-'40s, vulturous heirs, crazed cults, and modern-day Hollywood and the idiots and sleazeballs that surround it.Every character is memorable, as well as a loving parody of some cliche, celebrity, or character type. In disagreement with one of the below reviews, the fun of the book is that all the characters are one-dimensional types. The best mysteries are usually written that way (even Agatha Christie did it with &quot;And Then There Were None!&quot;), so that their one domating personality trait (often the one that makes them look guilty for one reason or another) can be emphasized and the story, which surrounds the murder, is not clogged up by character development. Sure, we all love books rich in character, but mysteries often shouldn't be that way. Some writers (like Sue Grafton) can pull it off, but for most of us, it's just fine. The one side of the characters we see are always uproarious, and the characters are very well-drawn: SSelf-absorbed, dumb Nadia; resourceful, studious Melanie; eager, giddy Nick; mysterious, sexual Callie; bitter, drunken Duncan; abrasive, demanding washed-up crooner Vince; hapless, loveless Quentin; sneaky, calculating Lila; and the list rolls on.....It's the most humorously well-written book I've read, too. The prose is laced with sour humor, even in simple descriptions of characters and items, and the dialogue is witty and vital. (And the pulp novel segments are great!) The pacing is fast and interesting, never slowing too much to lose interest. All the plots weave together quite nicely, and there's even an all-around happy ending that could only happen in Hollywood. By no means your conventional murder-mystery, and more resembling some wild satire along the lines of &quot;Soap,&quot; this book just screams &quot;MOVIE!&quot; This could easily be done with an obvious all-star cast; one's brain automatically fits celebrities into the roles with no trouble. A fun, light summer read, I picked it up one Sunday in July and had devoured it by Friday night. Tuck your cares away and read this book. you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Revenge of Kali-Ra","review":"I came accross my first k.k.beck book in a used book store.

Slightly different in style than her books set in the 1920's, Kali-Ra grabs you at the very beginning and I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"The Revenge of Kali-Ra","review":"Actress Nadia Wentworth, well-known for her popularity and anatomy, has found the role that she deeply believes she was born to play: the evil, eternal and gorgeous goddess Kali-Ra, of the now-forgotten, wildly popular pulp fiction series from the '20s. Little does Nadia know that by bringing Kali-Ra and her creator Valerian Ricardo back into the public eye, she'll be setting the stage for. . . a lot of people to come tramping into her life with demands!Nick Iverson, average guy with a philosophy degree, has just discovered he's Ricardo's heir. Or would be if Ricardo's wife, Lila were dead. Which she isn't. She's very much alive and trying to spread Valerian's &quot;message&quot; to the masses. But that won't benefit either of them monetarily as the book is public domain now and no one owns the rights.Or do they? It appears some heavy handed fat guy in a Speedo living in some foreign county not only has the rights, but he's sending his goons--a nervous lawyer and an aged lounge singer to be exact--to get his money.Into this mix, add one Doctor of Literature, who wrote his thesis on Valerian, one burnt-out script writer who just wants some peace and a good drink, a mysterious hot young thing named Callie, and Melanie, Nadia's manager and general dog's body--the only really sane one of the bunch. Stir in one murder, a missing security man and some cheesy pulp fiction and you've got The Revenge of Kali-Ra!In this tongue-in-cheek, laugh-out-loud novel, Beck manages, easily and credibly, to bring together all these bizarre and seemingly unrelated characters. The story generally flows well and employs a few twists and turns that would have made any pulp author proud. Over all, this is a fun, breezy book and well-worth a read."},{"Title":"The Revenge of Kali-Ra","review":"Actress Nadia Wentworth, a power in Hollywood, is bored with the on-location shoot of her current movie. An early arriving monsoon interrupts Nadia's filming on the South Pacific island of Boola Lau. Nadia's assistant, Melanie Oakley, finds several books to occupy her employer's time. Normally, Nadia never reads a novel. However, a particularly weird sounding title, \\"The Wrath of KALI-RA\\" by a deceased novelist Valerian Ricardo, captures her attention. Nadia decides that the story would be the perfect vehicle for her next movie.In spite of the fact that Ricardo has been dead for years, several individuals descend on Nadia's mansion for a piece of the pie. Ricardo's alleged wife Lila manages to work her way intoNadia's inner sanctum. Ricardo's great-nephew Nick Iverson arrives with a girl friend Callie Cunningham whom he actually just met. Both have a strong interest in Ricardo and his KALI-RA series. A gangster on a Caribbean island seemingly owns the rights through the Uruguay Round agreement. Also arriving at the mansion is Professor Glen Pendergast, who has written the ultimate (and only) book on the works of Ricardo. This cast of characters soon has a mystery to solve as someone is trying to kill Nadia for defiling KALI-RA.Anyone who has read a K.K. Beck novel (see WE INTERRUPT THIS BROADCAST) knows that the story line will be irreverent, jocular, and absolutely entertaining. THE REVENGE OF KALI-RA is no exception as the novel provides an interesting, humorous, and fun reading experience. The characters are warm and though it is an ensemble of several players, the awesome author appealingly brings them together. This is another wonderfully witty work by a master of the beguiling tale.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Revenge of Kali-Ra","review":"I saw the cover of this book and smiled. I used to read Fu Manchu novels and the mysteries of Seabury Quinn when I was a teenager (and this was in the 1970s!) and loved all the trappings of ersatz Asian occultism and the army of thugs and dacoits armed with daggers and blowpipes with poison darts. But Beck's novel is not about those writers' creations nor is it a very good parody of what it attempts to poke fun at. Donald Westlake is far funnier at the comic crime novel, so is Carl Hiassen. They know their worlds. Beck seems to have done some cursory research (certainly Rohmer's series is evident as well as references to Haggard's Allan Quartermain and She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed) but there's more contempt for the genre than any real love of the pulps. And any true parodist really loves the subject he's sending up and doesn't use that subject as a target of moralizing. Beck seems to be one of the writers who jumped on the bandwagon of the popular comic crime novel because, at this time, it's a moneymaking genre. Her characters are lifted out of the realm of cliche (the bimbo starlet; the failed lawyer with an equally failed love life; the alcoholic, sex-starved screenwriter; etc. etc.) and can be found in any number of ho-hum popular crime novel writers' books. Finally, had I bothered to read the whole blurb I would've learned this book was more about moviemaking (a topic I loathe) and the moronic minds in Hollywood and I would've avoided it completely. I stayed for the pastiche of pulp writing which IS funny and right on the mark. Overall, this is pretty run-of-the-mill. But for anyone who lingered over the pages of a real trashy pulp thriller from the 30s or 40s, craving the action and melodrama of the evil East battling the righteous West, it might be worth a read."},{"Title":"Witness For The Dead","review":"This book is boring I did not like it even a little..

Fredrickson pioneers a new genre of fiction- a combination of super crime novel and a guide to regional cusine, Sicilian, in this case.You can't think of this book without a reference to food, so I'd say it's like great meal with great company.The plot moves with balance and rhythm from course to course, never hurried, never dawdling. Fredrickson is as unusual a prose stylist as he is a plot designer and so the words themselves provide rich spectrum of textures, tastes, and humorous surprises.As for company, the key characters are literally unforgettable. Each is an interesting individual, yet recognizable as a participant in the rich anthropological stew that is modern Boston.You won't want to put it down, but you won't want it to end.Two final notes.

A very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Frommer's(r) Irreverent Guide to New Orleans, 4th Edition","review":"This isn't one of those exhaustive travel books that tells you everything there is to know about a place. Instead, the authors selectively present everything you actually need to know. The dining section was particularly helpful. It wasn't an exhaustive list of restaurants, but it did give you a choice of a few places in each category. The authors were also good about pointing out where the locals go and warning you about the places that are for tourists only. Even better, they distinguish between the tourist places that are all hype and those that are still worth seeing. The maps were helpful, and the book is small enough to fit into a purse or pocket.

What remains is a very bulky, entertaining though not earth shattering book. After his \\"histories\\" of Salisbury, London and Russia he has now chosen the Forest, an extensive woodland area south of Salisbury. The book is well written and reads fast despite its 800+ pages.The book starts in 1099, when King Rufus is killed during a hunt in his royal Forest. Edward Rutherfurd gives an alternative description of this killing. In this first chapter the author is quite keen on venting facts: a bit boring and interruptive to the story. Luckily this is less so in the remaining 6 stories which describe such events as the life in a medieval monastery, the Spanish Armada, a witch process, the time of the Puritans, the business of the smugglers which have always been active on the southern shores of England, and finally the way in which the Forest became a national protected area. I look forward to reading his next novel on Dublin..."},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"I HAD PREVIOUSLY READ 'SARUM', 'LONDON' AND 'RUSSKA' AND I HAVE JUST FINISHED READED 'THE FOREST'.

There are several families whose lives become woven together and a location that changes and yet remains the same. Each story in the book could stand on its own and yet read together, you feel as if you have watched time develop and change.The characters are of all ages and sizes have unique personalities, and the author uses their different perspectives to tell the stories. The background of each character is given in a way to not detract from the plot and yet it ties the individual stories together.I particularly liked that the author also took the time to describe the Forest itself and its flora and fauna. This really helped pull me into what I felt was the purpose of this book - the love for a group of people to a certain place.I cannot image the research it took to write of so many time periods and to do it so well. If you like a grand story and historical fiction, I greatly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"I't obvious from Rutherford's earlier works what he feels passionate about... and &quot;London&quot; ain't it, although it's a great book, too.In &quot;Sarum&quot;, his first book, he is personally involved with the landscape of what he writes about (as he was born and raised there), and in &quot;Russka&quot; (his second) it is obvious he has a passion for the Russian people. Later, in &quot;London&quot; it seems as though he feels compelled to write about this colorful city, but has no real passion for the place, as he borrows from previously published works (as he does with &quot;Russka&quot;- but with a preordained zeal that one must have to really write about the area in question.)In &quot;The Forest&quot;, Rutherfurd once again captures the passion he once held as an historical fictionist in &quot;Sarum&quot;, and places himself foremost among the &quot;greats&quot; of historical literature. &quot;The Forest&quot; is full of original characters and complex motives, together with original plots and great stories.Apparent as with all other Rutherfurd works is the detailed family tree at the begining of the book, as well as informtive maps as to the region.Readers of historical fiction will find this book to be Rutherfurd at his high peak of form. It is engrossing, addictive and entertaining.Highly recommended! Two thumbs up!"},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"Spanning centuries of British history, The Forest keeps the reader engrossed with the lives and emotions of its characters. Not only does Rutherfurd offer a continuing saga of the various families who inhabit the area, but also a natural history, detailing the behavior of the deer and the cycle of the trees, which form a constant backdrop for the human drama. The author's command of the language and of interesting tidbits of knowledge, such as the process of charcoal production, make this a very satisfying read. It was a great book to settle in with for the summer."},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"Rutherfurd's style makes English history come alive for me!

It's a less dramatic tale. But it does involve the reader in Rutherfurd's usual style of tracking multi-family histories. I'd say it's a good, but not great, read."},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"This was my favorite Rutherfurd novel. I enjoyed the characters even more than in the previous books, and there seemed to be more depth to the stories. I often find myself reading additional books to learn more about a person or event that intrigues me when I am done reading one of Rutherford's books, and after reading \\"The Forest\\" I re-read Jane Austin because of the memories stirred up by one section of the book. Of special interest in \\"The Forest\\" also are wonderful stories about how the royal forests were developed and managed, village smugglers and revenue agents, and the effects of machines and steam engines on the development of rural England. I had a lot of fun reading this book, and learned a lot too."},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"Another intriguing novel by Edward Rutherfurd Through the eyes of the ancient forest near Bath, Rutherfurd takes us through the generations, exploring the great conflicts in English history such as Norman vs. Saxon, Merchant vs. Nobleman, Catholic vs. Protestant, Royalist vs. Cromwellian and Industrialist vs. Conservationist.He does this through sympathetically tracing the lives people down the generations of seven families: The Albions, the Martells, the Prides, the Seagulls, the Puckles, the Furzeys and the Grockletons.We read about waxing and waning fortunes and about ongoing family feuds, but always the main interest is through the people themselves of who's trials and tribulations we read about: The experiences of a young Norman noblewoman, Adela De La Roche in \`The Hunt', the Monk, Brother Adam, struggling with the love of a woman, Mary Furzey, in Beuleau. The tragic tale of Alice Lisle, caught up in the political turbulence of the 17 th.

I recommend the Forest to anyone who is a fan of Michener, and to anyone who loves to get lost in great stories."},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"In this book the author has taken the existence of the Crown Forest in Central South England and has used it as his background to present different lifes throughout England's history and how they are all interconnected through because of this Forest.The description of the scenery and the people, all faithfully following history is very interesting. The stories are fun and easy to read and keep you interested in thier individual plots. I also really enjoyed the description of the Forest in itself, all the lives that are connected to trees: insects, etc.This is certainly the result of some incredible research and I congratulate the author on his book. Good read."},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"&quot;The Forest&quot; offers the reader bulk without satisfaction. Like Michener's before him, Rutherfurd's books have become formulaic. His technique is to string a series short tales upon the thread of the history of a common locus -- in this case the &quot;New Forest&quot; in SW England. Perhaps because we are familiar with the formula, it becomes easier to be critical of the components.His tracing of certain physical and intellectual chracter- istics down through the generations of the families that figure in &quot;The Forest&quot; stikes me as clumsier and more objectionable than when he did the same thing in &quot;Sarum&quot; or &quot;London&quot;. Must the Grockletons forever be claw-handed and clench-minded and the Prides always fast-walking, fairminded and upstanding? It beggars belief. The gentry seems to play a more central roll -- or is it just a more boring roll? -- in &quot;The Forest&quot; than in earlier Rutherfurd books. In the &quot;Albion Park&quot; story we are asked to believe that a wealthy young gentlewomen in Georgian Bath would be brought to trial for stealing a piece of lace and worry that she will be transported because she is too lovelorn to defend herself. As that story ends, the aristocratic, remote, intellecutal man she has married rises in the night and pens a &quot;confession&quot; to her. We learn at the end of the book that it was only a love letter. Maybe the Brontes could have carried it off, but Rutherfurd can't. I also found Rutherfurd's coy toying with the theme of witchcraft in the New Forest uninformed. At time of the Conquest, where the book begins, many of the inhabitants of the New Forest probably belonged to pre-Christian religions. In Rutherurd's forest you are either a christian or a witch."},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. I enjoyed Sarum a little more because I thought he got you closer to the characters. The history was extended back further in Sarum, also. This book however was very interesting from the point of view of each time that the people lived. I enjoyed hearing about their customs and their class structure. It was fun to see how they managed their daily lives too.It could almost be a survival manual. They hung the meat in the chimney to keep the flies off of it. How neat. I do hope that he has another book in the works since I can't wait..."},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"I like this sort of really big book with lots of historical flavor, but of all Rutherfords books only &quot;Russka&quot; was worse. Both &quot;London&quot; and &quot;Sarum&quot; started much earlier in time and this gave the books a more satisfying sense of time and continuity. The different types and classes of people are well covered and interesting. It is not possible in a book like this to give each story a lot of depth but that is to be expected. Still I wish they had been less predictable."},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"I read 'The Forest' because one of the places mentioned in the book is my home town, Ringwood. I enjoyed the author's first historical fiction, 'Sarum', but couldn't finish 'London' because of the sloppy writing and editing. 'The Forest' is another disappointment. He is now writing to formula and getting very lazy. All his research ends up in the story whether it relevant or not. It disrupts the narrative, which is poor at best. The characterisation is weak, the plot lacks tension and the section on the thoughts of the deer is laughable. An opportunity to write an exciting and interesting novel about a beautiful area has been missed."},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"I very much enjoy the Saga genre. I have read most of the titles by James Michener, as well as, Mr.Rutherfurd's Sarum, and Russka, I enjoy the history of the families and the landscape descriptions, even though I have to turn to the geneology chart and maps frequently. The Princes of Ireland and The Rebels of Ireland are shipping at present."},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"... in the style of London and Sarum. Will begin reading Russka later this summer. I write this review in the hope that the author will read this. Being somewhat of a Francophile, I hope one of his next efforts might be centered somewhere in France, perhaps Paris or an alternative region."},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"There are several ways to write an historical novel; you could pick a famous figure and provide a narrative for their life, or you could create a fictional character and involve them in a famous historical event. Or you could do what Edward Rutherford does, and make up a series of stories based around an historical city, landscape or country. It is what he has done in previous novels, such as London andSarum: The Novel of England(his most famous works), continuing the trend in \\"The Forest\\". Stretching from 1099 to 2000, the novel incorporates elements such as the assassination of King William Rufus, the threat of the Spanish Armada, the trial of Alice Lisle, the Protestant Reformation and the saving of the New Forest from development.The novel is incredibly dense, following the ancestry of several families throughout the time periods (the noble Albions, the cheerful Prides, the cunning Furzeys, the charismatic Martells and the mysterious woodland Puckles) and several components are placed in the earlier stories which are discovered by descendants as time goes on (such as an engraved letter on a monastery wall, a tree planted by a fugitive and a family heirloom passed down throughout the ages). As is to be expected, some of the stories are more interesting than others, and there is plenty of historical detail throughout which (given Rutherford's background) is presumably both accurate and fascinating. Maps of the area and a genealogy of the families involved, as well as a preface that mentions some of the sources are included.\\"The Hunt\\" concerns the mysterious death of King Rufus, as told predominantly through the point of view of Lady Adela, a young noble woman on the hunt for a husband. Unfortunately, because the details on the death of the King are sketchy, Rutherford leaves much of the story ambiguous and several subplots uncompleted. However, the story fares better in \\"Beaulieu\\" in which a monastery monk finds love with a married woman when investigating an attack on one of the brothers.Unfortunately, there's another slip in quality with \\"Lymington\\", a story that involves the estranged relationship between a man and his young son, and the boat race that brings them together, yet Rutherford makes up for this with \\"The Armada Tree\\" and \\"Alice\\", two stories set in the reigns of Queen Elizabeth and Oliver Cromwell, and with plenty of political intrigue connected to these eras to keep things tense. The trend continues into \\"Albion Park\\", in which young Fanny Albion discovers her heritage, searches for a husband and is accused of a crime (apparently based on a real accusation made against Jane Austen's aunt) in the upper-class society of late 18th century Bath.Finally, \\"Pride of the Forest\\" deals with the philandering, but surprisingly likeable Minimus Furzey and his attempts to save the Forest from development; furthermore, the novel is framed by the contemporary journey of Dottie Pride and her research into the history of the Forest. These however are just brief outlines of the main storylines, there are subplots that concern love affairs, stolen ponies, smuggling, practical jokes and other aspects of day to day life of past time periods.The major issue I had with the novel was Rutherford's technique of conveying historical information. Rather than integrating it within the narrative, Rutherford uses long paragraphs of exposition to explain to the reader what's going on, a technique that is glaringly at odds with the storytelling. This is particularly obvious considering the author usually uses past tense for the narrative, and present tense for the explanations, which effectively pulls the reader out of the story as they digest the info-dump. It doesn't help matters that Rutherford uses contemporary language to explain much of the historical detail, for example, when describing the life-cycle of trees the words \\"chlorophyll\\" and \\"mycelium\\" are used, words that stick out like a sore thumb in the time period in which they appear.Because there are so many of these expository segments (which are often not particularly interesting or relevant, such as the aforementioned tree, and the mating habits of deer) the story can often drag. Several times I skim-read, or even page-skipped these sections, which in all honesty, don't really add much to the flow of the story. Rutherford is obviously passionate about the subject material, but I can't help but feel (judging by this book alone) that he could use some work at incorporating his research within the context of an actual story."},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"This is an extremely rich body of work. I hesitate to say 'novel' since there are eight parts to this book of equal stature. Is it then a collection of novellas? Well, no not quite, since all of these stories have a tendency to refer to each other. For instance, there is the little wooden cross that is handed down the generations of families whose paths we follow. Of no great monetary value in itself, this ornament, whose origin is more or less forgotten, still signifies a great deal to whomever happens to be wearing it at the time. The author concentrates his attention of a handful of fictional families, from the Albions of the gentry, to the coarser tribe of Seagulls. The one great thing which binds all these families is the New Forest. The author takes great pains to also bring the forest alive, from the mighty oak, to the fallow deer. Anyone who's in love with English history will find much richness here. What the author has done is to realise a great empathy for the English peoples of the last thousand years, and even beyond, if you include the Prehistory of the Saxon Prides. Also mentioned are modern day forest disputes, which are rooted in the past.The prose is light and easy to follow. The author has a few old storyteller tricks here: such as employing loose ends. A character will do something in one story that will resound greatly in another. Those who dislike such loose fragments left unresolved will be relieved to find that this author is extremely tidy. However, I did spot a few typos, but these hardly spoil the impact of such great tales. This author is also very aware of the literary conventions concerning the historical periods of which he writes. You groan when the section set in Beaulieu Abbey starts off with the murder of a monk, and suspect that Cadfael is not far behind with his herbal remedies. However, the author is very clever here, for he plays delightfully with your expectations - he does not provide mere homage to the past - he always brings something new and unique to such fictions. The tale of 'Albion Park' is very much Jane Austen, and as the author admits, he derived this story from something which really happened to Austen's aunt at Bath. The heroine, like that of 'Mansfield Park', is called Fanny. During the latter parts of the book, we also get a delicious portrait of a Victorian Pre-Raphaelite artist, who is inspired by the forest of his ancestors. But all is not sweetness and light: perhaps the grimmest chapter features the plight of Alice Lisle, caught within Judge Jeffries' notorious Assizes. There are accounts of famous rebels, such as Penruddock and Monmouth: the author really does bring the history alive. He reveals how place names and surnames change over time, due to historical events.However, there was one family that I was particularly interested in concerning this novel, but whom I found to be only obliquely mentioned: the Rutherfurds. I first became intrigued because of the peculiar spelling - trying to search for this author's surname in online bookshop search boxes provides a variety, so much so that it's highly tempting to believe that the internet will have impact on this ancient name. Rutherfurd begins his novel by going back just under a thousand years to the murder of King William 'Rufus' (so-named because he had red hair). 'Ruther' is also derived from the Celtic word for 'red'. One of the stories concerning the origins of the Rutherfurd name is that it relates to a ford. The Rutherfords first seem to appear around this era as inhabitants of the Scottish borders. There is an account of them beating back an invading English force across a ford before the time of William Wallace, and it's romantic to believe that the name could derive from this incident. Is it just a coincidence that Walter Tyrell has a ford named after him in the New Forest (as Rutherfurd writes in the opening novella), due to his flight after the death of Rufus?Rutherford also briefly mentions Wallace, and the Scottish Rutherfords certainly fought for him and Robert the Bruce against the English. Rutherfurd writes of the protestant dissenters: Samuel Rutherfurd may have been one such historical ancestor. There is also a strong branch of Rutherfurds in America, possibly related to the Pilgrim Fathers or others like them. Certainly the American heiress Consuelo Vanderbilt had a distant relation to the Rutherfurds, and may even have been in love with Winthrop Rutherfurd before she married the Duke of Marlborough, whose Blenheim Palace is mentioned in the novel (along with, I think I recall, a cheeky comment about the Marlboroughs marrying into the best families). Sir Walter Scott was related to a branch of Rutherfurds, one of whom is mentioned in his 'The Bride of Lammermoor'. However, all this might be baloney or coincidence, except for one thing: Edward Rutherfurd keeps mentioning the Royal Navy ship, the Swiftsure, which was at the battle of Trafalgar as part of Nelson's forces: it's captain? - Why, none other than William Gordon Rutherfurd! I therefore think that the author has derived a great deal from a rich family history, as his characters do also."},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"Having read all of the authers works, I am not suprised by the wonderful depth of this one. Sarum used to be my favorite book now the forest has surpassed it in my mind. Of course I recomend it to everyone!"},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"It's been slow going with 'The Forest', but some of it could be intentional. Edward Rutherfurd's latest offering is truly something to read and savor. This book (there's no other way to describe it) is composed of eight stories (and an epilouge) that vary in length and follow generations of families--everyone from gentry to poor commoners who've been on the land since the beginning.Contrary to some of his other work, I was captivated in all of the stories. Most are no more than 50 or 60 pages long, so the form of the plot is quick-paced and literal. Longer stories (the longest being 'Albion Park') cover larger blocks of time and can be excruciatingly slow. You keep waiting to come upon some action, while Rutherfurd is sweetly biding his time with his wonderful descriptions. However, if you try to hurry through any of the stories, you'll find yourself lost and confused because you missed a precious detail.Rutherfurd's storytelling is unmatched. The climax of the plot can fill your stomach with butterflies. He also manages to skirt the &quot;big&quot; events in England's history, never directly putting his characters in a traumatic and dramatic period. (The closest he comes is the Spanish Armada.) He effectively describes everyday life for people and animals of the New Forest.'The Forest' is most similar to 'Russka: The Story of Russia' to me. Both use a more saga-like form, careful to show the outcomes of the families as well as the setting. It is also the only English book of his I've been able to read (I couldn't bear trudging through 'London', which has been prasied as his best work).I would recommend this book to anyone who likes Rutherfurd's work or is interested in a historical fiction/saga-like epic."},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"I very much enjoyed Rutherfurd's latest work, but find he is relying more and more on formula rather than strong character development. In his previous books, the locale has played a strong role in the book, as the history of a city and the buildings in it has been woven into the narrative; unfortunately, the changes within the New Forest over time are less concrete and so some richness is lost. One thing missing in this book that I enjoyed in his other works was watching the rise and ebb of family fortunes; in this book, the gentry more or less stay gentry and the yeomanry stay yeomanry throughout the book, which stretches credibility. Rutherfurd needs to develop the individual characters a little more and to allow the families to evolve through time, rather than establishing a few immutable family characteristics and overrelying on them. Still, his work is well-researched and quite entertaining--the reader comes away with a little knowledge about history as a bonus. As much as I love English history, I'm hoping he'll move on to a different area next time, which might inject a little more freshness into his work."},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"Sarum was fabulous, London was fascinating, even Russka was interesting... but enough already! It's not that The Forest is a bad book. It's quite good, if you've never read another Rutherfurd book. It's just that it's like every other Rutherfurd book, which is getting a little monotonous. The families have physical or psychological attributes that carry on down through the millenia as if no other bloodlines ever come into the picture. It also seems like Rutherfurd is running out of interesting plots. The chapter Albion Park is simply a take off on Jane Austen (Mansfield Park?)and not a particularly good one. (&quot;It was no doubt part of the divine plan that, having been endowed with an insatiable desire to rise in society, Mrs. Grockleton had also been created absent-minded.&quot;) Despite all of this it was interesting to learn about the New Forest, an area with which I am unfamiliar. I only hope the author will try to be a bit more creative in his next book."},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"Having read &quot;Russka,&quot; &quot;Sarum,&quot; and &quot;London,&quot; I couldn't wait to get my hands on Rutherfurd's latest, &quot;The Forest.&quot; But it just didn't measure up to the author's previous endeavours. For one thing, it is far, far shorter, and I felt that either it didn't do justice to the full history of the New Forest, or perhaps the author ought to have chosen a more historically deep setting. Starting in 1099 seemed like a sell-out, after his previous novels, which often began several thousand years ago. For another, I agree with one reader who said that Rutherfurd was going formula on us. Though it is a genre, it seems that his techniques -- for example, in distinguishing members of a same family -- are all too familiar. However, &quot;The Forest&quot; is still a good read, and perhaps standing alone, it would rate 4 or 5 stars. But in comparison to &quot;London,&quot; for example, &quot;The Forest&quot; just doesn't rate..."},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"&quot;The New Forest,&quot; set aside as a royal game preserve (or to be more accurate, as a royal deer farm) by William the Conqueror, comes to life through six of the families inhabiting it in Edward Rutherfurd's fourth novel. Opening and closing with a framing story set in 2000, the book's seven intervening chapters span the years from 1099 until then. Each chapter is a self-contained tale that covers a generation or two, telling the lives of the principal families - and the changes that time, technology, and politics bring to their beloved Forest.I'm fascinated, after finishing this book, to go back to its preface and discover that the Austen-like feel of &quot;Albion Park&quot; may be partly due to the author's use of a real-life incident to craft its turning point. That incident, it seems, happened to Jane Austen's aunt! Both &quot;Albion Park&quot; and the chapter following it, &quot;Pride of the Forest,&quot; show Rutherfurd's characters acting within the tight cultural boundaries of their time and place - and yet, like Austen's people, they manage to transcend those boundaries. To show themselves fully, and timelessly - *human.* Even the women!After reading all four of Rutherfurd's novels, I don't hesitate to call this one his best. My one criticism is that I found the end of its framing story something of an anticlimax. However, that's nowhere near sufficient to keep me from giving it the top rating it otherwise richly deserves."},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"As I neared the end of \\"The Forest\\", a sadness moved over me as I realized that the wonderful journey through time in the forest was coming to an end. This is not just a book, it is an adventure into moments in history in a region of England not often covered. Rutherford has perfected the ability to tell stories of ancestry while incorporating beautifully described periods of English history into his tales. There are chapters in this book that are profound. The story of Alice, her heirs and ancestors, is a personal favorite. However, each chapter brings new twists and complications to the evolving families.For me,\\"Sarum\\" is still my favorite of Rutherfor's books but \\"The Forest\\" is very close. It is another brilliant effort and worthy of the highest praise."},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"Edward Rutherfurd has done it again: take a location and describe crucial episodes in its history using the fictitious characters of a few local families through the ages. What remains is a very bulky, entertaining though not earth shattering book. After his \\"histories\\" of Salisbury, London and Russia he has now chosen the Forest, an extensive woodland area south of Salisbury. The book is well written and reads fast despite its 800+ pages.The book starts in 1099, when King Rufus is killed during a hunt in his royal Forest. Edward Rutherfurd gives an alternative description of this killing. In this first chapter the author is quite keen on venting facts: a bit boring and interruptive to the story. Luckily this is less so in the remaining 6 stories which describe such events as the life in a medieval monastery, the Spanish Armada, a witch process, the time of the Puritans, the business of the smugglers which have always been active on the southern shores of England, and finally the way in which the Forest became a national protected area. I look forward to reading his next novel on Dublin..."},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"The forest is a novel in the tradition of James Michener. It takes the reader through a vast sweep of time, yet connects intimately with the folk who dwell in the forest's environs. I highly recommend Edward Rutherfurd to anyone interested in historical novels."},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"Well up to the usual high standard, an absorbing read, the only down side is I have now read all the series.

This is a collection of short stories that are inter-related, so they have some relavance to a prior story. Very enjoyable!"},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"This book I loved by Edward Rutherford. He tells an excellent story surrounded by that period of history I am interested in."},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"This tome is advertised as a companion piece to the earlier Rutherfurd novel, Sarum, and it is just that. Whereas Sarum dealt primarily with the more urbanized area in and around Salisbury, The Forest deals with the adjacent rural area encompassed by the King's Forest.Very similar in style and scope to other Rutherfurd works, it is still my opinion that his best work remains Russka. Perhaps due to having read roughly half a dozen of Rutherfurd's novels, I'm beginning to appreciate them less and less. \\"Familiarity breeds contempt.\\" I've run into some of the same thing in Clancy and Michener (and more keenly with Cirque du Soliel) where I found that their later works were less satisfying than earlier efforts. Perhaps this is more an issue pertaining to the reader than the author.If The Forest were the first Rutherfurd work I ever read, perhaps it would be my favorite, who knows. In any event, The Forest is an entertaining and reliable read. It is pure Rutherfurd, and if you enjoyed other works by that author, you will not be disappointed, but will not likely be bowled over."},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"I was a little wary the first time I picked up this book. I was hooked just a few pages in, and finished the entire novel in less than a week, thirsting for more. Rutherford does a great job of making you care and love (or loathe) his characters. A must for anyone who enjoys reading."},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"I thought this book would be disappointing, but I couldn't put it down. For everyone who loves historical genre."},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"Another thoroughly enjoyable historical voyage by Rutherfurd. While I personally find Rutherfurd less engaging than Michener, he gives a vivid portrayal of the place and the people that make it up. I have some trouble with his anthropomorphic depictions of deer and trees. However, the archetypical families, which evolve through what amounts to several novellas, make a very satisfying read."},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"What can be better than to have a long train ride and have a huge, highly entertaining book to read. Mr. Rutherford has not let me down yet. As much as I loved Sarum and London that's how much I absolutely love The Forest. In every book he focuses on a few families and takes us up through history with them and you wonder about the origins of your own family."},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"I've just finished reading this wonderful book and feel as though I've just gorged myself on the whole of a very large block of chocolate--sated but VERY satisfied ! The story of The Forest begins shortly after the closure of these acres by William the Conqueror ,to create a natural hunting reserve for the benefit of himself and the nobles of his court. The saga continues through the major periods of English history and involves both the more aristocratic of the forests inhabitants as well as the local peasantry.The family lines of both of these classes of the forests inhabitants,weave their ways down through the years, occasionally intertwining and always maintaining the forest as an entity in it's own right. This is a fascinating glimpse of history through the ages and an equally fascinating look at the lives and customs of the forest dwellers over the centuries. Can't wait for Mr.Rutherfurds next offering , &quot;Dublin&quot;."},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"If you want a good summer read by all means pick up Edward Rutherfurd's the Forest. It is by no means a heavy read but a solid enjoyable romp through history. There are loads of details, lots of twists and enough interesting characters to keep you moving along at a brisk pace."},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"I am generally fond of this author's novels but for some reason I just wasn't able to get far into The Forest. The setting seemed sound, the stories seemed good, his descriptions of the vast, vibrant forest and its creatures were interesting, but underneath everything there was a plodding drabness in the tales themselves that didn't grab my interest the way Sarum and London did. Maybe someday I'll finish The Forest but after nearly a decade it's still sitting on my shelf with the same bookmark where I left it about a third of the way in."},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"In one of his stronger efforts, Edward Rutherfurd sets his historical fiction in the New Forest of southern England. The New Forest in Hampshire, England was originally commandeered in 1079 as a deer hunting area by the king, William the Conqueror.Rutherfurd tells the history of the area from William's establishment of the royal forest to modern times through the fortunes of half a dozen families. Special laws, courts, offices and traditions developed over the centuries whereby commoners gained certain limited rights to use of the forest.Vintage Rutherfurd. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"I've read Sarum, Russka, London, and now The Forest. Although Sarum is still my favorite, I have thoroughly enjoyed The Forest.

I highly recommend The Forest, as well as his other works."},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"I have to say that I am sad that Edward Rutherford hasn't written more. This book immerses you into the life of the forest throughout its history. The writing is so vivid that you almost feel as if you were there throughout these times. If Mr. Rutherford reads this I can only say: write more please!"},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"I've read Edward Rutherfurd before and was mightily impressed with that previous tome. This one, while still meticulously researched, was just not quite as good. It still had a lot of details, but unfortunately it also had a lot of chances for allowing the reader to get lost in those details.The Forest deals with a period of almost a thousand years in the history of the New Forest of England. Through these times, Rutherfurd weaves the tale of several inhabitants of the area and their descendants. The Pride family, and the Albions, in particular saw a lot of time in the book with different branches of their family appearing quite often through the different ages. It also explored the different ways that the people lived in each of these eras and the feuds that were sometimes between families carried down as an intense dislike for certain names. But the book too was about the actual Forest and how it was preserved and taken up through the different times. Always a preserve it showed how people desired a piece of it.None of the family lines particularly jumped out at me. Well, none of the human lines that is. In the first part there was a story about some deer and I was deeply disappointed to see that it wasn't continued throughout the whole novel. I thought it would have added a nice contrast to the continuing stories of the human elements. There was quite a detail provided about certain families, but with the exception of a few I was a bit muddled on how the names changed and who was actually related to who as the years passed. There were some like the Pride's that were clearly there from the beginning. But others, while I know there was something I missed, I just couldn't figure out which line of family they were descended from.The whole novel was a bit confusing with all the detail. Which it was rich and obviously well researched, it was also very tedious to read. Rutherfurd's previous works, while having the same amount of detail, did not have nearly that much confusion associated with them. Most of the aspects were interesting and some time periods were definitely more enchanting to read than others. I especially liked the earlier periods of history within the book.Not one of his better ones but still an interesting to read. I like Sarum more, but if you like historical fiction that rings with truth, this would probably be right up your alley.The ForestCopyright 2005784 pagesReview by M.

If you've read any other Rutherford novels, you'll be familiar with his storytelling methods, and those methods remain true in this novel.

It was an interesting read, but, in the end...I think I'm over Rutherford and his style."},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"A writer must be talented when you are loathe to see their work end after nearly 800 pages, and Rutherfurd is both a talented writer and a fine storyteller.

In between we come to know several families and their ongoing stories. One chapter, 'Albion House', seems to be a conscious homage to Jane Austen's 'Pride and Prejudice' (with a smattering of Daphne Du Maurier) and is an especially wonderful story.Comparisons to James Michener are valid, and if you enjoy one author's work you will most likely enjoy the other's."},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"Gave an excellent picture of &quot;The Forest&quot; but it seems that the author got tired about 3/4s of the way through and then found his 2nd wind for the final sprint."},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"A very very tough read.

Even tho he did not originate this type of novel, I personally feel he is the best at writing them for 2 reasons: 1) Instead of dealing with a very large area (Hawaii, South Africa, etc) as Michener does, Rutherfurd picks a small geographical area such as London or England's New Forest. This makes the focus of the story more manageable. 2) Rutherfurd is much better at characterisation &amp; plot developement than Michener.&quot;The Forest&quot; is Rutherfurd's latest 1000 year geographical epic, &amp; altho not his best work, is eminently readable. Unlike his previous (&amp; better) work, &quot;London&quot;, &quot;The Forest&quot; deals with an area few people outside of the UK will be familiar with. This of course means the historical events he fictionalises will also be unfamiliar to the average American reader, thus adding some freshness to tales of Cavaliers vs. Roundheads, peasants relating to their feudal lords etc. In the chapter entitled &quot;Albion Park&quot; Rutherfurd even tries to adapt Jane Austen's &quot;Pride &amp; Prejudice&quot; to his multi-generational narrative!Does it work? For the most part, yes. Rutherfurd's novels are an excellent way for a reader to get a handle on history, &amp; he makes large events personal to the reader. My main problem with his writings is his tendency to make family members thru the generations have the same appearance &amp; mannerisms over hundreds of years. They never seem to inherit anything from their mothers; a Furzey is a Furzey whether in the 11th or the 19th century. This seems especially strange in &quot;The Forest&quot; as he has the same families marrying each other for the entire book without ever starting to share characteristics! I assume this is the author's way of making a protagonist instantly identifiable &amp; not confusing the reader with too many different people to keep track of. The other fault I found with &quot;The Forest&quot; was starting the story at the end of the 11th century. Although the Roman period &amp; Anglo-Saxon eras are mentioned, there is no narrative covering them as there was in &quot;London&quot;. Personally, I would have welcomed the inclusion.If not quite as good as &quot;London&quot;, fans of Edward Rutherfurd will not be disappointed with &quot;The Forest&quot;."},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"A novel that spans a period of 1000 years in a small region of England? The premise sounded original and I was willing to rely on my love of history carrying me through. And you know what? I got more that I expected out of this book.Having not read any other titles by Rutherfurd, I had no previous experience of his style and though curiosity led me at first, I was soon hooked.Following the fortunes of six families through the years, most notably the Albions, Rutherfurd not only relates a series of great stories, he also tells the history and politics of England's New Forest, and the life of its deer and famous oaks.The characterisation is strong, both heros and heroines are well drawn, from the Norman noblewoman Adela de la Roche to the mysterious Puckle and his many equally mysterious descendents.All in all, a pretty damn good book. The chapter 'Albion Park' left me with a craving for Jane Austen again and as a whole leaving me with a strong inclination to read some more of Edward Rutherfurd's work some time soon."},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"Well, Edward Rutherfurd has done it again! Somehow, he is able to take an area of land and give us a history lesson about it--without boring us to death. He also has an incredible talent for covering a large span of time, yet he is still able to be detailed in his telling and make us care about his characters. &quot;The Forest&quot; is no exception. He teaches us English history while giving us stories that intertwine throughout the timeline. We learn the background of both obscure and well-known relics, and are shown ways that people earned their surnames. One of the things I really appreciate about this author is that he's realistic--sometimes the good guys don't win, and every once in a while, a bad guy gets away with an evil deed. Be sure though, that in Rutherfurd's books, the ancestors will pay! If you liked &quot;Sarum&quot; and &quot;London,&quot; be sure that you won't be disappointed with this one. I don't often buy hardback books, but I was confident that Edward Rutherfurd wouldn't let me down, and he didn't."},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"I've read all Rutherford's books, starting with the wonderful &quot;Sarum&quot; and &quot;Russka,&quot; then &quot;London&quot; (which seemed to me to be interesting but slightly stale) and, now, &quot;The Forest.&quot; I suspect he's written too much, too quickly, because he uses the identical plot devices for each of his novels but the originalty of his stories is now beginning to suffer.In each case, you start WAAAAAY back when in history (usually Stone Age) and work your way up to the present through a series of interesting vignettes or snapshots of human-interest stories set periodically through the history of the specific place. James Michener, of course, perfected this technique, and Rutherford is never less than interesting in his version. But ...somehow, by &quot;The Forest,&quot; it just didn't seem to me that he had that much to say. The book felt repetitive, as if I was simply reading rifs on his earlier English books. Oh, yeah, another Norman-vs-Saxon episode, another Augustan Age seque, etc.Don't get me wrong, I'm sure you'll enjoy this book if you've never read him before, but I'd certainly recommend any of his earlier works ahead of this one. He feels, somehow, like he's gone formula on us."},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"The Forest is a rich, vivid historical read ~~ with fiction intertwined with history of England's most lush forest. If you are a history buff, this book is a good read. It seems long but unlike &quot;London&quot;, this book didn't drag in some places. Keeping track of the families were easier this time for some reason. Maybe it's because after reading all of his books, you tend to get an idea of how he writes.In my opinion, Rutherford gets better with every book, though &quot;Russka&quot; is still my favorite Rutherford book. Rutherford goes out of his way to find the little historical facts as well as the well-known ones. The characters are vividly drawn in their periods of time. The scenery is terrific ~~ the whole time I was reading this, it was below zero outside and all I could think of was hiding in the woods in the middle of summer to feel the breeze going through the treetops.If you are looking for a long read during these cold winter nights, this book is a great bet. Just grab your glass of wine, a blanket and light the logs in your fireplace and settle down for a nice winter read. It's worth it."},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"The New Forest has played a central role in the history of England starting with William using it as a hunting \\"spa\\". It is in the New Forest where William's son Rufus is killed under strange circumstances. Throughout the remainder of the millennium, this area has been on center stage almost as much as London has. Even in the present, the locale serves as an example of the modern day debate between development with easy access vs. environmental protection by pushing to name it a national park. In between much happens to members of the English Who's Who to include Austen, Drake, and Nelson, etc.Edward Rutherfurd is considered one of the giants of fictionalized history that provides a story telling account centering on real events and people. His latest work THE FOREST will show his talent to educate his audience with a well-written account that spans a thousand years of English history. Though some sections will overwhelm the reader with its vast historical tidbits, sub-genre fans will enjoy this book as much as Mr. Rutherfurd's previous works, LONDON and SARUM.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"Having read &quot;Russka,&quot; &quot;London,&quot; and &quot;Sarum&quot; and enjoyed them all, I was eager to read &quot;The Forest&quot;--and I wasn't disappointed, overall. Some people might complain that the New Forest area of England is hardly worthy of such a long novel, but Rutherfurd's interest in and portrayal of the &quot;small people&quot; of the forest make fascinating reading. In fact, I'd have much preferred more about the forest dwellers and somewhat less about the &quot;society types&quot; who dominate so much of the book. Give me more Puckle and Seagull any day! Even so, the book is well worth the time for anyone who has ever entertained an interest in England and English history. Rutherfurd's literary strength lies in his wonderful descriptions of the natural world in which his characters move and I often found myself rereading paragraphs in order to soak in that description. As for his characters, I enjoyed them, but the copy I read would have benefitted from a family tree similar to the one found in &quot;London,&quot; although Rutherfurd throws in enough physical similarities and references to ancestors to help his readers keep the characters quite distinct. I also have a couple of nitpicks about the book. In one spot, the owl is said to be able to turn its head 360 degrees, which is incorrect. Also, the mark of the arrow in the Rufus tree is said to have grown higher with the passing decades. This also is incorrect, as trees grow from the ends of the branches out and a mark in the trunk never gets any higher. These are quibbles with a wonderfully readable story which I am otherwise happy to recommend."},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"Something about this book, as opposed to \\"Sarum\\" \\"London\\" \\"Russka\\" and \\"Princes of Ireland\\" was so compelling in its tale and it characters, I made a 5 day trip to the U.K. and visited Bath-Sarum-Amesbury-Lyndhurst. The village of Lyndhurst is still just that, a village. And the Forest, the ponies and the ancient Abbey of Beulieu were stunning. You can walk for miles through the New Forest and not see anyone. As one of the characters in the book said \\"it just feels ancient\\". And it does. There are tiny and lovely B&B's all up and down the road right across from the Forest and compared to London are quite inexpensive. Nicer too. At times you sit under the huge tree at the entrance (also the road to the Abbey) which sits on top of a hill and just gaze out on the tree tops. You think about the book and you realize that what is missing are all the characters. As if you mourn for those long gone. It feels as if the Forest misses them as well."},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"With THE FOREST, author Edward Rutherford continues his love affair with England begun with SARUM and LONDON. (His other book, RUSSKA, was apparently an aberrational dalliance.) In all of his novels, Rutherford goes back in time and selects fictional families living in a specific geographical area, then visits members of each family at key points down through history as they interact with each other and the environment of the chosen area. In SARUM, it was the land surrounding the English town of Salisbury, including Stonehenge. In LONDON, it was ... well, London. In THE FOREST, it's the New Forest in the English county of Hampshire, a triangular patch of land approximately anchored by Salisbury, Christchurch and Southampton, and on the mainland immediately northwest of the Isle of Wight. \\"Forest\\", a French term, originally meant \\"reservation\\", and the New Forest was such a place set aside by Duke William of Normandy as a royal hunting preserve after becoming William I, King of England, in 1066 by defeating King Harold at Hastings.Rutherford begins his narrative in 1099, and continues in chapters headed 1294, 1480, 1587, 1635, 1794, 1868 and 2000 respectively. From previous exposure to the author's style, I've found it convenient to consider each chapter a short story more or less independent from the overall chronology. That way, I don't get too confused by the intersecting genealogical lines of the featured families as they thread through the centuries.This is a collection of vignettes portraying the human dramas encountered in the everyday lives of ordinary people, both gentry and commoners, as influenced by the time and place of their life spans. Thus, one becomes acquainted with Adela, a Norman noblewoman in search of a husband soon after the Conquest, and Brother Adam, an abbey monk suffering a crisis of faith after being seduced by a local housewife. Then there's Jonathan, a young boy living in the port of Lymington, caught in a storm at sea during a boat race, and Clement, a young gentleman threatened by his crazy mother's treasonous behavior as the Spanish Armada seemed poised to invade. And Alice, caught in the turbulent and dangerous times of Cromwell's Civil War and the subsequent Restoration. Or Fanny, an heiress pulled in opposite directions by love and an age-old family vendetta, on trial for shoplifting a piece of lace. Finally, Colonel Albion, fighting to save the forest he loves from the depredations of the London politicians.If you're looking for a thriller, or epic conflicts between a series of protagonists and antagonists, then THE FOREST is not for you. However, if you love England - especially that - and you enjoy vicariously immersing yourself in the everyday joys, heartaches, triumphs and defeats of others, then you'll love this book. Moreover, THE FOREST contains interesting information about non-human elements of the region: the mating rituals of the local deer population, the life cycles of the forest's oak trees, the method for harvesting salt from seawater, the formation of bogs, the proper use of timber in the art of building wooden sailing ships. Additionally, England's southern coast was once a hotbed of smuggling (oh, sorry ... \\"free trade\\"), and Rutherford gives some insight into its economics and methods as practiced there.If, by serendipity or design, you should find yourself on the A31 between Southampton and Ringwood, perhaps leave the main route onto the B3078 or A337, and explore the villages and landscape of the New Forest. I've been on the A31 several times, yet have never taken the time to explore this small corner of England. Now, I wish I had."},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"Mr Rutherford has given us another story rich with delightful characters and vivid scenery. If you are a fan of James A Michener's books, you will enjoy the rich tapestry that is woven here. The story line covers an area within the catchment of his masterpiece &quot;Sarum&quot;, but there is no duplication, and this book stands alone as a work of art.Also of interest is the fact that this book looks at great moments in English history, but almost skirts around them, giving us an insight into what it must have been like to be common folk, in the midst of great events. It is also very entertaining to read. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed The Forest by Edward Rutherford. I was born and raised in Southampton and as children we hiked the paths, rode our bicycles and picnicked in the New Forest. My grandparents lived in Pennington and now my parents live in Lymington and my youngest brother in Hale. The authors descriptions of the places came alive in my mind as I read. It was a happy read back to the origins of my childhood trips. Also a wonderful historical and fictional account of the people and background of The New Forest."},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"If you have not read this author's other books, London and Sarum please do so for they are as outstanding as is this newest book by a wonderful author and historian.I don't know when I have enjoyed history as much for Rutherfurd tells it in the most beguiling ways through stories of real people, their trials, loves and losses. At times one can find tears flowing because they are so poignant and heartbreaking yet one is left with a marvellous sense of seeing history and tradition so revered by our British friends lovingly revealed here. It is difficult to put this book down for many reasons. Each story in each period of time that he writes of has so many nuances that one may want to race through the pages, yet, it is not the best course for a lot of information relevant to the foundation of the early settlement of America by British colonists becomes increasingly clear and a new respect for the traditions our own American land are wonderful to recognize.What is especially delightful is the story of those early forest dwellers, both human and animal. The reader is brought to a keen awareness of how deeply Britians revere their land and their ancestral roots that trace backwards into antiquity and are still present throughout countless descendants who carry on a reverent legacy of respect and love for their great forests. From shipbuilding timber to charcoal to wood for heating and cooking,to acorns and other benefice for the animals, the forest is an everlasting symbol of nurturance and as an invaluable resource for their life and livelihood.This book is a marvellous Christmas, Birthday, or general gift to a person whom you love and know is an avid book reader, and a guarantee that the recepient will be well pleased. You may find that you may want to read it yourself. And then read his other books for a continuation of his vast knowledge and delicious storytelling vignettes of life as we can only imagine it was in the British Islands over the past thousand or so years. A wonderful journey."},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"I'm rarely moved enough by a novel to write an Amazon review on it (maybe that's because I read a lot of formulaic authors!)But, this one was something special. It's my first Rutherfurd. I know readers of his previous works were a bit disappointed in this one. But being my first and having no frame of reference . . .let's just say, I can't wait to read more of Rutherfurd! I normally read popular authors like Grisham and King, while I like them, this was a welcome change.It's labeled a &quot;novel&quot; but I'm sure most people would agree it reads like a series of short stories with a common thread, that being the settings, and the generations of the same eight or ten families that keep showing up as characters.While I didn't find all eight stories to be great, most of them were at least four star stories. My favorites were Beauliu, Lymington, and Pride of the Forest. Least favorite The Hunt.The characters were just so human . .from Brother Adam's moral dilemnas in Beaulieu, to the beautiful realization of father-son love in Lymington, to Fanny Albion's rollercoaster ride of emotions and problems in Albion Park, the plots and characters are very down to earth. I love some of the comic relief as well . . .for example The Grockletons in Albion Park, and more.One might wonder with such rave reviews, why didn't I give it five stars? Well, my only minor complaints were that on occasion it got a little hard to follow the political happenings and royal families. But . . .overall the stories were easy to follow.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"I very much enjoyed Sarum and London and looked forward to reading The Forest, but I was disappointed. The book is eight or nine loosely connected short stories. There's no overall page-turning plot, and Mother Nature seems to get more ink than the characters. I gave up midway through and moved on to better reading."},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"I haven't finished this yet, I'm about half way through but I am not into it anywhere near as much as I was his 2 on Ireland, maybe because they are on Ireland. I like the way he writes, he seamlessly weaves history into fiction. Each segment is almost a book in itself. He writes maybe 150 pages about one set of characters then skips about that many years & writes about their descendants. For some reason I am not as captivated by this as I was the Princes of Ireland & The Rebels of Ireland, which is the same as Awakening; Ireland. I'll finish it, though & I also have London to read yet. His style is very pleasant & readable, maybe I'll like this more when I finish it."},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"The Forest didnt seem to me to match up with Alaska, London or Sarum, three other books I have read written by Mr Rutherford. The other three, particularly Sarum, kept me engrossed and I did not want to put them down. The Forest didn't quite have the same attention grabbing script. Still, very good book and would recommend to readers."},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"I am currently reading this book. I have read other RutherfordNovels And am a fan. Although I prefer some of the others, but need to finish it before I can come to a more complete recommendation."},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"A good yarn but overcomplicated.I feel that it was intended almost as a documentary instead of a good read.Still the historical facts a fascinating."},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"Edward Rutherford has written a relatively small group of historical novels, However, if you are a fan of good stories crossing generations that happen in interesting places and times, the Rutherford's books are for you. After reading Sarum. I hunted his other books and have read them with interest and enthusiasm. Forest is another of Rutherford's real books--they are good enough to hold the readers interest over many, many pages. If you love long books Rutherford's your man.."},{"Title":"The Forest","review":"Of the first four books in the Edward Rutherford series, this fourth entry, The Forest, is the weakest one. It covers little new ground historically than the previous two English books, Sarum and London, already did. Thankfully, the book is also a third of the size of its predecessors. As far as characters, though, the book is just as excellent. It brings to life many interesting characters both fictional and historical, dating back from the Norman conquest to the present day. The ones who stood out the most were the characters from the time of Queen Elizabeth I's reign. A mother who wants England restored to Catholicism more than anything is the most memorable. Otherwise, though, it is a welcome relief that the next three books in the Rutherford series finally move away from England and explore new territory and history."},{"Title":"The Story of Papiamentu: A Study in Slavery and Language","review":"Anyone studying the Papiamentu language should read this book. Fouse, the author, gives a history of the language, presenting linguistic and historical evidence that it was originally based on Portuguese and has ties to Cape Verdean Creole (Kriolu).In part one, Fouse explains pidgins and creoles and then introduces the basics of the language, giving the etymologies of some words including djarason (Wednesday) as \\"day of [weekly] rations\\" (here I have used the Bonairean spelling). Part two traces the history of slavery in Portuguese West Africa, the Spanish destruction of the native Caiquetios on Aruba, Curaao, and Bonaire, and the Dutch rule of the ABC islands since the struggles of 1634 through 1636. Part three presents the many influences on the development of Papiamentu, including Portuguese slavers, African languages, Sephardic merchants, Spanish Catholic church workers, Dutch landowners and administrative personnel, oral versus written transmission, and the issue of standardization. In part four, Fouse describes the present situation of Papiamentu, including the diaspora of Papiamentu speakers and the future prospects for the language.As the book went to press, it was not well proofread. However, the many problems with punctuation and the occasional problems with spelling originate with the editors of the University Press of America and not with the author. At places, the book seems to have been written to meet a deadline. Indications of this rush to completion include unexpected and unilluminating repetitions of information. Fortunately, these problems present a minor irritant and do not negate this book as a source of information.This book fills what would otherwise remain a void for the prospective student of the Papiamentu language. It should be considered as required reading both for the classroom student and for the independent learner."},{"Title":"The Story of Papiamentu: A Study in Slavery and Language","review":"When I bought this book on Amazon, it cost me 25 cents. That is about what it is worth. It is a shame that such an interesting topic as Papiamentu should be given such a slapdash treatment. A reviewer below seems to blame the editors, but the editors didn't write the thing, they just didn't fix it. I managed to finish the book despite the horrible writing, which goes beyond punctuation mistakes and repeated information. It is full of non-sequiturs, parenthetical notes (that do repeat the same information they are describing), subordinate clauses that do not refer back to anything, and a terrible overuse of the \\"etc.\\". This all makes for a very confusing read. Fouse is not a writer or scholar - he is a former customs and DEA agent turned ESL teacher (check out his blog \\"fousesquawk\\") and is now a dilettante who chose a very interesting topic and bogged it down in such poor writing as to make excruciating. I give him credit for trying, though, and for his love of the language."},{"Title":"The Story of Papiamentu: A Study in Slavery and Language","review":"I found The Story of Papiamentu an interesting and refreshing study of Papiamentu en read it with pleasure."},{"Title":"Guide to Owning a Pomeranian (Re Dog)","review":"Many pet books that are currently on the market are full of fluff and sound like they could be about any breed of dog. However, Ms. Ellmann has written a wonderful guide to Pomeranians. She highlights on the history of Poms, the proper way to choose a pup, housebreaking, training, grooming, and general health care of Poms. She also gives great information about how to show your dog if you desire to do so. It's not a guide that goes very in-depth, but in my case, it's a great book to get started learning about Pomeranians. One of my favorite features of this particular book are the stunning pictures that are throughout it.

Exellent directions and carefully drawn maps direct the visitor to the hidden treasures along the way. You don't have to drive the whole trail to get the best from this book as each section of the trail can be accessed from other better roads. So next time you are in the East Mojave National Preserve drive a little of this old pack trail which was a well-used native american trading route long before the days of mules and covered wagons; the drive time will be longer but the rewards will be greater."},{"Title":"Mojave Road Guide","review":"The Mojave Road is one of those epic desert adventures. There are three reasons why every serious desert rat should embark on this recreational road. First, the road is rich with history. The story of this area connects with figures such as John Fremont, Kit Carson and Jedediah Smith. Second, the 132.9 mile road is a quality challenge for experienced off-roaders. Indeed, even experienced drivers should not attempt the road in a single vehicle. Third, the remote area is naturally stunning. It's not \\"National Park beautiful,\\" but beautiful in a Mojave Desert way. Located in Mojave National Preserve, the area is about three hours north of Los Angeles. Without rushing, the entire road takes three days. \\"Mojave Road Guide: An Adventure Through Time\\" is by Dennis G. Casebier. If you didn't already know, Casebier is one of the luminaries of the Mojave. As a virtual one man institution, he is one of the most prolific writers on the area. Indeed, \\"the Mojave Road Guide\\" is actually number 22 in his \\"Tales of the Mojave Road\\" series. Nobody is better qualified to write such a book. Indeed, before embarking on the Mojave Road, a stop off at Goffs (Casebier's base of operations) is suggested. The spiral bound book is excellent. It offers a mile by mile break down of the off-roading trail. Detailed descriptions, historical connections and driving challenges are indicated at the proper mileage points. Multiple maps help to guide the traveler. The title is illustrated with both contemporary and historical photographs. This detailed data is essential as the Mojave Road isn't simply a dirt road that you get on and drive it until it finishes. Rather it often intersects, overlaps and backtracks over multiple routes. There are times when the route leaves what seems to be the main road for a lesser path. Even with this book, the experience is all about mindful driving. As a guide, this book has the issue of being dated. The most recent version was published in 1999, so road conditions have obviously changed in the past decade. Published by the Friends of the Mojave Road, \\"The Mojave Road Report\\" is supposed to be used in conjunction with the book and update the reader with the most current road conditions. After a year long subscription, I found the Report to have little practical value. A web site could easily solve this problem, but Casebier's organization has somehow managed to resist any Internet presence. So when it comes to current road conditions, the potential adventurer's only options include the Report and a well-timed stop off at the Goffs Schoolhouse. (The Park Rangers at Kelso have little useful intel.) All of that written, the few changes are of little consequence to the vehicular caravans. When embarking on this odyssey, the adventurer should also bring the Tom Harris \\"Recreation map of the Mojave National Preserve\\", acompassand/orGPS Unit. Despite being dated, \\"Mojave Road Guide\\" is both practical and learned. In the end, Casebier crafted the essential guide to the Mojave Road."},{"Title":"Tragic Failure: Racial Integration in America","review":"This is a comparison of two books with different points of view, one from the heart and one from the head. Tom Wicker's thesis in &quot;Tragic Failure&quot; subtitle &quot;Racial Integration in America&quot; is that racial integration simply has not worked. He would support the William O. Douglas / Thurgood Marshall line of thought that the job of integration will only be complete when most neighborhoods and schools are visibly multi-racial and all races enjoy substantially equal prestige and incomes. He would argue that government, especially the courts, have much more work to do.Wicker's apologia for persistent educational and economic underperformance he roots in two centuries of slavery and another of Jim Crow. He sees a vicious cycle of undereducation, low self esteem, illegitimacy and drug dependency that will apparently perpetuate itself until it is broken by the acceptance of minorities as equal citizens, that to be achieved by force of law.Both authors observe that the courts went from one extreme, the &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine of Plessy vs. Ferguson. to a middle ground with &quot;Brown vs. Board of Education,&quot; to the highly interventionist phase of forced busing in the 1970s, to return to a rather muddled middle ground in the 1990's, with mandatory busing being phased out and increased tolerance of de facto segregation resulting from residential patterns.David J. Armor served as an expert witness in many school desegregation cases, including those involving forced busing. &quot;Forced Justice&quot; offers the legal history of school desegregation, an analysis of the &quot;harm and benefits&quot; theory behind integration, an assessment of the extent to which desegregation yielded the expected benefits, and a snapshot of the status quo as of his writing in 1995, forty some years after Brown vs. Board of Education.Though court decisions drove the most divisive aspects of school desegregation, The Supreme Court chose to accept only a fraction of the cases presented for review and rendered opinions that were vague enough that lower courts were able to interpret them in many different ways. In some cases, such as Mecklenburg, North Carolina and Pasadena, California the courts came close to running the schools. Fear of extensive judicial involvement led many districts to institute some form of voluntary desegregation using devices such as magnet schools.Armor is at pains to point out that human affairs are far too complex to permit controlled experimentation with ideas such as desegregation. The races are segregated by neighborhood. Is that a matter of race, class, or simple preference? Does it cause or result from school segregation? To what extent can school boards be held accountable for it?Measurement is also difficult. What can be measured is that the schools' racial mixture changed rapidly and radically in many school districts undergoing desegregation. Student performance is also measured, though only by broad categories. It is difficult to know how to distinguish among the numerous factors that can student performance, among them the trauma of desegregation, racial prejudice and self esteem issues, the stress of being bused, socioeconomic status and native ability.Regression analysis is the statistician's tool for mathematically isolating the many variables in a complex set of data. Armor's before-and-after analyses of student performance in districts that desegregated yield two recurrent results: &quot;No measurable different&quot; and &quot;We don't know.&quot; In particular:Black self esteem appears to be if anything higher than whites,' and it is highest in majority black schools, worst in those that are more evenly mixed, and better in schools in which blacks are a distinct minority.Both black and white academic performance are worst in predominantly black schools. However, adjusting for socioeconomic status, blacks seem to do as well in urban schools as the suburban schools to which they are frequently bused.Each race's estimation of the other is lowest in those situations in which they have a maximum of contact. In other words, less mixing actually led to better mutual relations.White academic performance appears to be largely unaffected by the addition of a substantial minority of black students. The fears driving white flight appear unfounded. White academic achievement has been static over the forty year period under study. Black academic achievement has risen, though it still remains a significant fraction of a standard deviation below that of whites.Armor's bottom line is that desegregation was an immensely costly effort. The out-of-pocket expense involved in legal proceedings, busing, construction and other remedies could only have been justified by significant, measurable benefits. The actual benefits are at best mixed. One clear benefit is more intense focus on equalizing levels of spending on education, though there too, the correspondence between spending and results is hard to discern.Wicker's bottom line is that African Americans have received pretty much as much help as they can expect from the political system. He advocates that &quot;African-Americans themselves must take the lead, state the goal (economic advance and social leveling), and move boldly towards it.&quot; Armor would advocate something similar. Blacks need to decide what structure is best suited to provide them with &quot;equity&quot; and work within existing systems to achieve it. One despairs that judicial solutions are too much to hope for, the other that they have been tried and have not worked. Both agree that the onus for improvement of the lot of African-Americans falls primarily on them. Close to ten year later that is exactly what is happening through charter schools and vouchers programs."},{"Title":"Penissimo: Gay Erotic Art Photography Vol. 1","review":"Is this book photography, erotic art, or just plain pornography? I really can't say. You could just call it pure gay sex in photography. I think Leonard Zett has created a uniquely different art with these photos of penises. He has taken images of penises from videos or directly from his own videos and created new ones by duplicating them, changing colors, and multiplying and also reducing the images. I think he must have had a lot of fun in doing this. Don't expect facial shots or bodies, (although there are a few), these are just penises glorified to the fullest. No computer techniques were used at all to create these images.I really enjoyed this book because it was different from other photography books.

He tells a story which binds you to the place and the people who live there. The individuals and peoples -- of several tribes, African and European -- which populate his book have a vital attachment to their granite hills, and it's fascinating to see that attachment bring them together and divide them. Ranger shows us how complex the reality of inter-ethnic relations are; we see different attitudes toward nature and history be shared or not shared across ethnic and racial boundaries. Cecil Rhodes lives on through this book, and surprisingly, as much more complex than simply a greedy imperialist; after reading this book I can understand better why there's a huge Zimbabwean defense of keeping his body at World's End in the Matopos. This book is a detailed living escape from political history and a thought-provoking study of history and philosophy of nature."},{"Title":"Recovering : A Journal","review":"Reading Sarton is like taking in fresh air! \\"Recovering\\" is no exception.

Although she expresses her grief and losses in a poignent and potent manner, she is not sentimental and \\"Recovering\\", like her other works, leaves one with a certian calmness even amid all of the emotional turbulance.\\"Recovering\\" also is typically \\"Sartonian\\" in that her eye for the beautiful simplicity in nature and the in small details is ever present in this journal."},{"Title":"Recovering : A Journal","review":"I am one of those people who May Sarton speaks to.

Sarton doesn\`t mythologize her unhappiness or sickness, and that is what someone on the road to recovery needs to read.

Kerr, and it is a fictional story. It was written in the first person from two people's views, Brenda Belle and Adam Blessing. The setting is in the small town of Storm, Vermont, where nothing much happens. The local drugstore is the after-school hangout, dances and other people's affairs are everyone's business. The characters are believable and have real feelings. It seems as if you could know them and identify them in your own neighborhood. Tension rises as the teens discover things about each other that they didn't need to know. At the end most conflicts are resolved, but not as you would expect them to be. Because the resolution fits in with the rest of the story, it is believable. My favorite part from the book is Brenda's and Adam's first fight. Brenda had found out about the incorrect initial on Adam's ring. The relationship was over. &quot;I don't care,&quot; she says. &quot;You don't have to explain anything.&quot; You can almost hear the tightness in her words as you read them. &quot;You sound nervous,&quot; he says. &quot;I'm not nervous,&quot; she replies. Brenda's and Adam's &quot;nothing power&quot; is dissolved. &quot;You said yourself life isn't fair, even, or equal,&quot; Brenda finishes. The story ends on a good note: don't pretend to be who you are not. That is something we should all try. The following excerpt expresses the theme of the book: &quot;We'll travel light - I like that. I'm not ready for anything heavy. I want to start out slow and easy while I get used to the advantages of being the son of someone famous. That is just a part of being me. But not the biggest part. I know that now.&quot; As I said earlier, the book is written in the first person. But it is from two different people's point of view, Adam's and Brenda's. It is written like a journal in Adam's part, and &quot;Notes for a Novel&quot; under Brenda's. In some parts it is hard to go from one section to another, though. The language mostly simple on a probably seventh grade level. The author doesn't describe anything in too thorough detail, but it is enough to get the main idea. &quot;It is possible that all the hurts have made him so good at what he does; it is equally possible that such a man is only good at what he does, and not good at the things most men do easily. The only thing I'm really sure about my father is that he's different. Special, you might say.

(Note that the character's name seems to have been lifted from a much older pulp novel called \\"The Damnation of Adam Blessing\\" which was later the name of a regionally successful late-60s band.) Adam is the \\"son of someone famous\\" who often sees his father on TV doing very important things (such as shaking hands with the Vice President) but doesn't seem to have much contact with him. Adam is living with his grandfather under an assumed identity in a pretty ordinary New England town, where he gets involved with a local girl, Brenda Belle, but doesn't tell her who he really is.My problem with this book is mainly that, like other Kerr books involving \\"famous\\" teens (such as \\"I'll Love You When You're More Like Me\\"), the story told from Adam's perspective seemed beyond my experience and farfetched, and his attitude towards it was annoying. On the one hand, Adam is hiding his identity; on the other hand he obviously gets a big charge out of being the secret \\"son of someone famous\\" and refers to that, and his father's achievements, in his first-person narrative (presented as a diary). I didn't understand why he couldn't just be straight with Brenda or why it is such a big deal for him to be associated with a famous father. I don't like people who coast on their parents' accomplishments - why couldn't he set that aside and focus on accomplishing things for himself? He also seemed to perceive himself as not really having a relationship with Brenda, while she thought of it as \\"going steady\\" and he didn't bother to set her straight. Really kind of an unlikable guy.

The America that united in its pain and bewilderment, its grief and anger? The America that sought solace again in the God of its founders?The answer to this question ---whether it be apathy, lack of understanding, or simply being overwhelmed---now haunts our nation as an acrid division over the war on terror. It is now time that we step back into the powerful emotions of those days after 9/11 and begin our response afresh.The outline for America's eventual victory against the forces of terror is contained in the stirring book by Dr. Elaine I. Duval,America After the Siege: Roadmap to Victory After 9/11.Written in the dynamic and powerful voice of the Old Testament prophets, this book takes readers to a place where they can clearly hear the voice of a loving and mournful God, a God who is passionately calling His children back into His embrace.The book begins with a recital of the shock and pain we felt on 9/11 as we watched the unthinkable happen before our eyes. We are captured up once more in the emotions of that bloody day and the grief-filled days that followed.As the reader re-experiences those unbearable, excruciating emotions again, aching in the hopelessness of 9/11, the voice shifts to one of compassion and hope. The author shares the inspiring vision of a strong and united America along with a road map for the journey to fulfilling this vision.It is to our own detriment that we ignore this clarion call to return to the God of our founding fathers. We would be wise, therefore, to heed the call to return to Him, seeking His righteousness, grace, and mercy as we seek to heal the wounds that continue to bleed, draining us of the power necessary to prevail against the evil in today's world.This book is a powerful and timely reminder of how far we have fallen away from God and how desperately He is pursuing our return to Him.America After Siege should be required reading for anyone who cares about America and her safety in today's climate of evil and terror."},{"Title":"America After Siege: Roadmap to Victory After 9/11","review":"I have read several works since our nation's tragedy on 9/11.

One of love and loyalty for my country, tenderness for those who suffered loss of loved ones, forgiveness, hope and understanding of some of the whys. That was a tall order that she fulfilled.Told in poetic form, the author expresses within these pages emotions that have laid dormant within many of us. She gently guides us back to our Creator with words that sooth the spirit and bring understanding to the soul.Through reading her work, I truly believe she has a finger on America's pulse and perhaps her words should be read with an open mind and taken to heart.I recommend this read America; I believe it will bless and enhance you.Well done Dr. DuvalShirley JohnsonSenior ReviewerMidWest Book Review"},{"Title":"America After Siege: Roadmap to Victory After 9/11","review":"Reviewed by: Tyrone Vincent Banks of Betsie's Literary PageA strategy for coping with the pain caused by the events of 9/11.Dr. Elaine I. Duval has written this book to aid those who are still scarred by the horrific events of September 11, 2001. Many of us have heard the calming words and reassurances of our spiritual and political leaders as the country existed for a short time blanketed by American flags and patriotic assemblies. The events of 9/11 became a call to arms as our country retaliated by attacking those that have caused us such pain and terror. We are now enthralled in a war spawned by this cowardly act and now more blood is spilling. Many of us feel that the country is spiraling towards a decay that cannot be stopped. In the authors own description we are now in a broken state and this brokenness can be repaired through God.Many have moved past 9/11 and focus intently on the combat in the Middle East. We want to see justice and those responsible punished for their acts. As this broken country struggles to rebound from 9/11 many are pointing fingers with the hopes that blaming someone else will serve as a form of retribution. This surreal event - the tragic morning on September 11, 2001 will never leave our minds and will always be in our hearts - but there is a way to heal.We must not blame God for this tragedy. Instead, we must stand tall and work harder at strengthening our resolve to honor and respect each other. We are given a chance to rebuild our lives and make it better. Dr. Duval compares our country to Christ and the pain and death that he overcame. He was \\"broken\\" beyond repair however, he was resurrected and his words and love continues to comfort those in need of spiritual healing.I can recall that tragic day and the days that followed. People were kind to each other as we shared in the hurt and pain. Every house displayed the American Flag proudly and the \\"Proud to be an American\\" bumper stickers adorned every vehicle. Individual differences did not matter, 9/11 affected many countries in different ways and we enjoyed a brotherhood that you rarely see today. For a moment, just a moment, the tragedy created a society where crime rates dropped, people were kind to each other and we comforted anyone in need of comfort.As time went by, that all dissolved and continues to fade away.\\"America After Siege: Roadmap to Victory After 9/11\\" should be read as you read the bible or whatever book represents your faith. America has been given a chance to be reborn out of the ashes of 9/11. Together we can go forward and live the lives as dictated by God, Allah or whatever deity you choose to worship.This book will open up a train of thought and internal reflection that will vary depending on the person reading these words. Instead of reviewing this book and relaying the poetry and words that I've read, I have chosen to digest these words and make them a part of myself. I challenge myself to return to the brotherhood and Christianity that enveloped my being after 9/11. I have not forgotten the events but I now remind myself of the calm that followed the storm prior to our quest for justice. The battle will continue to rage and those who do not fight as instruments of war can become instruments of faith.Even if you believe that you have \\"healed\\" emotionally after 9/11, read this book and you will be enlightened. Dr. Duval's simple words represent complex feelings and emotions that are necessary to embrace as we move forward with our lives. Read this book and share it with others. There is a message to spread and that message starts with you..."},{"Title":"Moody Handbook of Theology","review":"This is a well written and well organized reference on the major branches of Christian theology. It is written from a Protestant/evangelical perspective but still gives adequate treatment to many other views including Roman Catholicism, liberal theologies and significant historical positions. Includes dozens of useful charts, some of which I have seen reprinted in other theology texts.I particularly like the way the author develops the various layers of theological work starting with exegesis and biblical theology as the underpinning for systematics, dogmatics then contemporary etc. These relationships were not clear to me until I saw them in this book.If you study theology to any degree, and especially if you are just starting to study it, this is dollar for dollar one of the best books you can invest in. Each topic is treated briefly but with sufficent depth to clarify the various views to help make further study fruitful. There are many lists of other works in the chapter end notes - also has a good subject index. I love this book and expect to continue using it often."},{"Title":"Moody Handbook of Theology","review":"Enns does an excellent job in taking a very complex subject (namely, theology) and breaking it down into a very readable format. While he certainly has his personal theological bent, it is not very apparent throughout much of the book, as he seems to honestly tackle the different styles and beliefs of doctrines. He is very effective in objectively (as far as it can be done) describing the various systems of belief. Numerous charts found throughout the book accentuate the discussion of the different chapters. The glossary in the back includes 1-2-sentence defintions, and while this is perhaps too simple, I could see this being advantageous for a beginner who is easily overwhelmed. For someone who would like an overview of theology, I would think this book should be a most valuable research tool."},{"Title":"Moody Handbook of Theology","review":"I have read many &quot;theology&quot; books, and this one rates among the best. This book goes into depth that will assist someone in full time ministry, but the material is explained in a way that anyone else can easily comprehend it.

The material is rock solid, since it is based entirely on the Bible itself. This book is a necessity for addition to anyone's library."},{"Title":"Moody Handbook of Theology","review":"Paul Enns writes in a style easily read by most high school &quot;B&quot; students. This book is rather comprehensive in subjects, and covers most subjects rather well. It speaks to opposing (theological) views and explains the differences very well. It will introduce and explain issues related to basic subjects that, unless you've attended in-depth theology classes, you will not even know existed. Subjects include the Bible, God, Salvation, Church, Future Events, etc. It also includes many tables to provide the big picture very quickly.For basic theology books, it is one of two books I recommend for everyone. (The other one is &quot;Practical Christianity&quot; by Floyd Barackman.) Neither of these books would serve well as seminary text books, but rarely are we looking for such material anyway! If you want to get a good understanding of a doctrine in 30 minutes, either of these two books are very good choices. (This is using the book as a reference book, not for general reading. One could certainly simply read the book, but my guess is most owners use it in reference style instead. It has a good index, etc.)"},{"Title":"Moody Handbook of Theology","review":"I actually like the format and flow of the book. My problem with it has to do with the fact that it misrepresents Arminianism. Arminianism and semi-pelagianism are not the same. Arminius affirmed total depravity and the bondage of the will. Arminius believed that divine grace is needed before one can have faith. Arminius also held to penal-substitutionary atonement, not governmental like the book presents. Later followers of Arminius did espouse these heretical views but that is not Arminianism.Even if you do not agree with Arminianism, it is important to know accurately what they believe. everything else is pretty good, but for an understanding of Arminianism, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Moody Handbook of Theology","review":"Most handbooks of theology are fairly brief works of about 150 pages consisting of short articles that explain doctrines, heresies, movements, and leading men in the field of theology. However, this massive work is divided into five parts that cover biblical theology (in 16 chapters that survey the theology of all major biblical sections), systematic theology (bibliology, theology proper, christology, etc.), historical theology (surveying the major theological teachings of the ancient, medieval, Reformation, and modern eras), dogmatic theology (with chapters on Calvinistic, Arminian, covenant, dispensational, and Catholic theology), and contemporary theology (10 types, including Evangelical Feminism, Charismatic Theology and the Emerging Church). It has 48 chapters and an epilogue, 55 simple-to-understand charts, a 26-page glossary of terms and names, and several indexes (persons, subjects, and Scripture references), endnotes identifying sources quoted, and helpful bibliographies. Enns is a ThM and ThD graduate of Dallas Seminary and dispensational in his convictions, yet he graciously presents and responds to other views. He is currently a minister for Biblical Training & Leadership Development as professor and director of the Tampa Extension, Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary. The simple writing style of this work makes it appropriate for Bible institute, college, and seminary students and graduates as well as for lay persons interested in learning more about theology. This volume is highly recommended as no other work is so comprehensive, understandable (using lay language yet scholarly with excellent endnoting), and well laid out. In the second edition Enns addresses developments in \\"progressive dispensationalism\\" which have come about since 1989 through Robert Saucy, Darrell Bock, and Craig Blaising. This new edition also addresses prosperity theology, openness theology, and dominion theology. My only complaint is my own preference for footnotes instead of his endnotes that complete each chapter."},{"Title":"Moody Handbook of Theology","review":"This masterful short handbook on theology is written by one of the classy senior professors in current Christendom. The first chapter outlines ways to study scripture and with uncommon brevity explains each approach. Though I have not completed the text, I love its organization and thoroughness. This reader learned much and greatly appreciated the definitions and direction. The only distraction might not seem such to those who are snug in the camp of young earth. The hard challenge to bright minds of science with the notion that accepting any concepts of evolution in anyway is somehow unscriptural just does not seem to this reader to fit the venue. The handbook is probably not the best place to make this blanket fractious statement and then not follow through with the many sides and aspects of this debate.Otherwise, this reader is happy to ignore this issue as one perhaps with honest passion of the author and use the handbook for its many great features."},{"Title":"Moody Handbook of Theology","review":"The Moody Handbook of Theology is a great resource to have in your library.

Second, one should buy books by Richard Swinburne (&quot;The Coherence of Theism&quot;, &quot;The Christian God&quot;, &quot;Revelation&quot;, etc., all from Oxord U.), and balance Swinburne erroneous idea of a time-bound God with Norman Geisler's &quot;Creating God in the Image of Man&quot; or Paul Helm's &quot;Eternal God&quot;."},{"Title":"Moody Handbook of Theology","review":"This book covers basic Bible doctrine.

In a way this does that, but it is a very biased book. The author is very much an ultra conservative 4 point Calvinist (refuting the idea of limited atonement) and so all of his opinions and summaries come from that perspective. I was pretty surprised that he used Hans K&uuml;ng (someone who is not officially allowed to teach catholic theology) as a big basis for his catholic section and ignored more accepted theologians like the current pope, just one example of many of his slanted bias. Oddly Eastern Orthodox Christianity was mostly skipped.So if you're an anti-evolutionist, 4 point Calvinist who wants a slanted theological comparison to show you why you're completely correct and why everyone else is wrong, then this might be your book, if you want a more balanced approach find something else. I plan to read Alister McGrath's Christian Theology next year for hopefully a more balanced approach."},{"Title":"Moody Handbook of Theology","review":"This is good theology book but not great.

Part 1 for example covers \\"Biblical Theology\\"; (The introduction to Old Testament and New Testament Theology, Theology of the Edenic era and other key era's in the Old Testament as well as various aspects of New Testament Theology such as the Theology of the Synoptics, the Theology of Acts, of Paul and others). In Part 2 author Enns shares information about what is called \\"Systematic Theology\\" (which includes the Doctrine of Christology which is a study of the doctrine of Christ for example or The Doctrine of Soteriology which is the study of the doctrine of Salvation as well as 7 other areas of doctrine that are essential to the faith).In Part 3 the author covers the area of \\"Historical Theology;\\" (For example, Ancient Theology, Reformation Theology, Modern Theology and others). Part 4 provides information about \\"Dogmatic Theology\\" which looks at such areas as Calvinistic Theology, Arminian Theology and others of importance. Then in Part 5 Contemporary Theology is covered which looks at Liberal Theology, Neoorthodox Theology, Catholic Theology and even the \\"Emerging Church.\\" Also included in the handbook are over 50 different helpful charts to aid in your study of Theology and The Word of God and a concise and handy glossary.What I like about author Enns Handbook of Theology is that it is very easy to read and understand which is important. And his handbook can be most helpful to the beginning student of the Scriptures as well as someone who has an extensive education as well as experience in the ministry. So I give the Moody Handbook of Theology a big thumbs up!"},{"Title":"Moody Handbook of Theology","review":"An important part of a book is knowing what you have. This is a \\"handbook,\\" not an exhaustive systematic theology. It is the \\"Moody\\" handbook of theology, so it represents doctrine that is what you would expect from the Moody Bible Institute. When you want to get the central truths of a doctrinal question without having to slog through long and broad sections, you will find this very helpful.It is a great handbook that not only has a fairly complete, concise, and easy to understand section on systematic theology, but also includes other parts that will help (especially) a layman broaden his/her thinking about other ways to think about theology. Part one (pp. 19-144) gives a helpful explanation and overview of \\"Biblical theology.\\" Part two (pp. 147-402) is the section on systematic theology that gives a fairly complete, but not exhaustive, development of nine areas of systematic theology. Part three (pp. 403-470) discusses \\"historical theology\\" which is something that many in church have not given much thought to. Part four (pp. 471-544) is about \\"dogmatic theology.\\" It outlines three areas of current theological debate: Calvinistic vs. Arminian, Covenant vs. Dispensational, and Catholic theology. Part five (pp. 545-625) gives an overview of some \\"contemporary trends\\" in theology. It also has a glossary, and index of persons, subjects, and Scriptures.If you are comfortable with Moody's doctrinal positions and want a handy reference, this will be an excellent tool for your reference and study. This is a great tool for the pastor or layman in the church setting. If you are looking for an exhaustive, scholastic, or very advanced treatment, you might be happier with something else."},{"Title":"Moody Handbook of Theology","review":"I found this book very helpful. It wasnt hard to understand and it brought up interesting points I havent thought of as well as opposing views and why he believes them to be wrong. Im glad this author discusses the arguments against the bible and Christianity. I believe as a Christian it only makes you stronger to know all theviews you face in the real world and how you can address them."},{"Title":"Moody Handbook of Theology","review":"A well researched, well articulated encyclopedia of the major Christian doctrines. An interesting read and an excellent reference. Enns does take a very conservative approach to doctrine, so you may not agree with all of his conclusions, but the background he provides will help you in forming your own understanding of what you believe and why."},{"Title":"Moody Handbook of Theology","review":"Paul Enns does a good job- no- an EXCELLENT job with systematically arranging,organizing and presenting theology in this volume. I agree with the previous comments by Bruno Granger- this book is a must have for believers everywhere. My one gripe, is that some of the material may need to be 'dumbed down' for new believers. You kinda need to 'study up' to this one :)"},{"Title":"Moody Handbook of Theology","review":"simple, but well written, I appreciated this work,and used it in my classes I am taking at www.lru.edu .I would recommend this to anyone."},{"Title":"Moody Handbook of Theology","review":"My husband and I are studying to become NANC-certified Christian counselors and this book was suggested reading for the theology requirement. This book is written in a way that these weighty subjects are easy to understand and grasp the concepts. Some theology books are difficult to sift through, but this book is very user friendly. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in gaining a deeper understanding of the Gospel and how to apply it to life."},{"Title":"Moody Handbook of Theology","review":"Would recommend it to students who are looking to learn theology from a source which has simple and various layouts."},{"Title":"Moody Handbook of Theology","review":"Helps learn the language alot by hearing it over and over. Would suggest these CD's to everyone who studies the course."},{"Title":"Moody Handbook of Theology","review":"Its going to take some time to finish this book however its very easy to read yet in depth . You will not be disappointed Im sure . 5 stars all the way"},{"Title":"Moody Handbook of Theology","review":"If you want to know about different doctrines and theologies this is the book for you. It gives a nice look into a lot of different but important aspects in theology and doctrines in a easy to read and understand context. Helps you to get clearer on your understanding of God."},{"Title":"Moody Handbook of Theology","review":"The little handbook of theology that I used in my college studies often returns to my hand as a reference tool today. Enns' fascinating little work introduces the student to the various approaches to theology. The volume is divided into five sections. The writer first presents a biblical theology which moves through the Bible section by section, demonstrating the progressive nature of revelation on various points of theology along the way. Next, Enns moves to systematic theology. In this section, the reader will find the classic doctrines discussed in light detail. The third section is the discussion of the historical theology of the church. Enns traces the development of theology from ancient, to medieval, to reformation, to the modern church. Section four discusses various branches of dogmatic theology such as Calvinism, Arminianism, Covenant Theology, Dispensationalism, and Catholicism. The last section deals with contemporary theology and lays out the beliefs of various strands of Christians today. Enns deals here with the Liberals, the Neo-Orthodox, Radical Theologies, Historicist Ideologies, Socialist Theology, Catholic Theology, and Conservative Theology. This excellent work will provide the average reader with an introduction to the major fields of theology today and will serve as a valuable reference tool for years to come."},{"Title":"Moody Handbook of Theology","review":"The Moody Handbook of Theology exceded my expectations. Every aspect of theology is approached and reviewed. Very comprehensive study."},{"Title":"Moody Handbook of Theology","review":"This is a wonderful book for those, like me, who are intersted in Theology and it's study. This may be a good book for a beginning student or even a seasoned theologian to use. It is biased, of course towards the theology of the author. This is clearly shown as he summarizes each chapter at the end and gives \\"low numbers\\" to what he disagrees with and \\"great numbers\\" to that which he agrees with.A very good book, though."},{"Title":"Moody Handbook of Theology","review":"I thank God for the Moody Handbook of Theology. I will continue to enjoy reading and re-reading this book. This book is going to be a great and valuable reference tool for me in years to come.I love this book. One of the reasons is because it is non bias. It teaches basic BIBLE doctrine. It just sates the facts. Enns is very effective in describing various systems of belief. The book is well written and well organized. It also gives references to allow me to go further in my studies.There were topics that I was not even interested in learning about. The Moody Hand Book on Theology changed that. There were topics that were not clear to me until I picked this book up. This is a fantastic book.Encourager Linda Flagg, LM, CS"},{"Title":"Moody Handbook of Theology","review":"Dr. Enns did a phenominal job in collaborating so many Theological articles; He hands it to his readers like a home made apple pie. This work provides a wonderful and balanced source as far as history and theology, not to mention the author's recommended reading at the end of each topic. Any one who purcheses this book will not be sorry."},{"Title":"Moody Handbook of Theology","review":"Dr. Enns has created a volume that a believer and student of the Bible should have on-hand at all times. His work is excellently divided into logical categories (Old Testament theology, New Testament Theology, with several sub- and sub- sub- categories of each). He has throroughly documented his conslusions with citations in endnote form. This volume not only gives an overview of the content of the Bible, but gives fascinating historical deatils, both of the events in the Bible and of theological movements and schools of thought over the centuries.I personally know this man and have studied under him; I know the love and devotion he has for the Lord. His love for Christ shines on every page of this work.No matter what level of theological training one has, Dr. Enns work will add greatly to the study of God's inspired and inerrant Word."},{"Title":"Moody Handbook of Theology","review":"This revised edition gives solid summaries on the themes of systematic theology.A good investment."},{"Title":"Sarge: The Life and Times of Sargent Shriver","review":"I have to say I was a little daunted by the size of the book but I quite literally could not put it down. Sargent Shriver is a truly great American, and Stossel tells his story in a compelling way. In addition, I feel as though I had a whole new insight into the historical period from the 1930s though the 1980s as seen through Shriver's life."},{"Title":"Sarge: The Life and Times of Sargent Shriver","review":"I think the title of my review says it all! He & Eunice were the most happily married (doesn't say much) of all the Kennedy women because he was a faithful husband, loving father & truly devoted to public service & not selfish political ambitions. Shriver's parents were the founders of Commonweal, A \\"liberal\\" Catholic publication that did not go along with total \\"papal infallibility\\" but encouraged free thought & inclusiveness. This, no doubt was a great influence on his life. He actually set aside so many of his own political ambitions for the greater good (meaning the male Kennedys). It is sad that today so few people even know all his good work or even who he was.."},{"Title":"Sarge: The Life and Times of Sargent Shriver","review":"When I first heard about this book, my reaction was, &quot;Why do we need a 700-page book about this guy?&quot; But after I read some of the reviews of it (which made it sound interesting), I took the plunge. Now I understand why we needed a big biography of this guy--and I'm amazed that there hasn't been one before. This is not the genre of book one associates with &quot;page turners&quot; but I devoured this book over one long weekend. I read lots of literary biographies but not many political biographies, because they're usually stutifyingly dull. Not this one: it's right up there with the top two or three biographies I've ever read."},{"Title":"Sarge: The Life and Times of Sargent Shriver","review":"What a delight it is to be reminded of a highly talented,moral, joy-filled public servant who accomplished so much.He was put in both difficult and privileged circumstancesby his Kennedy relationships (a tough, arrogant bunch),buthis own good will and good intentions triumphed. A greatread!"},{"Title":"Sarge: The Life and Times of Sargent Shriver","review":"This book tells the story of Sargent Shriver a genuine giant of American politics and history. He did so much more than establish the Peace Corps but that legacy alone qualifies him as a great American and champion of our principles."},{"Title":"Sarge: The Life and Times of Sargent Shriver","review":"Reading this biography brought back my memories and the enthusiasm of that period to change things for the better. It was an inspiring period for those of us concerned with improving opportunities of everyone in this country. Those who returned from the Peace Corps were students in my classes--highly motivated, eager to participate in community development, and aspiring to public service. Sargent Shriver was a remarkable and talented person who provided a great service to this country and served as a source of inspiration to those of my generation. Reading this biography was a trip down memory lane."},{"Title":"Sarge: The Life and Times of Sargent Shriver","review":"I truly admire this man, who put his faith not in politics, but in being humane and doing the next right thing."},{"Title":"Sarge: The Life and Times of Sargent Shriver","review":"Wonderful book about an extraordinary man. It's especially timely reading, in our current political climate, to see the grace, vision & diplomacy that marked Sarge's life."},{"Title":"Sarge: The Life and Times of Sargent Shriver","review":"i found this book to be both interesting and well written. i would recommend it to others interested in this time in us history."},{"Title":"Sarge: The Life and Times of Sargent Shriver","review":"Extremely fast, efficient service. The book itself was in perfect condition. Wish every buy was this flawless."},{"Title":"Sarge: The Life and Times of Sargent Shriver","review":"I wish that there more of a discussion of the importance of Executive Order 11063. Also, did Shriver have the opportunity to visit some of Peace Corps Volunteers in Iran's shahrestan?, viz., in Aliabad, Bidokht or Birjand?"},{"Title":"Sarge: The Life and Times of Sargent Shriver","review":"I found this book to be a fascinating way to look at 20th century American history through the prism of a very inspiring man's life. It was also pretty interesting to get the inside scoop on some of the personalities and behind-the-scenes maneuverings that shaped major events in our nation's history. What was maybe most interesting to me, though, was the thoughtful way the book explored what it was like for Shriver being sort-of-but-not-quite a Kennedy. Both the book and Shriver himself are inspiring. It seems like they don't make people like him anymore!"},{"Title":"Sarge: The Life and Times of Sargent Shriver","review":"This is one of the best biographies I have ever read. I was fascinated by Sarge's life and he is the coolest Kennedy. Stossel is a great writer and he is able to make political writing fun. I recommend this book to anyone interested in politics, the Kennedies, or biographies.A really good book."},{"Title":"Sarge: The Life and Times of Sargent Shriver","review":"Sargent Shriver may have first entered public eye as the brother-in-law of John F. Kennedy and he may and leave it as father-in-law of Arnold Schwarzenegger. But in reality Shriver, in is own right, is an overlooked superstar. He embodies the energy and vision of the New Frontier and the Great Society and his legacies are the most successful programs of each: Peace Corps, Head Start, Legal Services and, while not a government program, the Special Olympics.Scott Stossel's rich biography deserves five stars on two accounts. It is an accurate, compelling story of a great man and humanitarian. In addition it is remarkably well written and cohesive book. As I read it, I kept thinking this is Pulitzer Prize quality writing"},{"Title":"Sarge: The Life and Times of Sargent Shriver","review":"When I was a Peace Corps volunteer in Nepal in the 1960s, Sarge Shriver was one of my heroes. This eloquent book makes him even more of a hero, a passionate idealistic citizen who has made a difference in so many arenas in American life. In a time when Americans view their leaders with such mistrust, this is an esssential book and a guide to how a good man can change the world without losing his goodness."},{"Title":"Sarge: The Life and Times of Sargent Shriver","review":"Read this book not only for its historical value. Read it also for a contrast to the current Bush administration and the kinds of leaders currently recruited to public service. Bush seems to punish diversity of opinion within his circle, and he promotes less competent folks while rooting out those who get \\"off message.\\" When a problem comes up, Bush instantly wants to zero in on one single solution.In contrast, Sargent Shriver, as this biography shows, was someone who gathered the best minds about him. They would openly and heatedly debate each other about not only the problem, but also about various solutions (rather than one alone). What kept them from all hating each other? For one thing, they knew that Sargent Shriver valued each of their varied contributions; for another, they also knew that they were serving the greater good, not just their boss, Shriver, or the president (JFK or LBJ).This book will impress you with how much good was accomplished by one man. But it will also impress upon you the fact that the good things Sarge accomplished were the product of a man who had a largeness of mind, an openness to different ideas, an intellectual curiosity that always sought out the wisdom of others."},{"Title":"Sarge: The Life and Times of Sargent Shriver","review":"loved learning about this amazing man. wow, who knew he did all these things. too bad he did not get a press agent earlier in his life! and great that he finally got one. a real inspiration to me."},{"Title":"Sarge: The Life and Times of Sargent Shriver","review":"This book appeals to such a wide spectrum of people. If you grew up in the 60's and watched the mystique of &quot;Camelot&quot; unfold this book will reveal many of the behind the scenes events that took place. If you were a Peace Corps Volunteer, this story will show you where it all began. If you are an interested student of Modern History this is a detailed view of the times. If you are a patriot looking for an inspirational tale that will inspire you this is your text! Sarge Shriver's life and times is a wonderfully written, interesting account of a man who gave of himself and set aside many personal goals for the greater goals of a bigger picture. His passion, love of life, romantic zeal, and love for his country are qualities we need so depserately today. This is one excellent biography."},{"Title":"Sarge: The Life and Times of Sargent Shriver","review":"Don't miss this beautifully crafted biography of a man everyone has heard of but few know that much about, other than his connection to the Kennedys and now Calif. Gov. Arnold Schwarzeneger, his son-in-law.Shriver's story is fascinating on its own. His championing of the Peace Corps, Johnson's War on Poverty, and the Special Olympics is amazing and remarkable. What a difference he made in the world, and how much more he might have been able to do had he only had his family's support for the presidency.Scott Stossel is a biographer to watch. His easy-flowing style, coupled with his strong sense of history and way with words, make this a biography not to miss -- even if you're a conservative, anti-political, rabble-rousing atheist. You won't be able to put it down."},{"Title":"Sarge: The Life and Times of Sargent Shriver","review":"To be called a &quot;liberal&quot; is often considered a bad word. We hunt for terms like &quot;progressive&quot; or anything that will not associate us with the &quot;free-spending&quot; myth of the Democratic politician. But if to be liberal, means to care for the poor, the disabled, the diverse in color and opportunity, then we will all find ourselves walking in the footprints of Sargent Shriver. Scott Stossel has caught the essence of a man who is guided by compassion and justice. What a legacy for us and his children! What an example. &quot;Sarge&quot; is a must read for every historian and every social justice activist in the world."},{"Title":"Sarge: The Life and Times of Sargent Shriver","review":"Sarge is without a doubt a long overdue and first-rate biography of a great American. Most seem to have forgotten what an inspiring man Sargent Shriver has been. The way in which Stossel records the war on poverty is second only to the many facits of the Shriver-Kennedy connection. Don't be turned off by the length. Historians must read this; book lovers will enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Last Marlin: The Story of a Father and Son","review":"This book is beautiful. It transports you back to the 50's and the island of Bimini in days gone by when life was simpler, then sadly reveals how the island slowly becomes corrupted with drug trafficking etc. All the while the author is focused on catching that \\"Last big one\\". The author is writing from his own experiences and boy does he have some great experiences to share! I find myself wishing I could be him, on a boat sailing around the Gulf Stream searching for Tuna and Marlin and pulling in hundreds of pounds of fish a day. I only wish the book would have been longer and gone into more depth. Either way it's a great book you won't regret buying and you won't soon forget. I think it's one of those books that will be enjoyable to immerse yourself in for a few days every winter and belongs in any collection of fishing or even ocean and beach lovers library."},{"Title":"The Last Marlin: The Story of a Father and Son","review":"As an ardent sport fisherman, I did not expect to find the great read that I did when I picked up &quot;The Last Marlin&quot; in the sportfishing section of our local library. A great autobiography of Waitzkin's growing up within a rather dysfunctional family, with a sportsman's love of his favorite sport (biggame fishing) told first hand from years spent growing up in Bimini on his father's and then later his own boat. Easy read, reads like a novel. I highly recommend for both the fisherman and non-fisherman."},{"Title":"The Well-Appointed Bath: Authentic Plans and Fixtures from the 1900's (Landmark Reprint Series)","review":"If you are remodeling or designing a period or period-inspired bathroom from the 1900s or 1930s, this book is a must-have. It features 2 catalogs, a 1914 Mott's Plumbing & a 1935 Standard, reprinted in full plus an informative commentary from the author on the evolution of indoor plumbing & the modern bathroom. One thing I found interesting is the fact that the Mott's catalog shows several rooms obviously affordable by only those with a lot of money, such as massive, highly decorative rooms with multiple fixtures & showers with full body sprays-in 1914! By the mid-1930s bathrooms had become available to \\"the masses\\" not just the rich so the catalog features more options for homes with limited space, i.e. the neo-angle tub allowing for inexpensive remodeling. The Standard catalog shows glossy, streamlined Deco fixtures in a rainbow of colors like \\"Ming Green\\" & \\"Clair de Lune Blue.\\" Both catalogs are highly representative of their eras. This is a well-chosen compilation of primary resources, invaluable to anyone attempting a period remodel or just interested in period interiors."},{"Title":"The Well-Appointed Bath: Authentic Plans and Fixtures from the 1900's (Landmark Reprint Series)","review":"This book from Goodwill located in Florida was described as in good condition.

Dr. Mylonas' personal research project was Eleuis and the Mysteries. A professional archeologist, the best in the world for his time, he had a life long focus and interest in the Eleusian Mysteries.

The illustrations are absolutely beautiful."},{"Title":"Quotable General (Potent Quotables)","review":"Those who have read John Feinstein's A Season on the Brink and/or Knight's recently published memoir (Knight: My Story) will probably enjoy reading this book as much as I did. Long ago, I concluded that most human wounds are self-inflicted. That has certainly been true of me and I think it is also true of Knight. He offers a highly visible example of someone who is \\"his own worst enemy.\\" Ironically, Knight has much of value to share but, for whatever reasons, he alienates those who would otherwise respect, perhaps even admire his ideas such as limiting Division One universities to only one scholarship in each major sport (e.g. football and basketball) for every \\"scholar/athlete\\" who earns a degree. For example, the number of scholarships Knight could award for the 2002-2003 basketball season would be determined by the number of Texas Tech basketball players who earned a degree during the 12 months prior to that season. (I really like that idea.) Knight has so much as said that Feinstein was a bleeping \\"traitor\\" because he quotes Knight constantly using profanity. There is none in this book. Rather, through 250-300 quotations, Carpenter and Towle trace Knight's career (and the evolution of his thinking) back to when he first became a head coach at the United States Military Academy. Those who are Knight advocates will find an abundance of material to support their high opinion of him. Those who view him with contempt must seek elsewhere for additional \\"evidence\\" of his misbehavior."},{"Title":"Quotable General (Potent Quotables)","review":"Most people think of Knight as this profane hothead with little good to say about anything. This book shows sides of Knight not often seen, starting with a great sense of humor and an ability to explain basketball's nuances in easy to understand language. And there's no profanity in the book, I'm glad to say. There's something like 250 quotes in this book going back to his days at West Point, including some quotes from well-known people talking about Knight. Even if you hate Knight, you will get a kick out of this book."},{"Title":"Quotable General (Potent Quotables)","review":"I've always been fascinated by Bobby Knight. I always figured that anybody who could lose his temper so violently, make outlandish statements, become involved in numerous controversies, and yet still coach college basketball must have some inspiring things to say.And I was right. Carpenter's book is a short collection of Knight's great quotes on various subjects such as leadership, success, basketball, himself, and his times at Indiana and Army. The Appendix contains his statement regarding the 1979 \\"Puerto Rico Incident,\\" which I found to be superfluous.Some reviewers seem surprised that the book is free from profanity and contains a very positive message. This quote is well known, but I still like it: \\"The will to prepare to win is more important than the will to win.\\"Not all of the messages are as inspiring, of course. Some quotes are purely included for humor, while others simply provide the reader with insight into Knight's character. Many quotes are not even from Knight himself, but from others in reference to him.This book is a very fast read -- athletes and other readers may find it especially interesting.One thing fans will notice is the book is somewhat out of date --there is no mention of Knight's Texas Tech years.Knight's fans and supporters will like this book, and it would make a great small gift/stocking stuffer for that purpose."},{"Title":"Quotable General (Potent Quotables)","review":"This is an amazing book! You can see the teaching genius of who was perhaps the greatest coach ever (and best University Professor ever!): Bobby Knight. You can learn from what he says, and from what others say about him. Those who can understand and those who can see beyond the disfiguration that liberal and politically correct media have created will truly understand the work of a genius. A man full of passion, charisma and leadership, determined to build strong, healthy, successful men out of kids. Here you can see, not only his amazing graduation success, the love his former players have for him, but also the passion and \\"tough love\\" that only a gifted genius like the General can give to his adopted children. This book is a legacy for one of America Greatest ever. While many in the new liberal and politically correct \\"Hanna Montana\\" generation will never understand Coach Knight, his quotes, his legacy is that of a passionate man who with superb leadership accomplished the impossible. Way far more than a basketball coach, Coach Knight was a Life Teacher who only used Basketball as metaphor for life. The success of his former students (and their loyalty), his graduation rate, his legacy will always be there to demonstrate what passion, hard work, true motivation and \\"hard love\\" can do: the impossible."},{"Title":"Quotable General (Potent Quotables)","review":"I found this book quite funny in the relation that Knight gives all his thoughts on various subjects as in Religion, to how he fells about other people he has met. A little disappointing though when I didn't think it was his best work I do believe Knight Fall was better"},{"Title":"Cryptozoology","review":"I had high hopes for this book, but was a little disappointed. I bought conspiracy x, expecting great stuff, and it met with my expectations. Cryptozoolgy didn't. First, it's set up with information divided into two parts: the gamers information, and the GM's information. the result is that you have to look in two different areas for information on different &quot;supernatural creatures&quot;. Most of the regular freaks of nature are covered--Loch Ness monster, Bigfoot, Sasquatch, etc. I was pleased to see a few others like the Mokole. The writing is a lot more pendantic than I'd like--but that may be a direct result from being written in character, where teh character is old, stuffy, and bombastically long-winded. If your game will run into a supernatural creature, it might be worth checking this beek out. If not, I wouldn't bother."},{"Title":"Applied Statistics and the Sas Programming Language","review":"In short, this is THE book to have if you are a regular person who needs to use SAS. While most SAS applications are a nightmare for all but the full-time statistician/SAS user, this well-written book makes things seem pretty easy. It includes some useful background material on statistical procedures as well as references for the more inquiring mind. This is an essential companion for SAS in the real-world. SAS would do well to take on some of the suggestions in this book."},{"Title":"Applied Statistics and the Sas Programming Language","review":"Anyone who must use SAS for statistical analysis should use this book in their learning process. Yes, there is \\"The Little SAS Book\\" and its variatons, but Cody and Smith have written the best text for quickly learning how to use SAS for statistical analysis. Sometimes, academic authors write for their associates rather than students. These authors have one goal: to help anyone, at any level, learn how to apply SAS for their statistical analyses. Their writing is clear, and anyone with an 8th grade education can use their text. I've used R, Stata, SPSS, and Matlab for statistical analysis. This text is among the best statistical references and learning tools for anyone who must quickly learn SAS."},{"Title":"Applied Statistics and the Sas Programming Language","review":"One of the most heavily used reference books in my office...this is very well written for a programming book. The authors use case examples for illustrating the different programming techniques, which makes it very easily understood by the layman. If you have a basic understanding of statistical techniques such as ANOVAs and t-tests this book will allow you to use SAS fairly easily."},{"Title":"Applied Statistics and the Sas Programming Language","review":"Theres just too much unecessary material in this book about ways to read in data etc. Its all unecessary cos like myself most professional analysts and statisticians have access to SAS enterprise guide, which is incredibly powerful and so much less time consuming. The programming language is only useful for algorithms these days, as most professionals havent got the time to be debugging code all day. The text covers nothing about cluster analysis either which is central to a lot of multi variate analysis.The mathematics and statistical detail is of far more interest and importance to us in the working environment than reading in of files."},{"Title":"Applied Statistics and the Sas Programming Language","review":"The book can be helpful to college students, but is of little benefit to more seasoned statisticians. The title notwithstanding, most of its chapters deal with general-purpose SAS programming; the rest (totaling 100-150 pages) offer a very basic review of REG, TTEST, LOGISTIC and FACTOR procedures, something that you can easily find online. (Check out the SAS tutorials offered by UCLA). I like and recommend Ron Cody's other books, but not this ridiculously overpriced (by 100%, I'd say) softcover."},{"Title":"Applied Statistics and the Sas Programming Language","review":"I have a PhD in Marketing and MSEE, and because of this, a good, basic knowledge of statistics. Nevertheless, when i started working in quantitative marketing research, i was often posed with practical problems where i didn't have an immediate answer. THis book was often a lifesaver for me. When i ran into a practical problem analyzing data, i could look something up at the right page, and it would give me the basic intuition and workable prescriptions for a wide range of non-trivial, intermediate problems. My impression is that the people giving this book low ratings are looking for statistical theory, which of course this book isn't about. That's like blaming a pick-up truck for not being as sexy as a roadster. If you live in the real world however and don't have days to figure out the theoretical fine points and accompanying SAS codes, but still want to do solid work and get the basic intuition of what you're doing, this book is worth its weight in gold. I used this in market research, but I'm sure this would be valuable in all social sciences, and probably also in other applied fields such as medical statistics, biology, etc."},{"Title":"Applied Statistics and the Sas Programming Language","review":"I am disappointed after reading this book. The coverage on statistics is overly superficial. I would be quite hesitating to call it a book on \\"applied statistics\\". It's probably better called \\"Basic Data Analysis Using SAS\\".It's a book for users with no experience of either statistics or SAS. It's clearly written. However, the style is old fashioned (the same is for SAS). In recent years, SAS has shifted its focus on so called \\"enterprise solutions\\"; therefore the development on data management, statistics, and econometrics has lagged behind, compared to SPlus/R and other more specialized programs.Similar to most other SAS books, the authors spent a lot of time talking about SAS programming rather than the subject matters (mostly because SAS syntax is very old and different from most other programming languages). The author also spent a lot of efforts talking about data input assuming users are still living in a stone age and have to deal with punched cards instead of delimited data."},{"Title":"Applied Statistics and the Sas Programming Language","review":"My prof uses this book as a required text. I am not familiar with SAS but after reading a couple of chapter, this book is really easy to understand. The authors also make it fun to read! Definitely recommend this book, even for the first SAS user."},{"Title":"Applied Statistics and the Sas Programming Language","review":"I thought that this was a fabulous book. I used it for work and needed a copy of my own when I left. It was great to learn the language but even better as a reference book while using SAS daily. I can't live without it!"},{"Title":"Applied Statistics and the Sas Programming Language","review":"I am at a loss to see what people like about this book. The authors were extremely wordy in my opinion and took much too long to make a point. This book is extremely basic, so if you know anything about statistics, I feel you may be happier with something more advanced."},{"Title":"Applied Statistics and the Sas Programming Language","review":"I just bought this book and after looking it over a bit I see it doesn't include PROC MIXED and barely mentions PROC GLM. They do repeated measures analysis with PROC ANOVA, which is a sad old choice. They use PROC ANOVA for analysis of variance, when PROC GLM became the replacement for that many years ago. It seems though to be useful to have on the shelf since I am pretty new to SAS programming and don't like most of the resources available. At least they put together a presentation of what sort of data you are analyzing with SAS program language which will be helpful though not entirely current. It's a resource. It would be nice if someone REALLY updated this text in light of the new SAS procedures."},{"Title":"Applied Statistics and the Sas Programming Language","review":"Two years ago, I did not know anything about SAS and was intimidated by the SAS Users' Guide. This book beat several others and became my key reference book. The book is simple, elegant and entertaining. I have recommended it to several of my colleagues."},{"Title":"Applied Statistics and the Sas Programming Language","review":"A very good intro-level SAS book for SAS freshmen. It helps you to do SAS quickies without learning the language in detail. But wherever it touches the language itself, it provides excellent teaching in easy-to-understand English. It's the best book for non-programmers to start using SAS for their everyday statistic and database tasks. The final part of the book contains some (but very limited) tricks for professional SAS programmers. More advanced contents will earn one more star - wait for the next version."},{"Title":"Applied Statistics and the Sas Programming Language","review":"This book provides an excellent introduction to SAS. It melds both the techniques of using the program with the application of it to statistical analysis. As an experienced researcher who has never used SAS, the examples and procedures were clearly described and logically presented. I believe this would be an excellent adjunct to any statistics course. The authors write well and add a touch of humor which departs from the usual arrogance of expertise found in many of the SAS publications that I have seen. I recommend it."},{"Title":"Applied Statistics and the Sas Programming Language","review":"Really good for a start for SAS. You can always turn to it when there is something you do not understand.

The organization was abysmal, and I decided to sell it back to the college bookstore for use by future hapless students, because it is not good as a reference guide.I did not like how the author seemed to gear the book to an audience that is terrified of their computers or anything dealing with *gasp* math."},{"Title":"Applied Statistics and the Sas Programming Language","review":"I've been doing data analysis for almost 20 years and recommend this highly. It is not too advanced for the beginning college student or professional, but more weighty than the small Introduction to SAS books (which seem more suitable for those with no experience). Because it interweaves SAS programming with often used statistics (and offers excellent examples and interpretations of output throughout), it is ideal for a stats and/or SAS course.I find it useful for reviewing SAS steps, and as a quick stats overview. The big SAS books are fine as a reference or for researching more complex and/or narrower questions, but this is far more user-friendly. Highly recommended for the beginning to moderate statistician or programmer."},{"Title":"Applied Statistics and the Sas Programming Language","review":"I just completed a SAS course that used this book. I never used SAS before and found the book to be very useful and informative. The authors show you how to use the built in SAS procedures and provide basic guidance on how to interpret the results. It has a numerous examples which really helped me learn the basics about running t-tests, ANOVA, and regression. Notes: (a) The book does not cover every option available with the SAS procedures - this is actually good in an introductory book because it keeps the reader from getting confused. Don't buy the book expecting a technical programming manual. (b) The book does not cover macro programming (c) the book does not cover the more professional looking graphics procedures e.g. gplot"},{"Title":"Applied Statistics and the Sas Programming Language","review":"SAS is a data management and statistical analysis tool that is extremely popular in industry especially in medical device and pharmaceutical companies. SAS manuals are very good at providing users who have some statistical knowledge with guidance toward the use of various porcedures.

A trend is developing to introduce basic and advanced statistical methods illustrated through the use of statistical software (particularly SAS). This book does a great job of presenting many applied problems and demonstrating the implementation of the analysis in SAS."},{"Title":"Applied Statistics and the Sas Programming Language","review":"This is an ideal book for a certain audience, and a good book for many audiences The ideal audience is college-level students or B.A. level professionals who know a little SAS and know a little statistics, and need to know how to combine them.

I'd definitely recommend it to any student or professional."},{"Title":"Applied Statistics and the Sas Programming Language","review":"Once upon a time, I could not recommend this book highly enough. That's the problem--\\"once upon a time\\". In 2004, this book violates what I consider an overriding consideration for instruction books: Never distract the new user with picky details that s/he'll will rarely need in practice.The first few chapters are written using INPUT and DATALINES; commands to enter data. For those unfamiliar with SAS, that means the authors enter all of their data as lines of text typed inside their command language. No one works that way any more! It's a hold over from the days of punchcards. Does the new user really need to know thatINPUT ID 1-3 AGE 4-5 GENDER $6;means \\"look in columns 1-3 for a numerical id, columns 4-5 for numerical age, and column 6 for a character designating gender\\"? When the 4-th edition was written, the answer might have been yes, but even then it would have been given grudgingly. For more than a few years, data almost always arrive as data sets that have already been made into SAS files or as spreadsheets that can be imported directly into SAS. This method of data input would not be a fatal flaw if the material were in a later chapter or an appendix, but it's woven throughout the text starting with the first example on page 3.I would love to see this book updated with a more modern view to how data are processed and analyzed, but I can no longer recommend it in its current form.Added in edit: Instead, get a copy of \\"The Little SAS Book: A Primer, Third Edition\\" by Lora D. Delwiche and Susan J. Slaughter. If I ever get around to reviewing it, I'll give it 4 or 5 stars. In the meantime, there are already a bunch of reviews you can read on the book's own Amazon web page, mostly good, a few bad, for an average of 4 stars."},{"Title":"Applied Statistics and the Sas Programming Language","review":"I bought this book a few years ago, and still find myself referencing it more than any other book on the subject. It is a great book for those who use SAS, but do not use it daily. Cody and Smith have converted a difficult and dry subject into something that is as enjoyable to read as can be done given the subject matter. The authors do a fine job of explaining each process, when to use it, and how to interpret the results. Their examples are easy to understand, and the tips they provide are helpful. For instance, when talking about correlation, some other books fail to mention common mistakes made when doing the analysis, such as correlation not implying causality: this book clearly injects this in the chapter and gives a straightforward example to reinforce the point made.It is an excellent reference manual and deserves a spot alongside your SAS manuals."},{"Title":"Applied Statistics and the Sas Programming Language","review":"[A review of the 5th EDITION 2005.]Cody and Smith refine their text on learning to program SAS. They assume you already know many statistical concepts, including skewness, kurtosis, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and Student's T distribution. It is not a book on statistics per se, but how you can use SAS to compute these quantities from your input data.There is no fancy GUI of graphs taught here. The style of the SAS outputs given in the book reflects in part a legacy of an earlier time when graphical options were very limited. But you need to realise that understanding how to program in SAS does not necessitate nifty graphics. In statistics, a lot of understanding still comes from looking at tabular results, and simple graphics like scatterplots. The book shows how to get such results displayed.From the programming standpoint, the SAS language is pretty straightforward. Like writing script files. The main point is that the hard conceptual stuff is outside the book's remit. Instead, the book shows how SAS programming lets you handily access the large set of routines SAS has built, to do the tedious or complicated number crunching. It's up to you to decide what routines to use, and to understand the significance of the results."},{"Title":"Applied Statistics and the Sas Programming Language","review":"This is a great book for people just starting to work with SAS or people who haven't done SAS in a while.

Johnston presents a grim historical novel that tells of the stand Maj. Forsyth and fifty army scouts made in 1868 against Chief Roman Nose and his warriors at what became known as The Fight at Beecher's Island. If one can take Johnston's assertion of historical accuracy in the introduction at face value, this is an effective way for entry-level armchair historians to learn more of Indian fights and fighters. All but a few of the characters are based on historical figures. The dialogue is no doubt subject to some artistic license, but the general details are accurate. Johnston does not list a bibliography that would document his reserach. The Cyrus Townsend Brady influence, however, is easily evident. All fine and well until we consider the re-occurring fictional character of the series, Seamus Donegan. Donegan detracts from the otherwise exciting novel by his unlikely ability to be a part of so many significant events of the Indian Wars. His pulp-fiction subplots and general outrageous behavior hamper a smooth narrative. The first part of this novel is action-packed and moves swiftly. The pace tends to drag in the second half, but it reflects the drudgery and suffering of those who survived the multi-day siege. The heroism of the typical army scout, the military integrity of the Buffalo soldiers, and the fierce Native American warriors are all given balanced space in Johnston's tale.

Noakes explores the whole development of this movement offering translations of original speeches, legal texts, military orders and contemporary diaries. Not being satisfied with just showing the pieces, Noakes offers us lots of explanations and analysis of wider social contexts in which the texts were written.Most people would probably only use this brick of a book as a reference to Nazist texts. To me the book was more than that: Noakes bridges the documents so well with his analysis that I found the book very enjoyable to read just as it is, page by page, from start to finish. Afterwards, I found that I had developed a much better view of the birth and death of German Nazism."},{"Title":"Documents on Nazism: 2","review":"There are many documents, representing many different subjects, in this volume. Owing to space limitations, this review discusses only a few of them.There is a section in the book that deals with the Nazis' electoral successes. Germany had been divided into 35 voting districts. In the Reichstag elections of July 31, 1932, the German popular vote in favor of the Nazi Party (the NSDAP) was higher in northern than in southern Germany (p. 115). Interestingly, four of the five highest voting districts in which the Nazis had gotten the highest percentage of the popular vote, were situated east of the eventual-postwar Oder-Neisse (Odra-Nyssa) Polish-German boundary (p. 116). All of this refutes the claims of Alfred Maurice de Zayas, who had contended that the German expellees were among the least likely to have supported the Nazis. The exact contrary is true.In his TABLE TALK, Hitler made numerous derogatory comments about Christianity. In this volume, in a June 1941 document, Martin Bormann spoke thus against Christianity: \\"The concepts of National Socialism and Christianity are irreconcilable. The Christian churches build on people's ignorance and attempt to preserve the ignorance of as wide a section of the population as possible. National Socialism, on the other hand, is based on scientific foundations...If we National Socialists speak of belief in God, we do not understand by God, as the nave Christians and their spiritual camp followers do, a human-type being sitting around somewhere in space...The natural force by which all these innumerable planets move in the universe we call \`the Almighty' or \`God'\\". (p. 373). It is obvious that the Nazis were atheists. They had rejected the existence of a transcendental, personal God, and had merely retained the word \\"God\\" as a term of reference to natural forces.Ulrich von Hassel, the German diplomat to Italy until 1937, is described as a conservative opponent of Nazism (p. 302). This helps refute the claim that Nazism was just extreme conservatism. In his diary, von Hassel acknowledges the fact that the German air war against Poland in 1939 had gone far beyond the hitting of military targets: \\"...the disgrace that has sullied the German name through the conduct of war in Poland, namely, the brutal use of air power and the shocking bestialities of the SS, especially towards the Jews. The cruelties of the Poles against the German minority are also a fact, but somehow psychologically excusable...Those who saw Warsaw, with its devastation and the many thousands of dead bodies around, came away appalled.\\" (p. 303). (And to think that, at this time, the western media was getting all excited about the few dozen Spanish civilians killed by the German bombing of Guernica and the several hundred Dutch civilians killed by the German bombing of Rotterdam!).In another document, Colonel-General Blazkowitz, himself accused of atrocities against Poles, complained against the same, and pointed to the indomitable spirit of the Poles: \\"It is misguided to slaughter tens of thousands of Poles and Jews as is happening at present...The acts of violence against the Jews which occur in full view of the public inspire among the religious Poles not only deep disgust but also great pity for the Jewish population, to which up to now the Poles were more or less hostile...There is no doubt that the defenseless Polish population, who have to look on at these crimes and are driven to despair by them, will give fanatical support to any revolt or movement of vengeance...The idea that one can intimidate the Polish population by terrorism and rub their noses in the dirt will certainly prove to be false. This people's capacity for enduring suffering is too great for that...\\" (pp. 611-613).Not only was Nazism a radically new anti-Semitic movement, it was also a radically new anti-Slavic one. In a speech given May 17, 1933, Hitler said: \\"We therefore have no use for the idea of Germanization. The mentality of the past century which made people believe that they could make Germans out of Poles or Frenchmen is completely foreign to us...\\" (pp. 509-510). (Later, some Poles were Germanized. But these \\"Poles\\" were actually prewar Polish citizens of German descent. They were, in effect, re-Germanized).It is interesting to note the parallels between Nazi racism against Jews and that against Slavs. The Nuremberg Laws forbade intercourse between German gentiles and Jews (p. 464). In like manner, a document speaks of Polish forced laborers being compelled, on threat of punishment by death, to avoid intercourse with Germans (p. 649). Later Nazi laws forbade Jews from socializing with German gentiles (p. 477, 484). In like manner, Polish forced laborers were forbidden to socialize with Germans (p. 649). Both Jews (p. 478) and Polish forced laborers (p. 649) were forced to wear identification badges in Germany (Since there were tens of millions of Poles in German-occupied Poland, it was, of course, impractical to make them also wear badges).Hitler spoke of cleansing the territories annexed to the Reich, treating Jews and Poles in the same vein: \\"The fact that we are governing the territory should enable us to purify the Reich territory of both Jews and Polacks.\\" (p. 611).The Nazis did not deem either Slavs or Jews to have any inherent rights. A discussion between Otto Thierack and Heinrich Himmler focused on the treatment of prisoners and their consignment to the dreaded SS: \\"It is agreed that, in view of the plans of the Government for settling the eastern problems, in future Jews, Poles, gypsies, Russians and Ukrainians are no longer to be judged by the ordinary courts, so far as punishable offenses are concerned, but are to be dealt with by the Reichsfuhrer SS.\\" (p. 295)."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Man","review":"Victoria (Torey) Storm, a fabulously wealthy, attractive, sincere, and kind young woman from the U.S. East Coast (is this possible, really?) is attracted to and helps her fourth cousin, Mitchell Storm, Chief of the Scottish Clan Storm, find a buried treasure that makes it possible for Mitchell to live on his island, take care of his 800 island clansmen, and offer Torey a life of beauty and charm. The dialogue is simple, witty, and honest. The plot blends modern and historical. The setting flits from East Coast mega-wealth to a quaint Scottish island. Although the &quot;struggle&quot; is not difficult and you never doubt the outcome, the dreamlike, wispy heroine and always correct, strong hero keep you reading just to enjoy the calm of these happy, confident people. You want this couple, and their friends, to be your friends."},{"Title":"No Ordinary Man","review":"Suzanne Simmons's &quot;NO ORDINARY MAN&quot; is a great book.

She is in her 60's, has had numerous facelifts, and portrays herself as having maintained her youthful looks from her nutrition regiments. She also never discusses her credentials and they are not mentioned anywhere in her book. However, she does come across as educated and is always mentioning research papers in her book - it would be nice to know if she has any education pertinent to the nutrition field or is she a self-taught/self-proclaimed expert.I considered this book to be very basic and very repetitive and the author to be highly deceptive."},{"Title":"All Your Health Questions Answered Naturally","review":"Book arrived on time and in good shape."},{"Title":"All Your Health Questions Answered Naturally","review":"MAUREEN SALANA CLAIMS MS CAN BE CURED BY B12 SHOTS.

I am 19 years old and plan to be a nutritionist and holistic doctor. This book is well researched but one thing is that it is repeated a lot, but that may be necessary to get the point across that some sort of product or food should be avoided pertaining to many different situations and conditions. For example - hydrogenated oils! Now that is something to avoid all together!! This book is definately beyond common knowledge of the public, but I believe that there could be more in there. And I am sure Mrs. Salaman knows even more about these types of things since she wrote the book in 1998. But I do know more personally about different things that she deoes have in here, but then again, I probably have a lot to learn! So it is a good book, but I do wish I could learn more about foods, so maybe foods that heal would have been a better choice for me personally out of her collection of books she wrote,"},{"Title":"All Your Health Questions Answered Naturally","review":"My very healthy husband recently picked up a &quot;wierd&quot; virus while on vacation.The Dr. gave him antibiotics which had no effect on the illness.

There was only a small amount of redness on his wrist.It just amazed both of us,because the ingredients are so simple and most people have them in their kitchen.The $....

Especially with the tea tree oil for head lice. We have helped many frustrated parents find a safe remedy! Just reading different sections has enhanced my knowledge base and I give the book a great rating. However, I only gave it four stars because it seems to have too much repetitive information at chapter ends. I challenge some of the information in regards to recent studies. For example, Vitamin &quot;C&quot; therapy is suggested again and again... but with out stating the consequences of large doses of &quot;C&quot; It can be be stressful to the body, like the stomach lining, and credible studies have shown small increments (and food driven), are just overall better.

Her book most certainly does not live up to her claim. Some of the information in her book is very good and not common knowledge. In each chapter, she mentions taking certain supplements. However, at the end of the chapter where there is a list of supplements to take, most of the time she doesn't include the ones that she wrote about -- leaving one to wonder about the dosage. In addition, the book repeats itself several times in different chapters. The book is not the answer to curing all diseases, as she claims, but rather an introduction to addressing many human ailments."}]`),H={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],L={key:0},R={key:1};function q(n,e,s,c,r,i){const m=y("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",B,[(t(!0),a(g,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),p(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",R,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",L,"See more"))],8,x)):b("",!0)])}const E=u(H,[["render",q],["__scopeId","data-v-fde42fe7"]]),P=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/25.md","filePath":"quotes/25.md"}'),W={name:"quotes/25.md"},j=Object.assign(W,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(E)]))}});export{P as __pageData,j as default};
